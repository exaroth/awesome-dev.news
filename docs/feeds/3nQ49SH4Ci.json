In 2014, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fathers-of-the-internet-revolution-urge-todays-pioneers-to-reinvent-the-web\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/12/online-magna-carta-berners-lee-web\">“Magna Carta for the Web”</a> to restore the balance of power between individuals and institutions. This mirrors the original charter’s purpose: ensuring that those who occupy a territory have a meaningful stake in its governance.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3\">Web 3.0</a>—the distributed, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/decentralized-web\">decentralized Web</a> of tomorrow—is finally poised to change the Internet’s dynamic by returning ownership to data creators. This will change many things about what’s often described as the “CIA triad” of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-security\">digital security</a>: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Of those three features, data integrity will become of paramount importance.</p><p>When we have agency in digital spaces, we naturally maintain their integrity—protecting them from deterioration and shaping them with intention. But in territories controlled by distant platforms, where we’re merely temporary visitors, that connection frays. A disconnect emerges between those who benefit from data and those who bear the consequences of compromised integrity. Like homeowners who care deeply about maintaining the property they own, users in the Web 3.0 paradigm will become stewards of their personal digital spaces.</p><p>This will be critical in a world where <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-agents\">AI agents</a> don’t just answer our questions but act on our behalf. These agents may execute financial transactions, coordinate complex workflows, and autonomously operate critical infrastructure, making decisions that ripple through entire industries. As digital agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the question is no longer whether we will trust AI but what that trust is built upon. In the new age we’re entering, the foundation isn’t intelligence or efficiency—it’s integrity.</p><p>In information systems, integrity is the guarantee that data will not be modified without authorization, and that all transformations are verifiable throughout the data’s life cycle. While availability ensures that systems are running and confidentiality prevents unauthorized access, integrity focuses on whether information is accurate, unaltered, and consistent across systems and over time.</p><p>It’s a new idea. The undo button, which prevents accidental data loss, is an integrity feature. So is the reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state. Checksums are an integrity feature; so are verifications of network transmission. Without integrity, security measures can backfire. Encrypting corrupted data just locks in errors. Systems that score high marks for availability but spread <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/misinformation\">misinformation</a> just become <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amplifiers\">amplifiers</a> of risk.</p><p>All <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/it-systems\">IT systems</a> require some form of data integrity, but the need for it is especially pronounced in two areas today. First: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things\">Internet of Things</a> devices interact directly with the physical world, so corrupted input or output can result in real-world harm. Second: AI systems are only as good as the integrity of the data they’re trained on, and the integrity of their decision-making processes. If that foundation is shaky, the results will be too.</p><p>Integrity manifests in four key areas. The first,  concerns the quality and authenticity of data entering a system. When this fails, consequences can be severe. In 2021, <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/\">Facebook’s global outage</a> was triggered by a single mistaken command—an input error missed by automated systems. Protecting input integrity requires robust <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/authentication\">authentication</a> of data sources, cryptographic signing of sensor data, and diversity in input channels for cross-validation.</p><p>The second issue is  which ensures that systems transform inputs into outputs correctly. In 2003, the <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Documents/August_2003_Blackout_Final_Report.pdf\">U.S.-Canada blackout</a> affected 55 million people when a control-room process failed to refresh properly, resulting in damages exceeding US $6 billion. Safeguarding processing integrity means formally verifying algorithms, cryptographically protecting models, and monitoring systems for anomalous behavior.</p><p> covers the correctness of information as it’s stored and communicated. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration was <a href=\"https://www.thestack.technology/faa-outage-cause-notam-database-file-not-cyber/\">forced to halt</a> all U.S. departing flights because of a corrupted database file. Addressing this risk requires cryptographic approaches that make any modification computationally infeasible without detection, distributed storage systems to prevent single points of failure, and rigorous backup procedures.</p><p>Finally,  addresses the appropriate flow of information according to the norms of its larger context. It’s not enough for data to be accurate; it must also be used in ways that respect expectations and boundaries. For example, if a smart speaker listens in on casual family conversations and uses the data to build advertising profiles, that action would violate the expected boundaries of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-collection\">data collection</a>. Preserving contextual integrity requires clear data-governance policies, principles that limit the use of data to its intended purposes, and mechanisms for enforcing information-flow constraints.</p><p>As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions with reduced human oversight, all these dimensions of integrity become critical.</p><h3>The Need for Integrity in Web 3.0</h3><p>As the digital landscape has shifted from Web 1.0 to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/web-2-0\">Web 2.0</a> and now evolves toward Web 3.0, we’ve seen each era bring a different emphasis in the <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad\">CIA triad</a> of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><p>Returning to our home metaphor: When simply having shelter is what matters most, availability takes priority—the house must exist and be functional. Once that foundation is secure, confidentiality becomes important—you need locks on your doors to keep others out. Only after these basics are established do you begin to consider integrity, to ensure that what’s inside the house remains trustworthy, unaltered, and consistent over time.</p><p>Web 1.0 of the 1990s prioritized making information available. Organizations digitized their content, putting it out there for anyone to access. In Web 2.0, the Web of today, platforms for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-commerce\">e-commerce</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/social-media\">social media</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cloud-computing\">cloud computing</a> prioritize confidentiality, as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/personal-data\">personal data</a> has become the Internet’s currency.</p><p>Somehow, integrity was largely lost along the way. In our current Web architecture, where control is centralized and removed from individual users, the concern for integrity has diminished. The massive social media platforms have created environments where no one feels responsible for the truthfulness or quality of what circulates.</p><p>Web 3.0 is poised to change this dynamic by returning ownership to the data owners. This is not speculative; it’s already emerging. For example, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol behind decentralized <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/social-networks\">social networks</a> like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\">Mastodon</a>, combines content sharing with built-in attribution. Tim Berners-Lee’s <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\">Solid protocol</a> restructures the Web around personal data pods with granular access controls.</p><p>These technologies prioritize integrity through cryptographic verification that proves authorship, decentralized architectures that eliminate vulnerable central authorities, machine-readable semantics that make meaning explicit—structured data formats that allow computers to understand participants and actions, such as “Alice performed <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/surgery\">surgery</a> on Bob”—and transparent governance where rules are visible to all. As AI systems become more autonomous, communicating directly with one another via standardized protocols, these integrity controls will be essential for maintaining trust.</p><h3>Why Data Integrity Matters in AI</h3><p>For AI systems, integrity is crucial in four domains. The first is decision quality. With AI increasingly contributing to decision-making in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/health-care\">health care</a>, justice, and finance, the integrity of both data and models’ actions directly impact human welfare. Accountability is the second domain. Understanding the causes of failures requires reliable logging, audit trails, and system records.</p><p>The third domain is the security relationships between components. Many authentication systems rely on the integrity of identity information and cryptographic keys. If these elements are compromised, malicious agents could impersonate trusted systems, potentially creating cascading failures as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\">AI agents</a> interact and make decisions based on corrupted credentials.</p><p>Finally, integrity matters in our public definitions of safety. Governments worldwide are introducing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\">rules for AI</a> that focus on data accuracy, transparent algorithms, and verifiable claims about system behavior. Integrity provides the basis for meeting these legal obligations.</p><p>The importance of integrity only grows as AI systems are entrusted with more critical applications and operate with less human oversight. While people can sometimes detect integrity lapses, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-systems\">autonomous systems</a> may not only miss warning signs—they may exponentially increase the severity of breaches. Without assurances of integrity, organizations will not trust AI systems for important tasks, and we won’t realize the full potential of AI.</p><h3>How to Build AI Systems With Integrity</h3><p>Imagine an AI system as a home we’re building together. The integrity of this home doesn’t rest on a single security feature but on the thoughtful integration of many elements: solid foundations, well-constructed walls, clear pathways between rooms, and shared agreements about how spaces will be used.</p><p>We begin by laying the cornerstone: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\">cryptographic verification</a>. Digital signatures ensure that data lineage is traceable, much like a title deed proves ownership. Decentralized identifiers act as digital <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/passports\">passports</a>, allowing components to prove identity independently. When the front door of our AI home recognizes visitors through their own keys rather than through a vulnerable central doorman, we create resilience in the architecture of trust.</p><p>Formal verification methods enable us to mathematically prove the structural integrity of critical components, ensuring that systems can withstand pressures placed upon them—especially in high-stakes domains where lives may depend on an AI’s decision.</p><p>Just as a well-designed home creates separate spaces, trustworthy AI systems are built with thoughtful compartmentalization. We don’t rely on a single barrier but rather layer them to limit how problems in one area might affect others. Just as a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kitchen\">kitchen</a> fire is contained by fire doors and independent smoke alarms, training data is separated from the AI’s inferences and output to limit the impact of any single failure or breach.</p><p>Throughout this AI home, we build transparency into the design: The equivalent of large windows that allow light into every corner is clear pathways from input to output. We install monitoring systems that continuously check for weaknesses, alerting us before small issues become catastrophic failures.</p><p>But a home isn’t just a physical structure, it’s also the agreements we make about how to live within it. Our governance frameworks act as these shared understandings. Before welcoming new residents, we provide them with certification standards. Just as landlords conduct credit checks, we conduct integrity assessments to evaluate newcomers. And we strive to be good neighbors, aligning our community agreements with broader societal expectations. Perhaps most important, we recognize that our AI home will shelter diverse individuals with varying needs. Our governance structures must reflect this diversity, bringing many stakeholders to the table. A truly trustworthy system cannot be designed only for its builders but must serve anyone authorized to eventually call it home.</p><p>That’s how we’ll create AI systems worthy of trust: not by blindly believing in their perfection but because we’ve intentionally designed them with integrity controls at every level.</p><p>Unlike other properties of security, like “available” or “private,” we don’t have a common adjective form for “integrity.” This makes it hard to talk about it. It turns out that there is a word in English: “integrous.” The Oxford English Dictionary recorded the word used in the mid-1600s but now <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/integrous_adj?tab=factsheet&amp;tl=true#210671\">declares it obsolete</a>.</p><p>We believe that the word needs to be revived. We need the ability to describe a system with integrity. We must be able to talk about integrous systems design.</p><p>Ensuring integrity in AI presents formidable challenges. As models grow larger and more complex, maintaining integrity without sacrificing performance becomes difficult. Integrity controls often require computational resources that can slow systems down—particularly challenging for real-time applications. Another concern is that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/emerging-technologies\">emerging technologies</a> like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/quantum-computing\">quantum computing</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2668949802\">threaten current cryptographic protections</a>. Additionally, the distributed nature of modern AI—which relies on vast ecosystems of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/libraries\">libraries</a>, frameworks, and services—presents a large attack surface.</p><p>Beyond technology, integrity depends heavily on social factors. Companies often prioritize speed to market over robust integrity controls. Development teams may lack specialized knowledge for implementing these controls, and may find it particularly difficult to integrate them into legacy systems. And while some governments have begun establishing regulations for aspects of AI, we need worldwide alignment on governance for AI integrity.</p><p>Addressing these challenges requires sustained research into verifying and enforcing integrity, as well as recovering from breaches. Priority areas include <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fault-tolerant\">fault-tolerant</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/algorithms\">algorithms</a> for distributed learning, verifiable computation on encrypted data, techniques that maintain integrity despite <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/adversarial-attacks\">adversarial attacks</a>, and standardized metrics for certification. We also need interfaces that clearly communicate integrity status to human overseers.</p><p>As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the stakes for integrity have never been higher. We are entering an era where machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous agents will operate with reduced human oversight and make decisions with profound impacts.</p><p>The good news is that the tools for building systems with integrity already exist. What’s needed is a shift in mind-set: from treating integrity as an afterthought to accepting that it’s the core organizing principle of AI security.</p><p>The next era of technology will be defined not by what AI can do, but by whether we can trust it to know or especially to do what’s right. Integrity—in all its dimensions—will determine the answer.</p><h3>Sidebar: Examples of Integrity Failures</h3><p><em>Processing integrity failure</em>\nA 64-bit velocity calculation was converted to a 16-bit output, causing an error called overflow.

The likes of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/10/cisco_live_cloud_control_news/\">Cisco</a> have deployed AIops in a conversational interface that admins can use to prompt for information about system performance.

Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings.</p><p>In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent’s decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated—combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation—and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system.</p><p>To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.</p><p>Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</p></blockquote>","contentLength":2383,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Risky Business #803 -- Oracle's CSO Mary Ann Davidson quietly departs","url":"https://risky.biz/RB803/","date":1755664498,"author":"","guid":234371,"unread":true,"content":"<article></article>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media3.risky.biz/RB803.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Wednesday, August 20th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9578, (Wed, Aug 20th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32214","date":1755655202,"author":"","guid":233627,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Oregon Man Charged in ‘Rapper Bot’ DDoS Service","url":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/oregon-man-charged-in-rapper-bot-ddos-service/","date":1755636666,"author":"BrianKrebs","guid":233509,"unread":true,"content":"<p>A 22-year-old Oregon man has been arrested on suspicion of operating “,” a massive botnet used to power a service for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets — including a March 2025 DDoS that knocked Twitter/X offline.

The government says Rapper Bot consistently launched attacks that were “hundreds of times larger than the expected capacity of a typical server located in a data center,” and that some of its biggest attacks exceeded six terabits per second.</p><p>Indeed, Rapper Bot was <a href=\"https://cyberpress.org/rapperbot-exploits-dvrs-to-take-control-of-surveillance-cameras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly responsible</a> for the March 10, 2025 attack that caused intermittent outages on Twitter/X. The government says Rapper Bot’s most lucrative and frequent customers were involved in extorting online businesses — including numerous gambling operations based in China.</p><p>The criminal complaint was written by , an investigator with the <strong>Defense Criminal Investigative Service</strong> (DCIS), the criminal investigative division of the  (DoD) Office of Inspector General. The complaint notes the DCIS got involved because several Internet addresses maintained by the DoD were the target of Rapper Bot attacks.</p><p>Peterson said he tracked Rapper Bot to Foltz after a subpoena to an ISP in Arizona that was hosting one of the botnet’s control servers showed the account was paid for via . More legal process to PayPal revealed Foltz’s  account and previously used IP addresses. A subpoena to Google showed the defendant searched security blogs constantly for news about Rapper Bot, and for updates about competing DDoS-for-hire botnets.</p><p>According to the complaint, after having a search warrant served on his residence the defendant admitted to building and operating Rapper Bot, sharing the profits 50/50 with a person he claimed to know only by the hacker handle “.” Foltz also shared with investigators the logs from his Telegram chats, wherein Foltz and Slaykings discussed how best to stay off the radar of law enforcement investigators while their competitors were getting busted.</p><p>Specifically, the two hackers chatted about <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a May 20 attack against KrebsOnSecurity.com</a> that clocked in at more than 6.3 terabits of data per second. The brief attack was notable because at the time it was the largest DDoS that Google had ever mitigated (KrebsOnSecurity sits behind the protection of , a free DDoS defense service that&nbsp; provides to websites offering news, human rights, and election-related content).</p><p>The May 2025 DDoS was launched by an IoT botnet called , which I discovered was operated by a 21-year-old man in Brazil named . This individual was more commonly known online as “,” and Forky told me he wasn’t afraid of me or U.S. federal investigators. Nevertheless, the complaint against Foltz notes that Forky’s botnet seemed to diminish in size and firepower at the same time that Rapper Bot’s infection numbers were on the upswing.</p><p>“Both FOLTZ and Slaykings were very dismissive of attention seeking activities, the most extreme of which, in their view, was to launch DDoS attacks against the website of the prominent cyber security journalist Brian Krebs,” Peterson wrote in the criminal complaint.</p><p>“You see, they’ll get themselves [expletive],” Slaykings wrote in response to Foltz’s comments about Forky and Aisuru bringing too much heat on themselves.</p><p>“Prob cuz [redacted] hit krebs,” Foltz wrote in reply.</p><p>“Going against Krebs isn’t a good move,” Slaykings concurred. “It isn’t about being a [expletive] or afraid, you just get a lot of problems for zero money. Childish, but good. Let them die.”</p><p>“Ye, it’s good tho, they will die,” Foltz replied.</p><p>The government states that just prior to Foltz’s arrest, Rapper Bot had enslaved an estimated 65,000 devices globally. That may sound like a lot, but the complaint notes the defendants weren’t interested in making headlines for building the world’s largest or most powerful botnet.</p><p>Quite the contrary: The complaint asserts that the accused took care to maintain their botnet in a “Goldilocks” size — ensuring that “the number of devices afforded powerful attacks while still being manageable to control and, in the hopes of Foltz and his partners, small enough to not be detected.”</p><p>The complaint states that several days later, Foltz and Slaykings returned to discussing what that they expected to befall their rival group, with Slaykings stating, “Krebs is very revenge. He won’t stop until they are [expletive] to the bone.”</p><p>“Surprised they have any bots left,” Foltz answered.</p><p>“Krebs is not the one you want to have on your back. Not because he is scary or something, just because he will not give up UNTIL you are [expletive] [expletive]. Proved it with Mirai and many other cases.”</p><p>[Unknown expletives aside, that may well be the highest compliment I’ve ever been paid by a cybercriminal. I might even have part of that quote made into a t-shirt or mug or something. It’s also nice that they didn’t let any of their customers attack my site — if even only out of a paranoid sense of self-preservation.]</p><p>Foltz admitted to wiping the user and attack logs for the botnet approximately once a week, so investigators were unable to tally the total number of attacks, customers and targets of this vast crime machine. But the data that was still available showed that from April 2025 to early August, Rapper Bot conducted over 370,000 attacks, targeting 18,000 unique victims across 1,000 networks, with the bulk of victims residing in China, Japan, the United States, Ireland and Hong Kong (in that order).</p><p>The complaint says Foltz and his partner did not allow most customers to launch attacks that were more than 60 seconds in duration — another way they tried to keep public attention to the botnet at a minimum. However, the government says the proprietors also had special arrangements with certain high-paying clients that allowed much larger and longer attacks.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71951\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rapperbot-mad.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rapperbot-mad.png 1046w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rapperbot-mad-768x625.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rapperbot-mad-782x636.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"><p>The accused and his alleged partner made light of this blog post about the fallout from one of their botnet attacks.</p></div><p>Most people who have never been on the receiving end of a monster DDoS attack have no idea of the cost and disruption that such sieges can bring.

If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, although a federal judge is unlikely to award anywhere near that kind of sentence for a first-time conviction.</p>","contentLength":9631,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Increased Elasticsearch Recognizance Scans, (Tue, Aug 19th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32212","date":1755627389,"author":"","guid":233487,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I noticed an increase in scans that appear to try to identify Elasticsearch instances.

(those same \"performance reasons\" that we fought against for years when implementing SSL/TLS).</p><p>What is the real attack vector here?&nbsp; There are a couple:</p><ul><li>Ask Uber about MFA-bombing.&nbsp; If you target someone junior enough - or senior enough, and send them 2-30-40 MFA requests, chances are that eventually they'll press \"OK\" to make the flood stop.&nbsp; Or if the attacker can gain additional info on the target person (like say from LinkedIn), they can contact them via email or SMS, masquerade as an IT support person and instruct them to press \"OK\".&nbsp; An MFA attack of this type against an Uber driver in 2022 ended up in a successful (but very brief) compromise.&nbsp;</li><li>Of course, if the compromise got around MFA protections (using either MFA bombing or some direct attack that bypasses authentication), the attacker is still free to pillage that site.&nbsp; If they can pivot from that site, it's very likely that they'll find themselves on the inside network, where you can likely collect admin level creds from all sorts of places and own the whole shop.</li><li>Even if the attacker can't find a decent pivot, now they've got working credentials, which they can leverage against anything else that you have that's internet facing - both those using MFA or not.&nbsp; If they are persistent (that's the \"P\" in APT), eventually they'll find one that they can MFA Bomb, RCE or otherwise compromise, then pivot inbound from, which of course leads them to great destruction and victory, with tears from the target company to speed them on their way!</li></ul><p>Many of you are likely admins for organizations though, so the single-person view isn't so useful.&nbsp; As an administrator, can you see this same history information for your supported users?&nbsp; Sort of, just without the actual maps (which aren't so useful anyway).&nbsp; In https:portal.azure.com, navigate to identiy Protection / Dashboard / risk Detections.&nbsp; Choose \"View Attacks\", then from there you can pick an individual user and list all of their logins.&nbsp;</p><p>While I couldn't find an easy way to navigate to list all users (please use our comment field if you have that?), if you look in the URL, the report for a single user has a URL formatted as:\nhttps://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/SignInLogsList.ReactView/userObjectId/&lt;User-GUID-goes -in-HEX-here&gt;/timeRangeType/last1month</p><p>If you remove the \"UserObjedId/&lt;GUID&gt; sections of the URL, this now lists all users in the organization.&nbsp; From there you can filter the display as needed or simply export it an dice it up with Excel or whatever.</p><p>If you've got a way to get to this info directly, or better yet if you have a link to the API (which would allow you to pull this into your SIEM) or Powershell script that can collect this, by all means share in our comment form!</p><p>===============\nRob VandenBrink</p>\n\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.","contentLength":5176,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Cisco and KDDI Partner to Deliver Japan’s First Fully Managed SASE Solution","url":"https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-kddi-deliver-partner-to-deliver-japans-first-fully-managed-sase-solution/","date":1755518425,"author":"Raj Chopra","guid":231551,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Explore how service providers are enabling faster, scalable SASE adoption with cloud-native security and networking solutions.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Eavesdropping on Phone Conversations Through Vibrations","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/08/eavesdropping-on-phone-conversations-through-vibrations.html","date":1755514975,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":231531,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Researchers have managed to <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3734477.3734708\">eavesdrop</a><a href=\"https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/conversations-remotely-detected-cellphone-vibrations-researchers-report\">on</a> cell phone voice conversations by using radar to detect vibrations.
