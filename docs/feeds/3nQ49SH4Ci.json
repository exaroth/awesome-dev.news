The vulnerability could be exploited merely by sending the target a booby-trapped media file delivered via iMessage. Apple also recently updated its advisory for the zero-click flaw (CVE-2025-43200), noting that it was mitigated as of iOS 18.3.1, which was released in February 2025.</p><p>Apple has not commented on whether CVE-2025-43200 could be exploited on devices with Lockdown Mode turned on. But HelpNetSecurity <a href=\"https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/06/13/ios-zero-click-attacks-used-to-deliver-graphite-spyware-cve-2025-43200/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">observed</a> that at the same time Apple addressed CVE-2025-43200 back in February, the company fixed another vulnerability flagged by Citizen Lab researcher : <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVE-2025-24200</a>, which Apple said was used in an extremely sophisticated  attack against specific targeted individuals that allowed attackers to disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device.</p><p>In other words, the flaw could apparently be exploited only if the attacker had physical access to the targeted vulnerable device. And as the old infosec industry adage goes, if an adversary has physical access to your device, it‚Äôs most likely not your device anymore.</p><p>I can‚Äôt speak to Google‚Äôs Advanced Protection Mode personally, because I don‚Äôt use Google or Android devices. But I have had Apple‚Äôs Lockdown Mode enabled on all of my Apple devices since it was first made available in September 2022. I can only think of a single occasion when one of my apps failed to work properly with Lockdown Mode turned on, and in that case I was able to add a temporary exception for that app in Lockdown Mode‚Äôs settings.</p><p>My main gripe with Lockdown Mode was captured in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/apples-lockdown-mode-is-good-for-security-but-its-notifications-are-baffling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a March 2025 column</a> by TechCrunch‚Äôs <strong>Lorenzo Francheschi-Bicchierai</strong>, who wrote about its penchant for periodically sending mystifying notifications that someone has been blocked from contacting you, even though nothing then prevents you from contacting that person directly.

Some voters accept election results only <a href=\"https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states\">when their side wins</a>. The problem isn‚Äôt just political polarization‚Äîit‚Äôs a creeping <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/\">erosion of trust</a> in the machinery of democracy itself.</p><p>Commentators blame ideological tribalism, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/media/election-disinformation-2024.html\">misinformation campaigns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/opinion/social-media-polarization-democracy.html\">partisan echo chambers</a> for this crisis of trust. But these explanations miss a critical piece of the puzzle: a growing unease with the digital infrastructure that now underpins nearly every aspect of how Americans vote.</p><p>The digital transformation of American elections has been swift and sweeping. Just two decades ago, most people voted using mechanical levers or punch cards. Today, <a href=\"https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voting-technology\">over 95% of ballots</a> are counted electronically. Digital systems have replaced poll books, taken over voter identity verification processes and are integrated into registration, counting, auditing and voting systems.</p><p>This technological leap has made voting more accessible and efficient, and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/voting-has-never-been-more-secure-than-it-is-right-now/\">sometimes more secure</a>. But these new systems are also more complex. And that complexity plays into the hands of those looking to undermine democracy.</p><p>In recent years, authoritarian regimes have refined a <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/china-midterms-elections-influence-nord-hacking/\">chillingly effective strategy</a> to chip away at Americans‚Äô faith in democracy by relentlessly sowing doubt about the tools U.S. states use to conduct elections. It‚Äôs a sustained <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/\">campaign to fracture civic faith</a> and make Americans believe that democracy is rigged, especially when their side loses.</p><p>This is not cyberwar in the traditional sense. There‚Äôs no evidence that anyone has managed to break into voting machines and alter votes. But cyberattacks on election systems don‚Äôt need to succeed to have an effect. Even a single failed intrusion, magnified by sensational headlines and political echo chambers, is enough to shake public trust. By feeding into existing anxiety about the complexity and opacity of digital systems, adversaries create <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/business/media/china-online-disinformation-us-election.html\">fertile ground for disinformation and conspiracy theories</a>.</p><p>To test this dynamic, we launched a study to uncover precisely how cyberattacks corroded trust in the vote during the 2024 U.S. presidential race. We surveyed more than 3,000 voters before and after election day, testing them using a series of fictional but highly realistic breaking news reports depicting cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. We randomly assigned participants to watch different types of news reports: some depicting cyberattacks on election systems, others on unrelated infrastructure such as the power grid, and a third, neutral control group.</p><p>The results, which are under peer review, were both striking and sobering. Mere exposure to reports of cyberattacks <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0iGIYk_WsxumppZ4ZEVAANS4CC9lTaQ/view\">undermined trust in the electoral process</a>‚Äîregardless of partisanship. Voters who supported the losing candidate experienced the greatest drop in trust, with two-thirds of Democratic voters showing heightened skepticism toward the election results.</p><p>But winners too showed diminished confidence. Even though most Republican voters, buoyed by their victory, accepted the overall security of the election, the majority of those who viewed news reports about cyberattacks remained suspicious.</p><p>The attacks didn‚Äôt even have to be related to the election. Even cyberattacks against critical infrastructure such as utilities had spillover effects. Voters seemed to extrapolate: ‚ÄúIf the power grid can be hacked, why should I believe that voting machines are secure?‚Äù</p><p>Strikingly, voters who used digital machines to cast their ballots were the most rattled. For this group of people, belief in the accuracy of the vote count fell by nearly twice as much as that of voters who cast their ballots by mail and who didn‚Äôt use any technology. Their firsthand experience with the sorts of systems being portrayed as vulnerable personalized the threat.</p><p>It‚Äôs not hard to see why. When you‚Äôve just used a touchscreen to vote, and then you see a news report about a digital system being breached, the leap in logic isn‚Äôt far.</p><p>Our data suggests that in a digital society, perceptions of trust‚Äîand distrust‚Äîare fluid, contagious and easily activated. The cyber domain isn‚Äôt just about networks and code. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogac042\">It‚Äôs also about emotions</a>: fear, vulnerability and uncertainty.</p><p>Does this mean we should scrap electronic voting machines? Not necessarily.</p><p>Every election system, digital or analog, has flaws. And in many respects, today‚Äôs high-tech systems have solved the problems of the past with voter-verifiable paper ballots. Modern voting machines reduce human error, increase accessibility and speed up the vote count. No one misses the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/12/us/counting-the-vote-the-ballots-after-cards-are-poked-the-confetti-can-count.html\">hanging chads</a> of 2000.</p><p>But technology, no matter how advanced, cannot instill legitimacy on its own. It must be paired with something harder to code: public trust. In an environment where foreign adversaries amplify every flaw, cyberattacks can trigger spirals of suspicion. It is no longer enough for elections to be secure ‚Äì voters must also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/american-elections-hack-bruce-scheier\">perceive them to be secure</a>.</p><p>That‚Äôs why <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/learning/2024-election-teaching-resources.html\">public education</a> surrounding elections is now as vital to election security as firewalls and encrypted networks. It‚Äôs vital that voters understand how elections are run, how they‚Äôre protected and how failures are caught and corrected. Election officials, civil society groups and researchers can teach <a href=\"https://verifiedvoting.org/audits/\">how audits work</a>, host open-source verification demonstrations and ensure that high-tech electoral processes are comprehensible to voters.</p><p>We believe this is an essential investment in democratic resilience. But it needs to be proactive, not reactive. By the time the doubt takes hold, it‚Äôs already too late.</p><p>Just as crucially, we are convinced that it‚Äôs time to rethink the very nature of cyber threats. People often imagine them in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/us/politics/china-cyber-us-infrastructure.html\">military terms</a>. But that framework misses the true power of these threats. The danger of cyberattacks is not only that they can destroy infrastructure or steal classified secrets, but that they chip away at societal cohesion, sow anxiety and fray citizens‚Äô confidence in democratic institutions. These attacks erode the very idea of truth itself by making people doubt that anything can be trusted.</p><p>If trust is the target, then we believe that elected officials should start to treat trust as a national asset: something to be built, renewed and defended. Because in the end, elections aren‚Äôt just about votes being counted‚Äîthey‚Äôre about people believing that those votes count.</p><p>And in that belief lies the true firewall of democracy.</p><p><em>This essay was written with Ryan Shandler and Anthony J.

Manipulating account balances in bank databases, removing entries from criminal records, and murder by removing notations about allergies from medical records are all integrity attacks.</p><p>More broadly, integrity refers to ensuring that data is correct and accurate from the point it is collected, through all the ways it is used, modified, transformed, and eventually deleted. Integrity-related incidents include malicious actions, but also inadvertent mistakes.</p><p>We tend not to think of them this way, but we have many primitive integrity measures built into our computer systems. The reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state, is an integrity measure. The undo button is another integrity measure. Any of our systems that detect hard drive errors, file corruption, or dropped internet packets are integrity measures.</p><p>Just as a website leaving personal data exposed even if no one accessed it counts as a privacy breach, a system that fails to guarantee the accuracy of its data counts as an integrity breach ‚Äì even if no one deliberately manipulated that data.</p><p>Integrity has always been important, but as we start using massive amounts of data to both train and operate AI systems, data integrity will become more critical than ever.</p><p>Most of the attacks against AI systems are integrity attacks. Affixing small stickers on road signs to fool AI driving systems is an integrity violation. Prompt injection attacks are another integrity violation. In both cases, the AI model can‚Äôt distinguish between legitimate data and malicious input: visual in the first case, text instructions in the second. Even worse, the AI model can‚Äôt distinguish between legitimate data and malicious commands.</p><p>Any attacks that manipulate the training data, the model, the input, the output, or the feedback from the interaction back into the model is an integrity violation. If you‚Äôre building an AI system, integrity is your biggest security problem. And it‚Äôs one we‚Äôre going to need to think about, talk about, and figure out how to solve.</p><p>Web 3.0 ‚Äì the distributed, decentralized, intelligent web of tomorrow ‚Äì is all about data integrity. It‚Äôs not just AI. Verifiable, trustworthy, accurate data and computation are necessary parts of cloud computing, peer-to-peer social networking, and distributed data storage. Imagine a world of driverless cars, where the cars communicate with each other about their intentions and road conditions. That doesn‚Äôt work without integrity. And neither does a smart power grid, or reliable mesh networking. There are no trustworthy AI agents without integrity.</p><p>We‚Äôre going to have to solve a small language problem first, though. Confidentiality is to confidential, and availability is to available, as integrity is to what? The analogous word is ‚Äúintegrous,‚Äù but that‚Äôs such an obscure word that it‚Äôs not in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, even in its unabridged version. I propose that we re-popularize the word, starting here.</p><p>We need research into integrous system design.</p><p>We need research into a series of hard problems that encompass both data and computational integrity. How do we test and measure integrity? How do we build verifiable sensors with auditable system outputs? How to we build integrous data processing units? How do we recover from an integrity breach? These are just a few of the questions we will need to answer once we start poking around at integrity.</p><p>There are deep questions here, deep as the internet. Back in the 1960s, the internet was designed to answer a basic security question: Can we build an available network in a world of availability failures? More recently, we turned to the question of privacy: Can we build a confidential network in a world of confidentiality failures? I propose that the current version of this question needs to be this: Can we build an integrous network in a world of integrity failures? Like the two version of this question that came before: the answer isn‚Äôt obviously ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but it‚Äôs not obviously ‚Äúno,‚Äù either.</p><p>Let‚Äôs start thinking about integrous system design. And let‚Äôs start using the word in conversation. The more we use it, the less weird it will sound. And, who knows, maybe someday the American Dialect Society will choose it as the word of the year.</p>","contentLength":4436,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Friday, June 27th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9508, (Fri, Jun 27th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32074","date":1750989602,"author":"","guid":183157,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["infosec"]}
