How do you save money? The easiest way is to get people to quit. What are these return to office mandates, particularly the five day a week in office mandates? We have a lot of data on this now, and it shows people will quit and you don't even have to pay them severance to do it. \n\nMolly Roberts: It's not about productivity for the people who are in the office, then, you think. It's more about just cutting down on the size of the workforce generally. \n\nHeather Long: I do think so. There has been a decent amount of research so far on fully remote, hybrid and fully in office. It's a mixed bag for fully remote. That's why I think if you look at the Fortune 500, only about 16 companies are fully remote, but a lot of them are hybrid. The reason that so much companies are hybrid is because that's the sweet spot. There is no productivity difference between the hybrid schedule and fully in the office five days a week. But what you do see a big difference is employee satisfaction and happiness and employee retention.... \nI think if what we're talking about is places that have been able to do work from home successfully for the past several years, why are they suddenly in 2025, saying the whole world has changed and we need to come back to the office five days a week? You should definitely be skeptical. \n\"Who are the first people to leave in these scenarios? It's star employees who know they can get a job elsewhere,\" Long says (adding later that \"There's also quantifiable data that show that, particularly parents, the childcare issues are real.\") Long also point out that most of Nvidia's workforce is fully remote — and that housing prices have spiked in some areas where employers are now demanding people return to the office. \n\nBut employers also know hiring rates are now low, argues Long, so they're pushing their advantage — possibly out of some misplaced nostalgie. \"[T]here's a huge, huge perception difference between what managers, particularly senior leaders in an organization, how effective they think in offices versus what the rank and file people think. Rank and file people tend to prefer hybrid because they don't want their time wasted.\" \n\nTheir discussion also notes a recent Harvard Business School survey that found that 40% of people would trade 5% or more of their salaries to work from home....","contentLength":2760,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why the ‘spirit’ of open source means much more than a license","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/why-the-spirit-of-open-source-means-much-more-than-a-license/","date":1739026800,"author":"Paul Sawers","guid":176,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Arguments about what is and isn’t “open source” are often resolved by deferring to the Open Source Initiative (OSI): If a piece of software is available under a license rubber stamped as “open source” by the OSI’s formal “definition,” then that software is open source.

Once linked, the two pieces of hardware could be treated as a single quantum computer, allowing simple algorithms to be performed that involved operations on both sides of the 2-meter gap. [...] The Oxford team was simply interested in a proof-of-concept, and so used an extremely simplified system. Each end of the 2-meter gap had a single trap holding two ions, one strontium and one calcium. The two atoms could be entangled with each other, getting them to operate as a single unit.\n \nThe calcium ion served as a local memory and was used in computations, while the strontium ion served as one of the two ends of the quantum network. An optical cable between the two ion traps allowed photons to entangle the two strontium ions, getting the whole system to operate as a single unit. The key thing about the entanglement processes used here is that a failure to entangle left the system in its original state, meaning that the researchers could simply keep trying until the qubits were entangled. The entanglement event would also lead to a photon that could be measured, allowing the team to know when success had been achieved (this sort of entanglement with a success signal is termed \"heralded\" by those in the field).\n \nThe researchers showed that this setup allowed them to teleport with a specific gate operation (controlled-Z), which can serve as the basis for any other two-qubit gate operation -- any operation you might want to do can be done by using a specific combination of these gates. After performing multiple rounds of these gates, the team found that the typical fidelity was in the area of 70 percent. But they also found that errors typically had nothing to do with the teleportation process and were the product of local operations at one of the two ends of the network. They suspect that using commercial hardware, which has far lower error rates, would improve things dramatically. Finally, they performed a version of Grover's algorithm, which can, with a single query, identify a single item from an arbitrarily large unordered list. The \"arbitrary\" aspect is set by the number of available qubits; in this case, having only two qubits, the list maxed out at four items. Still, it worked, again with a fidelity of about 70 percent.\n \nWhile the work was done with trapped ions, almost every type of qubit in development can be controlled with photons, so the general approach is hardware-agnostic. And, given the sophistication of our optical hardware, it should be possible to link multiple chips at various distances, all using hardware that doesn't require the best vacuum or the lowest temperatures we can generate. That said, the error rate of the teleportation steps may still be a problem, even if it was lower than the basic hardware rate in these experiments. The fidelity there was 97 percent, which is lower than the hardware error rates of most qubits and high enough that we couldn't execute too many of these before the probability of errors gets unacceptably high.","contentLength":3301,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Media Slant: Slant Contagion and Polarization","url":"https://hackernoon.com/media-slant-slant-contagion-and-polarization?source=rss","date":1738984591,"author":"Tech Media Bias [Research Publication]","guid":221,"unread":true,"content":"<p>6.

Mechanisms and Heterogeneity</p><h2>C.13. Mechanisms: Descriptive Evidence on Demand Side</h2><p>A relevant question is whether the effects of contagious slant are driven by supply or demand – that is, a direct influence on news producers, or else theirs response to changes in reader preferences. Newspaper readers, influenced by their cable news consumption, might demand more slanted news content. On the supply side, owners, editors, or journalists exposed to certain channels may borrow the associated slanted content and push it to consumers.</p><p>\\\nThe previous literature has produced mixed evidence, with some work showing that slant across U.S. newspapers reflects the political preferences of readers rather than producers (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010), while other work has shown that media owners do influence news content (Gilens and Hertzman, 2000; Martin and McCrain, 2019; Mastrorocco and Ornaghi, 2020; Szeidl and Szucs, 2021). Given the declining revenues in the local news industry during the 2005-2008 time period (Evans, 2009; Rolnik et al., 2019; Djourelova et al., 2021), it could be that newspapers have less leeway to deviate from consumer preferences in favor of producer preferences. On the other hand, lower revenues might also reduce newsmaking resources. Then, borrowing content from national platforms may provide a cheap production alternative to original reporting.</p><p>\\\nThe features of the institutional setting make direct influence of journalists, either through production costs or ideological preferences, a less likely or at least less salient mechanism for the observed 2SLS effects. A journalist can easily access cable news and borrow material, regardless of the local channel position (assuming that journalists are relatively sophisticated news consumers). Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) discuss this issue in the context of voting, where one would expect cable news to influence swing voters who don’t have a strong partisan commitment. Ash and Poyker (2019) make a similar point for judges: cable news influences criminal sentencing through voters and judicial elections rather than persuading judges directly.</p><p>\\\nHere, we provide some descriptive evidence on the demand side by comparing the effects of cable-channel exposure on news content to the parallel effects on Republican vote share documented in previous work (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017; Ash et al., 2021). If the contagious-slant effects are driven by responses to a cable news-induced demand shift among readers, we would expect newspapers to react most in counties where the FNC effect on Republican voting is the largest. To test for this possibility, we use a machine-learning approach to model heterogeneous treatment effects across counties in the response to the channel-position instrument. This generalized model – a causal forest from Athey et al. (2019) – allows the reduced form effect of channel position to vary flexibly with local covariates. After collapsing the data to the county level, we train two models – one with newspaper slant as the outcome and a second with 2008 Republican vote share as the outcome.</p><p>\\\nUsing the trained causal forests, we predict county-specific treatment effects for both outcomes. Figure C.6 shows that the predicted effect sizes for each outcome are highly correlated across counties (with a Pearson’s correlation of 0.25). Further, Table C.16 shows that similar covariates predict a strong response for both news similarity and Republican vote share. Overall, these findings suggest that the types of counties who are responsive to cable news exposure in their voting are also responsive in the associated news content similarity. We interpret this result as descriptive evidence for the relative importance of demand-side effects.</p><p>\\\nFigure C.6: Predicted treatment effects of instrument: similarity to FNC versus Republican votes in 2008</p><p>(1) Philine Widmer, ETH Zürich and philine.widmer@gess.ethz.ch;</p><p>(2) Sergio Galletta, ETH Zürich and sergio.galletta@gess.ethz.ch;</p><p>(3) Elliott Ash, ETH Zürich and ashe@ethz.ch.</p>","contentLength":4053,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Researching Media Slant: Language Features and Topics","url":"https://hackernoon.com/researching-media-slant-language-features-and-topics?source=rss","date":1738983553,"author":"Tech Media Bias [Research Publication]","guid":219,"unread":true,"content":"<p>6.

While the law remains in limbo due to industry influence and legal challenges, broader enforcement issues persist across multiple states, with corporations often ignoring right-to-repair laws despite their legal passage. Techdirt reports: A little over a year ago, Maine residents voted overwhelmingly (83 percent) to pass a new state right to repair law designed to make auto repairs easier and more affordable. More specifically, the law requires that automakers standardize on-board diagnostic systems and provide remote access to those systems and mechanical data to consumers and third-party independent repair shops. But as we've seen with other states that have passed right to reform laws (most notably New York), passing the law isn't the end of the story. Corporate lobbyists have had great success not just watering these laws down before passage, but after voters approve them. They've also been swarmed by coordinated industry lawsuits and falsehood-spewing attacks.\n \nMaine's popular right to repair law just took effect after a year of hashing out the fine details, but the bill's still being changed as the state tries to sort out enforcement. Large automakers have been looming over that process to try and weaken the law. But the Alliance For Automotive Innovation also just filed a new lawsuit saying the law isn't fully cooked and therefore violates the law: \"This is an example of putting the cart before the horse. Before automakers can comply, the law requires the attorney general to first establish an 'independent entity' to securely administer access to vehicle data. The independent entity hasn't been established. That's not in dispute. Compliance with the law right now is not possible.\"","contentLength":1880,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Media Slant Research: Newspaper-County Observations","url":"https://hackernoon.com/media-slant-research-newspaper-county-observations?source=rss","date":1738976681,"author":"Tech Media Bias [Research Publication]","guid":216,"unread":true,"content":"<p>6.

It also operates a network of physician practices and 15 local hospitals across Illinois and Wisconsin, including two children's hospitals. The non-profit healthcare system said in data breach notifications sent to those impacted that the incident was discovered on August 27, 2023, after detecting that the attacker had gained access to HSHS' network.\n \nAfter the security breach, its systems were also impacted by a widespread outage that took down \"virtually all operating systems\" and phone systems across Illinois and Wisconsin hospitals. HSHS also hired external security experts to investigate the attack, assess its impact, and help its IT team restore affected systems. [...] While the incident and the resulting outage have all the signs of a ransomware attack, no ransomware operation has claimed the breach. Following the forensic investigation, HSHS found that the attackers had accessed files on compromised systems between August 16 and August 27, 2023.\n \nThe information accessed by the threat actors while inside HSHS' systems varies for each impacted individual, and it includes a combination of name, address, date of birth, medical record number, limited treatment information, health insurance information, Social Security number, and/or driver's license number. While HSHS added that there is no evidence that the victims' information has been used in fraud or identity theft attempts, it warned affected individuals to monitor their account statements and credit reports for suspicious activity.

From the report: The Culture, Media and Sport Committee and Science, Innovation and Technology Committee asked composer Max Richter how he would know if \"bad-faith actors\" were using his material to train AI models. \"There's really nothing I can do,\" he told MPs. \"There are a couple of music AI models, and it's perfectly easy to make them generate a piece of music that sounds uncannily like me. That wouldn't be possible unless it had hoovered up my stuff without asking me and without paying for it. That's happening on a huge scale. It's obviously happened to basically every artist whose work is on the internet.\"\n \nRichter, whose work has been used in a number of major film and television scores, said the consequences for creative musicians and composers would be dire. \"You're going to get a vanilla-ization of music culture as automated material starts to edge out human creators, and you're also going to get an impoverishing of human creators,\" he said. \"It's worth remembering that the music business in the UK is a real success story. It's 7.6 billion-pound income last year, with over 200,000 people employed. That is a big impact. If we allow the erosion of copyright, which is really how value is created in the music sector, then we're going to be in a position where there won't be artists in the future.\"\n \nSpeaking earlier, former Google staffer James Smith said much of the damage from text and data mining had likely already been done. \"The original sin, if you like, has happened,\" said Smith, co-founder and chief executive of Human Native AI. \"The question is, how do we move forward? I would like to see the government put more effort into supporting licensing as a viable alternative monetization model for the internet in the age of these new AI agents.\"\n \nMatt Rogerson, director of global public policy and platform strategy at the Financial Times, said: \"We can only deal with what we see in front of us and [that is] people taking our content, using it for the training, using it in substitutional ways. So from our perspective, we'll prosecute the same argument in every country where we operate, where we see our content being stolen.\" The risk, if the situation continued, was a hollowing out of creative and information industries, he said. [...] \"The problem is we can't see who's stolen our content. We're just at this stage where these very large companies, which usually make margins of 90 percent, might have to take some smaller margin, and that's clearly going to be upsetting for their investors. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't. It's just a question of right and wrong and where we pitch this debate.

It’s used for other types of data not necessarily linked to passwords.</p><h3>2. Obfuscation (Encryption) in Data Streaming</h3><p>\\\nWhen a system generates events (for example, through Event Sourcing) for marketing or analytics and sends them to Kafka (or another streaming service), there’s a risk that these messages may contain personal user data (email addresses, phone numbers, etc).  helps ensure this data won’t be accessible in plain text.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Use case: Marketing and user data</strong></p><ul><li>Marketers need the data to segment the audience or evaluate user behavior.</li></ul><ul><li>Each user event (registration, clicks, purchases, etc.) is sent to Kafka.</li></ul><ul><li><p>If the events contain unencrypted personal data, accidental leaks, or a “rogue” consumer connecting to the topic could result in serious consequences.</p></li></ul><ol><li><p> with a strong algorithm, such as AES.</p></li><li><p> to enable secure authentication and on-the-wire encryption.</p></li><li><p> to Kafka topics via ACLs (Access Control Lists) and role-based policies.</p></li></ol><pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n    \"crypto/aes\"\n    \"crypto/cipher\"\n    \"crypto/rand\"\n    \"encoding/base64\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io\"\n)\n\nfunc encryptAES(plaintext, key string) (string, error) {\n    block, err := aes.NewCipher([]byte(key))\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", err\n    }\n\n    cipherText := make([]byte, aes.BlockSize+len(plaintext))\n    iv := cipherText[:aes.BlockSize]\n\n    if _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, iv); err != nil {\n        return \"\", err\n    }\n\n    stream := cipher.NewCFBEncrypter(block, iv)\n    stream.XORKeyStream(cipherText[aes.BlockSize:], []byte(plaintext))\n\n    return base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(cipherText), nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    key := \"myVerySecretKey12\" // AES-128/256\n    data := \"User Email: user@example.com\"\n\n    encrypted, err := encryptAES(data, key)\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Encrypted Data:\", encrypted)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Thus, even if someone gains access to a message, they won’t be able to decrypt its contents without the key.</p><h3>3. Exceptions and Additional Measures</h3><p>Despite obfuscation being crucial, certain business scenarios demand de-identified data for analytics (for example, age or country). In those cases, you need to:</p><ul><li> (full name, exact email, phone number), replacing them with anonymized identifiers.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Use certificates and authentication in Kafka</strong> so that no one without sufficient privileges can “join” your consumer group or read messages directly from the console.</li></ul><p>\\\nSample command for secure topic access:</p><pre><code>kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \\\n  --topic user-events \\\n  --consumer.config client-ssl.properties\n</code></pre><p>The  file will contain the necessary certificate and key information for authentication.</p><p>By combining hashing and obfuscation, as well as properly configuring access roles and migration processes, you achieve a multi-layered defense for user data. This not only lowers the potential risk of leaks but also enhances user and regulatory confidence in your system.</p><ol><li><p>&nbsp;Each microservice should have its own database to isolate breaches and prevent unwanted cross-service access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Each user has a unique account:</strong> No shared accounts or passwords \\u2014 this simplifies audit trails and accountability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Access roles clearly defined by policy:</strong> All data operations should be governed by predetermined rules (who can read, who can modify, etc.).</p></li><li><p><strong>All database changes via migrations only:</strong> Avoid arbitrary manual modifications to the database schema. Migrations provide transparency, versioning, and control.</p></li><li><p><strong>All passwords in Vault or k8s secrets (including the “salt” for decoding)</strong>: Sensitive data should never be stored in code or exposed in Git. Use specialized solutions (HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, etc.).</p></li></ol><p>\\\nBy following these recommendations, you significantly strengthen security in your infrastructure and minimize financial and reputational risks when dealing with user data.</p>","contentLength":6432,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Salesforce, Workday Are Hiring More Overseas To Save Cash","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/25/02/07/1423237/salesforce-workday-are-hiring-more-overseas-to-save-cash?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1738963260,"author":"msmash","guid":279,"unread":true,"content":"Software companies are under pressure to invest in new AI capabilities without denting profits.

Instead, we could use the same fiber optic cables that we utilize in classical communication.</p><p>\\\nFibre optic cables or optical fibers transmit light particles, signals, or pulses. They contain glass fibers wrapped in another glass layer called cladding, a buffer tube, and a jacket, the final layer. After quantum teleportation became more than a theoretical scientific milestone, there was another problem—how to teleport information with quantum computing while preserving the data. But why's this a problem, and what's quantum teleportation in the first place?</p><p>\\\nThis article will explain quantum teleportation, how it works, and how it could affect modern-day communication.</p><h2>What is Quantum Teleportation?</h2><p>To understand quantum teleportation, we must first start with its parent field—quantum computing. And to understand quantum computing, we must know what quantum mechanics is.</p><p>\\\nAs the DOE explains,  is the field of physics that explains how extremely small objects have the characteristics of particles and waves simultaneously. For instance, the atom consists of subatomic particles like electrons that exhibit this wave-particle duality. In other words, while they exist as a small discrete unit in a bound state, they are also constantly shifting.</p><p>\\\nThe discovery of these microscopic objects, known as quanta, spurred a series of discoveries in the field. Quantum computing was the first, leading to the birth of quantum computers, which could solve problems that even the most powerful classical computers couldn't.</p><p>\\\nAt the heart of this field lies quantum teleportation. It is a faster, more secure method of transmitting information over significant distances without direct transfer through a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.</p><h2>Key Principles and Terms of Quantum Teleportation</h2><p>Understanding quantum teleportation requires you to grasp the underlying concepts that form its basis. These include:</p><p>, also known as qubits, are the fundamental units that make up the parts of a quantum system. While classical computers store information in 0 or 1 bits, quantum bits can exist as 0, 1, or both 0 and 1.</p><p>John Preskill, professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology, explains it as the  between parts of a quantum system. These parts, known as qubits, are linked in a way that allows them to exchange information without physically transporting it. When the state of one is changed, the other one automatically assumes the altered state.</p><p>Superposition is one of the most important principles of quantum mechanics. Due to its wave-particle dual nature, a quantum particle can exist in multiple states. However, these superpositions are mathematical probabilities of the particle having a specific property.</p><p>Bell state, also called EPR states or pairs, is the simplest form of quantum entanglement. When a qubit's state takes on a value, the correlating qubit will also take on a value. Each quantum entanglement formed from two cubits can result in 4 bell states.</p><p>A quantum state is simply the physical properties of a quantum system. However, it is usually mathematically represented by a vector containing all the information about that system. Quantum states are usually written as |Ψ⟩.</p><p>The big question is how these all come together to cause quantum teleportation as we know it. In 1993, four scientists—Bennett, Brassard, Crépeau, Jozsa, Peres, and Wootters—came together to form . But it wasn't until 1997 that Anton Zeilinger and Sandu Prospecu took it from pages to a real experiment.</p><p>\\\nThe teleportation protocol exists for one sole reason—to transfer quantum states from one particle to another without physically moving them. It involves preparing entangled particles, performing specific operations on them (like measurements and classical communication), and finally sending the states.</p><p>\\\nInstead of classical gates that use bits, the protocol uses quantum gates to build quantum circuits at the start of the teleportation process. These gates are called the Hadamard and CNOT gates and are used to create an EPR qubit or Bell state described earlier. Here's a full breakdown of the  published by Mario Mastriani.</p><h2>What Does Quantum Teleportation Mean for Us?</h2><p>Now that we're making progress with quantum teleportation, what does it mean for us as humans?</p><p>Of all the benefits of quantum teleportation, the most talked about is quantum encryption. No doubt, quantum teleportation will make current cybersecurity practices laughable. Forget what you know about firewalls, VPNs, and encryption. They all rely on the assumption that hackers can't intercept data. Well, until now.</p><p>\\\nQuantum encryption can prevent many security breaches, especially now that security threats have become more advanced. When someone attempts to intercept information, the quantum state of the particles involved will be disrupted, and both parties will be alerted.</p><p>Although we're not there yet, quantum teleportation will soon set a new communication speed standard. If the quantum internet becomes a thing, you can transfer data across continents almost immediately.</p><p>\\\nThis could be helpful in many areas, such as business, healthcare, and education. It might allow people to work together in real time, no matter where they are.</p><p>Space technology could've gone farther than this if only communication with spacecraft or satellites had been faster. But it hasn't because signals must travel long distances before they reach space.</p><p>\\\nBut it's not just space. Several other technologies and industries will develop much faster with quantum teleportation. Information discovery and sharing is the backbone of any invention. Maybe we really could use the quantum push.</p><p>Quantum teleportation still has a long way to go. If we've come this far, I have no doubt that we will see surprising advancements before the next decade is over.</p><p>\\\nWe still have much to do regarding quantum repeaters, as well as the effect of temperature and electromagnetic radiation on quantum systems. But I have no doubt that we will soon build quantum communication networks that can operate reliably outside of controlled lab environments.</p><p>\\\nI can't wait for us to have more secure, instantaneous data systems. This will likely cause change in almost every field known to man, whether it's cybersecurity or global communications.</p><p>\\\nOne day, in the future, you may look back and realize that our current communication methods were much slower, just as you'd say about the Abacus right now.</p><p>\\\nSo, the next time someone talks about quantum teleportation, remember it's no longer a sci-fi dream.

While most people hope never to need one, they are essential to society. Since they are so important, it is reasonable to think they are some of the most efficient institutions in the country. However, that assumption could not be further from the truth.</strong></p><p>\\\nMany emergency communication centers are underfunded and understaffed, resulting in unanswered 911 calls and lengthy dispatch times. Those delays can cost lives. While the clear solution is hiring more people, urban and rural centers have trouble finding candidates. Could artificial intelligence solve this seemingly unsolvable problem?</p><h2>1. Handles Nonemergency Calls</h2><p>Even though most people are taught from a young age that 911 is for emergencies only, PSAPs receive an incredible number of nonemergency calls. Factoring in spam and misdials, call-takers spend an inordinate amount of time handling situations that don’t matter.</p><p>\\\nThe director of government affairs for the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch (IAED) said using AI for nonemergency calls  and a huge benefit because it enables dispatchers to focus on the calls that really matter. If a machine learning model picks up instead of them, they don’t have to waste their time on noncritical situations.</p><p>\\\nAI can identify spam calls, resolve misdials and route nonemergency calls to the proper agencies, reducing the volume of calls on the administrative line. For example, if someone calls about a loose dog, it can transfer them to animal control.</p><p>\\n Already, 911 call centers have deployed AI this way. For instance, Charleston County’s Consolidated Emergency Communications Center — which  annually on average — used machine learning to automate its nonemergency line fully. The center’s director said it helps dispatchers provide better assistance.</p><h2><strong>2. Creates Transcripts of Calls</strong></h2><p>Generative models can automatically create written records of audio communications. These transcripts can be used for reference during dispatch or later training. Since all 911 calls are already recorded, implementation would be relatively straightforward.</p><p>\\n Automatic transcription and summarization would be a massive help during frantic conversations. What has happened, who needs help and where the crisis is unfolding are the most important pieces of data in an emergency. AI can help dispatchers understand the situation’s scope and collect their thoughts, improving decision-making efficiency.</p><h2><strong>3. Conducts Sentiment Analysis</strong></h2><p>A machine learning model can leverage natural language processing to conduct sentiment analysis, allowing it to identify and react to mood. This technology  when deployed in emergency services systems.</p><p>\\\nWhile dispatchers are trained to respond to an array of crises, every person who calls 911 reacts to danger differently. The algorithm can detect these subtle differences, enabling helpful tone, wording and intervention recommendations.</p><h2><strong>4. Reviews Dispatch Data for Accuracy</strong></h2><p>Many 911 dispatchers are overworked. One investigation into the D.C. Office of Unified Communications (OUC) payroll revealed that almost  are overtime. Many work 12-hour shifts — sometimes multiple in one week.</p><p>\\\nLong hours and sleepless nights lead to human error. Call-takers may send first responders to the wrong address or leave a caller on hold for minutes. In a field where every second counts, these delays are unacceptable. Besides, forced overtime will eventually result in burnout, compounding the sector’s labor shortage.</p><p>\\\nAI can automate repetitive job functions and analyze information before relaying it, lightening the workload and ensuring accuracy. In addition to increasing efficiency, it can minimize human error, helping save lives.</p><p>\\\nEmbedding AI into emergency vehicles helps dispatchers retain control of the situation while they remain on the line with callers. It can relay critical information, provide accurate arrival time estimates and even automate some driving functions, helping teams focus on what matters.</p><p>\\n On top of improving efficiency, it could make driving safer. Research shows incorporating forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking systems could , saving 850 lives annually. While fire truck and ambulance accidents are uncommon, they happen. Preventing them saves precious time.</p><h2><strong>5. Provides Training for all Situations</strong></h2><p>While 911 call center operators receive extensive training, many don’t feel prepared to handle all possible situations. Just because they’re used to burglaries and trespassing doesn’t mean they know how to respond to a bomb threat or an active shooter.</p><p>\\\nAccording to a National Emergency Number Association survey,  feel equipped to handle any situation. They are also ill-prepared to deal with the administrative side of their work. Around 36% agreed management was the most stressful aspect of their job, ranking it above taking incoming 911 calls.</p><p>\\\nA machine learning model can create personalized training material to maximize improvements, helping dispatchers excel in areas where they previously lagged behind. Also, it can help establish individualized workflows to improve their management and administrative capabilities.</p><h2><strong>6. Handles Incident-Specific Call Surges</strong></h2><p>During events that cause mass panic, PSAPs are flooded with 911 calls. Those that are understaffed due to retention and hiring issues — which is most of them — will have trouble helping everyone.</p><p>\\\nA nationwide staffing survey by IAED revealed that 911 call center  in 2022, meaning one in four positions was unfilled. This figure represents a five-percentage-point increase from before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>\\\nEven if dispatchers can handle their regular call volume without trouble, these unexpected situations can easily cause prioritization and management issues. A machine learning model can handle incoming calls, freeing up their time. Since this technology can evolve, it can adapt to never-before-seen crises.</p><p>\\\nAI can relay relevant, helpful information to callers to ensure everyone receives help. This is especially helpful for people who aren’t connected to mass panic events because it ensures they receive a timely response.</p><h2><strong>7. Responds to Text-to-911 Messages</strong></h2><p>The ability to reach 911 operators from a mobile device is called the text-to-911 service. It is increasing in popularity. According to the National 911 Program, people in 38 states  in 2021, up from 492,328 in 2020. While this program could be revolutionary, it poses some challenges.</p><p>\\\nWhat happens when the sender misspells a word or types slowly? AI can increase efficiency by generating response prompts, reading the message aloud or fixing spelling mistakes. Contrary to popular belief, most people won’t be put off by receiving AI-generated texts.

It's designed for high concurrency, scalability and fault tolerance. Most programming languages have a framework that implements it, but some programming languages like Erlang/Elixir are designed with this model in mind.</p><p>The actor model was created in 1973, inspired by physics and some programming languages like Smalltalk, Lisp and others. It was designed to handle highly parallel computer machines consisting of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of independent microprocessors, each with its own local memory and communications processor, communicating via a high-performance communications network.</p><p>In Object-Oriented Programming, we treat everything as an object, in the actor model we treat everything as an actor.</p><p>It treats the actor as a basic block of concurrency, where an actor reacts to a message, by changing your states, modifying our behaviour for the next message, and sending more messages. In other words, an actor can:</p><ul><li>Send a finite number of messages to other actors</li><li>Create a finite number of new actors</li><li>Designate the behaviour to be used for the next message it receives.</li></ul><p>Message is a unit of communication between actors, a message should be serializable and be transmitted over networks.</p><p>The mailbox is how an actor reads messages, every message it receives goes to a mailbox, typically Actor Sysmte uses FIFO(First-In First-Out) but depending on the case, we can implement a Mailbox using a different approach if you need, for example, to prioritize a message over other</p><p>State it's the actor state, it can be read from other actors, but only the actor itself can modify your state.</p><p>The behaviour is how an actor will react to a message.</p><p>Process Identification (PID) or Actor Reference it's the actor's address, with this address an actor can send a message to another actor, this address can be local or on the remote machine.</p><p>Supervision is how the Actor Model coordinates your tasks and ensures resilience.</p><p>\\\nSo imagine, you create an actor and you ask to that actor do an action and fails to do it, how are you going to handle this failure? Should you retry? Should you stop the all process? Should you stop only that actor?</p><p>\\\nWhen the actor fails it’ll emit a signal to the supervisor and it decides what to do, stop only that actor, stop all actors or send the signal to its supervisor and let the layer above define what to do.</p><p>\\\nAll actors are supervisors.</p><p>The virtual actor is a concept created by Microsoft on the Orleans project where you don't need to know the Actor ID, you will have a unique identifier and the actor framework will find the corresponding actor (or create a new one if case it doesn't find it). \\n Virtual Actor seems to fit very well with DDD and event source, where you can use the Actor ID as the Domain ID, and the message you received you can store in some database, so when you load the domain you can easily reply to all message to get the current state (or save the state as a snapshot).</p><p>The framework to use the Actor Model will depend on the programming language, I can only talk about it for C#</p><p>&nbsp;is an Actor Model implementation from Microsoft, but it doesn't implement the Actor Model completely, only the Virtual Actor, also Microsoft decided to change some terms, like Silos = Node, Grain = Virtual Actor. One advantage of Microsoft Orleans is it's very easy to use and requires a minimal setup, but it doesn't implement the supervision like it's described in the book, so you have less flexibility.</p><p>&nbsp;is a good framework (it's a port from Java), it has almost all concepts of the Actor Model, is very flexible and seems easy to use. The main disadvantage is Akka doesn't implement a Virtual Actor Model, so if you want to implement DDD with Akka, it can be a challenge to mimic the Virtual Actor Model.</p><p>&nbsp;is the best framework for the Actor Model (you can use it with Go), it is implemented by the book (like Akka) Actor Model and supports the Virtual Actor Model (like Orleans). I would give a change for this framework</p><p>Elixir/Erlang is based on BEAM VM, which is based on the Actor Model, so you won't need any framework. Because the Virtual Actor model is a kind of new concept Elixir doesn't have native support for it, so you need to use an external library. I highly recommend you study about them</p><p>The actor model is very interesting, if you are also interested in it I recommend that you look deep. We use the actor model to create high-scale applications and it can be combined with Domain-Driven Design, Event Source and CQRS, in the next article I'll show can we can combine them.</p>","contentLength":4614,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Stop Wasting Time on Country Dropdowns – This Angular Tool Does It All!","url":"https://hackernoon.com/stop-wasting-time-on-country-dropdowns-this-angular-tool-does-it-all?source=rss","date":1738949073,"author":"Wilfried Lucha","guid":208,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey everyone!

It's a versatile, platform-independent language that's widely used in a variety of industries, from Android app development to enterprise software solutions.</p><p>However, despite its popularity, Java is often surrounded by myths and misconceptions that can discourage beginners from learning the language. In this post, we'll debunk some of the most common myths about Java and explore the benefits of learning this powerful language.</p><h2>Myth #1: Java is too hard to learn</h2><p>One of the most common myths about Java is that it's a steep learning curve for beginners. While it's true that Java can be a complex language, the reality is that the learning curve <strong>depends largely on the instructor or resource you're using</strong>. If you're learning from someone who struggled to grasp Java themselves, it's likely to be a more challenging experience. However, with the right guidance and resources, Java can be a relatively accessible language to learn, even for beginners.</p><h2>Myth #2: Java is not suitable for lightweight, quick tasks</h2><p>Another myth about Java is that it's not suitable for lightweight, quick tasks. While it's true that Java is <strong>better suited for larger and more complex applications</strong>, this doesn't mean it can't be used for smaller tasks. In fact, Java's versatility and platform independence make it a great choice for a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex enterprise systems. And with the rise of multi-file source code and shebang execution under Linux, Java is becoming an increasingly popular choice for quick and lightweight tasks.</p><h2>Myth #3: Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) is not open source</h2><p>One of the most common misconceptions about Java is that the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) is not open source. However, this is not true. <strong>OpenJDK is a completely open-source implementation of the JDK</strong>, and it's where the majority of Java development happens. Oracle Java developers contribute to the OpenJDK project, ensuring that Java remains a community-driven and open-source language.</p><h2>Myth #4: Java is an \"old\" language</h2><p>Another myth about Java is that it's an \"old\" language, with some developers viewing it as outdated or obsolete. However, the reality is that Java's age is actually a benefit. Java's maturity means it's a <strong>well-established and widely used language</strong>, with a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. This also translates to excellent documentation and a large community of developers who can provide support and guidance.</p><h2>Myth #5: There are too many Java programmers</h2><p>Finally, some developers believe that there are too many Java programmers, making it a less desirable skill to have. However, the reality is that having a large community of Java developers is actually a benefit. With so many Java developers out there, it's <strong>easy to find people who can help you out and mentor you</strong>, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer.</p>","contentLength":2963,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Your Dream Life is a Trap","url":"https://hackernoon.com/your-dream-life-is-a-trap?source=rss","date":1738948140,"author":"","guid":206,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Last week, an entrepreneur in my mentorship group shared his \"dream life\" vision board. Beach houses. Supercars. Private jets. The whole aspirational package.</p><p>\\\n\"But how's your Tuesday looking?\" I asked.</p><p>\\\nThe silence was telling.</p><p>We've got it backwards in entrepreneurship. We obsess over these massive future milestones while treating our daily experience as something to endure. Something to push through until we \"make it.\"</p><p>\\\n<strong>But here's the brutal truth about building a business: Your Tuesday afternoon matters more than your five-year vision.</strong></p><p>\\\nI'm reminded of an old Irish folktale about a man who spent his entire life chasing leprechauns, convinced that if he caught one, he'd find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. He crossed oceans, climbed mountains, and explored every forest—always just one step behind.</p><p>\\\nYears later, on his deathbed, he discovered that his own backyard had been built on an ancient gold mine.</p><p>\\\nThis is the entrepreneur's paradox: We chase the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow while ignoring the gold beneath our feet. The present moment isn't just a stepping stone to some future paradise—it's the foundation of everything we'll build.</p><p>\\\nThink about the entrepreneurs you admire most. The ones actually building remarkable things. They're not grinding through miserable days dreaming about some future paradise. They've engineered daily experiences that energize them, challenge them, and light them up.</p><p>\\\n<em>The greatest lie in entrepreneurship is that you need to suffer now to enjoy life later.</em></p><p>\\\nI watched a founder burn through three years of his life building an eight-figure business. Classic hustle story. Working weekends. Missing his kids' events. Treating his health like an inconvenience. He finally hit his numbers, bought the dream house, and realized something terrifying: He had trained himself to hate every day.</p><p>\\\nThe vision board fantasy keeps us stuck because it creates a dangerous bargain: trade your present life for a promised future. But business growth doesn't work that way. You can't sustainably build something great from a place of daily misery.</p><p>\\\nMost of us already have access to 80% of what makes a day great. Deep work. Movement. Real conversations. Problems worth solving.</p><p>\\\nBut we're too busy fantasizing about future billions to design the day right in front of us.</p><p>Let's get brutally honest about how life actually works. Your year isn't made up of highlight reel moments. It's built from ordinary Wednesdays. Regular mornings. Normal afternoons.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Do the math: You'll live about 250 workdays this year. Maybe 10-15 \"dream life\" days if you're lucky.</strong></p><p>\\\nImagine you have two jars:</p><ul><li>Jar A contains 250 marbles representing your workdays</li><li>Jar B contains 10 marbles representing your \"dream\" days</li></ul><p>\\\nMost entrepreneurs focus all their energy on optimizing those 10 marbles while treating the other 250 as disposable. It's like having a bank account with $250,000 but only caring about $10,000 of it.</p><p>\\\nYet I watch entrepreneurs pour their energy into optimizing those rare peak moments while treating the other 250 days like something to survive. The math doesn't work. It's like focusing all your attention on New Year's Eve while ignoring the rest of December.</p><p>\\\n<em>Your life happens in 24-hour blocks. Not in five-year leaps.</em></p><p>\\\nThink about how business growth actually happens. It's not in breakthrough moments. It's in consistent execution. Regular client meetings. Daily decisions. Small improvements stacked on top of each other.</p><p>\\\nI've seen businesses implode because their founders built systems they hated running. They designed their days around some imagined future instead of what actually works for them right now. Their perfect business plan looked great on paper but was miserable to execute on a random Thursday.</p><p>\\\nThe entrepreneurs who win aren't waiting to start living. They're building businesses that fit their natural rhythm.&nbsp;<strong>They understand a fundamental truth: You can't build a thriving business from a place of daily drain.</strong></p><p>\\\nThis isn't about lowering your ambitions. It's about sequencing them properly. Instead of fantasizing about your dream life, what if you started by designing a day that energizes you? A day that plays to your strengths instead of fighting against them?</p><p>\\\nBecause here's what nobody tells you about those big entrepreneurial success stories: They're built on a foundation of well-designed ordinary days.</p><p>Most business advice focuses on exceptions. Launch days. Big presentations. Major deals. But your success and satisfaction live in the routine. The regular rhythm. The unsexy middle.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Your average day is your actual life.</strong></p><p>\\\nWhen I shifted from chasing outcomes to designing experience, everything changed. I stopped seeing my daily schedule as an obstacle to my goals and started treating it as&nbsp;<em>the foundation of everything I wanted to build.</em></p><p>\\\nHere's what I learned: The best daily design starts with energy, not time. Most entrepreneurs do this backwards. They try to squeeze more into their calendar without understanding their natural rhythm.</p><p>\\\nPay attention to when your mind is sharpest. When you naturally focus best. When you feel most creative.</p><p>\\\n<strong>These aren't preferences. They're data points.</strong></p><p>\\\nI know a founder who fought her night owl tendencies for years because \"successful people wake up early.\" She finally stopped fighting. Redesigned her day around her peak evening hours. Her business doubled in 18 months because she stopped wasting energy forcing an unnatural rhythm.</p><p>\\\n<em>Success isn't about copying someone else's schedule. It's about honoring how you actually work.</em></p><p>\\\nStart with your non-negotiables. The things that make you feel human. Movement. Deep work. Real connection. Then build your business day around protecting these elements instead of sacrificing them.</p><p>\\\nThe entrepreneurs who sustain success aren't just good at business. They're good at designing days they can actually sustain. Days that energize instead of drain. Days worth repeating.</p><p>\\\nBecause a business that requires you to hate your daily experience isn't really an asset. It's just a well-disguised trap.</p><p>Most entrepreneurs think business growth and personal satisfaction are opposing forces. That you have to choose between building something great and having days you actually enjoy.</p><p>\\\n<strong>This might be the most expensive myth in business.</strong></p><p>\\\nThink about how this plays out: You push through endless draining days, telling yourself it's temporary. Just until you hit the next milestone. Just until you can hire more help. Just until things \"settle down.\"</p><p>\\\n<em>But business doesn't settle down. It settles up.</em></p><p>\\\nWhat actually happens is you train yourself to operate from a place of constant strain. You build systems and habits around that strain. You make decisions from that strain.&nbsp;<strong>And your business becomes a reflection of that strained energy.</strong></p><p>\\\nThe counterintuitive truth? Daily satisfaction is a business multiplier. When you're operating from a place of genuine energy and engagement, everything works better:</p><p>\\\nYour decision-making improves because you're not running on fumes.</p><p>Your team performs better because they're not absorbing your stressed energy.</p><p>Your clients get better results because you're fully present for them.</p><p>\\\n<em>A business built on days you love becomes an asset that compounds. A business built on days you hate becomes a liability that extracts.</em></p><p>Let's get tactical about building days worth repeating. This isn't about dramatic overhauls. It's about intentional micro-adjustments that compound over time.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Start with an energy audit.</strong>&nbsp;Not a time audit. Track when you naturally hit your stride each day. When you think most clearly. When you feel most creative. When you need to recharge.&nbsp;<em>These patterns are your building blocks.</em></p><p>\\\nMost entrepreneurs discover they're fighting their natural rhythm without realizing it. Scheduling critical work when their energy dips. Taking important calls when they're mentally drained. Small misalignments that create constant friction.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Design your day around energy protection instead of time management.</strong></p><p>\\\nI rebuilt my entire schedule around three peak focus hours in the morning. No calls. No meetings. No distractions. Just pure creation and critical thinking. It felt almost irresponsible at first. But protecting those hours changed everything.</p><p>\\\nThe key is starting small. Don't try to revolutionize your entire day at once. Pick one window of time that matters most. One type of work that deserves your best energy.&nbsp;<em>Protect that first. Let the rest of your schedule adapt around it.</em></p><p>\\\nThen watch for the ripple effects. Better energy leads to better decisions. Better decisions create more space. More space allows for better boundaries.&nbsp;<strong>It's a positive spiral that starts with one protected block of time.</strong></p><p>\\\nPay attention to what drains you. Those \"small\" calls that leave you exhausted. The low-value tasks you dread. The meetings that could be emails.&nbsp;<em>These aren't just irritations. They're data points showing you where to make changes.</em></p><p>\\\nYour perfect day already exists in pieces. You've experienced fragments of it. Moments when everything clicked. Hours when you were in complete flow.&nbsp;<strong>The art is in stringing those pieces together intentionally.</strong></p><p>The hardest part isn't designing your ideal day. It's protecting it as your business grows.&nbsp;<strong>Success has a way of trying to pull you back into old patterns.</strong></p><p>\\\nMore opportunities mean more demands on your time. More revenue brings more complexity. More visibility creates more distractions. The very growth you're working toward will test every boundary you set.</p><p>\\\n<em>This is where most entrepreneurs slip backward.</em>&nbsp;They build a great daily rhythm, then abandon it at the first sign of pressure. They treat their ideal day like a luxury instead of a necessity.</p><p>\\\n<strong>But your daily experience isn't just another business variable. It's the foundation everything else is built on.</strong></p><p>\\\nThink about the compounding effect of your daily experience. Every time you compromise your ideal day, you're not just affecting those 24 hours. You're setting patterns that will shape your next month, quarter, and year.</p><p>\\\n<em>The entrepreneurs who sustain long-term success aren't just good at building businesses. They're masters at protecting their energy as those businesses grow.</em></p><p>\\\nThis isn't about being rigid. It's about being intentional. Your ideal day will evolve as your business does. But that evolution should come from conscious choice, not external pressure.</p><p>\\\nStop waiting for some future moment to start enjoying your life. Stop treating your daily experience like a sacrifice on the altar of success.&nbsp;<strong>Because the truth is devastatingly simple: Your dream life already exists in the day right in front of you.</strong></p><p>\\\nThe only question is whether you'll have the courage to build it.</p><p>\\\n<em>P.S. The next time you're tempted to grind through another draining day in service of some future goal, remember: Your life isn't waiting in your vision board. It's happening right now, in the next 24 hours. Make them count.</em></p>","contentLength":10988,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"DeFi's Not Doing so Great Right Now","url":"https://hackernoon.com/defis-not-doing-so-great-right-now?source=rss","date":1738947966,"author":"maxo1st","guid":205,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This picture was AI-generated with perchance.org</p><h3>How DeFi went from revolutionary to repetitive: Chasing yields, dodging rug pulls, and watching protocols rebrand. Sometimes you need to point out the problems to make things better.</h3><p>I speak for every DeFi user who has been around since 2020 when I say that it feels like DeFi is stagnating. What exactly do I mean by this? Nowadays, hardly any new, innovative and, above all, trustworthy and user-friendly new protocols are being launched that appeal to a regular user. I’m not trying to sound melancholic and say that everything was better in the past. There have been plenty of hacks and complete failures of major protocols such as Euler Finance (lost value: $179,000,000) or similar. (I only take Euler Finance as an example, I have nothing against the protocol, or the team and was not affected) <a href=\"https://rekt.news/leaderboard/\">[1]</a>. However, you can’t get rid of the feeling that DeFi is no longer progressively evolving but stagnating.</p><p>The large DeFi institutions, such as Uniswap, Aave, and Compound, have established themselves and are still essential. When these protocols were launched around 2020, they greatly advanced the development of DeFi and were its true beginning. This is also due to the fact that DeFi did not really exist before and therefore simple products such as swapping, lending, and borrowing were considered ‘new and innovative’. In the long run, however, they have proven to be reliable, trustworthy, and user-friendly and have thus become the DeFi giants they are today and continue to enjoy great popularity. For example, Uniswap has a daily volume of $2 to 3 billion on average <a href=\"https://defillama.com/dexs/uniswap\">[2]</a>, while Aave and Compound have a TVL of $21 billion and $2.8 billion respectively <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/aave\">[3]</a><a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/compound-finance\">[4]</a>.</p><h2>The Copycat Crisis — Recycled Products, Recycled Problems</h2><p>Over the course of time, these protocols have naturally been joined by similar spin-offs, which also play a major part today and also have their “raison d’être”, such as Jupiter and PancakeSwap for example <a href=\"https://jup.ag/\">[5]</a><a href=\"https://pancakeswap.finance/\">[6]</a>. Behind these front row protocols, many copycats have emerged. These new protocols want a piece of the pie and offer identical products. In order to try to be competitive, ever newer protocols emerge, which then artificially keep the yields high with their new shiny tokens to attract new users to their platforms. This is the eternal cycle that continues to this day.</p><p>At a certain point, you have to ask yourself what the point is. The added value is no longer apparent. Far too often, a valued concept is recycled without there being any innovative thought behind it that improves the existing concept. As I already mentioned, the yields are often inflated by new protocols to attract users, just so that the creator team can dump the team tokens after a few months to make a profit. (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/a3b409f3fce7?source=post_page---user_mention--7cb5ce478205--------------------------------\">Joshua Field</a> wrote a good article about Real Yield in 2023 <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/contango-digital-assets/real-yield-the-future-of-defi-c3ca7aa5621c\">[7]</a>).</p><p>This pattern repeats frequently. Protocols are either abandoned or rebranded to hide their problems. Take Alpha Finance, oops I mean Stella Finance of course, oh no oops, after the latest rebrand I mean LitLayer of course <a href=\"https://rekt.news/trapped-between-protocols/\">[8]</a>. You see what I mean.</p><p>The user journey turns into a constant fund-moving from protocol to protocol to collect artificially inflated yields and sell the protocol tokens faster than the teams can do it, or as <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/a3b409f3fce7?source=post_page---user_mention--7cb5ce478205--------------------------------\">Joshua Field</a> called it “” <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/contango-digital-assets/real-yield-the-future-of-defi-c3ca7aa5621c\">[7]</a>. This user journey is extremely unfriendly to users and new DeFi users will wake up to the bitter reality that the tokens they earned through lending, for example, have virtually no value (anymore) at the end and the actual yield is now much lower than what they hoped for.</p><p>Obviously, competition is good in itself and stimulates the market, but it is questionable whether this works in the current DeFi sector. Far too often the same product is repackaged, and the competition doesn’t try to stand out from the crowd with innovative products or improvements.</p><h2>When Innovation Actually Means Something</h2><p>It is probably time to highlight Pendle here. Although the protocol has actually existed since 2021 <a href=\"https://messari.io/project/pendle/profile\">[9]</a>, it only really experienced an upswing and hype at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, with its market capitalisation growing from $200 million in December 2023 to around $6.5 billion within 6 months <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/pendle\">[10]</a>. Why is that? Clearly because of the Eigenlayer Points <a href=\"https://finbold.com/guide/where-to-trade-eigenlayer-points/\">[11]</a> that were in hype at the time and could be farmed with Pendle, but also because it is a new and innovative protocol that has never existed in this form before.</p><p>To describe Pendle effectively in the words of the Messari website: “<em>Pendle offers a market for fixed and floating rates of supported yield-bearing tokens by which users can earn fixed yield, long yield (e.g., speculate on the yield of the underlying token increasing), and provide liquidity to the Pendle pool for the underlying token.</em>” <a href=\"https://messari.io/project/pendle/profile\">[12]</a></p><p>Pendle, although relatively complicated, is an example of innovation in the DeFi sector. The product’s complexity may limit its adoption, especially for new users without a financial background. However, that’s a topic for another article. The point here is that the DeFi sector can do more than just repackage and exploit the ever-same products, and Pendle is a very positive standout example of this.</p><h2>The Reality of DeFi Today</h2><p>Thus, one can conclude from these developments of the last 2–3 years that DeFi is developing in an unproductive direction, which makes no sense for the adoption of crypto and DeFi.

My aim is to explore a different approach to testing these components, examining the pros and cons of using mocks versus testing without mocking the context. We’ll look at how each approach impacts the tests’ reliability, and I’ll share insights on when and why one method may be more beneficial than the other in real-world applications.</p><ul><li>What reactjs is used for (probably you have written some apps already)</li></ul><p>The ReactJS context emerged as a solution to a common problem in the structure of ReactJS components: prop drilling. Prop drilling occurs when we have a chain of components that need to access the same set of data. The context mechanism allows components to share the same set of data as long as the context itself is the first descendant.</p><p>\\\nIn the reactjs documentation, the context for holding the theme is used, as other component might need this information the docs use the context to handle that instead of passing the value via props. Another example is the usage of context to hold the layout of the application, in the <a href=\"https://github.com/marabesi/json-tool/blob/040f279d11b2d56248ccd5d62c28f7b19e622b86/src/App.tsx\">json-tool</a> example the App.tsx wraps the application with a DefaultLayout context that is available for all the application.</p><p>For the example that follows the theme app will be used. It is an application that allows users to switch between light/dark themes. The app is also used in the <a href=\"https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext\">reactjs official documentation</a>. This application consist of a simple toggle that switches between light theme mode and dark theme mode. The application is as simple as it gets and we can plot everything in a single file:</p><pre><code>import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light')\n\nfunction Page() {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;current theme: {theme}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')\n  return (\n    &lt;ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}&gt;\n      &lt;button\n        className={theme}\n        onClick={() =&gt; setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}\n      &gt;\n        Toggle\n      &lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;Page /&gt;\n    &lt;/ThemeContext.Provider&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIn this application, we have two main components:  and . The  component serves as the main component and contains the state for the current theme, which can be either “light” or “dark”. It also includes a button that toggles the theme between light and dark modes. The  component is a child of  and consumes the theme context to display the current theme. The button in the  component is a simple toggle button that, when clicked, switches the theme and updates the context value accordingly.</p><p>Usually in any application we would have to focus on what kind of test we want to do, and which slice we want to tackle. For example, we could target a single component, instead of the entire application. In our example, we will start with the Page component. Which will require us to use test-doubles to test it.</p><p>\\\nThe test-double comes from the app structure itself, as it depends on the context, to change it, the value in the context needs to change as well.</p><p>To get started with our testing approach with context in reactjs we will start writing the first test:</p><pre><code>import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport { Page } from './Page'\n\ndescribe('&lt;Page /&gt;', () =&gt; {\n  it('should render light as default theme', () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;Page /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThis test will pass as expected, given that the light theme is set to be the default one in the ThemeContext. We could even test drive this first example as well, however, the things get interesting in the second test, when we are interested in the dark theme. To get in to the dark theme, we need to start using <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/development/2020/11/29/2020-mocks-dummies-spies-fakes-testing-your-code.html\">test-doubles</a>, given that we depend on the reactjs context to do that. The second test brings the  to the mix as well as the . Note that the second test to be written also required the first one to be changed.</p><pre><code>import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport { Page } from './Page'\nimport { useContext } from 'react'\n\nvi.mock('react', () =&gt; {\n  return {\n    ...vi.importActual('react'),\n    useContext: vi.fn(),\n    createContext: vi.fn()\n  }\n})\n\ndescribe('&lt;Page /&gt;', () =&gt; {\n  it('should render light as default theme', () =&gt; {\n    vi.mocked(useContext).mockReturnValue('light')\n    render(&lt;Page /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n\n  it('should render dark theme', () =&gt; {\n    vi.mocked(useContext).mockReturnValue('dark')\n    render(&lt;Page /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: dark')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n</code></pre><p>\\\nBoth test cases now are using a fake to test drive the application. If we change the return data from the context, the test will also change. The points of attention here are:</p><ul><li>We are mocking reactjs context which hurst the “don’t mock what you don’t own principle”</li><li>The test become more verbose, since we are required to use mocking to do that</li><li>The two tests we have written don’t reflect the user interaction with the application. We know that the theme will change when the toggle button is hit.</li></ul><p>The next approach is to use the context embedded into our application, without isolating it or using any test-double. If we take this approach with TDD, we can start with a very simple test that simulates how the user will behave:</p><pre><code>import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport App from './App'\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'\n\ndescribe('&lt;App /&gt;', () =&gt; {\n  it('should render toggle button', () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;App /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('Toggle')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThen following to the second test, that we would like to set the light theme by default:</p><pre><code>import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport App from './App'\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'\n\ndescribe('&lt;App /&gt;', () =&gt; {\n  it('should render toggle button', () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;App /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('Toggle')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n\n  it('should render light as default theme', () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;App /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n</code></pre><p>\\\nand last but not least the theme switching:</p><pre><code>import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport App from './App'\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'\n\ndescribe('&lt;App /&gt;', () =&gt; {\n  it('should render toggle button', () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;App /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('Toggle')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n\n  it('should render light as default theme', () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;App /&gt;)\n    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n\n  it('should render dark theme on toggle', async () =&gt; {\n    const user = userEvent.setup()\n    render(&lt;App /&gt;)\n\n    await user.click(screen.getByText('Toggle'))\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: dark')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n</code></pre><p>\\\nPoints of attention to this strategy:</p><ul><li>Test-doubles are not required, it makes the test with less code</li><li>The behaviour of the test matches what the user will do in the real application</li></ul><h2>Pros and cons of each approach</h2><p>In this sections we will go over the pros and cons of each approach in regards to different properties.</p><p>Using a test-double for the context makes the test fragile for this kind of change. Refactoring the usage of useContext with props automatically makes the test to fail even when the behaviour doesn’t. Using the option that doesn’t use test-doubles supports refactoring in that sense. In the book “Refactoring in Large Software Projects” the authors Stefan Roock and Martin Lippert depicted a scenario that is similar to what I am stating in here. One of the problems that they discussed is relatated with refactoring and changing class structures, they quote the C3 project:</p><pre><code>About every 3 or 4 iterations we do a refactoring that causes us to toss or otherwise radically\nmodify a group of classes. The tests will either go away or be changed to reflect the classes’ new\nbehavior. We are constantly splitting classes up and moving behavior around. This may or may not affect the UnitTests\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIdeally to overcome this situation the unit tests would be written based on a “stable api” and the target system under test would not be touched, however, sometimes changing the api is also needed. For that, the solution proposed by the authors is to imply automated acceptance tests.</p><h3>Creating a custom context</h3><p>The same happens to using a custom context instead of relying on the context provider from reactjs directly. Using the option without test-doubles enables refactoring.</p><p>In this guide, we explored how to test components that rely on context, without the need for test-doubles, making the tests more straightforward, closer to real user interactions and contrasting pros and cons of each approach. Whenever possible, using the simples approach that reflects the user interaction should be followed. However, when test-doubles are required, they should be used targeting the maintainability of the test code. Having a simple test enables refactoring in the production code with confidence.</p><ul><li>Try testing more complex scenarios involving multiple contexts or nested providers.</li><li>While we avoided mocks in this guide, there are cases where mocking is necessary. Explore advanced mocking techniques for those scenarios.</li></ul>","contentLength":9505,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Video Friday: Agile Humanoids","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-agile-humanoids","date":1738945804,"author":"Evan Ackerman","guid":89,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Your weekly selection of awesome robot videos</p>","contentLength":45,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjI5NzUwOS9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzI1MjgxMX0.E544b1VXCKnbQMF2MZF3pmS7vTPUB1Ki4FcOrSVf-so/image.gif?width=600","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Vulkan Cooperative Matrix Merged For RDNA4 GPUs With RADV, DCC Support Inches Closer","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-Lands-RDNA4-Coop-Matrix","date":1738945696,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":701,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Last week when RADV lead developer Samuel Pitoiset with Valve was commenting on the AMD RDNA4 state with the Mesa RADV driver it was noted that Vulkan cooperative matrix support, Vulkan Video encode/decode, and DCC support were still missing.
