In addition to this blog post,  containing charts with aggregated results of all questions in the survey.</p><p><strong>Our sincerest thanks to every community member who took the time to express their opinions and experiences with Rust over the past year. Your participation will help us make Rust better for everyone.</strong></p><p>There's a lot of data to go through, so strap in and enjoy!</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>As shown above, in 2024, we have received fewer survey views than in the previous year. This was likely caused simply by the fact that the survey ran only for two weeks, while in the previous year it ran for almost a month. However, the completion rate has also dropped, which seems to suggest that the survey might be a bit too long. We will take this into consideration for the next edition of the survey.</p><p>The State of Rust survey not only gives us excellent insight into how many Rust users around the world are using and experiencing the language but also gives us insight into the makeup of our global community. This information gives us a sense of where the language is being used and where access gaps might exist for us to address over time. We hope that this data and our related analysis help further important discussions about how we can continue to prioritize global access and inclusivity in the Rust community.</p><p>Same as every year, we asked our respondents in which country they live in. The top 10 countries represented were, in order: United States (22%), Germany (14%), United Kingdom (6%), France (6%), China (5%), Canada (3%), Netherlands (3%), Russia (3%), Australia (2%), and Sweden (2%). We are happy to see that Rust is enjoyed by users from all around the world! You can try to find your country in the chart below:</p><p>We also asked whether respondents consider themselves members of a marginalized community. Out of those who answered, 74.5% selected no, 15.5% selected yes, and 10% preferred not to say.</p><p>We have asked the group that selected “yes” which specific groups they identified as being a member of. The majority of those who consider themselves a member of an underrepresented or marginalized group in technology identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or otherwise non-heterosexual. The second most selected option was neurodivergent at 46% followed by trans at 35%.</p><p>Each year, we must acknowledge the diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) related gaps in the Rust community and open source as a whole. We believe that excellent work is underway at the Rust Foundation to advance global access to Rust community gatherings and distribute grants to a diverse pool of maintainers each cycle, which you can learn more about <a href=\"https://rustfoundation.org/community\">here</a>. Even so, global inclusion and access is just one element of DEI, and the survey working group will continue to advocate for progress in this domain.</p><p>The number of respondents that self-identify as a Rust user was quite similar to last year, around 92%. This high number is not surprising, since we primarily target existing Rust developers with this survey.</p><p>Similarly as last year, around 31% of those who did not identify as Rust users cited the perception of difficulty as the primary reason for not using Rust. The most common reason for not using Rust was that the respondents simply haven’t had the chance to try it yet.</p><p>Of the former Rust users who participated in the 2024 survey, 36% cited factors outside their control as a reason why they no longer use Rust, which is a 10pp decrease from last year. This year, we also asked respondents if they would consider using Rust again if an opportunity comes up, which turns out to be true for a large fraction of the respondents (63%). That is good to hear!</p><blockquote><p>Closed answers marked with N/A were not present in the previous version(s) of the survey.</p></blockquote><p>Those not using Rust anymore told us that it is because they don't really need it (or the goals of their company changed) or because it was not the right tool for the job. A few reported being overwhelmed by the language or its ecosystem in general or that switching to or introducing Rust would have been too expensive in terms of human effort.</p><p>Of those who used Rust in 2024, 53% did so on a daily (or nearly daily) basis — an increase of 4pp from the previous year. We can observe an upward trend in the frequency of Rust usage over the past few years, which suggests that Rust is being increasingly used at work. This is also confirmed by other answers mentioned in the Rust at Work section later below.</p><p>Rust expertise is also continually increasing amongst our respondents! 20% of respondents can write (only) simple programs in Rust (a decrease of 3pp from 2023), while 53% consider themselves productive using Rust — up from 47% in 2023. While the survey is just one tool to measure the changes in Rust expertise overall, these numbers are heartening as they represent knowledge growth for many Rustaceans returning to the survey year over year.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the most popular version of Rust is , either the most recent one or whichever comes with the users' Linux distribution. Almost a third of users also use the latest nightly release, due to various reasons (see below). However, it seems that the beta toolchain is not used much, which is a bit unfortunate. We would like to encourage Rust users to use the beta toolchain more (e.g. in CI environments) to help test soon-to-be stabilized versions of Rust.</p><p>People that use the nightly toolchain mostly do it to gain access to specific unstable language features. Several users have also mentioned that rustfmt works better for them on nightly or that they use the nightly compiler because of faster compilation times.</p><p>To use Rust, programmers first have to learn it, so we are always interested in finding out how do they approach that. Based on the survey results, it seems that most users learn from Rust documentation and also from <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\">The Rust Programming Language</a> book, which has been a favourite learning resource of new Rustaceans for a long time. Many people also seem to learn by reading the source code of Rust crates. The fact that both the documentation and source code of tens of thousands of Rust crates is available on <a href=\"https://docs.rs\">docs.rs</a> and GitHub makes this easier.</p><p>In terms of answers belonging to the \"Other\" category, they can be clustered into three categories: people using LLM (large language model) assistants (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), reading the official Rust forums (Discord, <a href=\"https://users.rust-lang.org/\">URLO</a>) or being mentored while contributing to Rust projects. We would like to extend a big thank you to those making our spaces friendly and welcoming for newcomers, as it is important work and it pays off. Interestingly, a non-trivial number of people \"learned by doing\" and used rustc error messages and clippy as a guide, which is a good indicator of the quality of Rust diagnostics.</p><p>In terms of formal education, it seems that Rust has not yet penetrated university curriculums, as this is typically a very slowly moving area. Only a very small number of respondents (around 3%) have taken a university Rust course or used university learning materials.</p><p>In terms of operating systems used by Rustaceans, Linux was the most popular choice, and it seems that it is getting increasingly popular year after year. It is followed by macOS and Windows, which have a very similar share of usage.</p><blockquote><p>As you can see in the <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2025-02-13-rust-survey-2024/which-os-do-you-use-wordcloud.png\">wordcloud</a>, there are also a few users that prefer Arch, btw.</p></blockquote><p>Rust programmers target a diverse set of platforms with their Rust programs. We saw a slight uptick in users targeting embedded and mobile platforms, but otherwise the distribution of platforms stayed mostly the same as last year. Since the WebAssembly target is quite diverse, we have split it into two separate categories this time. Based on the results it is clear that when using WebAssembly, it is mostly in the context of browsers (23%) rather than other use-cases (7%).</p><p>We cannot of course forget the favourite topic of many programmers: which IDE (developer environment) they use. Although Visual Studio Code still remains the most popular option, its share has dropped by 5pp this year. On the other hand, the Zed editor seems to have gained considerable traction recently. The small percentage of those who selected \"Other\" are using a wide range of different tools: from CursorAI to classics like Kate or Notepad++. Special mention to the 3 people using \"ed\", that's quite an achievement.</p><blockquote><p>You can also take a look at the linked <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2025-02-13-rust-survey-2024/what-ide-do-you-use-wordcloud.png\">wordcloud</a> that summarizes open answers to this question (the \"Other\" category), to see what other editors are also popular.</p></blockquote><p>We were excited to see that more and more people use Rust at work for the majority of their coding, 38% vs 34% from last year. There is a clear upward trend in this metric over the past few years.</p><p>The usage of Rust within companies also seems to be rising, as 45% of respondents answered that their organisation makes non-trivial use of Rust, which is a 7pp increase from 2023.</p><p>Once again, the top reason employers of our survey respondents invested in Rust was the ability to build relatively correct and bug-free software. The second most popular reason was Rust’s performance characteristics. 21% of respondents that use Rust at work do so because they already know it, and it's thus their default choice, an uptick of 5pp from 2023. This seems to suggest that Rust is becoming one of the baseline languages of choice for more and more companies.</p><p>Similarly to the previous year, a large percentage of respondents (82%) report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals. In general, it seems that programmers and companies are quite happy with their usage of Rust, which is great!</p><p>In terms of technology domains, the situation is quite similar to the previous year. Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends, web and networking services and cloud technologies. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use-cases.</p><blockquote><p>You can scroll the chart to the right to see more domains. Note that the Automotive domain was not offered as a closed answer in the 2023 survey (it was merely entered through open answers), which might explain the large jump.</p></blockquote><p>It is exciting to see the continued growth of professional Rust usage and the confidence so many users feel in its performance, control, security and safety, enjoyability, and more!</p><p>As always, one of the main goals of the State of Rust survey is to shed light on challenges, concerns, and priorities on Rustaceans’ minds over the past year.</p><p>We have asked our users about aspects of Rust that limit their productivity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, slow compilation was at the top of the list, as it seems to be a perennial concern of Rust users. As always, there are efforts underway to improve the speed of the compiler, such as enabling the <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc.html\">parallel frontend</a> or switching to a <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/17/enabling-rust-lld-on-linux.html\">faster linker by default</a>. We invite you to test these improvements and let us know if you encounter any issues.</p><p>Other challenges included subpar support for debugging Rust and high disk usage of Rust compiler artifacts. On the other hand, most Rust users seem to be very happy with its runtime performance, the correctness and stability of the compiler and also Rust's documentation.</p><p>In terms of specific unstable (or missing) features that Rust users want to be stabilized (or implemented), the most desired ones were async closures and if/let while chains. Well, we have good news! Async closures will be stabilized in the next version of Rust (1.85), and if/let while chains will hopefully follow <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/132833\">soon after</a>, once Edition 2024 is released (which will also happen in Rust 1.85).</p><p>Other coveted features are generators (both sync and async) and more powerful generic const expressions. You can follow the <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h1/goals.html\">Rust Project Goals</a> to track the progress of these (and other) features.</p><p>In the open answers to this question, people were really helpful and tried hard to describe the most notable issues limiting their productivity. We have seen mentions of struggles with async programming (an all-time favourite), debuggability of errors (which people generally love, but they are not perfect for everyone) or Rust tooling being slow or resource intensive (rust-analyzer and rustfmt). Some users also want a better IDE story and improved interoperability with other languages.</p><p>This year, we have also included a new question about the speed of Rust's evolution. While most people seem to be content with the status quo, more than a quarter of people who responded to this question would like Rust to stabilize and/or add features more quickly, and only 7% of respondents would prefer Rust to slow down or completely stop adding new features.</p><p>Interestingly, when we asked respondents about their main worries for the future of Rust, one of the top answers remained the worry that Rust will become too complex. This seems to be in contrast with the answers to the previous question. Perhaps Rust users still seem to consider the complexity of Rust to be manageable, but they worry that one day it might become too much.</p><p>We are happy to see that the amount of respondents concerned about Rust Project governance and lacking support of the Rust Foundation has dropped by about 6pp from 2023.</p><p>Each year, the results of the State of Rust survey help reveal the areas that need improvement in many areas across the Rust Project and ecosystem, as well as the aspects that are working well for our community.</p><p>If you have any suggestions for the Rust Annual survey, please <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues\">let us know</a>!</p><p>We are immensely grateful to those who participated in the 2024 State of Rust Survey and facilitated its creation.

Since then, we have made a lot of progress and shipped a few new features. In this blog post, we want to give you an update on the latest changes that we have made to crates.io.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3660-crates-io-crate-deletions.html\">RFC #3660</a> we proposed a new feature that allows crate owners to delete their crates from crates.io under certain conditions. This can be useful if you have published a crate by mistake or if you want to remove a crate that is no longer maintained. After the RFC was accepted by all team members at the end of August, we began implementing the feature.</p><p>We created a new API endpoint <code>DELETE /api/v1/crates/:name</code> that allows crate owners to delete their crates and then created the corresponding user interface. If you are the owner of a crate, you can now go to the crate page, open the \"Settings\" tab, and find the \"Delete this crate\" button at the bottom. Clicking this button will lead you to a confirmation page telling you about the potential impact of the deletion and requirements that need to be met in order to delete the crate:</p><p>As you can see from the screenshot above, a crate can only be deleted if either: the crate has been published for less than 72 hours or the crate only has a single owner, and the crate has been downloaded less than 500 times for each month it has been published, and the crate is not depended upon by any other crate on crates.io.</p><p>These requirements were put in place to prevent abuse of the deletion feature and to ensure that crates that are widely used by the community are not deleted accidentally. If you have any feedback on this feature, please let us know!</p><p>Around the holiday season we started experimenting with generating an <a href=\"https://www.openapis.org/\">OpenAPI</a> description for the crates.io API. This was a long-standing request from the community, and we are happy to announce that we now have an experimental OpenAPI description available at <a href=\"https://crates.io/api/openapi.json\">https://crates.io/api/openapi.json</a>!</p><p>Please note that this is still considered work-in-progress and e.g. the stability guarantees for the endpoints are not written down and the response schemas are also not fully documented yet.</p><p>You can view the OpenAPI description in e.g. a Swagger UI at <a href=\"https://petstore.swagger.io/\">https://petstore.swagger.io/</a> by putting <code>https://crates.io/api/openapi.json</code> in the top input field. We decided to not ship a viewer ourselves for now due to security concerns with running it on the same domain as crates.io itself. We may reconsider whether to offer it on a dedicated subdomain in the future if there is enough interest.</p><p>The OpenAPI description is generated by the <a href=\"https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa\">utoipa</a> crate, which is a tool that can be integrated with the <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum\">axum</a> web framework to automatically generate OpenAPI descriptions for all of your endpoints. We would like to thank <a href=\"https://github.com/juhaku\">Juha Kukkonen</a> for his great work on this tool!</p><h2><a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/05/crates-io-development-update.html#support-form-and-report-crate-button\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Support form and \"Report Crate\" button</h2><p>Since the crates.io team is small and mostly consists of volunteers, we do not have the capacity to manually monitor all publishes. Instead, we rely on you, the Rust community, to help us catch malicious crates and users. To make it easier for you to report suspicious crates, we added a \"Report Crate\" button to all the crate pages. If you come across a crate that you think is malicious or violates the <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct\">code of conduct</a> or our <a href=\"https://crates.io/policies\">usage policy</a>, you can now click the \"Report Crate\" button and fill out the form that appears. This will send an email to the crates.io team, who will then review the crate and take appropriate action if necessary. Thank you to crates.io team member <a href=\"https://github.com/eth3lbert\">@eth3lbert</a> who worked on the majority of this.</p><p>If you have any issues with the support form or the \"Report Crate\" button, please let us know. You can also always email us directly at <a href=\"mailto:help@crates.io\">help@crates.io</a> if you prefer not to use the form.</p><p>We have added a new feature that allows you to receive email notifications when a new version of your crate is published. This can be useful in detecting unauthorized publishes of your crate or simply to keep track of publishes from other members of your team.</p><p>This feature was another <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/815\">long-standing feature request</a> from our community, and we were happy to finally implement it. If you'd prefer not to receive publish notifications, then you can go to your account settings on crates.io and disable these notifications.</p><p>These were some of the more visible changes to crates.io over the past couple of months, but a lot has happened \"under the hood\" as well.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3691-trusted-publishing-cratesio.html\">RFC #3691</a> was opened and accepted to implement \"Trusted Publishing\" support on crates.io, similar to other ecosystems that adopted it. This will allow you to specify on crates.io which repository/system is allowed to publish new releases of your crate, allowing you to publish crates from CI systems without having to deal with API tokens anymore.</p></li><li><p>Slightly related to the above: API tokens created on crates.io now expire after 90 days by default. It is still possible to disable the expiry or choose other expiry durations though.</p></li><li><p>The crates.io team was one of the first projects to use the <a href=\"https://diesel.rs/\">diesel</a> database access library, but since that only supported synchronous execution it was sometimes a little awkward to use in our codebase, which was increasingly moving into an async direction after our migration to <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum\">axum</a> a while ago. The maintainer of diesel, <a href=\"https://github.com/weiznich\">Georg Semmler</a>, did a lot of work to make it possible to use diesel in an async way, resulting in the <a href=\"https://github.com/weiznich/diesel_async\">diesel-async</a> library. Over the past couple of months we incrementally ported crates.io over to  queries, which now allows us to take advantage of the internal query pipelining in  that resulted in some of our API endpoints getting a 10-15% performance boost. Thank you, Georg, for your work on these crates!</p></li><li><p>Whenever you publish a new version or yank/unyank existing versions a couple of things need to be updated. Our internal database is immediately updated, and then we synchronize the sparse and git index in background worker jobs. Previously, yanking and unyanking a high number of versions would each queue up another synchronization background job. We have now implemented automatic deduplication of redundant background jobs, making our background worker a bit more efficient.</p></li><li><p>The final big, internal change that was just merged last week is related to the testing of our frontend code. In the past we used a tool called <a href=\"https://miragejs.com/\">Mirage</a> to implement a mock version of our API, which allowed us to run our frontend test suite without having to spin up a full backend server. Unfortunately, the maintenance situation around Mirage had lately forced us to look into alternatives, and we are happy to report that we have now fully migrated to the \"Industry standard API mocking\" package <a href=\"https://mswjs.io/\">msw</a>. If you want to know more, you can find the details in the \"small\" <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/10393\">migration pull request</a>.</p></li></ul><p>We hope you enjoyed this update on the development of crates.io.

My main focus is on common patterns among people using Vello’s <a href=\"https://docs.rs/vello/latest/vello/struct.Scene.html\"></a> API; most of this is going to be pretty dry.</p><p>I’ve mostly noticed two types of projects with Vello as a direct dependency:</p><ul><li> bridging Vello with some other format or framework, or providing wrapper functions for Vello’s API. Ex: , , etc.</li><li> that renders specific things with Vello.</li></ul><p>(Though in practice, a few blurred the lines, and a lot of projects that I put in one category or the other mostly ended up using Vello for example code or for very basic painting.)</p><p>The numbers (18 engine projects, 13 app-like projects) aren’t too surprising if you’re familiar with the “Rust has 50 game engines and 3 games” stereotype. They also match my “gut feeling” reading the code, where it feels like a lot more projects use Vello in a very systematized way, as some kind of middleware or optional backend than as a plug-and-play dependency to paint a bunch of shapes.</p><p>For instance, I saw almost no project calling the  function more than five times.</p><p>This is confounded by the fact that I only looked for direct dependents of Vello; I might have found more app projects looking for dependents of Masonry or bevy_vello. Maybe the painting-privitive-heavy code is in the dependents of one of those engine code projects I cited.</p><p>Graphite, for example, is a primitive-heavy 2D editor, but its use of Vello is bottlenecked through a middleware layer with its own internal representation.</p><p>In general, though, my impression is that the stereotype is mostly true.</p><p>Another interesting pattern is that code actually using Vello to paint things was often in amateur stub projects, which is good for our purposes: it tells us how people who have little experience with Vello end up using it.</p><h3>Fill and stroke arguments</h3><p> and  are the most used methods by a very wide margin.</p><p>As a reminder, their prototype is:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>A lot code calling them looks like this:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Note the heavy usage of default values:</p><ul><li> is the default fill setting for most paint APIs.</li><li> creates a stroke with rount joins and caps, no dashes, and the given width.</li><li> is set to  for both methods.</li><li> is set to  for both methods.</li></ul><p>These patterns can be found throughout the projects I’ve linked.
