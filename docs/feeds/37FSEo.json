I'm genuinely surprised to be even more optimistic now than before. The coding part was much easier than I imagined, thanks to the use of reference counting in the kernel.</p><p>And the promised benefits of Rust over C? They're absolutely real. The Rust version of the driver feels way more robust than the C code, not just regarding memory safety. It didn't have a single bug: Once it compiled, it worked. That's not a huge deal considering it was a direct rewrite, but it counts for something.</p></blockquote><p>Despite a lamentable lack of suggestions, llogiq is reasonably pleased with his choice.</p>","contentLength":2652,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Industries Adopting Rust","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRgtK2DsEXM","date":1751379309,"author":"Let's Get Rusty","guid":178971,"unread":true,"content":"<article>If you love coding in Rust but arenâ€™t sure how to turn that passion into a full-time career, this video is for you.
