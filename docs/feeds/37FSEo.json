The way this is accomplished is by using <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/generativity\">generativity</a> to create unique invariant lifetimes so that borrows to TLS can't be coerced to a `&amp;'static` lifetime and by configuring the runtime with a barrier to rendezvous worker threads during shutdown. This shutdown barrier makes it such that runtime tasks never outlive TLS data owned by worker threads; this makes every invariant lifetime guaranteed to be valid until no tasks remain. Blocking threads managed by the Tokio runtime cannot outlive worker threads with this configuration, and so pointers to TLS from worker threads can be safely moved to these blocking threads with the lifetime constrained. As the lifetimes cannot be coerced into `&amp;'static`, moving onto other threads is prevented. This crate downgrades to using `Arc` whenever the `barrier-protected-runtime` feature is not enabled, making it the end users choice to opt into this optimization by using async_local to configure the runtime shutdown barrier. </p>","contentLength":1145,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ring is unmaintained","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0007.html","date":1740185098,"author":"/u/technobicheiro","guid":8934,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This advisory has been withdrawn and should be ignored.

What do I even mean with \"semantic paragraphs?\"</p><p>Let me explain. Up until now, Typst considered  piece of text you wrote as a paragraph — be it a single word in a page header, a figure caption, or a page number. Just like paragraphs, these things can have spacing, break across lines, etc. Layout-wise they are not all that different from paragraphs.</p><p>However, there  semantical differences. Only proper paragraphs should be counted when paragraphs are numbered (such as in legal texts). Only proper paragraphs should be announced by a screen reader as such. And even layout-wise there are differences; for instance, that only proper paragraphs should have first-line indent. While the layout routines for \"just text\" and a paragraph may be very similar, the second order effects of something being a proper paragraph are far-reaching.</p><p>In version 0.13, Typst finally gains a better understanding of this distinction. Whether something is a paragraph or just text is decided based on a few simple rules about which you can read in the <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/par/#what-becomes-a-paragraph\">updated paragraph documentation</a>.</p><p>The most visible immediate effect of this work is that <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-first-line-indent\"></a> can now be applied to all paragraphs instead of just consecutive ones, closing the most upvoted Typst bug. Semantic paragraphs are also crucial for the in-development HTML export and for planned future work on PDF accessibility.</p><p>If you've created a table of contents with Typst's <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/outline/\" title=\"outline\">outline</a> functionality before, you might remember that it always looked a bit bland. The default style had no indentation and rather tightly dotted leaders (leaders are the filler dots between a title and its page number).</p><p>In Typst 0.13, the outline gets a full facelift while also becoming easier to customize. The new automatic indentation nicely aligns all titles and numberings across the whole outline, long titles have better-looking wrapping behavior, and we fixed a number of bugs.</p><p>Since Typst 0.2, you could draw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve\">Bézier paths</a> with the  function. However, the input format of this function was rather arcane. Rather than specifying pen movements as in an SVG, you had to specify directly points with their two control points. Moreover, the path function had a fatal flaw: You could not close a path and then keep on drawing. This is necessary to draw a shape with cutouts, as depicated below.</p><p>The new <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/curve/\" title=\"`curve`\"></a> function fixes these flaws. It provides an easier-to-understand and more expressive interface. We also used this opportunity to change the name from  to  as we plan to repurpose the name  for a file path type in an upcoming release.</p><p>Various functions in Typst load files, be it <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/\">images</a>, <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-loading/\">data loading functions</a>, or <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/\">plugins</a>. Sometimes though, a little extra flexibility is needed, for example, to preprocess, generate, or inline data into a Typst document.</p><p>For this reason, there are also  variants on various of the functions, e.g.  or . However, that approach didn't work so well when a path is expected in a set rule, as in <code>theme</code>. It also introduced duplication: All the properties of an image are also spelled out again in .</p><p>Typst 0.13 revamps file handling to improve this unsatisfactory situation. All places where a path is expected now also support raw <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/\" title=\"bytes\">bytes</a> instead. Typst will always interpret a string as a path and raw bytes as data. When trying to decode an image from a string, thus make sure to first convert it to bytes. Converting to bytes is cheap as Typst will internally reuse the memory from the string. It will even remember that the bytes came from a string to make conversions back to a string cheap as well!</p><p>The existing  functions are now deprecated as they are not needed anymore. The  variants of data loading functions remain unchanged.</p><p>With the new byte-taking  function (and previously ), you can generate images at runtime. However, the image function expects images in an encoded image exchange format like PNG or JPEG. Producing valid bytes for such a format in pure Typst code is prohibitively complicated. Meanwhile, plugins are unnecessarily bloated and slowed down if they have to include an image encoder.</p><p>To streamline image generation workflows, Typst 0.13 thus brings support for loading images from uncompressed raw pixel data. To that end, the <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-format\"></a> parameter of the image function supports a new form, where the channel encoding and pixel width/height of the image can be specified. This feature is crucial for better scientific visualizations — think things like heatmaps.</p><p>In version 0.8, Typst gained support for WebAssembly plugins — one of the features that would very likely still be a little blue \"feature request\" label if not for our fabulous open source community. Since then, plugins have become the backbone of various community packages. They're great because they bring the power and package ecosystem of all the languages that compile to WebAssembly right into Typst.</p><p>They are also faster to execute than Typst code. Still, with heavy usage the time spent executing plugin code can make up a significant chunk of compile time. A simple way to improve this would've been to switch to a faster WebAssembly runtime (specifically, from  to ). However, taking on a dependency on a WebAssembly runtime with just-in-time compilation wasn't a spot we wanted to put Typst into. It would have reduced portability and security and increased the amount of third-party code Typst depends on by a lot.</p><p>There was another way to speed up plugins: Since 0.12, Typst's layout engine is multi-threaded. Plugins didn't profit from this though as they couldn't be easily replicated across threads. This is a limitation we're lifting with 0.13. Typst will now automatically run plugins in multiple threads without any changes from plugin authors. This is possible because we require (and also already required in the past) plugin functions to be  This means that we can execute plugin functions out of order without a visible effect. For cases where purity is too limiting, Typst 0.13 introduces the new <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/#definitions-transition\"> API</a>, which lets plugin authors deal with stateful operations in a sound way.</p><p>The work on speeding up plugins was prioritized through a Typst open-source support contract.

It's one of the <a href=\"https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/274\">longest-standing bugs</a>, which is curious because it  so easy to fix. Unfortunately, it was not. To see why, we need to take a look behind the scenes and understand how Typst views your equations.</p><p>In Typst 0.12 and lower, the  in  is a <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/\" title=\"text\">text</a> element like any other text in your document. A string like  is converted to content by becoming such a text element, too. While different syntactically,  and  thus used to yield identical content. Since  becomes italic by default,  did, too.</p><p>Changing that by itself wouldn't have been too hard, but there is a third guest to the party: Symbols. The  in  is a <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/\">symbol value</a>. Like strings, symbols were up until now converted to content by becoming text elements. This means they work both in math and normal text (as ).</p><p>For a long time, the issue was thus blocked on finding a general solution to the text element ambiguity — <a href=\"https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1125\">perhaps introducing a new  element for math-y text</a>. That story isn't fully written yet, but for 0.13 we really wanted to fix the issue at hand. For this reason, we attempted to find a minimal solution that fixes the issue while leaving our options for further improvements open.</p><p>The solution we came up with: Bare letters and symbols are now converted into an internal  which has auto-italics in math, but is transparently converted to normal text outside of math. Meanwhile, strings still generate text elements. With the <a href=\"https://laurmaedje.github.io/posts/types-and-context/\">planned unification of types and elements</a>, this symbol element and the existing symbol type will naturally merge into one.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/wrzian\">@wrzian</a> for working on this!</p><p>When text in different writing scripts is mixed, it's often important to have precise control over which text is typeset with which font. For example, Latin and Chinese text are almost always typeset with different fonts.</p><p>This is quite problematic for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) Typst users which often have text that mix their native language and English. Typst 0.13 takes a first step to improve this situation. With the new <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font\"></a> functionality, users can specify precisely for which character ranges a font should be used. This can, for example, be used to define in which font punctuation (which is present in both Latin and CJK fonts) is rendered.</p><p>The  feature supports specifying a character set, either as a <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/regex/\">regular expression</a> or one of the built-in ones. Currently, the only built-in set is , which should be specified for a Latin font that is  a CJK font in the fallback list. In the example below, we can put  first in the fallback chain while still having quotes render with </p><p>With Typst 0.13's new  function, you can attach arbitrary text or binary files to your PDF. These embedded files can then be browsed in PDF viewers or extracted programmatically by third-party tools.</p><p>When is this useful? One example, electronic invoicing, is ever more important as new EU legislation just came into force. While electronic invoices are typically in XML-based formats, it's often useful to still have a human-readable and printable invoice.</p><p>With PDF file embedding, the XML invoice data can be inserted into the PDF itself, forming a hybrid invoice. Currently, there is still one missing piece in Typst's support for this: The PDF metadata must identify the document as an E-Invoice to other applications. We plan to add support for embedding arbitrary metadata like this in a future Typst release.</p><h2>A first look at HTML export</h2><p>Saved for last is a particularly exciting topic: We've been starting work on <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/html/\">HTML export</a>! The feature is still very incomplete and only available for experimentation behind a feature flag, but there's already some stuff to see.</p><p>Most of the markup and some of the other built-in functions like  and  already produce the appropriate HTML. Our focus is on producing semantically rich HTML that retains the structure of the input document. The HTML output should be accessible, human-readable, and editable by hand.</p><pre><code>\nA  with some  A list\n with elements\n\nA bit of text\n  captionMy caption</code></pre><p>will produce the following HTML output:</p><pre></pre><p>Typst cannot always produce the perfect HTML automatically. Instead, it gives you full control by letting you generate raw HTML elements:</p><pre><code>\n  attrsstyle\n  A div with  inside!\n</code></pre><pre></pre><p>To make your document portable across PDF and HTML, we're also introducing a <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/target/\" title=\"`target`\"></a> function that returns the current export format (either  or ). It is mainly intended for use in show rules, like below:</p><pre></pre><p>The  function is contextual because the export target can vary within one compilation. How? With the <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/html/frame/\" title=\"`html.frame`\"></a> function, you can lay out part of your HTML document as an inline SVG, using Typst's normal layout engine. Within such a frame, the compilation target is  again, so that show rules produce the appropriate layout elements instead of HTML elements.</p><p>A lot! For instance, currently, Typst will always output a single HTML file. Support for outputting directories with multiple HTML documents and assets, as well as support for outputting fragments that can be integrated into other HTML documents is planned.</p><p>Typst currently also doesn't output any CSS, instead focusing fully on emitting semantic markup. You can of course write your own CSS styles and still benefit from sharing your content between PDF and HTML.</p><p>In the future, we plan to give you the option of automatically emitting CSS, taking more of your existing set rules into account. More generally, we have a lot of plans for HTML export! Visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5512\">tracking issue</a> to learn more about them.</p><p>In the CLI, you can experiment with HTML export by passing  or setting the  environment variable to . In the web app, HTML export is not yet available. It will become available once we think it's ready for general use.</p><p>You can also use HTML export with . Typst will then automatically spin up a live-reloading HTTP server that serves your document.</p><pre></pre><p>Work on Typst's HTML export is sponsored by <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Typst-HTML/\">NLNet</a>. We are very grateful for their support! We also want to thank external contributor <a href=\"https://github.com/01mf02\">@01mf02</a> with whom we've thus far collaborated on HTML export through the NLNet grant. Unfortunately, we and him have since parted ways over technical differences. Nonetheless, we plan to increase the time and resources we put into HTML export, and we are very happy to have NLNet's continued support in this endeavor.</p><p>Typst 0.13 ships with a number of deprecations and breaking changes. The <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/changelog/0.13.0/\">changelog</a> has a full account of all changes, but in this section you'll learn how to deal with the most common kinds of breakage.</p><p>In Typst 0.8, <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/type/\">types</a> were promoted to proper values. As a result,  directly returns a type instead of a string since then. To make this change less disruptive, we also introduced a temporary compatibility behavior where types could be used like strings in some contexts (e.g.,  would be true). For implementation reasons, we did not add a warning for this at the time. We're rectifying this now and adding a warning to shake out remaining reliance on this behavior. With Typst 0.14, the compatibility behavior will be fully removed.</p><pre><code> int </code></pre><p>The  function and the  variants of data loading functions are now deprecated.

If you get the error \"unexpected argument: fill\", adjust your code as shown below:</p><pre><code> outlinefillfill</code></pre><p>Because the  property is now on the entry, it can also be configured for individual outline levels, like this:</p><pre><code> outlineentrylevel outlinefill</code></pre><p>In light of the changes to paragraphs, outline entries now show themselves as <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/\">blocks</a> instead of lines of text. This means spacing is now configured via normal show-set rules for <a href=\"https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-spacing\" title=\"`block.spacing`\"></a>.</p><pre><code> outlineentrylevelbelow outline it \n  it\n   weak</code></pre><p>In Typst 0.12 and below, outline entries expose a few fields like  and  that are useful for writing an outline entry show rule.

At some point you need to write code, without any abstraction, directly for the hardware. Assembly is just that.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Allowing C++ in the kernel\n</h2><p>I believe Linus was right to reject C++ for the following reaons:</p><ol><li>C++ is a gigantic language, allowing it would create an endless discussion on which of its features would be allowed/forbidden,</li><li>being a loose superset of C it has the same archaic syntax, thus little improvement to the developer experience, and</li><li>no matter how many features would be allowed C++ does not improve enough on C to offset the cost of porting it.</li></ol><p>In recent year one thing became clear: C is no longer the best tool for the job. It's still the best understood tool, especially by the current team. It's what 98% of the Linux kernel is written in today. But the \"unchallenged best\" status it used to have for so many years in pragmatic kernel development is shaky.</p><p>Better languages have come up, specifically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_(programming_language)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zig</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rust</a>.</p><p>There has been a lot of discussion on allowing Rust in the kernel. But since the main honchos, Linus and Greg Kroah-Hartman, have put their weight behind it, it is clear that Rust will find it's way into the project. We still have to wait and see how much of the project will be written in Rust.</p><p>Unlike C++, Rust has lots of features that are very useful in kernel development, and very few features that would need to be forbidden. Especially features related to memory safety, which constitute a <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/2025021954-flaccid-pucker-f7d9@gregkh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">large part of the bugs in Linux</a>. Compared to C, Rust provides much a improved developer experience, which is not weird considering Rust is 40 younger.</p><p>Rust's main downside is: slower compile times. Compile times matter very much, but so does safety. While this is a hard trade-off, the decision seems to be final: Rust is to stay in the Linux kernel.</p><p>I expect Zig will come from another angle. The Zig compiler compiles C as well as Zig code. It's just a matter of time before the Zig compiler will be able to compile the Linux kernel. Once this is achieved, C-files can be ported to Zig one-by-one. I expect LLMs will help a great deal with the initial port of the Linux kernel's C code to Zig. Once in Zig, the code can be optimized by humans.</p><p>Zig is very similar to C. This makes the initial port rather straight forward. LLMs will perform much better on C-to-Zig than on C-to-Rust. </p><p>Compared to C, Zig brings serious improvements in the developer experience at similar-to-C compile times. Features like  are really cool and may allow the kernel project to do away with lots of crufty old C preprocessor macros on the one side, while allowing for interesting optimizations on the other.</p><p>I expect we will have a Linux kernel in Zig, Rust and Assembly in 10 years. It may be a fork. It may be the Linux mainline: it all depends on the open-mindedness of the main devs.</p><p>So far they seem up for it!</p>","contentLength":3140,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rust Integration in Linux Kernel Faces Challenges but Shows Progress","url":"https://thenewstack.io/rust-integration-in-linux-kernel-faces-challenges-but-shows-progress/","date":1739986010,"author":"/u/CrankyBear","guid":6023,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When Miguel Ojeda, overseer of the <a href=\"https://rust-for-linux.com/\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">Rust for Linux</a> project, asked Hellwig to suggest an alternative, he replied that Rust developers should “<a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250108151858.GB24499@lst.de/\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">Keep the wrappers in your code</a> instead of making life painful for others.” Getting to the heart of the matter, in another Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) note, Hellwig wrote, “<a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250110083955.GA5395@lst.de/\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">Maintaining multi-language projects is a pain</a> I have no interest in dealing with. If you want to use something that’s not C, be that assembly or Rust, you write to C interfaces and deal with the impedance mismatch yourself.”</p><h2>Is Rust Harder for Maintainers?</h2><p>That doesn’t work for Hellwig, either. He replied, “I also do not want another maintainer.&nbsp; If you want to make Linux impossible to maintain due to a cross-language codebase, do that in your driver so that you have to do it instead of spreading this cancer to core subsystems.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">“Cancer</a>,” thanks to Steve Ballmer’s criticism of Linux, has always been a red-letter term in <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/learning-linux-start-here/\">Linux circles</a>. A lot of heated words followed. I think senior Linux kernel developer Ted T’so, though, hit the nail on the head when he said that, Ultimately, <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250208204416.GL1130956@mit.edu/\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">Cristoph’s concern is that Rust is going to make life harder for maintainers </a>because of particular build breaks getting in the way of the very limited bandwidth that Maintainers have. In short, it’s not so much that kernel maintainers think Rust is awful; they don’t have enough hours in the day to maintain their projects.</p><h2>‘Rust Device Driver Mess’</h2><p>Be that as it may, one maintainer, <a href=\"https://asahilinux.org/\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">Asahi Linux</a> lead developer Hector Martin, called on Torvalds to “pipe up with an authoritative answer” to resolve the Rust device driver mess. “If he doesn’t, Miguel and the other Rust folks should just merge this series once it is reviewed and ready, ignoring Christoph’s overt attempt at sabotaging the project.” When that didn’t work, Martin took to&nbsp; “shaming on social media” to carry his point. Torvalds was not amused.</p><p>Torvalds replied, “How about you accept the fact that maybe the problem is you? You think you know better. But the current process works. It has problems, but problems are a fact of life.&nbsp; There is no perfect.” That said, Torvalds continued, “If we have issues in the kernel development model, then <a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/2/6/1292\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">social media sure as hell isn’t the solution</a>. The same way, it sure as hell wasn’t the solution to politics.”</p><h2>Lessons From Real-Time Linux</h2><p>So, what can be done moving forward with Rust and Linux? Senior real-time Linux developer Steven Rostedt suggested the Rust developers might follow in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">real-time Linux, which took twenty years to join the mainline Linux kernel</a>; that was to “<a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/2/7/1955\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">keep [Rust as]&nbsp; an out of tree patch</a>. … Yes, being out of tree is very difficult because you have to constantly rebase … But it also gives you full flexibility to try new approaches. Just because something is out of tree doesn’t mean it can’t be published and used. Red Hat and SUSE, as well as many others, shipped PREEMPT_RT while it was out of tree.”</p><p>Since then, Ojeda published a “<a href=\"https://rust-for-linux.com/rust-kernel-policy\" rel=\"external \" onclick=\"this.target='_blank';\">Rust kernel policy</a>” document to clarify the status of Rust integration efforts. This move came in response to growing confusion and debate within the Linux community regarding the role of Rust in kernel development.</p><p>This document addresses several crucial points, including kernel maintainers’ expected level of support. Ojeda noted that it continues to be up to each maintainer to decide how to deal with Rust. “Some subsystems may decide they do not want to have Rust code for the time being, typically for bandwidth reasons. This is fine and expected.” So, while some developers want Rust to move much more quickly into the kernel, Hellwig’s position is perfectly defendable.</p><p>Indeed, Ojeda continued, “For Rust, a subsystem may allow to temporarily break Rust code. The intention is to facilitate the friendly adoption of Rust in a subsystem without introducing a burden to existing maintainers who may be working on urgent fixes for the C side. The breakage should nevertheless be fixed as soon as possible, ideally before the breakage reaches Linus.”</p><h2>Rust Integration With Linux</h2><p>When it comes to Rust’s integration with Linux, unlike the tech mantra of “move fast and break things,” the rule is to “move slow and stabilize things.” After all, despite all the harsh words, Rust’s integration into Linux continued to move forward.</p><p>Next merge window, hopefully, we will have PCI and platform drivers working, which will fully enable almost all driver subsystems to start accepting (or at least getting) rust drivers.&nbsp; This is the end result of a lot of work from a lot of people, congrats to all of them for getting this far, you’ve proved many of us wrong in the best way possible, working code.”</p><p>In short, for all the war of words, Rust’s movement into Linux continues to be slow, steady, and productive, as we can see in 6.13.

We'll serve the application in the form of a command-line tool.</p><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The process typically involves two main components: retrieving relevant knowledge from a pre-existing database or knowledge base and generating contextually accurate answers based on that information. When a question or query is posed, the model first retrieves relevant snippets or pieces of information from the knowledge base. It then augments its generative model with this newly acquired knowledge, enabling it to provide a more accurate, informed response.</p><p>In contrast to traditional LLMs that rely purely on their trained parameters, RAG systems dynamically incorporate external data, ensuring that responses are grounded in factual and up-to-date knowledge. When a question is asked, the relevant knowledge from a pre-existing dataset is retrieved and fed into the model. The LLM then generates an answer that combines the retrieved information and its generative abilities, aiming to offer a detailed and accurate response. This hybrid approach allows RAG models to provide answers that are not only linguistically fluent but also well-supported by factual data.</p><p>Next, you'll need to create a new project using :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Before we start, let's add the relevant dependencies which we need:</p><div><pre><code>cargo add serde rig-core tokio csv \nserde/derive,tokio/macros,tokio/rt-multi-thread\n</code></pre></div><p>This adds the following dependencies:</p><ul><li> - The rig library.</li><li> - an asynchronous Rust runtime. We additionally add the  and  feature as we want to use the macro.</li><li> - The Rust crate for using CSVs.</li></ul><p>Before we do anything else, we'll need to declare our struct type as well as derive the correct macros for it. Note that the embedding trait for Rig also depends on  (which also depends on ), hence the derivation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next to be able to use Rig's embeddings API, we need to implement the  trait. This trait simply defines a method for what to embed. Because we don't have a singular field we want to embed and will need the whole record, we can simply just implement  for the struct then format the whole struct into a string (which we can then embed).</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Thankfully, embedding our CSV is actually quite easy now that we've done the hard part. We can create an OpenAI client and get the embedding model, then iterate through each record and build an embedding from it and store it in Rig's in-memory vector store.</p><p>You can see below the code to generate an OpenAI client is fairly simple:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We'll also keep the code for loading the CSV in as a separate function as it's relatively long.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The next step will be to actually take input from the user and prompt the LLM using not only the prompt, but additional (relevant!) snippets from the vector store. </p><p>We'll start by taking some input from standard input (i.e., you load up the application in the terminal, then you type in something and press Enter). We then check if the prompt is equal to  - if it is then immediately break the loop and close the application, if not, carry on and retrieve a response from the LLM.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In terms of storing your conversation history, it is actually quite simple to do so. All you need to do is to create a  and then feed it into the agent, using the  function instead of . You then add a user message and assistant message (in that order) at the end of the loop iteration. This allows you to build up a conversation with the LLM.</p><p>Additionally, we'll also add a  command which allows the entire conversation to be wiped should the user want to ask the LLM about something else.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now that we've set up a base for your command-line tool, here are a few ways you can extend this demo to do much more than just simple ragging:</p><ul><li>What about semantic routing to make sure your LLM stays on track?</li><li>Try incorporating CSV RAG into a new, bigger pipeline!</li></ul><p>Thanks for reading! Hopefully you will have a good example of how to improve how you work with data by creating a RAG pipeline from your CSV.</p>","contentLength":4278,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[media] My first project on rust after learning basics.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1it5kwi/media_my_first_project_on_rust_after_learning/","date":1739972036,"author":"/u/Independent_Row_6529","guid":5967,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi.
