Critical functions have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/musk-doge-takeover-usaid\">halted</a>, tens of thousands of federal staffers are being encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/federal-workers-accept-buyout-offers-be1c00fb\">resign</a>, and congressional mandates are being <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5124133-democrats-bill-treasury-system-musk/\">disregarded</a>. The next phase: The Department of Government Efficiency <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/technology/musk-allies-ai-government.html\">reportedly</a> wants to use AI to cut costs. According to , Musk’s group has started to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\">run sensitive data</a> from government systems through AI programs to analyze spending and determine what could be pruned. This may lead to the elimination of human jobs in favor of automation. As one government official who has been tracking Musk’s DOGE team told the, the ultimate aim is to use AI to replace “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/08/doge-musk-goals/\">the human workforce with machines</a>.” (Spokespeople for the White House and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>Using AI to make government more efficient is a worthy pursuit, and this is not a new idea. The Biden administration disclosed more than 2,000 <a href=\"https://github.com/ombegov/2024-Federal-AI-Use-Case-Inventory\">AI applications</a> in development across the federal government. For example, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/ai/use-case-inventory/fema\">FEMA</a> has started using AI to help perform damage assessment in disaster areas. The <a href=\"https://ai.cms.gov/assets/CMS_AI_Playbook.pdf\">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> has started using AI to look for fraudulent billing. The idea of replacing dedicated and principled civil servants with AI agents, however, new—and complicated.</p><p>The civil service—the massive cadre of employees who operate government agencies—plays a vital role in translating laws and policy into the operation of society. New presidents can issue sweeping executive orders, but they often have no real effect until they actually change the behavior of public servants. Whether you think of these people as essential and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2024/michael-lewis-conclusion-who-is-government/\">inspiring</a> do-gooders, boring bureaucratic functionaries, or as agents of a “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/11/deep-state-public-health-trump-kennedy/680621/\">deep state</a>,” their sheer number and continuity act as ballast that resists institutional change.</p><p>This is why Trump and Musk’s actions are so significant. The more AI decision making is integrated into government, the easier change will be. If human workers are widely replaced with AI, executives will have unilateral authority to instantaneously alter the behavior of the government, profoundly raising the stakes for transitions of power in democracy. Trump’s unprecedented purge of the civil service might be the last time a president needs to replace the human beings in government in order to dictate its new functions. Future leaders may do so at the press of a button.</p><p>To be clear, the use of AI by the executive branch doesn’t have to be disastrous. In theory, it could allow new leadership to swiftly implement the wishes of its electorate. But this could go very badly in the hands of an authoritarian leader. AI systems concentrate power at the top, so they could allow an executive to effectuate change over sprawling bureaucracies instantaneously. Firing and replacing tens of thousands of human bureaucrats is a huge undertaking. Swapping one AI out for another, or modifying the rules that those AIs operate by, would be much simpler.</p><p>Social-welfare programs, if automated with AI, could be redirected to systematically benefit one group and disadvantage another with a single prompt change. Immigration-enforcement agencies could prioritize people for investigation and detainment with one instruction. Regulatory-enforcement agencies that monitor corporate behavior for malfeasance could turn their attention to, or away from, any given company on a whim.</p><p>Even if Congress were motivated to fight back against Trump and Musk, or against a future president seeking to bulldoze the will of the legislature, the absolute power to command AI agents would make it easier to subvert legislative intent. AI <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/anatomy-of-an-ai-coup/\">has the power to diminish</a> representative politics. Written law is never fully determinative of the actions of government—there is always wiggle room for presidents, appointed leaders, and civil servants to exercise their own judgment. Whether intentional or not, whether charitably or not, each of these actors uses discretion. In human systems, that discretion is widely distributed across many individuals—people who, in the case of career civil servants, usually outlast presidencies.</p><p>Today, the AI ecosystem is dominated by a small number of corporations that decide how the most widely used AI models are designed, which data they are trained on, and which instructions they follow. Because their work is <a href=\"https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/paper.pdf\">largely secretive and unaccountable</a> to public interest, these tech companies are capable of making changes to the bias of AI systems—either generally or with aim at specific governmental use cases—that are invisible to the rest of us. And these private actors are both vulnerable to coercion by political leaders and self-interested in appealing to their favor. Musk himself created and funded xAI, now one of the world’s largest AI labs, with an <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-xs-anti-woke-grok-ai-chatbot-the-results-were-the-opposite-of-what-i-expected/\">explicitly ideological</a> mandate to generate anti-“woke” AI and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/llm-political-bias/\">steer</a> the wider AI industry in a similar direction.</p><p>But there’s a second way that AI’s transformation of government could go. AI development could happen inside of transparent and accountable public institutions, alongside its continued development by Big Tech. Applications of AI in democratic governments could be focused on benefitting public servants and the communities they serve by, for example, making it easier for non-English speakers to access government services, making ministerial tasks such as processing routine applications more efficient and reducing backlogs, or helping constituents weigh in on the policies deliberated by their representatives. Such AI integrations should be done gradually and carefully, with public oversight for their design and implementation and monitoring and guardrails to avoid unacceptable bias and harm.</p><p>Governments around the world are demonstrating how this could be done, though it’s early days. <a href=\"https://talktothecity.org\">Taiwan</a> has pioneered the use of AI models to facilitate deliberative democracy at an unprecedented scale. Singapore has been a leader in the development of <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-public-ai-can-strengthen-democracy/\">public AI</a> models, built <a href=\"https://sea-lion.ai\">transparently</a> and with <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/policy-centre/singapore/blog/pairing-ai-public-sector-impact-singapore\">public-service use cases</a> in mind. <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/algorithmic-impact-assessment.html\">Canada</a> has illustrated the role of disclosure and public input on the consideration of AI use cases in government. Even if you do not trust the current White House to follow any of these examples, U.S. states—which have much greater contact and influence over the daily lives of Americans than the federal government—could lead the way on this kind of responsible development and deployment of AI.</p><p>As the political theorist <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631496943\">David Runciman</a> has written, AI is just another in a long line of artificial “machines” used to govern how people live and act, not unlike corporations and states before it. AI doesn’t replace those older institutions, but it changes how they function. As the Trump administration forges stronger ties to Big Tech and AI developers, we need to recognize the potential of that partnership to steer the future of democratic governance—and act to make sure that it does not enable future authoritarians.</p><p><em>This essay was written with Nathan E.

It’s\nsomething that feels “obvious” to me since I’ve been using the terminal for a\nlong time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually\ncouldn’t find something that explained all of the steps – a lot of them just\nsaid “add this to ”, but what if you’re not using bash? What if your\nbash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure\nout which directory to add anyway?</p><p>So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some\nof the gotchas I’ve run into over the years.</p><p>Here’s a table of contents:</p><h3>step 1: what shell are you using?</h3><p>If you’re not sure what shell you’re using, here’s a way to find out. Run this:</p><ul><li>if you’re using , it’ll print out </li><li>if you’re using , it’ll print out </li><li>if you’re using , it’ll print out an error like “In fish, please use\n$fish_pid” ( isn’t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error\nmessage tells you that you’re using fish, which you probably already knew)</li></ul><p>Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of\n2024). I’ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.</p><h3>step 2: find your shell’s config file</h3><ul><li>in zsh, it’s probably </li><li>in bash, it might be , but it’s complicated, see the note in the next section</li><li>in fish, it’s probably <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> (you can run  if you want to be 100% sure)</li></ul><h3>a note on bash’s config file</h3><p>Bash has three possible config files: , , and .</p><p>If you’re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I’d recommend\ntesting this way:</p><ol><li>add  to your </li><li>If you see “hi there”, that means  is being used! Hooray!</li><li>Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with </li><li>You can also try  if the first two options don’t work.</li></ol><p>(there are a lot of elaborate flow charts out there that explain how bash\ndecides which config file to use but IMO it’s not worth it and just testing is\nthe fastest way to be sure)</p><h3>step 3: figure out which directory to add</h3><p>Let’s say that you’re trying to install and run a program called \nand it doesn’t work, like this:</p><pre><code>$ npm install -g http-server\n$ http-server\nbash: http-server: command not found\n</code></pre><p>How do you find what directory  is in? Honestly in general this is\nnot that easy – often the answer is something like “it depends on how npm is\nconfigured”. A few ideas:</p><ul><li>Often when setting up a new installer (like , , , etc),\nwhen you first set it up it’ll print out some directions about how to update\nyour PATH. So if you’re paying attention you can get the directions then.</li><li>Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell’s config file\nto update your  for you</li><li>Sometimes just Googling “where does npm install things?” will turn up the\nanswer</li><li>Some tools have a subcommand that tells you where they’re configured to\ninstall things, like:\n<ul><li>Node/npm:  (then append )</li><li>Go:  (then append )</li><li>asdf: <code>asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR</code> (then append  and )</li></ul></li></ul><h3>step 3.1: double check it’s the right directory</h3><p>Once you’ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it’s\nactually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine,  is\nin . I can make sure that it’s the right directory by trying to\nrun the program  in that directory like this:</p><pre><code>$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server\nStarting up http-server, serving ./public\n</code></pre><p>It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your ,\nlet’s move to the next step!</p><h3>step 4: edit your shell config</h3><p>Now we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:</p><ol><li>Which directory you’re trying to add to your PATH (like  )</li><li>Where your shell’s config is (like , , or <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>)</li></ol><p>Now what you need to add depends on your shell:</p><p>Open your shell’s config file, and add a line like this:</p><pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/\n</code></pre><p>(obviously replace  with the actual directory you’re trying to add)</p><p>You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier\nsyntax you can use if you prefer:</p><pre><code>path=(\n  $path\n  ~/.npm-global/bin\n)\n</code></pre><p>In fish, the syntax is different:</p><pre><code>set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin\n</code></pre><p>(in fish you can also use , some notes on that <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/13/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path/#a-note-on-fish-add-path\">further down</a>)</p><h3>step 5: restart your shell</h3><p>Now, an extremely important step: updating your shell’s config won’t take\neffect if you don’t restart it!</p><ol><li>open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don’t get confused</li><li>Run  to start a new shell (or  if you’re using zsh, or  if you’re using fish)</li></ol><p>I’ve found that both of these usually work fine.</p><p>And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and\nhopefully it works now.</p><p>If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:</p><h3>problem 1: it ran the wrong program</h3><p>If the wrong  of a is program running, you might need to add the\ndirectory to the  of your PATH instead of the end.</p><p>For example, on my system I have two versions of  installed, which I\ncan see by running :</p><pre><code>$ which -a python3\n/usr/bin/python3\n/opt/homebrew/bin/python3\n</code></pre><p>The one your shell will use is the .</p><p>If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory\n() to the  of your PATH instead, by putting this in\nyour shell’s config file (it’s  instead of the usual )</p><pre><code>export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH\n</code></pre><pre><code>set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH\n</code></pre><h3>problem 2: the program isn’t being run from your shell</h3><p>All of these directions only work if you’re running the program . If you’re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,\nor some other way, you’ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different\nway, and the exact details might depend on the situation.</p><ul><li>use the full path to the program you’re running, like <code>/home/bork/bin/my-program</code></li><li>put the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like\nPATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:….). You can get the full PATH you’re\nusing in your shell by running .</li></ul><p>I’m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven’t run into\nthat in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right\ndirection.</p><h3>problem 3: duplicate  entries making it harder to debug</h3><p>If you edit your path and start a new shell by running  (or , or\n), you’ll often end up with duplicate  entries, because the shell\nkeeps adding new things to your  every time you start your shell.</p><p>Personally I don’t think I’ve run into a situation where this kind of\nduplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug\nwhat’s going on with your  if you’re trying to understand its contents.</p><p>Some ways you could deal with this:</p><ol><li>If you’re debugging your , open a new terminal to do it in so you get\na “fresh” state. This should avoid the duplication.</li><li>Deduplicate your  at the end of your shell’s config  (for example in\nzsh apparently you can do this with )</li><li>Check that the directory isn’t already in your  when adding it (for\nexample in fish I believe you can do this with <code>fish_add_path --path /some/directory</code>)</li></ol><p>How to deduplicate your  is shell-specific and there isn’t always a\nbuilt in way to do it so you’ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your\nshell.</p><h3>problem 4: losing your history after updating your </h3><p>Here’s a situation that’s easy to get into in bash or zsh:</p><ol><li>Run  to reload your config</li><li>Press the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)</li><li>The failed command isn’t in your history! Why not?</li></ol><p>This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit\nthe shell.</p><p>Some options for fixing this:</p><ul><li>Instead of running  to reload your config, run  (or\n in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current\nsession.</li><li>Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving\nthe history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you’re\nusing bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I’m\nnot exactly sure what the best way is)</li></ul><p>When you install  (Rust’s installer) for the first time, it gives you\nthese instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don’t mention a specific\ndirectory at all.</p><pre><code>This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):\n\n. \"$HOME/.cargo/env\"        \t# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh\nsource \"$HOME/.cargo/env.fish\"  # For fish\n</code></pre><p>The idea is that you add that line to your shell’s config, and their script\nautomatically sets up your  (and potentially other things) for you.</p><p>This is pretty common (for example <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/deacfa6a6e62e5f4002baf9e1fac7a96e9aa5d41/install.sh#L1072-L1087\">Homebrew</a> suggests you eval ), and there are\ntwo ways to approach this:</p><ol><li>Just do what the tool suggests (like adding  to your shell’s config)</li><li>Figure out which directories the script they’re telling you to run would add\nto your PATH, and then add those manually. Here’s how I’d do that:\n<ul><li>Run  in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)</li><li>Run <code>echo \"$PATH\" | tr ':' '\\n' | grep cargo</code> to figure out which directories it added</li><li>See that it says  and shorten that to </li><li>Add the directory  to PATH (with the directions in this post)</li></ul></li></ol><p>I don’t think there’s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it\nmight be the “best way”!), but personally I usually use the second approach\nbecause I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I’m changing.</p><p>fish has a handy function called  that you can run to add a directory to your  like this:</p><pre><code>fish_add_path /some/directory\n</code></pre><p>This is cool (it’s such a simple command!) but I’ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:</p><ol><li>Sometimes  will update the  for every session in the\nfuture (with a “universal variable”) and sometimes it will update the \njust for the current session and it’s hard for me to tell which one it will\ndo. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.</li></ol><p>Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if\nyou there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a\ndirectory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!</p>","contentLength":9872,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"DOGE as a National Cyberattack","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/doge-as-a-national.html","date":1739448206,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":144,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the span of just weeks, the US government has experienced what may be the most consequential security breach in its history—not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role.

Next, the Office of Personnel Management—which holds detailed personal data on millions of federal employees, including those with security clearances—<a href=\"https://fedscoop.com/opm-email-federal-workforce-lawsuit-server-privacy-security/\">was</a><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/elon-musk-seizes-computer-system-171738117.html\">compromised</a>.

On Feb. 8, a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-musks-doge-accessing-payment-systems-2025-02-08/\">blocked</a> the DOGE team from accessing the Treasury Department systems any further.

Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. The Chinese government’s 2015 breach of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html\">OPM</a> was a significant US security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.</p><p>In this case, external operators with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/\">limited experience</a> and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny: gaining the highest levels of <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base\">administrative access</a> and making changes to the United States’ most sensitive networks, potentially introducing new security vulnerabilities in the process.</p><p>But the most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted. It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/usaid-officials-put-on-leave-musk-doge\">by</a> removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.</p><p>The Treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: No single person should have unlimited power. Just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.</p><p>This approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. When your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. When a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. These aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. These measures have been <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/\">bypassed or ignored</a>. It’s as if someone found a way to rob Fort Knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.</p><p>The implications for national security are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/the-biggest-breach-of-u-s-government-data-is-under-way/\">staggering</a>. Sen. Ron Wyden said his office had learned that the attackers gained <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/173776/security/elon-musk-s-doge-granted-full-access-to-sensitive-treasury-systems.html\">privileges</a> that allow them to modify core programs in Treasury Department computers that verify federal payments, access encrypted keys that secure financial transactions, and alter audit logs that record system changes. Over at OPM, reports indicate that individuals associated with DOGE <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/elon-musk-doge-lawsuit/\">connected</a> an unauthorized server into the network. They are also reportedly <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-doge-running-highly-sensitive-government-data-through-ai-report-2000560381\">training</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\">AI</a> software on all of this sensitive data.</p><p>This is much more critical than the initial unauthorized access. These new servers have unknown capabilities and configurations, and there’s no evidence that this new code has gone through any rigorous security testing protocols. The AIs being trained are certainly not secure enough for this kind of data. All are ideal targets for any adversary, foreign or domestic, also seeking access to federal data.</p><p>There’s a reason why every modification—hardware or software—to these systems goes through a complex planning process and includes sophisticated access-control mechanisms. The national security crisis is that these systems are now much more vulnerable to dangerous attacks at the same time that the legitimate system administrators trained to protect them have been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-aides-lock-government-workers-out-computer-systems-us-agency-sources-say-2025-01-31/\">locked out</a>.</p><p>By modifying core systems, the attackers have not only compromised current operations, but have also left behind vulnerabilities that could be exploited in future attacks—giving adversaries such as Russia and China an <a href=\"https://therecord.media/doge-opm-treasury-cybersecurity\">unprecedented</a><a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/musk-doge-opm-treasury-breach/\">opportunity</a>. These countries have long targeted these systems. And they don’t just want to gather intelligence—they also want to understand how to disrupt these systems in a crisis.</p><p>Now, the technical details of how these systems operate, their security protocols, and their vulnerabilities are now potentially exposed to unknown parties without any of the usual safeguards. Instead of having to breach heavily fortified digital walls, these parties &nbsp;can simply walk through doors that are being propped open—and then erase evidence of their actions.</p><p>The security implications span three critical areas.</p><p>First, system manipulation: External operators can now modify operations while also altering audit trails that would track their changes. Second, data exposure: Beyond accessing personal information and transaction records, these operators can copy entire system architectures and security configurations—in one case, the technical blueprint of the country’s federal payment infrastructure. Third, and most critically, is the issue of system control: These operators can alter core systems and authentication mechanisms while disabling the very tools designed to detect such changes. This is more than modifying operations; it is modifying the infrastructure that those operations use.</p><p>To address these vulnerabilities, three immediate steps are essential. First, unauthorized access must be revoked and proper authentication protocols restored. Next, comprehensive system monitoring and change management must be reinstated—which, given the difficulty of cleaning a compromised system, will likely require a complete system reset. Finally, thorough audits must be conducted of all system changes made during this period.</p><p>This is beyond politics—this is a matter of national security. Foreign national intelligence organizations will be quick to take advantage of both the chaos and the new insecurities to steal US data and install backdoors to allow for future access.</p><p>Each day of continued unrestricted access makes the eventual recovery more difficult and increases the risk of irreversible damage to these critical systems. While the full impact may take time to assess, these steps represent the minimum necessary actions to begin restoring system integrity and security protocols.</p><p>Assuming that anyone in the government still cares.</p><p><em>This essay was written with Davi Ottenheimer, and originally appeared in <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/11/doge-cyberattack-united-states-treasury/\">Foreign Policy</a>.</em></p>","contentLength":8433,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"GenAI Patterns: Reranker","url":"https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/#reranker","date":1739441760,"author":"Martin Fowler","guid":171,"unread":true,"content":"<p>LLMs struggle with large amounts of context. <b>Bharani\n      Subramaniam</b> and I explain how to mitigate this common RAG\n      problem with a <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/#reranker\">Reranker</a> which takes the document\n      fragments from the retriever, and ranks them according to their usefulness.</p>","contentLength":253,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Delivering Malware Through Abandoned Amazon S3 Buckets","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/delivering-malware-through-abandoned-amazon-s3-buckets.html","date":1739362164,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":143,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Here’s a <a href=\"https://labs.watchtowr.com/8-million-requests-later-we-made-the-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-look-amateur/\">supply-chain attack</a> just waiting to happen. A group of researchers searched for, and then registered, abandoned Amazon S3 buckets for about $400. These buckets contained software libraries that are still used. Presumably the projects don’t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.</p><blockquote><p>The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines—and then abandoned.</p><p>Naturally, we registered them, just to see what would happen—”how many people are really trying to request software updates from S3 buckets that appear to have been abandoned months or even years ago?”, we naively thought to ourselves.</p></blockquote><p>Turns out they got eight million requests over two months.</p><p>Had this been an actual attack, they would have modified the code in those buckets to contain malware and watch as it was incorporated in different software builds around the internet. This is basically the SolarWinds attack, but much more extensive.</p><p>But there’s a second dimension to this attack. Because these update buckets are abandoned, the developers who are using them also no longer have the power to patch them automatically to protect them. The mechanism they would use to do so is now in the hands of adversaries. Moreover, often—but not always—losing the bucket that they’d use for it also removes the original vendor’s ability to identify the vulnerable software in the first place. That hampers their ability to communicate with vulnerable installations.</p><p>Software supply-chain security is an absolute mess. And it’s not going to be easy, or cheap, to fix. Which means that it won’t be.
