Some voters accept election results only <a href=\"https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states\">when their side wins</a>. The problem isn’t just political polarization—it’s a creeping <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/\">erosion of trust</a> in the machinery of democracy itself.</p><p>Commentators blame ideological tribalism, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/media/election-disinformation-2024.html\">misinformation campaigns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/opinion/social-media-polarization-democracy.html\">partisan echo chambers</a> for this crisis of trust. But these explanations miss a critical piece of the puzzle: a growing unease with the digital infrastructure that now underpins nearly every aspect of how Americans vote.</p><p>The digital transformation of American elections has been swift and sweeping. Just two decades ago, most people voted using mechanical levers or punch cards. Today, <a href=\"https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voting-technology\">over 95% of ballots</a> are counted electronically. Digital systems have replaced poll books, taken over voter identity verification processes and are integrated into registration, counting, auditing and voting systems.</p><p>This technological leap has made voting more accessible and efficient, and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/voting-has-never-been-more-secure-than-it-is-right-now/\">sometimes more secure</a>. But these new systems are also more complex. And that complexity plays into the hands of those looking to undermine democracy.</p><p>In recent years, authoritarian regimes have refined a <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/china-midterms-elections-influence-nord-hacking/\">chillingly effective strategy</a> to chip away at Americans’ faith in democracy by relentlessly sowing doubt about the tools U.S. states use to conduct elections. It’s a sustained <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/\">campaign to fracture civic faith</a> and make Americans believe that democracy is rigged, especially when their side loses.</p><p>This is not cyberwar in the traditional sense. There’s no evidence that anyone has managed to break into voting machines and alter votes. But cyberattacks on election systems don’t need to succeed to have an effect. Even a single failed intrusion, magnified by sensational headlines and political echo chambers, is enough to shake public trust. By feeding into existing anxiety about the complexity and opacity of digital systems, adversaries create <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/business/media/china-online-disinformation-us-election.html\">fertile ground for disinformation and conspiracy theories</a>.</p><p>To test this dynamic, we launched a study to uncover precisely how cyberattacks corroded trust in the vote during the 2024 U.S. presidential race. We surveyed more than 3,000 voters before and after election day, testing them using a series of fictional but highly realistic breaking news reports depicting cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. We randomly assigned participants to watch different types of news reports: some depicting cyberattacks on election systems, others on unrelated infrastructure such as the power grid, and a third, neutral control group.</p><p>The results, which are under peer review, were both striking and sobering. Mere exposure to reports of cyberattacks <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0iGIYk_WsxumppZ4ZEVAANS4CC9lTaQ/view\">undermined trust in the electoral process</a>—regardless of partisanship. Voters who supported the losing candidate experienced the greatest drop in trust, with two-thirds of Democratic voters showing heightened skepticism toward the election results.</p><p>But winners too showed diminished confidence. Even though most Republican voters, buoyed by their victory, accepted the overall security of the election, the majority of those who viewed news reports about cyberattacks remained suspicious.</p><p>The attacks didn’t even have to be related to the election. Even cyberattacks against critical infrastructure such as utilities had spillover effects. Voters seemed to extrapolate: “If the power grid can be hacked, why should I believe that voting machines are secure?”</p><p>Strikingly, voters who used digital machines to cast their ballots were the most rattled. For this group of people, belief in the accuracy of the vote count fell by nearly twice as much as that of voters who cast their ballots by mail and who didn’t use any technology. Their firsthand experience with the sorts of systems being portrayed as vulnerable personalized the threat.</p><p>It’s not hard to see why. When you’ve just used a touchscreen to vote, and then you see a news report about a digital system being breached, the leap in logic isn’t far.</p><p>Our data suggests that in a digital society, perceptions of trust—and distrust—are fluid, contagious and easily activated. The cyber domain isn’t just about networks and code. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogac042\">It’s also about emotions</a>: fear, vulnerability and uncertainty.</p><p>Does this mean we should scrap electronic voting machines? Not necessarily.</p><p>Every election system, digital or analog, has flaws. And in many respects, today’s high-tech systems have solved the problems of the past with voter-verifiable paper ballots. Modern voting machines reduce human error, increase accessibility and speed up the vote count. No one misses the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/12/us/counting-the-vote-the-ballots-after-cards-are-poked-the-confetti-can-count.html\">hanging chads</a> of 2000.</p><p>But technology, no matter how advanced, cannot instill legitimacy on its own. It must be paired with something harder to code: public trust. In an environment where foreign adversaries amplify every flaw, cyberattacks can trigger spirals of suspicion. It is no longer enough for elections to be secure – voters must also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/american-elections-hack-bruce-scheier\">perceive them to be secure</a>.</p><p>That’s why <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/learning/2024-election-teaching-resources.html\">public education</a> surrounding elections is now as vital to election security as firewalls and encrypted networks. It’s vital that voters understand how elections are run, how they’re protected and how failures are caught and corrected. Election officials, civil society groups and researchers can teach <a href=\"https://verifiedvoting.org/audits/\">how audits work</a>, host open-source verification demonstrations and ensure that high-tech electoral processes are comprehensible to voters.</p><p>We believe this is an essential investment in democratic resilience. But it needs to be proactive, not reactive. By the time the doubt takes hold, it’s already too late.</p><p>Just as crucially, we are convinced that it’s time to rethink the very nature of cyber threats. People often imagine them in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/us/politics/china-cyber-us-infrastructure.html\">military terms</a>. But that framework misses the true power of these threats. The danger of cyberattacks is not only that they can destroy infrastructure or steal classified secrets, but that they chip away at societal cohesion, sow anxiety and fray citizens’ confidence in democratic institutions. These attacks erode the very idea of truth itself by making people doubt that anything can be trusted.</p><p>If trust is the target, then we believe that elected officials should start to treat trust as a national asset: something to be built, renewed and defended. Because in the end, elections aren’t just about votes being counted—they’re about people believing that those votes count.</p><p>And in that belief lies the true firewall of democracy.</p><p><em>This essay was written with Ryan Shandler and Anthony J.

Manipulating account balances in bank databases, removing entries from criminal records, and murder by removing notations about allergies from medical records are all integrity attacks.</p><p>More broadly, integrity refers to ensuring that data is correct and accurate from the point it is collected, through all the ways it is used, modified, transformed, and eventually deleted. Integrity-related incidents include malicious actions, but also inadvertent mistakes.</p><p>We tend not to think of them this way, but we have many primitive integrity measures built into our computer systems. The reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state, is an integrity measure. The undo button is another integrity measure. Any of our systems that detect hard drive errors, file corruption, or dropped internet packets are integrity measures.</p><p>Just as a website leaving personal data exposed even if no one accessed it counts as a privacy breach, a system that fails to guarantee the accuracy of its data counts as an integrity breach – even if no one deliberately manipulated that data.</p><p>Integrity has always been important, but as we start using massive amounts of data to both train and operate AI systems, data integrity will become more critical than ever.</p><p>Most of the attacks against AI systems are integrity attacks. Affixing small stickers on road signs to fool AI driving systems is an integrity violation. Prompt injection attacks are another integrity violation. In both cases, the AI model can’t distinguish between legitimate data and malicious input: visual in the first case, text instructions in the second. Even worse, the AI model can’t distinguish between legitimate data and malicious commands.</p><p>Any attacks that manipulate the training data, the model, the input, the output, or the feedback from the interaction back into the model is an integrity violation. If you’re building an AI system, integrity is your biggest security problem. And it’s one we’re going to need to think about, talk about, and figure out how to solve.</p><p>Web 3.0 – the distributed, decentralized, intelligent web of tomorrow – is all about data integrity. It’s not just AI. Verifiable, trustworthy, accurate data and computation are necessary parts of cloud computing, peer-to-peer social networking, and distributed data storage. Imagine a world of driverless cars, where the cars communicate with each other about their intentions and road conditions. That doesn’t work without integrity. And neither does a smart power grid, or reliable mesh networking. There are no trustworthy AI agents without integrity.</p><p>We’re going to have to solve a small language problem first, though. Confidentiality is to confidential, and availability is to available, as integrity is to what? The analogous word is “integrous,” but that’s such an obscure word that it’s not in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, even in its unabridged version. I propose that we re-popularize the word, starting here.</p><p>We need research into integrous system design.</p><p>We need research into a series of hard problems that encompass both data and computational integrity. How do we test and measure integrity? How do we build verifiable sensors with auditable system outputs? How to we build integrous data processing units? How do we recover from an integrity breach? These are just a few of the questions we will need to answer once we start poking around at integrity.</p><p>There are deep questions here, deep as the internet. Back in the 1960s, the internet was designed to answer a basic security question: Can we build an available network in a world of availability failures? More recently, we turned to the question of privacy: Can we build a confidential network in a world of confidentiality failures? I propose that the current version of this question needs to be this: Can we build an integrous network in a world of integrity failures? Like the two version of this question that came before: the answer isn’t obviously “yes,” but it’s not obviously “no,” either.</p><p>Let’s start thinking about integrous system design. And let’s start using the word in conversation. The more we use it, the less weird it will sound. And, who knows, maybe someday the American Dialect Society will choose it as the word of the year.</p>","contentLength":4436,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"All color is best-effort","url":"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort","date":1751009400,"author":"Amos Wenger","guid":173941,"unread":true,"content":"<p data-bo=\"224\">I do not come to you with answers today, but rather some observations and a lot of questions.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#the-weird-glitch\"></a><p data-bo=\"340\">Recently I was editing some video and I noticed this:</p><p data-bo=\"748\">Not what the finger is pointing at — the dots.</p><p data-bo=\"798\">Here are the separate layers this image is made up of: the background is a stock image\nI’ve licensed from Envato Elements:</p><p data-bo=\"1001\">Because I use it as a background image, I’ve cranked down the exposition in the Color tab:</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#playing-with-color-spaces\"></a><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#cie-chromaticity-diagram\"></a><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#our-first-transfer-function\"></a><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#parade-scope\"></a><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#more-transfer-functions\"></a><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#how-white-is-your-white\"></a><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/all-color-is-best-effort#conclusion\"></a>","contentLength":410,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"White House Bans WhatsApp","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/06/white-house-bans-whatsapp.html","date":1750935649,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":172064,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Reuters is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whatsapp-banned-us-house-representatives-devices-memo-2025-06-23/\">reporting</a> that the White House has banned WhatsApp on all employee devices:</p><blockquote><p>The notice said the “Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use.”</p></blockquote>","contentLength":325,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"New zine: The Secret Rules of the Terminal","url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/06/24/new-zine--the-secret-rules-of-the-terminal/","date":1750896000,"author":"Julia Evans","guid":172391,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello! After many months of writing deep dive blog posts about the terminal, on\nTuesday I released a new zine called “The Secret Rules of the Terminal”!</p><p>Here’s the table of contents:</p><a href=\"https://wizardzines.com/zines/terminal/toc.png\"><img width=\"600px\" src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-toc-small.png\"></a><p>I’ve been using the terminal every day for 20 years but even though I’m very\nconfident in the terminal, I’ve always had a bit of an uneasy feeling about it.\nUsually things work fine, but sometimes something goes wrong and it just feels\nlike investigating it is impossible, or at least like it would open up a huge\ncan of worms.</p><p>So I started trying to write down a list of weird problems I’ve run into in terminal and I realized\nthat the terminal has a lot of tiny inconsistencies like:</p><ul><li>sometimes you can use the arrow keys to move around, but sometimes pressing the arrow keys just prints </li><li>sometimes you can use the mouse to select text, but sometimes you can’t</li><li>sometimes your commands get saved to a history when you run them, and sometimes they don’t</li><li>some shells let you use the up arrow to see the previous command, and some don’t</li></ul><p>If you use the terminal daily for 10 or 20 years, even if you don’t understand\nexactly  these things happen, you’ll probably build an intuition for them.</p><p>But having an intuition for them isn’t the same as understanding why they\nhappen. When writing this zine I actually had to do a lot of work to figure out\nexactly what was  in the terminal to be able to talk about how to\nreason about it.</p><h3>the rules aren’t written down anywhere</h3><p>It turns out that the “rules” for how the terminal works (how do\nyou edit a command you type in? how do you quit a program? how do you fix your\ncolours?) are extremely hard to fully understand, because “the terminal” is actually\nmade of many different pieces of software (your terminal emulator, your\noperating system, your shell, the core utilities like , and every other random\nterminal program you’ve installed) which are written by different people with different\nideas about how things should work.</p><p>So I wanted to write something that would explain:</p><ul><li>how the 4 pieces of the terminal (your shell, terminal emulator, programs, and TTY driver) fit together to make everything work</li><li>some of the core conventions for how you can expect things in your terminal to work</li><li>lots of tips and tricks for how to use terminal programs</li></ul><h3>this zine explains the most useful parts of terminal internals</h3><p>Terminal internals are a mess. A lot of it is just the way it is because\nsomeone made a decision in the 80s and now it’s impossible to change, and\nhonestly I don’t think learning everything about terminal internals is worth\nit.</p><p>But some parts are not that hard to understand and can really make your\nexperience in the terminal better, like:</p><ul><li>if you understand what  is responsible for, you can configure your shell (or use a different one!) to access your history more easily, get great tab completion, and so much more</li><li>if you understand , it’s much less scary when ing a binary to stdout messes up your terminal, you can just type  and move on</li><li>if you understand how  works, you can get rid of bad colour contrast in your terminal so you can actually read the text</li></ul><h3>I learned a surprising amount writing this zine</h3><p>When I wrote <a href=\"https://wizardzines.com/zines/git\">How Git Works</a>, I thought I\nknew how Git worked, and I was right. But the terminal is different. Even\nthough I feel totally confident in the terminal and even though I’ve used it\nevery day for 20 years, I had a lot of misunderstandings about how the terminal\nworks and (unless you’re the author of  or something) I think there’s a\ngood chance you do too.</p><p>A few things I learned that are actually useful to me:</p><ul><li>I understand the structure of the terminal better and so I feel more\nconfident debugging weird terminal stuff that happens to me (I was even able\nto suggest a <a href=\"https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834\">small improvement</a> to fish!). Identifying exactly which piece of software is causing a weird thing to happen in my terminal still isn’t  but I’m a lot better at it now.</li><li>how  works under the hood (it does the equivalent of <code>stty sane; sleep 1; tput reset</code>) – basically I learned that I don’t ever need to worry about\nremembering  or  and I can just run  instead</li><li>how to look at the invisible escape codes that a program is printing out (run <code>unbuffer program &gt; out; less out</code>)</li><li>why the builtin REPLs on my Mac like  are so annoying to use (they use  instead of )</li></ul><h3>blog posts I wrote along the way</h3><p>As usual these days I wrote a bunch of blog posts about various side quests:</p><h3>people who helped with this zine</h3><p>A long time ago I used to write zines mostly by myself but with every project I get more\nand more help. I met with <a href=\"https://marieflanagan.com\">Marie Claire LeBlanc Flanagan</a> every weekday from September to June to work\non this one.</p><p>The cover is by Vladimir Kašiković,\nLesley Trites did copy editing,\nSimon Tatham (who wrote <a href=\"https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">PuTTY</a>) did technical review, our\nOperations Manager Lee did the transcription as well as a million other\nthings, and <a href=\"https://github.com/doy\">Jesse Luehrs</a> (who is one of the very few\npeople I know who actually understands the terminal’s cursed inner workings)\nhad so many incredibly helpful conversations with me about what is going on in\nthe terminal.</p><p>Here are some links to get the zine again:</p><p>As always, you can get either a PDF version to print at home or a print version\nshipped to your house.

There’s at least one other person using this approach now,\nso let’s write this down.</p><section><p>Let me start with a quick rundown of RSS, as the topic can be somewhat confusing. I am by no means\nan expert; my perspective is amateur.</p><p>The purpose of RSS is to allow blog authors to inform the readers when a new post comes out. It is,\nfirst and foremost, a notification mechanism. The way it works is that a blog publishes a machine\nreadable list of recent blog entries. An RSS reader fetches this list, persists the list in the\nlocal state, and periodically polls the original site for changes. If a new article is published,\nthe reader notices it on the next poll and notifies the user.</p><p>RSS is an alternative to Twitter- and HackerNews-likes for discovering interesting articles. Rather\nthan relying on word of mouth popularity or algorithmic feeds, you curate your own list of favorite\nauthors, and use a feed reader in lieu of compulsively checking personal websites for updates\ndirectly.</p><p>There are several specific standards that implement the general feed idea. The original one is RSS.\nIt is a bad, ambiguous, and overly complicated standard. Don’t use it. Instead, use\n<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt\">Atom</a>, a much clearer and simpler standard. Whenever “RSS” is\ndiscussed (as in the present article), Atom is usually implied. See <a href=\"https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/23/\">Atom vs.\nRSS</a> for a more specific discussion on the differences.</p><p>While simpler, Atom is not simple. A big source of accidental complexity is that Atom feed is an XML\ndocument that needs to embed HTML. HTML being almost like XML, it is easy to mess up escaping. The\nactually good, simple standard is <a href=\"https://www.jsonfeed.org\">JSON Feed</a>. However, it appears to be\ncompletely unmaintained as of 2025. This is very unfortunate. I hope someone takes over the\nmaintenance from the original creators.</p></section><section><p>As I’ve mentioned, while I like the ideas behind RSS, none of the existing RSS readers worked for\nme. They try to do more than I need. A classical RSS reader fetches full content of the articles,\nsaves it for offline reading and renders the content using an embedded web-browser. I don’t need\nthis. I prefer reading the articles on the author’s website, using my normal browser (and,\noccasionally, its reader mode). The only thing I need is notifications.</p></section><section><p>My first attempt at my own RSS reader was to create a web page that stored the state in the\nbrowser’s local storage. This idea was foiled by CORS. In general, if a client-side JavaScript does\na  it can only fetch resources from the domain the page itself is hosted on. But feeds are\nhosted on other domains.</p></section><section><p>This list is stateless: for each feed I follow, I display the latest three posts, newer posts on top. I\ndon’t maintain read/unread state. If I don’t remember whether I read the article or not, I might as\nwell re-read! I can access this list from any device.</p><p>While it is primarily for me, the list is publicly available, and might be interesting for some\nreaders of my blog.

Complete and verbatim.</code></p></blockquote><p>This will only work if you you are on a paid ChatGPT plan and have the “Reference chat history” setting turned on in your preferences.</p><p>I’ve shared <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/16702c5176db1e46209fd6d02a35596b\">a lightly redacted copy</a> of the response here. It’s  detailed! Here are a few notes that caught my eye.</p><p>From the “Assistant Response Preferences” section:</p><blockquote><p>User sometimes adopts a lighthearted or theatrical approach, especially when discussing creative topics, but always expects practical and actionable content underneath the playful tone. They request entertaining personas (e.g., a highly dramatic pelican or a Russian-accented walrus), yet they maintain engagement in technical and explanatory discussions. […]</p><p>User frequently cross-validates information, particularly in research-heavy topics like emissions estimates, pricing comparisons, and political events. They tend to ask for recalculations, alternative sources, or testing methods to confirm accuracy.</p></blockquote><p>This big chunk from “Notable Past Conversation Topic Highlights” is a clear summary of my technical interests.</p><blockquote><p>In past conversations from June 2024 to April 2025, the user has demonstrated an advanced interest in optimizing software development workflows, with a focus on Python, JavaScript, Rust, and SQL, particularly in the context of databases, concurrency, and API design. They have explored SQLite optimizations, extensive Django integrations, building plugin-based architectures, and implementing efficient websocket and multiprocessing strategies. Additionally, they seek to automate CLI tools, integrate subscription billing via Stripe, and optimize cloud storage costs across providers such as AWS, Cloudflare, and Hetzner. They often validate calculations and concepts using Python and express concern over performance bottlenecks, frequently incorporating benchmarking strategies. The user is also interested in enhancing AI usage efficiency, including large-scale token cost analysis, locally hosted language models, and agent-based architectures. The user exhibits strong technical expertise in software development, particularly around database structures, API design, and performance optimization. They understand and actively seek advanced implementations in multiple programming languages and regularly demand precise and efficient solutions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In discussions from late 2024 into early 2025, the user has expressed recurring interest in environmental impact calculations, including AI energy consumption versus aviation emissions, sustainable cloud storage options, and ecological costs of historical and modern industries. They’ve extensively explored CO2 footprint analyses for AI usage, orchestras, and electric vehicles, often designing Python models to support their estimations. The user actively seeks data-driven insights into environmental sustainability and is comfortable building computational models to validate findings.</p></blockquote><p>(Orchestras there was me trying to compare the CO2 impact of training an LLM to the amount of CO2 it takes to send a symphony orchestra on tour.)</p><p>Then from “Helpful User Insights”:</p><blockquote><p>User is based in Half Moon Bay, California. Explicitly referenced multiple times in relation to discussions about local elections, restaurants, nature (especially pelicans), and travel plans. Mentioned from June 2024 to October 2024. […]</p><p>User is an avid birdwatcher with a particular fondness for pelicans. Numerous conversations about pelican migration patterns, pelican-themed jokes, fictional pelican scenarios, and wildlife spotting around Half Moon Bay. Discussed between June 2024 and October 2024.\n</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, it picked up on the pelican thing. I have other interests though!</p><blockquote><p>User enjoys and frequently engages in cooking, including explorations of cocktail-making and technical discussions about food ingredients. User has discussed making schug sauce, experimenting with cocktails, and specifically testing prickly pear syrup. Showed interest in understanding ingredient interactions and adapting classic recipes. Topics frequently came up between June 2024 and October 2024.</p></blockquote><p>Plenty of other stuff is very on brand for me:</p><blockquote><p>User has a technical curiosity related to performance optimization in databases, particularly indexing strategies in SQLite and efficient query execution. Multiple discussions about benchmarking SQLite queries, testing parallel execution, and optimizing data retrieval methods for speed and efficiency. Topics were discussed between June 2024 and October 2024.</p></blockquote><p>I’ll quote the last section, “User Interaction Metadata”, in full because it includes some interesting specific technical notes:</p><p>[Blog editor note: The list below has been reformatted from JSON into a numbered list for readability.]</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>User is currently in United States.
