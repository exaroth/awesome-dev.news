Every image you hover over isn’t just a visual placeholder; it’s a critical data point that fuels our sophisticated personalization engine. At Netflix, we call these images ‘impressions,’ and they play a pivotal role in transforming your interaction from simple browsing into an immersive binge-watching experience, all tailored to your unique&nbsp;tastes.</p><p>Capturing these moments and turning them into a personalized journey is no simple feat. It requires a state-of-the-art system that can track and process these impressions while maintaining a detailed history of each profile’s exposure. This nuanced integration of data and technology empowers us to offer bespoke content recommendations.</p><p>In this multi-part blog series, we take you behind the scenes of our system that processes billions of impressions daily. We will explore the challenges we encounter and unveil how we are building a resilient solution that transforms these client-side impressions into a personalized content discovery experience for every Netflix&nbsp;viewer.</p><h3>Why do we need impression history?</h3><p>To tailor recommendations more effectively, it’s crucial to track what content a user has already encountered. Having impression history helps us achieve this by allowing us to identify content that has been displayed on the homepage but not engaged with, helping us deliver fresh, engaging recommendations.</p><p>By maintaining a history of impressions, we can implement frequency capping to prevent over-exposure to the same content. This ensures users aren’t repeatedly shown identical options, keeping the viewing experience vibrant and reducing the risk of frustration or disengagement.</p><h4>Highlighting New&nbsp;Releases</h4><p>For new content, impression history helps us monitor initial user interactions and adjust our merchandising efforts accordingly. We can experiment with different content placements or promotional strategies to boost visibility and engagement.</p><p>Additionally, impression history offers insightful information for addressing a number of platform-related analytics queries. Analyzing impression history, for example, might help determine how well a specific row on the home page is functioning or assess the effectiveness of a merchandising strategy.</p><p>The first pivotal step in managing impressions begins with the creation of a Source-of-Truth (SOT) dataset. This foundational dataset is essential, as it supports various downstream workflows and enables a multitude of use&nbsp;cases.</p><h4>Collecting Raw Impression Events</h4><p>As Netflix members explore our platform, their interactions with the user interface spark a vast array of raw events. These events are promptly relayed from the client side to our servers, entering a centralized event processing queue. This queue ensures we are consistently capturing raw events from our global user&nbsp;base.</p><p>After raw events are collected into a centralized queue, a custom event extractor processes this data to identify and extract all impression events. These extracted events are then routed to an Apache Kafka topic for immediate processing needs and simultaneously stored in an Apache Iceberg table for long-term retention and historical analysis. This dual-path approach leverages Kafka’s capability for low-latency streaming and Iceberg’s efficient management of large-scale, immutable datasets, ensuring both real-time responsiveness and comprehensive historical data availability.</p><h4>Filtering &amp; Enriching Raw Impressions</h4><p>Once the raw impression events are queued, a stateless Apache Flink job takes charge, meticulously processing this data. It filters out any invalid entries and enriches the valid ones with additional metadata, such as show or movie title details, and the specific page and row location where each impression was presented to users. This refined output is then structured using an Avro schema, establishing a definitive source of truth for Netflix’s impression data. The enriched data is seamlessly accessible for both real-time applications via Kafka and historical analysis through storage in an Apache Iceberg table. This dual availability ensures immediate processing capabilities alongside comprehensive long-term data retention.</p><h4>Ensuring High Quality Impressions</h4><p>Maintaining the highest quality of impressions is a top priority. We accomplish this by gathering detailed column-level metrics that offer insights into the state and quality of each impression. These metrics include everything from validating identifiers to checking that essential columns are properly filled. The data collected feeds into a comprehensive quality dashboard and supports a tiered threshold-based alerting system. These alerts promptly notify us of any potential issues, enabling us to swiftly address regressions. Additionally, while enriching the data, we ensure that all columns are in agreement with each other, offering in-place corrections wherever possible to deliver accurate&nbsp;data.</p><p>We handle a staggering volume of 1 to 1.5 million impression events globally every second, with each event approximately 1.2KB in size. To efficiently process this massive influx in real-time, we employ Apache Flink for its low-latency stream processing capabilities, which seamlessly integrates both batch and stream processing to facilitate efficient backfilling of historical data and ensure consistency across real-time and historical analyses. Our Flink configuration includes 8 task managers per region, each equipped with 8 CPU cores and 32GB of memory, operating at a parallelism of 48, allowing us to handle the necessary scale and speed for seamless performance delivery. The Flink job’s sink is equipped with a data mesh connector, as detailed in our <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/data-mesh-a-data-movement-and-processing-platform-netflix-1288bcab2873\">Data Mesh platform</a> which has two outputs: Kafka and Iceberg. This setup allows for efficient streaming of real-time data through Kafka and the preservation of historical data in Iceberg, providing a comprehensive and flexible data processing and storage solution.</p><p>We utilize the ‘island model’ for deploying our Flink jobs, where all dependencies for a given application reside within a single region. This approach ensures high availability by isolating regions, so if one becomes degraded, others remain unaffected, allowing traffic to be shifted between regions to maintain service continuity. Thus, all data in one region is processed by the Flink job deployed within that&nbsp;region.</p><h4>Addressing the Challenge of Unschematized Events</h4><p>Allowing raw events to land on our centralized processing queue unschematized offers significant flexibility, but it also introduces challenges. Without a defined schema, it can be difficult to determine whether missing data was intentional or due to a logging error. We are investigating solutions to introduce schema management that maintains flexibility while providing clarity.</p><h4>Automating Performance Tuning with Autoscalers</h4><p>Tuning the performance of our Apache Flink jobs is currently a manual process. The next step is to integrate with autoscalers, which can dynamically adjust resources based on workload demands. This integration will not only optimize performance but also ensure more efficient resource utilization.</p><h4>Improving Data Quality&nbsp;Alerts</h4><p>Right now, there’s a lot of business rules dictating when a data quality alert needs to be fired. This leads to a lot of false positives that require manual judgement. A lot of times it is difficult to track changes leading to regression due to inadequate data lineage information. We are investing in building a comprehensive data quality platform that more intelligently identifies anomalies in our impression stream, keeps track of data lineage and data governance, and also, generates alerts notifying producers of any regressions. This approach will enhance efficiency, reduce manual oversight, and ensure a higher standard of data integrity.</p><p>Creating a reliable source of truth for impressions is a complex but essential task that enhances personalization and discovery experience. Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where we’ll delve into how we use this SOT dataset to create a microservice that provides impression histories.

While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional\ncomplexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go\nover those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.\nThis migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,\nbuilding four new subsystems.</p><p>One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,\nwhich is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.</p><p>As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the \nobject with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the\ncloud-controller-manager.

Previously, the kubelet\nwas able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved\nto the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg\">chicken and egg problem</a>\nduring the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the\ncontroller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,\nstandalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using\n (more on this below)</p><h2>Examples of the dependency problem</h2><p>As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be\nunschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p><p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a \nor , may not be able to schedule.</p><p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3><p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p><blockquote><p>\"The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.\"</p></blockquote><p>One of the conditions that can lead to a  resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a  resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p><p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p><p>There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p><p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p><ol><li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).</li><li>Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li><li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol><li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li></ol></li><li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li></ol><p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p><p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is\nimportant to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please\nconsult your cloud provider’s documentation.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nname: cloud-controller-manager\nnamespace: kube-system\nspec:\nreplicas: 2\nselector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nstrategy:\ntype: Recreate\ntemplate:\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nannotations:\nkubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure\nspec:\ncontainers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager\n- name: cloud-controller-manager\ncommand:\n- /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager\n- --leader-elect=true\n- -v=1\nimage: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest\nresources:\nrequests:\ncpu: 200m\nmemory: 50Mi\nhostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane\nnodeSelector:\nnode-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\"\naffinity:\npodAntiAffinity:\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n- topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\nlabelSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\ntolerations:\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\n</code></pre><p>When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that\ncluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple\nreplicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and\nredundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance\nof a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.</p>","contentLength":11247,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Looking back at our Bug Bounty program in

WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the\naddition of the  directive and the ability to build a reactor\nfor WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).\nThese features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,\nfacilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities\nfor Go-based Wasm applications.</p><h2>WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface</h2><p><a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> is a binary instruction format\nthat was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of\nhigh-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.\nSince then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various\nenvironments beyond the browser.\nNotably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm\nexecutables, taking advantage of the\n<a href=\"https://wasi.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> system call API.\nWASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.</p><p>Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the\n port.\nGo 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the\nnew  port.</p><h2>Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with </h2><p>Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, , which allows\ndevelopers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the\nWasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.\nThis directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available\nas a Wasm <a href=\"https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/modules.html?highlight=export#exports\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">export</a>\nin the resulting Wasm binary.</p><p>To use the  directive, simply add it to a function definition:</p><pre><code>//go:wasmexport add\nfunc add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }\n</code></pre><p>With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named  that\ncan be called from the host.</p><p>This is analogous to the <a href=\"https://go.dev/cmd/cgo#hdr-C_references_to_Go\">cgo  directive</a>,\nwhich makes the function available to be called from C,\nthough  uses a different, simpler mechanism.</p><p>A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and\ncan be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.\nUnlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,\na reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain\naccessible.</p><p>With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the  build\nflag.</p><pre><code>$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm\n</code></pre><p>The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the  function\n(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an\n function, which performs runtime and package initialization,\nalong with any exported functions and their dependencies.\nThe  function must be called before any other exported functions.\nThe  function will not be automatically invoked.</p><p>To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling\n, then simply invoke the exported functions.\nHere is an example using <a href=\"https://wazero.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wazero</a>, a Go-based Wasm runtime\nimplementation:</p><pre><code>// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.\nr := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)\ndefer r.Close(ctx)\nwasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)\n\n// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.\nconfig := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions(\"_initialize\")\n\n//

In addition to this blog post,  containing charts with aggregated results of all questions in the survey.</p><p><strong>Our sincerest thanks to every community member who took the time to express their opinions and experiences with Rust over the past year. Your participation will help us make Rust better for everyone.</strong></p><p>There's a lot of data to go through, so strap in and enjoy!</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>As shown above, in 2024, we have received fewer survey views than in the previous year. This was likely caused simply by the fact that the survey ran only for two weeks, while in the previous year it ran for almost a month. However, the completion rate has also dropped, which seems to suggest that the survey might be a bit too long. We will take this into consideration for the next edition of the survey.</p><p>The State of Rust survey not only gives us excellent insight into how many Rust users around the world are using and experiencing the language but also gives us insight into the makeup of our global community. This information gives us a sense of where the language is being used and where access gaps might exist for us to address over time. We hope that this data and our related analysis help further important discussions about how we can continue to prioritize global access and inclusivity in the Rust community.</p><p>Same as every year, we asked our respondents in which country they live in. The top 10 countries represented were, in order: United States (22%), Germany (14%), United Kingdom (6%), France (6%), China (5%), Canada (3%), Netherlands (3%), Russia (3%), Australia (2%), and Sweden (2%). We are happy to see that Rust is enjoyed by users from all around the world! You can try to find your country in the chart below:</p><p>We also asked whether respondents consider themselves members of a marginalized community. Out of those who answered, 74.5% selected no, 15.5% selected yes, and 10% preferred not to say.</p><p>We have asked the group that selected “yes” which specific groups they identified as being a member of. The majority of those who consider themselves a member of an underrepresented or marginalized group in technology identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or otherwise non-heterosexual. The second most selected option was neurodivergent at 46% followed by trans at 35%.</p><p>Each year, we must acknowledge the diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) related gaps in the Rust community and open source as a whole. We believe that excellent work is underway at the Rust Foundation to advance global access to Rust community gatherings and distribute grants to a diverse pool of maintainers each cycle, which you can learn more about <a href=\"https://rustfoundation.org/community\">here</a>. Even so, global inclusion and access is just one element of DEI, and the survey working group will continue to advocate for progress in this domain.</p><p>The number of respondents that self-identify as a Rust user was quite similar to last year, around 92%. This high number is not surprising, since we primarily target existing Rust developers with this survey.</p><p>Similarly as last year, around 31% of those who did not identify as Rust users cited the perception of difficulty as the primary reason for not using Rust. The most common reason for not using Rust was that the respondents simply haven’t had the chance to try it yet.</p><p>Of the former Rust users who participated in the 2024 survey, 36% cited factors outside their control as a reason why they no longer use Rust, which is a 10pp decrease from last year. This year, we also asked respondents if they would consider using Rust again if an opportunity comes up, which turns out to be true for a large fraction of the respondents (63%). That is good to hear!</p><blockquote><p>Closed answers marked with N/A were not present in the previous version(s) of the survey.</p></blockquote><p>Those not using Rust anymore told us that it is because they don't really need it (or the goals of their company changed) or because it was not the right tool for the job. A few reported being overwhelmed by the language or its ecosystem in general or that switching to or introducing Rust would have been too expensive in terms of human effort.</p><p>Of those who used Rust in 2024, 53% did so on a daily (or nearly daily) basis — an increase of 4pp from the previous year. We can observe an upward trend in the frequency of Rust usage over the past few years, which suggests that Rust is being increasingly used at work. This is also confirmed by other answers mentioned in the Rust at Work section later below.</p><p>Rust expertise is also continually increasing amongst our respondents! 20% of respondents can write (only) simple programs in Rust (a decrease of 3pp from 2023), while 53% consider themselves productive using Rust — up from 47% in 2023. While the survey is just one tool to measure the changes in Rust expertise overall, these numbers are heartening as they represent knowledge growth for many Rustaceans returning to the survey year over year.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the most popular version of Rust is , either the most recent one or whichever comes with the users' Linux distribution. Almost a third of users also use the latest nightly release, due to various reasons (see below). However, it seems that the beta toolchain is not used much, which is a bit unfortunate. We would like to encourage Rust users to use the beta toolchain more (e.g. in CI environments) to help test soon-to-be stabilized versions of Rust.</p><p>People that use the nightly toolchain mostly do it to gain access to specific unstable language features. Several users have also mentioned that rustfmt works better for them on nightly or that they use the nightly compiler because of faster compilation times.</p><p>To use Rust, programmers first have to learn it, so we are always interested in finding out how do they approach that. Based on the survey results, it seems that most users learn from Rust documentation and also from <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\">The Rust Programming Language</a> book, which has been a favourite learning resource of new Rustaceans for a long time. Many people also seem to learn by reading the source code of Rust crates. The fact that both the documentation and source code of tens of thousands of Rust crates is available on <a href=\"https://docs.rs\">docs.rs</a> and GitHub makes this easier.</p><p>In terms of answers belonging to the \"Other\" category, they can be clustered into three categories: people using LLM (large language model) assistants (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), reading the official Rust forums (Discord, <a href=\"https://users.rust-lang.org/\">URLO</a>) or being mentored while contributing to Rust projects. We would like to extend a big thank you to those making our spaces friendly and welcoming for newcomers, as it is important work and it pays off. Interestingly, a non-trivial number of people \"learned by doing\" and used rustc error messages and clippy as a guide, which is a good indicator of the quality of Rust diagnostics.</p><p>In terms of formal education, it seems that Rust has not yet penetrated university curriculums, as this is typically a very slowly moving area. Only a very small number of respondents (around 3%) have taken a university Rust course or used university learning materials.</p><p>In terms of operating systems used by Rustaceans, Linux was the most popular choice, and it seems that it is getting increasingly popular year after year. It is followed by macOS and Windows, which have a very similar share of usage.</p><blockquote><p>As you can see in the <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2025-02-13-rust-survey-2024/which-os-do-you-use-wordcloud.png\">wordcloud</a>, there are also a few users that prefer Arch, btw.</p></blockquote><p>Rust programmers target a diverse set of platforms with their Rust programs. We saw a slight uptick in users targeting embedded and mobile platforms, but otherwise the distribution of platforms stayed mostly the same as last year. Since the WebAssembly target is quite diverse, we have split it into two separate categories this time. Based on the results it is clear that when using WebAssembly, it is mostly in the context of browsers (23%) rather than other use-cases (7%).</p><p>We cannot of course forget the favourite topic of many programmers: which IDE (developer environment) they use. Although Visual Studio Code still remains the most popular option, its share has dropped by 5pp this year. On the other hand, the Zed editor seems to have gained considerable traction recently. The small percentage of those who selected \"Other\" are using a wide range of different tools: from CursorAI to classics like Kate or Notepad++. Special mention to the 3 people using \"ed\", that's quite an achievement.</p><blockquote><p>You can also take a look at the linked <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2025-02-13-rust-survey-2024/what-ide-do-you-use-wordcloud.png\">wordcloud</a> that summarizes open answers to this question (the \"Other\" category), to see what other editors are also popular.</p></blockquote><p>We were excited to see that more and more people use Rust at work for the majority of their coding, 38% vs 34% from last year. There is a clear upward trend in this metric over the past few years.</p><p>The usage of Rust within companies also seems to be rising, as 45% of respondents answered that their organisation makes non-trivial use of Rust, which is a 7pp increase from 2023.</p><p>Once again, the top reason employers of our survey respondents invested in Rust was the ability to build relatively correct and bug-free software. The second most popular reason was Rust’s performance characteristics. 21% of respondents that use Rust at work do so because they already know it, and it's thus their default choice, an uptick of 5pp from 2023. This seems to suggest that Rust is becoming one of the baseline languages of choice for more and more companies.</p><p>Similarly to the previous year, a large percentage of respondents (82%) report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals. In general, it seems that programmers and companies are quite happy with their usage of Rust, which is great!</p><p>In terms of technology domains, the situation is quite similar to the previous year. Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends, web and networking services and cloud technologies. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use-cases.</p><blockquote><p>You can scroll the chart to the right to see more domains. Note that the Automotive domain was not offered as a closed answer in the 2023 survey (it was merely entered through open answers), which might explain the large jump.</p></blockquote><p>It is exciting to see the continued growth of professional Rust usage and the confidence so many users feel in its performance, control, security and safety, enjoyability, and more!</p><p>As always, one of the main goals of the State of Rust survey is to shed light on challenges, concerns, and priorities on Rustaceans’ minds over the past year.</p><p>We have asked our users about aspects of Rust that limit their productivity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, slow compilation was at the top of the list, as it seems to be a perennial concern of Rust users. As always, there are efforts underway to improve the speed of the compiler, such as enabling the <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc.html\">parallel frontend</a> or switching to a <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/17/enabling-rust-lld-on-linux.html\">faster linker by default</a>. We invite you to test these improvements and let us know if you encounter any issues.</p><p>Other challenges included subpar support for debugging Rust and high disk usage of Rust compiler artifacts. On the other hand, most Rust users seem to be very happy with its runtime performance, the correctness and stability of the compiler and also Rust's documentation.</p><p>In terms of specific unstable (or missing) features that Rust users want to be stabilized (or implemented), the most desired ones were async closures and if/let while chains. Well, we have good news! Async closures will be stabilized in the next version of Rust (1.85), and if/let while chains will hopefully follow <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/132833\">soon after</a>, once Edition 2024 is released (which will also happen in Rust 1.85).</p><p>Other coveted features are generators (both sync and async) and more powerful generic const expressions. You can follow the <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h1/goals.html\">Rust Project Goals</a> to track the progress of these (and other) features.</p><p>In the open answers to this question, people were really helpful and tried hard to describe the most notable issues limiting their productivity. We have seen mentions of struggles with async programming (an all-time favourite), debuggability of errors (which people generally love, but they are not perfect for everyone) or Rust tooling being slow or resource intensive (rust-analyzer and rustfmt). Some users also want a better IDE story and improved interoperability with other languages.</p><p>This year, we have also included a new question about the speed of Rust's evolution. While most people seem to be content with the status quo, more than a quarter of people who responded to this question would like Rust to stabilize and/or add features more quickly, and only 7% of respondents would prefer Rust to slow down or completely stop adding new features.</p><p>Interestingly, when we asked respondents about their main worries for the future of Rust, one of the top answers remained the worry that Rust will become too complex. This seems to be in contrast with the answers to the previous question. Perhaps Rust users still seem to consider the complexity of Rust to be manageable, but they worry that one day it might become too much.</p><p>We are happy to see that the amount of respondents concerned about Rust Project governance and lacking support of the Rust Foundation has dropped by about 6pp from 2023.</p><p>Each year, the results of the State of Rust survey help reveal the areas that need improvement in many areas across the Rust Project and ecosystem, as well as the aspects that are working well for our community.</p><p>If you have any suggestions for the Rust Annual survey, please <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues\">let us know</a>!</p><p>We are immensely grateful to those who participated in the 2024 State of Rust Survey and facilitated its creation. While there are always challenges associated with developing and maintaining a programming language, this year we were pleased to see a high level of survey participation and candid feedback that will truly help us make Rust work better for everyone.</p><p>If you’d like to dig into more details, we recommend you to browse through the full <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/surveys/main/surveys/2024-annual-survey/report/annual-survey-2024-report.pdf\">survey report</a>.</p>","contentLength":14399,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"GitHub Availability Report: January 2025","url":"https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-availability-report-january-2025/","date":1739393376,"author":"Jakub Oleksy","guid":87,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In January, we experienced three incidents that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services.</p><p><strong>January 09 1:26 UTC (lasting 31 minutes)</strong></p><p>On January 9, 2025, between 01:26 UTC and 01:56 UTC, GitHub experienced widespread disruption to many services, with users receiving 500 responses when trying to access various functionality.

We use GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) to discover, track, and remediate vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding standards at scale. One tool we rely heavily on to analyze our code at scale is <a href=\"https://codeql.github.com\">CodeQL</a>.</p><p>CodeQL is GitHub’s static analysis engine that powers automated security analyses. You can use it to query code in much the same way you would query a database. It provides a much more robust way to analyze code and uncover problems than an old-fashioned text search through a codebase.</p><p>The following post will detail how we use CodeQL to keep GitHub secure and how you can apply these lessons to your own organization. You will learn why and how we use:</p><ul><li>Custom query packs (and how we create and manage them).  </li><li>Variant analysis to uncover potentially insecure programming practices.</li></ul><p>We employ CodeQL in a variety of ways at GitHub.</p><ol><li> with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/codeql-query-suites#built-in-codeql-query-suites\">default and security-extended query suites</a>\nDefault setup with the default and security-extended query suites meets the needs of the vast majority of our over 10,000 repositories. With these settings, pull requests automatically get a security review from CodeQL.  </li><li>\nA few repositories, like our large Ruby monolith, need extra special attention, so we use advanced setup with a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/customizing-analysis-with-codeql-packs#about-codeql-packs\">query pack</a> containing custom queries to really tailor to our needs.  </li><li>\nTo conduct variant analysis and quick auditing, we use MRVA. We also write custom CodeQL queries to detect code patterns that are either specific to GitHub’s codebases or patterns we want a security engineer to manually review.</li></ol><p>The specific custom Actions workflow step we use on our monolith is pretty simple. It looks like this:</p><pre><code>- name: Initialize CodeQL\n    uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3\n    with:\n      languages: ${{ matrix.language }}\n      config-file: ./.github/codeql/${{ matrix.language }}/codeql-config.yml\n</code></pre><p>Our Ruby configuration is pretty standard, but advanced setup offers a variety of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#using-a-custom-configuration-file\">configuration options using custom configuration files</a>. The interesting part is the  option, which is how we enable our custom query pack as part of the CodeQL analysis. This pack contains a collection of CodeQL queries we have written for Ruby, specifically for the GitHub codebase.</p><p>So, let’s dive deeper into why we did that—and how!</p><h2>Publishing our CodeQL query pack<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/how-github-uses-codeql-to-secure-github/#publishing-our-codeql-query-pack\" aria-label=\"Publishing our CodeQL query pack\"></a></h2><p>Initially, we published CodeQL query files directly to the GitHub monolith repository, but we moved away from this approach for several reasons:</p><ul><li>It required going through the production deployment process for each new or updated query.  </li><li>Queries not included in a query pack were <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/publishing-and-using-codeql-packs#about-codeql-pack-compatibility\">not pre-compiled</a>, which slowed down CodeQL analysis in CI.  </li><li>Our <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/testing-custom-queries\">test suite for CodeQL queries</a> ran as part of the monolith’s CI jobs. When a new version of the CodeQL CLI was released, it sometimes caused the query tests to fail because of changes in the query output, even when there were no changes to the code in the pull request. This often led to confusion and frustration among engineers, as the failure wasn’t related to their pull request changes.</li></ul><p>By switching to publishing a query pack to <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry\">GitHub Container Registry (GCR)</a>, we’ve simplified our process and eliminated many of these pain points, making it easier to ship and maintain our CodeQL queries. So while it’s  to deploy custom CodeQL query files directly to a repository, we recommend publishing CodeQL queries as a query pack to the GCR for easier deployment and faster iteration.</p><p>When setting up our custom <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs#codeql-pack-structure\">query pack</a>, we faced several considerations, particularly around managing dependencies like the  package.</p><p>To ensure our custom queries remain maintainable and concise, we extend classes from the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/ruby-built-in-queries\">default query suite</a>, such as the  library. This allows us to leverage existing functionality rather than reinventing the wheel, keeping our queries concise and maintainable. However, changes to the CodeQL library API can introduce breaking changes, potentially deprecating our queries or causing errors. Since CodeQL runs as part of our CI, we wanted to minimize the chance of this happening, as this can lead to frustration and loss of trust from developers.</p><p>We develop our queries against the latest version of the  package, ensuring we’re always working with the most up-to-date functionality. To mitigate the risk of breaking changes affecting CI, we pin the  version when we’re ready to release, <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs%5C%5C#adding-and-installing-dependencies-on-a-codeql-pack\">locking it in the  file</a>. This guarantees that when our queries are deployed, they will run with the specific version of  we’ve tested, avoiding potential issues from unintentional updates.</p><p>Here’s how we manage this setup:</p><ul><li>In our qlpack.yml, we set the dependency to use the latest version of </li><li>During development, this configuration <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs#adding-and-installing-dependencies-on-a-codeql-pack%5C\">pulls in the latest version</a>) of  when running , ensuring we’re always up to date.\n<pre><code>// Our custom query pack's qlpack.yml\n\nlibrary: false\nname: github/internal-ruby-codeql\nversion: 0.2.3\nextractor: 'ruby'\ndependencies:\n  codeql/ruby-all: \"*\"\ntests: 'test'\ndescription: \"Ruby CodeQL queries used internally at GitHub\"\n</code></pre></li><li>Before releasing, we lock the version in the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs#codeql-pack-structure\"></a> file, specifying the exact version to ensure stability and prevent issues in CI.\n<pre><code>// Our custom query pack's codeql-pack.lock.yml\n\nlockVersion: 1.0.0\ndependencies:\n ...\n codeql/ruby-all:\n   version: 1.0.6\n</code></pre></li></ul><p>This approach allows us to balance developing against the latest features of the  package while ensuring stability when we release.</p><p>We also have a set of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/testing-custom-queries\">CodeQL unit tests</a> that exercise our queries against sample code snippets, which helps us quickly determine if any query will cause errors before we publish our pack. These tests are run as part of the CI process in our query pack repository, providing an early check for issues. We strongly recommend writing unit tests for your custom CodeQL queries to ensure stability and reliability.</p><p>Altogether, the basic flow for releasing new CodeQL queries via our pack is as follows:</p><ul><li>Open a pull request with the new query.  </li><li>Write unit tests for the new query.  </li><li>Increment the pack version in a new pull request.  </li><li>Run  to resolve dependencies.  </li><li>Correct unit tests as needed.  </li><li>Publish the query pack to the GitHub Container Registry (GCR).  </li><li>Repositories with the query pack in their config will start using the updated queries.</li></ul><p>We have found this flow balances our team’s development experience while ensuring stability in our published query pack.</p><h2>Configuring our repository to use our custom query pack<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/how-github-uses-codeql-to-secure-github/#configuring-our-repository-to-use-our-custom-query-pack\" aria-label=\"Configuring our repository to use our custom query pack\"></a></h2><p>We won’t provide a general recommendation on configuration here, given that it ultimately depends on how your organization deploys code. We opted against locking our pack to a particular version in our <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#using-codeql-model-packs\">CodeQL configuration file</a> (see above). Instead, we chose to manage our versioning by publishing the CodeQL package in GCR. This results in the GitHub monolith retrieving the latest published version of the query pack. To roll back changes, we simply have to republish the package. In one instance, we released a query that had a high number of false positives and we were able to publish a new version of the pack that removed that query in less than 15 minutes. This is faster than the time it would have taken us to merge a pull request on the monolith repository to roll back the version in the CodeQL configuration file.</p><p>One of the problems we encountered with publishing the query pack in GCR was how to easily make the package available to multiple repositories within our enterprise. There are several approaches we explored.</p><ul><li><strong>Grant access permissions for individual repositories.</strong> On the package management page, you can grant permissions for individual repositories to access your package. This was not a good solution for us since we have too many repositories for it to be feasible to do manually, yet there is not currently a way to configure programmatically using an API.   </li><li><strong>Mint a personal access token for the CodeQL action runner.</strong> We could have minted a personal access token (PAT) that has access to read all packages for our organization and added that to the CodeQL action runner. However, this would have required managing a new token, and it seemed a bit more permissive than we wanted because it could read  of our private packages rather than ones we explicitly allow it to have access to.  </li></ul><h2>CodeQL query pack queries<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/how-github-uses-codeql-to-secure-github/#codeql-query-pack-queries\" aria-label=\"CodeQL query pack queries\"></a></h2><p>We write a variety of custom queries to be used in our custom query packs. These cover GitHub-specific patterns that aren’t included in the default CodeQL query pack. This allows us to tailor the analysis to patterns and preferences that are specific to our company and codebase. Some of the types of things we alert on using our custom query pack include:</p><ul><li>High-risk APIs specific to GitHub’s code that can be dangerous if they receive unsanitized user input.  </li><li>Use of specific built-in Rails methods for which we have safer, custom methods or functions.    </li><li>Required authorization methods not being used in our REST API endpoint definitions and GraphQL object/mutation definitions.  </li><li>REST API endpoints and GraphQL mutations that require engineers to define access control methods to determine which actors can access them. (Specifically, the query detects the absence of this method definition to ensure that the actors’ permissions are being checked for these endpoints.)  </li><li>Use of signed tokens so we can nudge engineers to include Product Security as a reviewer when using them.</li></ul><p>Custom queries can be used more for educational purposes rather than being blockers to shipping code. For example, we want to alert engineers when they use the <a href=\"https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html#encrypt-and-decrypt\">ActiveRecord::decrypt</a> method. This method should generally not be used in production code, as it will cause an encrypted column to become decrypted. We use the recommendation severity in the <a href=\"https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/metadata-for-codeql-queries/#metadata-properties\">query metadata</a> so these alerts are treated as more of an informational alert. That means this may trigger an alert in a pull request, but it won’t cause the CodeQL CI job to fail. We use this lower severity level to allow engineers to assess the impact of new queries without immediate blocking. Additionally, this alert level isn’t tracked through our <a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/githubs-engineering-fundamentals-program-how-we-deliver-on-availability-security-and-accessibility/\">Fundamentals program</a>, meaning it doesn’t require immediate action, reflecting the query’s maturity as we continue to refine its relevance and risk assessment.</p><pre><code>/**\n * @id rb/github/use-of-activerecord-decrypt\n * @description Do not use the .decrypt method on AR models, this will decrypt all encrypted attributes and save\n * them unencrypted, effectively undoing encryption and possibly making the attributes inaccessible.\n * If you need to access the unencrypted value of any attribute, you can do so by calling my_model.attribute_name.\n * @kind problem\n * @severity recommendation\n * @name Use of ActiveRecord decrypt method\n * @tags security\n *      github-internal\n */\n\nimport ruby\nimport DataFlow\nimport codeql.ruby.DataFlow\nimport codeql.ruby.frameworks.ActiveRecord\n\n/** Match against .decrypt method calls where the receiver may be an ActiveRecord object */\nclass ActiveRecordDecryptMethodCall extends ActiveRecordInstanceMethodCall {\n  ActiveRecordDecryptMethodCall() { this.getMethodName() = \"decrypt\" }\n}\n\nfrom ActiveRecordDecryptMethodCall call\nselect call,\n  \"Do not use the .decrypt method on AR models, this will decrypt all encrypted attributes and save them unencrypted.\n</code></pre><p>Another educational query is the one mentioned above in which we detect the absence of the `control_access` method in a class that defines a REST API endpoint. If a pull request introduces a new endpoint without `control_access`,  a comment will appear on the pull request saying that the `control_access` method wasn’t found and it’s a requirement for REST API endpoints. This will notify the reviewer of a potential issue and prompt the developer to fix it.</p><pre><code>/**\n * @id rb/github/api-control-access\n * @name Rest API Without 'control_access'\n * @description All REST API endpoints must call the 'control_access' method, to ensure that only specified actor types are able to access the given endpoint.\n * @kind problem\n * @tags security\n * github-internal\n * @precision high\n * @problem.severity recommendation\n */\n\nimport codeql.ruby.AST\nimport codeql.ruby.DataFlow\nimport codeql.ruby.TaintTracking\nimport codeql.ruby.ApiGraphs\n\n// Api::App REST API endpoints should generally call the control_access method\nprivate DataFlow::ModuleNode appModule() {\n  result = API::getTopLevelMember(\"Api\").getMember(\"App\").getADescendentModule() and\n  not result = protectedApiModule() and\n  not result = staffAppApiModule()\n}\n\n// Api::Admin, Api::Staff, Api::Internal, and Api::ThirdParty REST API endpoints do not need to call the control_access method\nprivate DataFlow::ModuleNode protectedApiModule() {\n  result =\n    API::getTopLevelMember([\"Api\"])\n        .getMember([\"Admin\", \"Staff\", \"Internal\", \"ThirdParty\"])\n        .getADescendentModule()\n}\n\n// Api::Staff::App REST API endpoints do not need to call the control_access method\nprivate DataFlow::ModuleNode staffAppApiModule() {\n  result =\n    API::getTopLevelMember([\"Api\"]).getMember(\"Staff\").getMember(\"App\").getADescendentModule()\n}\n\nprivate class ApiRouteWithoutControlAccess extends DataFlow::CallNode {\n  ApiRouteWithoutControlAccess() {\n    this = appModule().getAModuleLevelCall([\"get\", \"post\", \"delete\", \"patch\", \"put\"]) and\n    not performsAccessControl(this.getBlock())\n  }\n}\n\npredicate performsAccessControl(DataFlow::BlockNode blocknode) {\n  accessControlCalled(blocknode.asExpr().getExpr())\n}\n\npredicate accessControlCalled(Block block) {\n  // the method `control_access` is called somewhere inside `block`\n  block.getAStmt().getAChild*().(MethodCall).getMethodName() = \"control_access\"\n}\n\nfrom ApiRouteWithoutControlAccess api\nselect api.getLocation(),\n  \"The control_access method was not detected in this REST API endpoint.

This is particularly useful when we’re responding to a <a href=\"https://bounty.github.com/\">bug bounty submission</a> or a security incident. We use a combination of tools to do this, including GitHub’s code search functionality, custom scripts, and CodeQL.  We will often start by using code search to find patterns similar to the one that caused a particular vulnerability across numerous repositories. This is sometimes not good enough, as code search is not semantically aware, meaning that it cannot determine whether a given variable is an Active Record object or whether it is being used in an `if` expression. To answer those types of questions we turn to CodeQL.</p><p>When we write CodeQL queries for variant analysis we are much less concerned about false positives, since the goal is to provide results for security engineers to analyze. The quality of the code is also not quite as important, as these queries will only be used for the duration of the VA effort. Some of the types of things we use CodeQL for during VAs are:</p><ul><li>Where are we using SHA1 hashes?  </li><li>One of our internal API endpoints was vulnerable to SQLi according to a recent bug bounty report. Where are we passing user input to that API endpoint?   </li><li>There is a problem with how some HTTP request libraries in Ruby handle the proxy setting. Can we look at places we are instantiating our HTTP request libraries with a proxy setting?</li></ul><p>One recent example involved a subtle vulnerability in Rails. We wanted to detect when the following condition was present in our code:</p><ul><li>A parameter was used to look up an Active Record object.  </li><li>That parameter is later reused after the Active Record object is looked up.</li></ul><p>The concern with this condition is that it could lead to an <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor\">insecure direct object</a> reference (IDOR) vulnerability because Active Record finder methods can accept an array. If the code looks up an Active Record object in one call to determine if a given entity has access to a resource, but later uses a different element from that array to find an object reference, that can lead to an IDOR vulnerability. It would be difficult to write a query to detect  vulnerable instances of this pattern, but we were able to write a query that found potential vulnerabilities that gave us a list of code paths to manually analyze. We ran the query against a large number of our Ruby codebases using CodeQL’s MRVA.</p><p>The query, which is a bit hacky and not quite production grade, is below:</p><pre><code>/**\n * @name wip array query\n * @description an array is passed to an AR finder object\n */\n\nimport ruby\nimport codeql.ruby.AST\nimport codeql.ruby.ApiGraphs\nimport codeql.ruby.frameworks.Rails\nimport codeql.ruby.frameworks.ActiveRecord\nimport codeql.ruby.frameworks.ActionController\nimport codeql.ruby.DataFlow\nimport codeql.ruby.Frameworks\nimport codeql.ruby.TaintTracking\n\n// Gets the \"final\" receiver in a chain of method calls.\n// For example, in `Foo.bar`, this would give the `Foo` access, and in\n// `foo.bar.baz(\"arg\")` it would give the `foo` variable access\nprivate Expr getUltimateReceiver(MethodCall call) {\n  exists(Expr recv |\n    recv = call.getReceiver() and\n    (\n      result = getUltimateReceiver(recv)\n      or\n      not recv instanceof MethodCall and result = recv\n    )\n  )\n}\n\n// Names of class methods on ActiveRecord models that may return one or more\n// instances of that model.

We use a combination of queries that run in CI using our query pack and one-off queries run through MRVA to find potential vulnerabilities and communicate them to engineers. CodeQL isn’t only useful for finding security vulnerabilities, though; it is also useful for detecting the presence or absence of security controls that are defined in code. This saves our security team time by surfacing certain security problems automatically, and saves our engineers time by detecting them earlier in the development process.</p><h2>Writing custom CodeQL queries<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/how-github-uses-codeql-to-secure-github/#writing-custom-codeql-queries\" aria-label=\"Writing custom CodeQL queries\"></a></h2><p>We have a large number of articles and resources for writing custom CodeQL queries.

He also came up with a formula for the\nratio between a cube and inscribed sphere as 8:5, implying the ratio of\na square’s area to an inscribed circle is √8:√5.

But instead of just tidying up, you’re making your code more efficient, maintainable, and readable, all without changing its external behavior.</p><p>Some standard ways of refactoring include:</p><ul><li><strong>Simplifying complex conditionals</strong> (because no one should need a PhD to read your  statements)  </li><li><strong>Extracting duplicated logic</strong> (so you’re not trying to maintain code in ten different places)  </li><li><strong>Improving variable and function names</strong> (because  is a crime against humanity)  </li><li><strong>Converting monolithic functions into smaller, modular pieces</strong> (to prevent the dreaded “function that spans multiple screens” scenario)</li></ul><p>Refactoring isn’t just about tidiness—it’s about making your codebase more resilient, scalable, and enjoyable to work with. Let’s find out how GitHub Copilot can help you do it faster and with fewer headaches.</p><h2>Know what your code does before you refactor anything<a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-refactor-code-with-github-copilot/#know-what-your-code-does-before-you-refactor-anything\" aria-label=\"Know what your code does before you refactor anything\"></a></h2><p>It might seem obvious to say this, but before you can refactor any code you need to understand how it works. If you don’t know what your code is doing, you won’t know whether or not the “improvements” you’re making are changing the core functionality of the code.</p><p>Consider the following method:</p><pre><code>public String getSound(String animal) {\n  if (animal == null) {\n      System.out.println(\"Oops! A null animal?\");\n  } else if (animal.equalsIgnoreCase(\"Dog\")) {\n      return \"Bark\";\n  } else if ( animal.equalsIgnoreCase(\"Cat\")) {\n      return \"Meow\";\n  } else if ( animal.equalsIgnoreCase(\"Bird\")) {\n      return \"Tweet\";\n  }\n  return \"Unknown\";\n}\n</code></pre><p>You might look at this and immediately think “they should use a switch statement,” and that would be one example of refactoring the code. But having that knee jerk reaction requires you to know how if-statements and switch-statements work. You can only make that suggestion if you understand this code will continue cycling through if-statements until it finds an appropriate match. Otherwise, it will return the value of .</p><p>As codebases get more complex and make calls between multiple files, this gets (much) more complicated. And this is one way Copilot can help you.</p><p>You can ask Copilot Chat to explain how some code works, either by asking in plain language or using the /explain slash command. To limit the scope of what Copilot looks at, select the code in your IDE before asking your query, or specify specific files for it to consider by using . While you’re at it, you can even ask it to add code comments to help you (or anyone else reading the code) in the future.</p><p><strong>Here are some sample prompts:</strong></p><ul><li><code>Explain what this code does.</code></li><li><code>Add comments to this code to make it more understandable.</code></li></ul><p>You should use Copilot Chat to analyze and explain your codebase until you fully understand the code you’re looking to refactor.</p><h2>Try some blanket improvements to refactor your code<a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-refactor-code-with-github-copilot/#try-some-blanket-improvements-to-refactor-your-code\" aria-label=\"Try some blanket improvements to refactor your code\"></a></h2><p>Like most things in life, it’s usually best to start small. When you’re first getting started with refactoring code, keep it simple: open up Copilot Chat in your project and ask “how would you improve this?” Just like when you are asking GitHub Copilot to explain some code, you can specify what it looks at by highlighting sections of code or identifying specific files by using .</p><p><strong>Here are some sample prompts:</strong></p><ul><li><code>How would you improve this?</code></li><li><code>Improve the variable names in this function.</code></li><li><code>#file:pageInit.js, #file:socketConnector.js Offer suggestions to simplify this code.</code></li></ul><p>Copilot will then offer suggestions to improve the code in the way that you specified. This is great for getting started, but Copilot can do much more if you give it some guidance.</p><p>When working with any generative AI-powered developer tool, it is often useful to include more context in your prompts—ones that are more likely to get you the results you’re looking for. By being specific about what you want the tool to do, it focuses the efforts toward that end.</p><p>It’s a bit like if someone tells you to code something, and you have so many ideas and questions that you’re not quite sure where to begin. But if someone tells you they specifically want you to code a class that sorts a list, you can focus on the task at hand.</p><p>The prompts above don’t offer much specificity or context, which leaves Copilot to explore all the possible ways your code could be improved. The upside? You may see options that you might not have considered. The downside is some of the proposed solutions might not address your specific concerns.</p><h2>Make a plan for refactoring your codebase<a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-refactor-code-with-github-copilot/#make-a-plan-for-refactoring-your-codebase\" aria-label=\"Make a plan for refactoring your codebase\"></a></h2><p>What do you want to do to your code? Do you want to make it more readable? Or do you want to find redundant code and remove it? Coming up with a plan for the improvements you want to make will help you to hit your goals. This comes back to making sure you understand your code. If you know how it works, you can come up with a plan for the type of improvements that you want to make.</p><p>Maybe your code base has a bunch of different scripts that all perform the same general function. You could strip out the code into a common module to import into each of the different scripts, making the code easier to change and maintain.</p><p>To do so, you can direct Copilot to look for these common code sections and to pull them into a single module.</p><pre><code>Inspect all my js files for GitHub API calls and create a new class that will manage all the GitHub API calls.\n</code></pre><p>Now that we have provided some guidance and additional context, Copilot will provide suggestions targeting this specific improvement that we want to make to our code.</p><p>You can also provide a laundry list of tasks, or ask Copilot to keep things in mind while it is doing the refactoring.</p><p><strong>In that vein, here’s a sample prompt to consider:</strong></p><pre><code>Can you refactor the GitHubController class to:\n- remove nested logic structures\n- make the code more concise\n- while doing this, check if the code is safe and add comments if not\n</code></pre><p>The takeaway here is Copilot is very good at taking directions—and the more specific your directions are, the more it will generate outputs in line with your intended end goal.</p><h2>A real-world example: Using GitHub Copilot to refactor code<a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-refactor-code-with-github-copilot/#a-real-world-example-using-github-copilot-to-refactor-code\" aria-label=\"A real-world example: Using GitHub Copilot to refactor code\"></a></h2><p>Sometimes the best way to understand something is to see it in use. To help with this, we wanted to share an experience where we needed to use GitHub Copilot to refactor our own code, interspersed with some general guidance and pointers.</p><p>It started with a couple of organizations independently requesting help with their individual large migration projects, which involved moving from other data centers into tens of thousands of repositories on GitHub. After building a proof of concept, we started creating individual systems, each tailored to the needs of the individual customer and their unique systems. While we were doing this, a third organization made a similar request for help, and we realized this was a common need.</p><p>At this point in time, we had two systems that were both suited for large-scale migrations, but each of them was heavily customized for the original company making the request. We quickly realized the best solution involved refactoring our code to improve its modularity so we could use it across different organizations. This would not be easy—the codebase was made up of several different scripts and workflows with a lot of moving parts. And that’s when we turned to Copilot for help.</p><p>First we came up with a plan. We created a set of high-level goals and used these to guide us during the refactoring process. We wanted to make sure the code was:</p><ul><li><strong>Modular and reusable for different organizations:</strong> The code should be organized into small, self-contained modules that could be reused and combined for new functionality.  </li><li> The code should be easy to maintain and extend as needed. That meant making it well-organized, well-documented, and easy to understand.  </li><li><strong>Customizable for different organizations:</strong> The code should be flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each organization.  </li><li><strong>Following coding standards and best practices:</strong> The code should be consistent, readable, and easy to understand.</li></ul><p>With this plan in place, it was time to ask Copilot for help.</p><h3>Step 1: Creating the initial module<a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-refactor-code-with-github-copilot/#step-1-creating-the-initial-module\" aria-label=\"Step 1: Creating the initial module\"></a></h3><p>Our first step was creating a common module we could import into each of the different scripts. This would allow us to reuse the same code across many different scripts, making it easier to maintain and extend. We created a skeleton of a module called . Then we used Copilot to fill in the details.</p><p><strong>Here was the prompt we gave Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>I am creating a module, gh-migrations, which will hold common functionality to be used through out my project. I have already created an index.js for the module. Please inspect the other js files for GitHub API calls, create a new class for the module which will manage all GitHub API calls. This class should also account for rate limiting and errors.

The next step was putting these changes into a separate file while ensuring the  file could reference it.</p><p><strong>Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>Rename the class GitHubApiManager to GHApi and put it in a separate file that is referenced in the index.js file.\n</code></pre><p><strong>And here was Copilot’s response:</strong></p><pre><code>I'll help you split the code into two files.

Be aware, we didn’t want to refactor the code directly at this stage. Instead, we wanted to create a common module we could use for refactoring code later.</p><p><strong>Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>The gh-api.js file is a new class that will be used to manage all GitHub API calls.

Since our application is a migration tool managed via GitHub Issues, we wanted to create classes for the following entities:</p><ul><li> represent repository migrations from various sources. They contain configuration and metadata about the repository and how the migration should be performed.  </li><li> represent a batch of migrations. They contain more high-level metadata about groups of individual migration issues such as custom application ids and status of the batch.  </li><li> represent the migration of a group of users, their associated repositories, and the permissions to those repositories.  </li><li> represent Azure DevOps pipelines rewire operations. They allow for the reconfiguration of Azure DevOps pipelines to point to the new GitHub repositories after a migration has been completed.</li></ul><p><strong>Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>Review the create-migration-issue.js and develop a new class called MigrationIssue that contains the properties associated with a migration. This shoud be added to the gh-migrations module where index.js is located.\n</code></pre><p><strong>And here was Copilot’s response:</strong></p><pre><code>I'll help create a new MigrationIssue class based on the migration configuration and status shown in the code. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Create a new file migration-issue.js in the gh-migrations directory\n2. Update the index.js file to expose the new class\n3. Extract configuration and status properties from the create-migration-issues.js file into the new class\n\nmigration-issue.js\nCreate a new class to represent a migration issue with all necessary properties and methods.\n\n&lt;code&gt;\n\nindex.js\nUpdate the index.js to expose the new MigrationIssue class.\n\n&lt;code&gt;\n\nThe new MigrationIssue class encapsulates all the properties that were previously spread across various objects in the create-migration-issues.js file. It provides a clean interface for creating and managing migration issues, with helper methods for generating issue titles and source types.\n\nYou can now use this class in create-migration-issues.js by replacing the manual object creation with the MigrationIssue class. For example, the createMigrationConfig function could be replaced with:\n\n&lt;code&gt;\n</code></pre><p>The process for creating new classes for the other entities was similar to the above. We created new classes for , , and , each with their own properties and methods.</p><p>After we built out our entity classes, we realized they should manage their own state. This is a common pattern in object-oriented programming, where the class is responsible for managing its state and behavior. Remember our goal about following good coding standards?</p><p>The class should include methods to get and set the state of the object, as well as methods to perform actions on the object. It should also be responsible for utilizing the GitHub API and manage the state of the object rather than the client code. This will help standardize and protect the state of the object, as well as give the client code a simpler interface to work with.</p><p><strong>Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>The MigrationIssue class should contain a initializer that uses the gh-api.js to create the resulting GitHub Issue. The initializer should take in an optional parameter called issueNumber, if the issueNumber is omitted the initializer should create a new Migration Issue and return the issue number created, if the issueNumber is passed to the initializer, the gh-api.js should be used to return the title and body of the issue which the class will parse to create the properties of the MigrationIssue.\n</code></pre><p><strong>And here was Copilot’s response:</strong></p><pre><code>I'll help you modify the code to add initialization logic to the MigrationIssue class. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Add a static method to parse issue body into configuration\n2. Add initialization methods to handle both new and existing issues\n3. Modify constructor to accept GHApi instance\n4. Add method to generate issue body\n5. Add method to create or load issue\n\nmigration-issue.js\nUpdate the MigrationIssue class to handle initialization from GHApi.\n\n&lt;code&gt;\n\nThe main changes include:\n\n1. Constructor now accepts a GHApi instance as first parameter\n2. Added parseIssueBody static method to parse configuration from issue body\n3. Added generateIssueBody method to create the issue body format\n4. Added initialize async method that either creates a new issue or loads an existing one\n5. The initialize method returns the issue number in both cases\n\nTo use this updated class:\n\n&lt;code&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Remember how we said it’s always important to review suggestions from Copilot? In this case, the  method wasn’t connected to the constructor, like we would expect. We asked Copilot to address this issue with an iterative prompt.</p><p><strong>Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>The MigrationIssue class has an initialize function that encapsulates functionality that should be included in the constructor. Rewire the constuctor method to include the initialzie function.\n</code></pre><p><strong>And here was Copilot’s response:</strong></p><pre><code>Let's modify the class to move the initialization logic into the constructor. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Make constructors async\n2. Move initialization logic into constructor\n3. Remove separate initialize method\n4. Keep static parseIssueBody method\n\nmigration-issue.js\nMove initialization logic into constructor.\n\n&lt;code&gt;\n\nThe main changes:\n\n1. Removed initialize method from the class\n2. Added static create and load factory methods\n3. Added save method to handle issue creation\n4. Constructor remains synchronous but now only handles property initialization\n\nUsage example:\n\n&lt;code&gt;\n\nThis approach follows better object-oriented principles by:\n\n1. Using factory methods for different creation scenarios\n2. Keeping the constructor simple and synchronous\n3. Separating issue creation into a distinct operation\n4. Making the API more intuitive\n</code></pre><p>In this case, Copilot suggested a different approach than we were thinking of with a factory method (which is a great way to handle different scenarios when creating or loading an issue). Even if it wasn’t what we were thinking, it worked and also kept the constructor clean and focused on just initializing the object. Moreover, the  method is a good way to encapsulate the logic for creating a new issue, and it makes the code more readable.</p><p>Now we just needed to repeat this process with each of the new classes we added.</p><h3>Step 4: Final refactoring<a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-refactor-code-with-github-copilot/#step-4-final-refactoring\" aria-label=\"Step 4: Final refactoring\"></a></h3><p>After we built a common module, we needed to refactor the client code to make it much cleaner and easier to read and maintain. After that, we’d also be able to identify and add any missing functionality in the common module.</p><p>This was an iterative process, and we needed to go back and forth between the client code and the common module to make sure everything worked properly. Because of the way this project evolved, it afforded us the opportunity to make sweeping changes to the codebase. It’s much more common to make small, incremental changes to the codebase, especially if it’s code that’s actively in use. In both of these cases, don’t forget to write tests to ensure the code works as expected.</p><p><strong>Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>Using the gh-migrations module, refactor the create-migration-issues.js\n</code></pre><p><strong>And here was Copilot’s response:</strong></p><pre><code>I'll help you refactor the create-migration-issues.js file to use the gh-migrations module.

For example, this is how we used Copilot to help with refactoring the  script.</p><p><strong>Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:</strong></p><pre><code>Using the gh-migrations module refactor the create-team-issues.js\n</code></pre><p><strong>And here was Copilot’s response:</strong></p><pre><code>I'll help you refactor the create-team-issues.js file to use the gh-migrations module.

Reduces code duplication by using a loop for team creation\n\nThe code is now more maintainable and follows the same pattern as the migration issues implementation.\n</code></pre><p>From there, it was a matter of rinsing and repeating this process with each of our scripts.</p><p>By first creating the common module, we could guide Copilot  and make sure that the final, refactored codebase was something we could use with multiple organizations. It gave us a foundation we could reuse and customize based on the needs of the system we were migrating.</p><p>Sometimes refactoring code can be really easy, like our first example with the sequential  statements. But the more you dig into it, the more it grows, and you might find yourself facing down the Herculean task of trying to refactor a codebase that stretches across multiple files from a larger team of developers.</p><p>Speaking from experience: It can be daunting to even know where to start.</p><p>Remember to take a step back and start with the basics. Your first step should always be improving your  understanding of the codebase you want to refactor. The more you know about what you’re starting out with, the greater chance that you will be able to think of ways to refactor it effectively. And once you come up with some ideas, you can always ask GitHub Copilot to help turn your vision into reality.

To enable such teams to provide new features efficiently, it is desirable to minimize the need for coordination between them. This calls for a modularization that verticalizes the system into low-coupled areas individual teams can take care&nbsp;of.</p><p>There are several possibilities for implementing such high-level modules (also called verticals). For instance, they can be implemented using a respective folder structure or in the form of several libraries in a Monorepo. Micro Frontends go one step further and designate a separate application for each vertical. This architectural style promises several advantages, such as a high amount of team autonomy, but it also comes with numerous challenges.</p><p>The first part of this article provides a critical overview of the benefits and drawbacks of Micro Frontends in the space of single-page applications. The second part discusses how such an architecture can be implemented with Native Federation, a community project built upon web standards that provide close integration with the Angular&nbsp;CLI.</p><h3>Motivation Behind Micro Frontends</h3><p>Like Micro Services, Micro Frontends promise several advantages, both technically and with respect to the organization. As applying Micro Frontend architectures results in several smaller applications, testing, performance tuning, and isolating faults in one part of the overarching system becomes more effortless, according to several&nbsp;sources.</p><p>However, the increased team autonomy was the main reason for applying this architectural style in the numerous cases I was involved in as a consultant. Individual teams are not blocked by waiting for other teams and can deploy separately anytime. This might not be a significant concern in a vast number of projects. Still, as soon as we talk about multi-team projects in a corporate environment with long communication paths and decision times, this aspect quickly becomes vital for the project’s success.</p><p>Teams can also make their own decisions that best fit their goals — architecturally and technology-wise. Mixing multiple client-side frameworks in the same application is considered an anti-pattern and should be avoided. However, it can help to create a migration path over to a new stack in the long run. The concern in corporate environments is that we find software solutions that usually outlive the average technology stack</p><p>Since Micro Frontends result in separate build processes, combining them with incremental builds, where only changed applications need to be rebuilt, has a massive potential for build-time improvements. For instance, the well-known <a href=\"https://nx.dev/\">Nx build system</a> provides this option. Interestingly, this feature can also be used without applying other aspects such as aligning teams with individual applications or separate deployments. There is debate about whether leveraging this tempting option automatically leads to micro frontend architectures.</p><p>A system consisting of several smaller applications can provide further organizational advantages: It’s easier to onboard new members and scale the development by adding further micro frontends. Team autonomy also leads to faster release&nbsp;cycles.</p><h3>Challenges to keep in&nbsp;mind</h3><p>Every architectural decision has consequences that need to be evaluated, and Micro Frontends are no exception. Besides the positive consequences outlined above, there are also several negative ones to consider.</p><p>For instance, individually developed Micro Frontends can diverge in UI/UX, leading to an inconsistent appearance. Also, loading several applications increases the number of bundles that need to be downloaded, adversely affecting loading times and increasing the memory pressure.</p><p>Splitting an application into low-coupled parts might be a best practice in general. However, it is often hard to define the boundaries between verticals clearly enough to implement them as individual applications. Also, while having several small applications at first glance simplifies the implementation, integrating them into an overarching solution brings additional complexity.</p><p>This leads to one of the biggest challenges I have seen in practice: we are moving away from a compile-time integration towards a runtime integration. This has severe consequences because we cannot easily foresee problems that might arise when individually developed and deployed applications start interacting at runtime. Besides the chance of technical conflicts, we also have to see that the current generation of SPA frameworks has not been built with such an operation mode in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Instead, modern SPA frameworks, especially Angular, have been developed to focus on compile time optimizations. A powerful compiler leverages type checks to identify technical conflicts and emits efficient source code optimized for tree-shaking. Furthermore, the CLI in the Angular space provides a highly optimized build process. An off-label usage necessary for implementing Micro Frontends undermines some of these achievements.</p><h3>Angular Does Not Officially Support Micro Frontends</h3><p>For all the outlined reasons, the Angular team recommends checking if alternatives, like implementing the individual verticals in Monorepos, which can be compiled together, are suitable. For instance, Google adopted this approach years ago and manages all its products and libraries in a <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2854146\">single Monorepo</a>.</p><p>Of course, there are also ways to compensate for the disadvantages outlined here, and some of them, like establishing a design system to help with a consistent UI/UX or lazy loading individual system parts, might be needed in general. More details on such compensation strategies can be found in this <a href=\"https://www.angulararchitects.io/blog/consequences-of-micro-frontends-survey-results\">survey</a> of more than 150 Micro Frontend practitioners.</p><p>All architectural decisions have benefits and drawbacks and should be evaluated with those considerations if you are going to implement a solution. If such an evaluation reveals that Micro Frontends provide more advantages than alternatives for achieving your very goals, the following sections provide you a well-lit path for implementing this architectural pattern with&nbsp;Angular.</p><h3>Micro Frontends with Federation</h3><p><a href=\"https://module-federation.io/\">Module Federation</a> is a popular technology for implementing Micro Frontends and sharing dependencies. Shipped initially with webpack 5, it comes with a tooling-agnostic runtime and provides compile-time integration into  and . Besides the usage of the vite dev server, these technologies are currently not supported by the Angular CLI. However, promising community solutions like <a href=\"https://angular-rspack.dev/\"></a>and <a href=\"https://analogjs.org/\">AnalogJS</a> allow them to be used with Angular. <a href=\"https://nx.dev/\">Nx</a> and my <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation\">CLI-plugin</a> provide an effortless integration.</p><p>Module Federation enables an application to load parts of other separately built and deployed applications lazily. The loading application is referred to as the host; the integrated ones are called&nbsp;remotes:</p><p>Federation, if permitted by the library version, can share dependencies like Angular or RxJS between the host and remotes. There are several configuration options for <a href=\"https://www.angulararchitects.io/blog/getting-out-of-version-mismatch-hell-with-module-federation/\">preventing version mismatches.</a> Since MF can only decide which dependencies to share at runtime, tree-shaking for shared parts is not possible.</p><p>To inform the host about the remotes and their shared dependencies, Module Federation creates a metadata file, the so-called remote entry, during the build. This file needs to be loaded into the&nbsp;host.</p><p>To fully decouple the idea of Federation from specific bundlers, I started the project <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/native-federation\">Native Federation</a> several years ago. Its API surface is very similar to that of Module Federation. The focus is on portability and standards like ECMAScript modules and Import Maps. Its compile time acts as a wrapper around existing bundlers. For the communication with the bundler, it uses an exchangeable adapter:</p><p>The integration into the Angular CLI directly delegates to Angular’s  that leverages the fast bundler esbuild, and is the foundation for several current features like partial hydration. Because of its architecture, Native Federation can also be ported to further builders or other innovations the CLI might provide in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>For integrating Micro Frontends built with Angular’s webpack-based builder, there is a <a href=\"https://www.angulararchitects.io/blog/combining-native-federation-and-module-federation/\">bridging solution</a> allowing the loading of such remotes into a Native Federation host. This solution enables the gradual adoption of the CLI’s new  and permits the sharing of dependencies between the two kinds of Federation. One of the features added recently is support for <a href=\"https://www.angulararchitects.io/blog/ssr-and-hydration-with-native-federation-for-angular/\">SSR and Hydration</a>, which is vital for performance-critical applications like public portals and web&nbsp;shops.</p><p>Native Federation for Angular is close to the CLI’s , but its compilation mode is for shared dependencies differs. While it works well for packages that align with <a href=\"https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\">Angular’s Package Format</a>, which is the case for all libraries built with the CLI, other libraries might provide some challenges, especially older ones that still use CommonJS or older conventions for providing metadata.</p><h3>Using Native Federation in&nbsp;Angular</h3><p>For the setup Native Federation provides a schematic:</p><pre>ng add @angular-architects/native-federation --project mfe1 --port 4201 --type remote</pre><p>The switch  defines the kind of the application. Possible options are , , and . The latter is a host configured with a configuration file (federation manifest) during application start. This manifest informs the application of the locations of the remotes and can be switched out by another manifest during deployment:</p><pre>{    \"mfe1\" : \"http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.json\"</pre><p>The key, in this case, is a short name the host uses to refer to the Micro Frontend. The value is the location of the remote entry with the metadata mentioned above. Alternatively, the manifest can be replaced by a service that informs the host of the current location of all deployed remotes and acts as a Micro Frontend registry.</p><p>The schematic configures the Native Federation builder delegation to the  and creates a configuration file :</p><pre>const { withNativeFederation, shareAll }     = require('@angular-architects/native-federation/config');<p>module.exports = withNativeFederation({</p>    './Component': './projects/mfe1/src/app/app.component.ts',    ...shareAll({}),    'rxjs/ajax',    'rxjs/testing',    // Add further packages you don't need at runtime</pre><p>The configuration assigns a unique name to the remote or host and defines which dependencies to share. Instead of providing an exhaustive list of all the dependencies to share, the configuration uses the helper function , which adds all dependencies found in the project’s . The skip list is used to opt out of sharing some of them or their secondary entry&nbsp;points.</p><p>Remotes also define exposed EcmaScript modules that can be loaded into the shell. For this, the  node maps the paths of the modules to short names such as&nbsp; in the example&nbsp;shown.</p><p>The schematic also adds code to initialize Native Federation to the . For the host, this code points to the federation manifest:</p><pre>import { initFederation } from '@angular-architects/native-federation';<p>initFederation('federation.manifest.json')</p>  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err))<p>  .then(_ =&gt; import('./bootstrap'))</p>  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));</pre><p>After initializing federation, the file , also created by the schematic, is loaded. It contains the usual code for bootstrapping Angular, e.g., via  when the application uses Standalone Components.</p><p>To load a component or routing configuration exposed by a remote, traditional lazy loading is combined with Native Federation’s  function:</p><pre>import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/native-federation';<p>export const APP_ROUTES: Routes = [</p>  [...]    path: 'flights',      loadRemoteModule('mfe1', './Component').then((m) =&gt; m.AppComponent),];</pre><p>Here,  is the key defined in the manifest, and&nbsp; points to the respective exposed module in the remote’s federation configuration.</p><p>More information on Native Federation can be found in this <a href=\"https://www.angulararchitects.io/blog/micro-frontends-with-modern-angular-part-1-standalone-and-esbuild/\">blog article</a> and in the project’s <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/native-federation\">readme</a>, which also links to a tutorial.</p><p>Micro Frontends promise significant advantages for enterprise-scale applications, such as enhanced team autonomy and independent deployment. These benefits make this architectural style particularly appealing in multi-team corporate environments where streamlined communication and rapid development cycles are critical. Additionally, they support gradual migration to new technologies and optimize build times by leveraging incremental builds.</p><p>However, these advantages come with trade-offs. Micro Frontends can lead to inconsistent UI/UX, increased load times, and complex runtime integrations. Defining clear vertical boundaries and managing inter-application communication add to the challenge. Furthermore, frameworks like Angular, designed for compile-time optimization, face limitations in runtime integration scenarios. The Angular team, therefore, recommends alternatives such as splitting an application into libraries managed within a Monorepo, which aligns better with Angular’s strengths in type safety and efficient compilation.</p><p>Module Federation has emerged as a popular solution to address some challenges by enabling lazy loading and dependency sharing. Native Federation builds on these concepts with a focus on standards and portability. It provides a seamless integration into the Angular CLI and its performant esbuild-based , which is also the foundation for advanced features like SSR and hydration.</p><p><em>Together with this team at </em><a href=\"http://www.angulararchitects.io\"></a>,<em> Manfred Steyer helps companies around the globe establish maintainable Angular-based Architectures.

The name reflects our belief that artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t replacing the developer. Instead, it’s always on their side. And like any good first officer, Copilot can also fly by itself: for example, when providing pull request feedback, autofixing security vulnerabilities, or brainstorming on how to implement an issue.</p><p>Today, we are <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot/whats-new?utm_source=agent-awakens-announcement&amp;utm_medium=blogtop&amp;utm_campaign=agentic-ai\">upgrading GitHub Copilot</a> with the force of even more agentic AI – introducing agent mode and announcing the General Availability of Copilot Edits, both in VS Code. We are adding Gemini 2.0 Flash to the model picker for all Copilot users. And we unveil a first look at Copilot’s new autonomous agent, codenamed Project Padawan. From code completions, chat, and multi-file edits to workspace and agents, Copilot puts the human at the center of the creative work that is software development. AI helps with the things you don’t want to do, so you have more time for the things you do.</p><h2>Agent mode available in preview 🤖<a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/#agent-mode-available-in-preview-%f0%9f%a4%96\" aria-label=\"Agent mode available in preview 🤖\"></a></h2><p>GitHub Copilot’s new agent mode is capable of iterating on its own code, recognizing errors, and fixing them automatically. It can suggest terminal commands and ask you to execute them. It also analyzes run-time errors with self-healing capabilities.</p><p>In agent mode, Copilot will iterate on not just its own output, but the result of that output. And it will iterate until it has completed all the subtasks required to complete your prompt. Instead of performing just the task you requested, Copilot now has the ability to infer additional tasks that were not specified, but are also necessary for the primary request to work. Even better, it can catch its own errors, freeing you up from having to copy/paste from the terminal back into chat.</p><p>Here’s an example where GitHub Copilot builds a web app to track marathon training:</p><p>To get started, you’ll need to download VS Code Insiders and then enable the agent mode setting for GitHub Copilot Chat:</p><p>Then, when in the Copilot Edits panel, switch from Edit to Agent right next to the model picker:</p><p>Agent mode will change the way developers work in their editor; and as such, we will bring it to all IDEs that Copilot supports. We also know that today’s Insiders build isn’t perfect, and welcome your feedback as we improve both VS Code and the underlying agentic technology in the coming months.</p><h2>Copilot Edits, now GA in VS Code 🎉<a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/#copilot-edits-now-ga-in-vs-code-%f0%9f%8e%89\" aria-label=\"Copilot Edits, now GA in VS Code 🎉\"></a></h2><p>Announced at GitHub Universe in October last year, Copilot Edits combines the best of Chat and Inline Chat with a conversational flow and the ability to make inline changes across a set of files that you manage. <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues/95\">The feedback</a><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues/1098\">you provided in the past</a> was instrumental in shipping this feature as GA in VS Code today. Thank you!</p><p>In Copilot Edits you specify a set of files to be edited, and then use natural language to ask GitHub Copilot for what you need. Copilot Edits makes inline changes in your workspace, across multiple files, using a UI designed for fast iteration. You stay in the flow of your code while reviewing the suggested changes, accepting what works, and iterating with follow-up asks.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Copilot Edits leverages a dual-model architecture to enhance editing efficiency and accuracy. First, a foundation language model considers a full context of the Edits session to generate initial edit suggestions. You can choose the foundation language model that you prefer between: OpenAI’s GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and now, Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash. For the optimal experience, we developed a speculative decoding endpoint, optimized for fast application of changes in files. The proposed edits from the foundation model are sent to the speculative decoding endpoint that will then propose those changes inline in the editor.</p><p>Copilot Edits works because it puts you in control, from setting the right context to accepting changes. The experience is iterative: when the model gets it wrong, you can review changes across multiple files, accept good ones and iterate until, together with Copilot, you arrive at the right solution. After accepting changes, you can run the code to verify the changes and, when needed, undo in Copilot Edits to get back to a previous working state. Copilot Edits is in the Secondary Side Bar (default on the right) so that you can interact with views in the Primary Side Bar, such as the Explorer, Debug, or Source Control view, while you’re reviewing proposed changes. For example, you can have unit tests running in the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/testing\">Testing view</a> on the left, while using the Copilot Edits view on the right, so that in every iteration you can verify if the changes Copilot Edits proposed are passing your unit tests.</p><p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/voice\">Using your voice</a> is a natural experience while using Copilot Edits. Just talking to Copilot makes the back and forth smooth and conversational. It almost feels like interacting with a colleague with area expertise, using the same kind of iterative flow that you would use in real-life pair programming.</p><p>Next on our roadmap is to improve the performance of the apply changes speculative decoding endpoint, support transitions into Copilot Edits from Copilot Chat by preserving context, suggest files to the working set, and allow you to undo suggested chunks. If you want to be among the first to get your hands on these improvements, make sure to use <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\">VS Code Insiders</a> and the pre-release version of the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat\">GitHub Copilot Chat</a> extension. To help improve the feature, <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release?utm_source=agent-awakens-announcement&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=agentic-ai\">please file issues in our repo</a>.</p><p>Beyond the GA in VS Code, Copilot Edits is now in preview for Visual Studio 2022.</p><h2>Project Padawan: SWE agents on GitHub<a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/#project-padawan-swe-agents-on-github\" aria-label=\"Project Padawan: SWE agents on GitHub\"></a></h2><p>We’re excited to share a first look at our autonomous SWE agent and how we envision these types of agents will fit into the GitHub user experience. When the product we are building under the codename Project Padawan ships later this year, it will allow you to directly assign issues to GitHub Copilot, using any of the GitHub clients, and have it produce fully tested pull requests. Once a task is finished, Copilot will assign human reviewers to the PR, and work to resolve feedback they add. In a sense, it will be like onboarding Copilot as a contributor to every repository on GitHub. ✨</p><p>Behind the scenes, Copilot automatically spins up a secure cloud sandbox for every task it’s assigned. It then asynchronously clones the repository, sets up the environment, analyzes the codebase, edits the necessary files, and builds, tests, and lints the code. Additionally, Copilot takes into account any discussion within the issue or PR, and any custom instruction within the repository, so it understands the full intent of its task, as well as the guidelines and conventions of the project.</p><p>And just as we did with Copilot Extensions and the model picker in Copilot, we will also provide opportunities to integrate into this AI-native workflow and work closely with partners and customers in a tight feedback loop. We believe the end-state of Project Padawan will result in transforming how teams manage critical-yet-mundane tasks, such as fixing bugs or creating and maintaining automated tests. Because ultimately, it’s all about empowering developers by allowing them to focus on what matters, and letting copilots do the rest. And don’t worry. We will have patience, so the agent won’t turn to the dark side. 😉</p>","contentLength":7446,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"5 tips for promoting your open source project","url":"https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/5-tips-for-promoting-your-open-source-project/","date":1738861207,"author":"Klint Finley","guid":82,"unread":true,"content":"<p>After months or years of hard work, you’ve just pushed your open source project to GitHub and made it public. Now it’s time to tell the world about it.</p><p>Chances are you’d rather spend time writing code than getting the word out about your project. Maybe your project will go viral and you won’t have to spend much time on marketing. But chances are you’re going to need to do some work to build awareness, at least in the early days. Fortunately, there are plenty of people who have been down this path and are willing to help. In this article, experienced maintainers offer their advice on sharing open source projects with the world.</p><p>Start with the obvious. Post to social media about your project. Submit it to Hacker News, Reddit, Product Hunt, and similar sites. Then keep an eye peeled for people who have the problem that you’re trying to solve. Respond to their posts and let them know you have a potential solution. Reach out to podcasts and YouTube channels. Submit talks to conferences. Offer to speak at meetups.</p><p>Keep promoting your work as you improve the project. Remember that people want to hear about helpful tools that solve real problems, as long as you’re genuinely trying to help, and not just spamming your followers. You might not be comfortable with self promotion, but you need to promote your work to get it out there. “You shouldn’t feel icky about it,” <a href=\"https://github.com/aarondfrancis/sidecar\">Sidecar</a> maintainer <a href=\"https://github.com/aarondfrancis\">Aaron Francis</a><a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/marketing-for-maintainers-how-to-promote-your-project-to-both-users-and-contributors/\">told us in a Q&amp;A</a>. “You put a lot of time into making something helpful.”</p><h2>Focus on the problem your project solves<a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/5-tips-for-promoting-your-open-source-project/#focus-on-the-problem-your-project-solves\" aria-label=\"Focus on the problem your project solves\"></a></h2><p>What should you say when you’re promoting your work? First and foremost, you need to know what problem your project solves and be able to communicate that to potential users as simply as possible. “One of the biggest mistakes I see is the use of too much technical terminology,” says <a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui\">Chakra UI</a> maintainer <a href=\"https://github.com/segunadebayo\">Segun Adebayo</a>. It might be tempting to talk about the technologies you’ve built your solution upon, or the latest buzzwords you think users might be interested in. Open source users are, after all, often your fellow developers and technical people. But it’s easy to go overboard and obscure the value of the project.</p><p>For example, your project might make clever use of decentralized computing principles, points out <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tashy/\">Tasha Drew</a>, co-chair for Kubernetes’ Working Group for Multi-tenancy, but what people really care about is why they should use it. “What’s the message you want people to take away from your webpage or your README? It’s probably not related to the theory behind the code,” she says.</p><p>Use that core message everywhere: Social media posts and profiles, blog posts, tutorials, etc.</p><h2>Document, document, document!<a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/5-tips-for-promoting-your-open-source-project/#document-document-document\" aria-label=\"Document, document, document!\"></a></h2><p>Getting someone’s attention is only one part of the battle. If you want people to actually use, share, and contribute to your project, you need clear, up-to-date documentation. “Write as much as you can stand to write,” Francis says. Not only will it make your user experience better, it might even improve your code. “If you find it’s hard to document a particular feature, that’s probably a sign that it’s too complicated and you need to simplify it,” he explains.</p><p>Think beyond just documenting the code. You should provide things like quick starts, tutorials, and screencasts. “Video is really helpful for a lot of people,” Adebayo says. “People learn in different ways so it’s important to provide different types of content.”</p><p>No matter how good your documentation is, people are still going to have questions—and, if you’re lucky, pull requests. It’s important to be responsive, especially when you’re just starting out. “Time is finite, we only get one life, so value those people who are willing to spend some of their precious resources on you,” Francis says. “That applies not just to people sending pull requests, but to people pointing out problems or making suggestions on social media as well.”</p><p>That doesn’t mean you have to be on call 24/7 to provide an immediate reply to every single question and comment. But it does mean you shouldn’t let pull requests, issues, and comments sit for too long without a response. You have to let people know your project is active, and that you value their input. “It might be intimidating at first to interact with people you don’t know, but you have to do it if you want to grow,” says Adebayo. “This is a sure way to meet new people and make new friends that might be helpful to you in the future.”</p><h2>Invest time in onboarding contributors<a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/5-tips-for-promoting-your-open-source-project/#invest-time-in-onboarding-contributors\" aria-label=\"Invest time in onboarding contributors\"></a></h2><p>You need to document both how to use your project, and how to contribute to it. Create CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files with your contribution guidelines and code of conduct. These let potential contributors know that you’re open to contributions and that you’ve put some thought into working with others. It’s especially helpful to provide a list of what you would, and would not, like potential contributors to help with.</p><p>Remember that <a href=\"https://github.com/readme/featured/open-source-non-code-contributions\">non-code contributions</a>, like documentation, support, and graphic design, are a big part of any successful project. While these aren’t necessarily non-technical, you shouldn’t assume too much technical knowledge. “You want to make your language and project easy to understand so that people of various technical skill levels will be interested,” Drew says.</p><p>Also be sure to take advantage of the “Help wanted” and “Good first issue” labels. These can help people who are looking for ways to contribute find your project.</p>","contentLength":5518,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Revolutionizing software testing: Introducing LLM-powered bug catchers","url":"https://engineering.fb.com/2025/02/05/security/revolutionizing-software-testing-llm-powered-bug-catchers-meta-ach/","date":1738780251,"author":"","guid":539,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/2022-481F/readings/mutation-testing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p><ol></ol><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/27/developer-tools/programming-languages-endorsed-for-server-side-use-at-meta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"crates.io: development update","url":"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/05/crates-io-development-update.html","date":1738713600,"author":"Tobias Bieniek","guid":315,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Back in July 2024, we published a <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/07/29/crates-io-development-update.html\">blog post</a> about the ongoing development of crates.io. Since then, we have made a lot of progress and shipped a few new features. In this blog post, we want to give you an update on the latest changes that we have made to crates.io.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3660-crates-io-crate-deletions.html\">RFC #3660</a> we proposed a new feature that allows crate owners to delete their crates from crates.io under certain conditions. This can be useful if you have published a crate by mistake or if you want to remove a crate that is no longer maintained. After the RFC was accepted by all team members at the end of August, we began implementing the feature.</p><p>We created a new API endpoint <code>DELETE /api/v1/crates/:name</code> that allows crate owners to delete their crates and then created the corresponding user interface. If you are the owner of a crate, you can now go to the crate page, open the \"Settings\" tab, and find the \"Delete this crate\" button at the bottom. Clicking this button will lead you to a confirmation page telling you about the potential impact of the deletion and requirements that need to be met in order to delete the crate:</p><p>As you can see from the screenshot above, a crate can only be deleted if either: the crate has been published for less than 72 hours or the crate only has a single owner, and the crate has been downloaded less than 500 times for each month it has been published, and the crate is not depended upon by any other crate on crates.io.</p><p>These requirements were put in place to prevent abuse of the deletion feature and to ensure that crates that are widely used by the community are not deleted accidentally. If you have any feedback on this feature, please let us know!</p><p>Around the holiday season we started experimenting with generating an <a href=\"https://www.openapis.org/\">OpenAPI</a> description for the crates.io API. This was a long-standing request from the community, and we are happy to announce that we now have an experimental OpenAPI description available at <a href=\"https://crates.io/api/openapi.json\">https://crates.io/api/openapi.json</a>!</p><p>Please note that this is still considered work-in-progress and e.g. the stability guarantees for the endpoints are not written down and the response schemas are also not fully documented yet.</p><p>You can view the OpenAPI description in e.g. a Swagger UI at <a href=\"https://petstore.swagger.io/\">https://petstore.swagger.io/</a> by putting <code>https://crates.io/api/openapi.json</code> in the top input field. We decided to not ship a viewer ourselves for now due to security concerns with running it on the same domain as crates.io itself. We may reconsider whether to offer it on a dedicated subdomain in the future if there is enough interest.</p><p>The OpenAPI description is generated by the <a href=\"https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa\">utoipa</a> crate, which is a tool that can be integrated with the <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum\">axum</a> web framework to automatically generate OpenAPI descriptions for all of your endpoints. We would like to thank <a href=\"https://github.com/juhaku\">Juha Kukkonen</a> for his great work on this tool!</p><h2><a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/05/crates-io-development-update.html#support-form-and-report-crate-button\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Support form and \"Report Crate\" button</h2><p>Since the crates.io team is small and mostly consists of volunteers, we do not have the capacity to manually monitor all publishes. Instead, we rely on you, the Rust community, to help us catch malicious crates and users. To make it easier for you to report suspicious crates, we added a \"Report Crate\" button to all the crate pages. If you come across a crate that you think is malicious or violates the <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct\">code of conduct</a> or our <a href=\"https://crates.io/policies\">usage policy</a>, you can now click the \"Report Crate\" button and fill out the form that appears. This will send an email to the crates.io team, who will then review the crate and take appropriate action if necessary. Thank you to crates.io team member <a href=\"https://github.com/eth3lbert\">@eth3lbert</a> who worked on the majority of this.</p><p>If you have any issues with the support form or the \"Report Crate\" button, please let us know. You can also always email us directly at <a href=\"mailto:help@crates.io\">help@crates.io</a> if you prefer not to use the form.</p><p>We have added a new feature that allows you to receive email notifications when a new version of your crate is published. This can be useful in detecting unauthorized publishes of your crate or simply to keep track of publishes from other members of your team.</p><p>This feature was another <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/815\">long-standing feature request</a> from our community, and we were happy to finally implement it. If you'd prefer not to receive publish notifications, then you can go to your account settings on crates.io and disable these notifications.</p><p>These were some of the more visible changes to crates.io over the past couple of months, but a lot has happened \"under the hood\" as well.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3691-trusted-publishing-cratesio.html\">RFC #3691</a> was opened and accepted to implement \"Trusted Publishing\" support on crates.io, similar to other ecosystems that adopted it. This will allow you to specify on crates.io which repository/system is allowed to publish new releases of your crate, allowing you to publish crates from CI systems without having to deal with API tokens anymore.</p></li><li><p>Slightly related to the above: API tokens created on crates.io now expire after 90 days by default. It is still possible to disable the expiry or choose other expiry durations though.</p></li><li><p>The crates.io team was one of the first projects to use the <a href=\"https://diesel.rs/\">diesel</a> database access library, but since that only supported synchronous execution it was sometimes a little awkward to use in our codebase, which was increasingly moving into an async direction after our migration to <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum\">axum</a> a while ago. The maintainer of diesel, <a href=\"https://github.com/weiznich\">Georg Semmler</a>, did a lot of work to make it possible to use diesel in an async way, resulting in the <a href=\"https://github.com/weiznich/diesel_async\">diesel-async</a> library. Over the past couple of months we incrementally ported crates.io over to  queries, which now allows us to take advantage of the internal query pipelining in  that resulted in some of our API endpoints getting a 10-15% performance boost. Thank you, Georg, for your work on these crates!</p></li><li><p>Whenever you publish a new version or yank/unyank existing versions a couple of things need to be updated. Our internal database is immediately updated, and then we synchronize the sparse and git index in background worker jobs. Previously, yanking and unyanking a high number of versions would each queue up another synchronization background job. We have now implemented automatic deduplication of redundant background jobs, making our background worker a bit more efficient.</p></li><li><p>The final big, internal change that was just merged last week is related to the testing of our frontend code. In the past we used a tool called <a href=\"https://miragejs.com/\">Mirage</a> to implement a mock version of our API, which allowed us to run our frontend test suite without having to spin up a full backend server. Unfortunately, the maintenance situation around Mirage had lately forced us to look into alternatives, and we are happy to report that we have now fully migrated to the \"Industry standard API mocking\" package <a href=\"https://mswjs.io/\">msw</a>.

Our current search method for sifting through PDFs is extremely manual and time consuming. Is there an easier way?”</strong></p><p>As a developer, this is one of those questions that really gets me excited. I was tasked with finding a way to transform a cumbersome, archival process into an efficient, intuitive search experience. It’s a way to make a group of people’s lives easier, and because of the organizations they work for, help them be more effective in providing humanitarian assistance to people in need around the world. I couldn’t imagine a better project to be working on.</p><h2>Unlocking the United Nations’ legacy for rapid action<a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/4-steps-to-building-a-natural-language-search-tool/#unlocking-the-united-nations-legacy-for-rapid-action\" aria-label=\"Unlocking the United Nations’ legacy for rapid action\"></a></h2><p>Since 1945, the United Nations has produced resolutions and other documents that guide international peace and security efforts. Yet accessing this wealth of knowledge remains a challenge, including for organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en\">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC). Currently, delegates at ICRC’s permanent observer mission to the UN advise member states and other stakeholders on international humanitarian law and humanitarian issues. When states negotiate relevant resolutions and other UN products, leaning on pre-existing humanitarian language from UN resolutions can provide precedence. This often requires sifting through PDFs to find relevant content within documents—a time-intensive, manual process ill-suited to the fast-paced world of humanitarian diplomacy.</p><p>To solve this, I built a single-page application (SPA) that enables users to input natural language queries and instantly retrieve relevant UN resolutions. The solution is live now at <a href=\"http://resolutions.projectrefuge.io\">resolutions.projectrefuge.io</a> and serves as a robust example of how technology can simplify access to critical information.</p><ol><li><strong>Text extraction and structuring</strong>\nUsing Amazon Textract, I extracted raw text from decades’ worth of UN Security Council Resolutions and Presidential Statements and six years of UN General Assembly Resolutions. A Go script then parsed this text using Regex matching, segmenting it into individual resolutions for easier indexing.\n</li><li><p><strong>Search-ready database with MongoDB Atlas</strong>\nI adapted a Node.js script from MongoDB to upload the parsed resolutions as embeddings into a MongoDB Atlas database. This step ensures the content is structured for fast and relevant searches.</p></li><li><p><strong>User interface built with Vue.js</strong>\nThe front end is an intuitive SPA created with Vue.js. Users simply enter semantic search queries—such as “resolutions on humanitarian access in armed conflicts”—and receive results in seconds.</p></li><li><p>\nThe backend relies on AWS Lambda and API Gateway, ensuring scalability and seamless performance. The entire application is hosted as a subdomain on AWS Amplify, combining reliability with ease of access.</p></li></ol><h2>Broader implications: a blueprint for impact<a href=\"https://github.blog/open-source/social-impact/4-steps-to-building-a-natural-language-search-tool/#broader-implications-a-blueprint-for-impact\" aria-label=\"Broader implications: a blueprint for impact\"></a></h2><p>The implications of this project go far beyond the ICRC’s use case with UN Resolutions. With slight modifications, the tool could index and search any collection of legal and policy documents.

Security researchers played a key role in uncovering this issue, which had the potential to allow attackers to remotely execute code and compromise systems globally. Thanks to their swift action and collaboration with the community, patches were developed and shared before attackers could widely exploit the vulnerability. This effort highlights the researchers’ vital role in safeguarding systems.</p><p>Similarly, in 2023, security researchers discovered a zero-day vulnerability in the l, identifying the issue before it could be exploited on a large scale. The flaw had the potential to allow unauthorized access to file transfer systems, which could have resulted in data breaches. By proactively identifying the vulnerability and working with vendors to develop timely patches, these researchers helped secure critical systems and prevent potential breaches.</p><p>These examples show that security researchers don’t just protect systems—they protect people and organizations. This makes their work not just important but crucial in the digital age. Their efforts save businesses, governments, and individuals from devastating cyberattacks, giving their work a deep sense of purpose.</p><h2>What makes a great security researcher?<a href=\"https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/cybersecurity-researchers-digital-detectives-in-a-connected-world/#what-makes-a-great-security-researcher\" aria-label=\"What makes a great security researcher?\"></a></h2><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/11.jpg?w=300&amp;resize=150%2C150\" alt=\"A cartoon of a barcode-nosed dog diving into water with the word &quot;Curiosity&quot; written above it.\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" align=\"right\">The essence of a great security researcher lies in a blend of traits and skills.

This allows for responsiveness to the keypresses they will try to navigate and take action on our tree view instances.</p><p>Navigating and taking actions on items in Windows’ tree view using <a href=\"https://www.nvaccess.org/\">NVDA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/\">JAWS</a> helped us get a better understanding of how things worked, including factors such as focus management, keyboard shortcuts, and expected assistive technology announcements.</p><h2>Then maybe reference the APG<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#then-maybe-reference-the-apg\" aria-label=\"Then maybe reference the APG\"></a></h2><p>This is to say that the APG can serve as a helpful high-level resource for things to consider for your overall approach, but its suggestions for code necessitate deeper scrutiny.</p><h2>Build from a solid, semantic foundation<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#build-from-a-solid-semantic-foundation\" aria-label=\"Build from a solid, semantic foundation\"></a></h2><p>At its core, a tree view is a list of lists. Because of this, we used  and  elements for parent and child nodes:</p><pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;.github/&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;source/&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;test/&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;.gitignore&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;README.md&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre><p>There are a few reasons for doing this, but the main considerations are:</p><ul><li>Lessening the work we need for future maintenance, and consequential re-verification that our updates continue to work properly, and  </li><li>Better guaranteed interoperability between different browsers, apps, and other technologies.</li></ul><p>: GitHub currently does not virtualize its file trees. We would need to revisit this architectural decision if this ever changes.</p><h3>Better broad assistive technology support<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#better-broad-assistive-technology-support\" aria-label=\"Better broad assistive technology support\"></a></h3><p>We found that utilizing semantic HTML elements also performed better for some less-common assistive technologies. This was especially relevant with some lower-power devices, like an entry-level Android smartphone from 2021.</p><h3>Better Forced Color Mode support<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#better-forced-color-mode-support\" aria-label=\"Better Forced Color Mode support\"></a></h3><p>Semantic HTML elements also map to native operating system UI patterns, meaning that <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/17/styling-for-windows-high-contrast-with-new-standards-for-forced-colors/\">Forced Color Mode</a>’s heuristics will recognize them without any additional effort. This is helpful for people who rely on the mode to see screen content.</p><p>The heuristic mapping behavior does not occur if we used semantically neutral  or  elements, and would have to be manually recreated and maintained.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/aria/#composite\">composite widget</a> allows a component that contains multiple interactive elements to only require one tab stop unless someone chooses to interact with it further.</p><p>Consider a file tree for a repository that contains 500+ files in 20+ directories. Without a composite widget treatment, someone may have to press  far too many times to bypass the file tree component and get what they need.</p><h2>Think about wrapping it in a landmark<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#think-about-wrapping-it-in-a-landmark\" aria-label=\"Think about wrapping it in a landmark\"></a></h2><p>Like using a composite widget, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/landmark-regions/\">landmark regions</a> help some people quickly and efficiently navigate through larger overall sections of the page. Because of this, we wrapped the entire file tree in a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/landmark-regions/\"> landmark element</a>.</p><h2>Go with a roving  approach<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#go-with-a-roving-tabindex-approach\" aria-label=\"Go with a roving <code>tabindex</code> approach\"></a></h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex\">roving tabindex</a> is a technique that uses  applied to each element in a series, and then updates the  value to use  instead in response to user keyboard input. This allows someone to traverse the series of elements, as focus “roves” to follow their keypresses.</p><pre><code>&lt;li tabindex=\"-1\"&gt;File 1&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li tabindex=\"-1\"&gt;File 2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li tabindex=\"0\"&gt;File 3&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li tabindex=\"-1\"&gt;File 4&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre><p>We use a considered set of <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/aria/\">ARIA</a> declarations to build off our semantic foundation.</p><p>Note that while we intentionally started with semantic HTML, there are certain ARIA declarations that are needed. The use of ARIA here is necessary and intentional, as it expands the capabilities of HTML to describe something that HTML alone cannot describe—a tree view construct.</p><ul><li> is placed on the parent  element, to communicate that it is a tree view construct.  </li><li> is placed on the child  elements, to communicate that they are tree view nodes.  </li><li> is declared on child  elements, to communicate that they contain branch and leaf nodes.  </li><li> is declared on directories, with a value of  to communicate that the branch node is in an opened state and a value of  to communicate that it is in a collapsed state instead.  </li><li> is used to indicate if branch or leaf nodes have been chosen by user navigation, and can therefore have user actions applied to them.</li></ul><p>We also made the following additions:</p><ul><li> is applied to SVG icons (folders, files, etc.) to ensure its content is not announced.  </li><li> is placed on the selected node to better support when a node is deep linked to via URL.</li></ul><p>: We use “branch node” and “leaf node” as broad terms that can apply to all tree view components we use on GitHub. For the file tree, branch nodes would correspond to directories and subdirectories, and leaf nodes would correspond to files.</p><h2>Support expected navigation techniques<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#support-expected-navigation-techniques\" aria-label=\"Support expected navigation techniques\"></a></h2><p>The following behaviors are what people will try when operating a tree view construct, so we support them:</p><ul><li>: Places focus on the entire tree view component, then moves focus to the next focusable item on the view.  </li><li>:\n<ul><li>If a branch node is selected: Displays the directory’s contents.  </li><li>If a leaf node is selected: Displays the leaf node’s contents.  </li></ul></li><li>: Moves selection to the next node that can be selected without opening or closing a node.  </li><li>: Moves selection to the previous node that can be selected without opening or closing a node.  </li><li>:\n<ul><li>If a branch node is selected and in a collapsed state: Expands the selected collapsed branch node and does not move selection.  </li><li>If a branch node is selected and in an expanded state: Moves selection to the directory’s first child node.  </li></ul></li><li>:\n<ul><li>If a branch node is selected and in an expanded state: Collapses the selected collapsed directory node and does not move selection.  </li><li>If a branch node is selected and in a collapsed state: Moves selection to the node’s parent directory.  </li><li>If a leaf node is selected: Moves selection to the leaf node’s parent directory.  </li></ul></li><li>: Moves selection to the last node that can be selected.  </li><li>: Moves selection to the first node that can be selected.</li></ul><p>We also support , as we are modeling Windows File Explorer’s tree view behaviors. Here, we move selection to the node closest to the currently selected node whose name matches what the user types.</p><p>Nodes on tree view constructs are <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/aria/#treeitem\">tree items</a>, not links. Because of this, tree view nodes do not support the behaviors you get with using an anchor element, such as opening its URL in a new tab or window.</p><p>We use JavaScript to listen for middle clicks and + keypresses to replicate this behavior.</p><p>Tree views on GitHub can take time to retrieve their content, and we may not always know how much content a branch node contains.</p><ul><li>If there is a known amount of nodes that load, we enumerate the incoming content with an announcement that reads, “Loading {x} items.”  </li><li>If there is an unknown number of nodes that load, we instead use a more generic announcement of, “Loading…”  </li><li>If there are no nodes that load we use an announcement message that reads, “{branch node name} is empty.”</li></ul><ul><li>If focus is placed on a placeholder loading node when the content loads in: Move focus from the placeholder node to the first child node in the branch node.   </li><li>If focus is on a placeholder loading node but the branch node does not contain content: Move focus back to the branch node. Additionally, we remove the branch node’s  declaration.</li></ul><p>Circumstances can conspire to interfere with a tree view component’s intended behavior. Examples of this could be a branch node failing to retrieve content or a <a href=\"https://primer.style/ui-patterns/degraded-experiences\">partial system outage</a>.</p><p>In these scenarios, the tree view component will use a straightforward <a href=\"https://primer.style/components/dialog\">dialog component</a> to communicate the error.</p><h2>Fix interoperability issues<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#fix-interoperability-issues\" aria-label=\"Fix interoperability issues\"></a></h2><p>As previously touched on, complicated interaction patterns run the risk of compatibility issues. Because of this, it’s essential to test your efforts with actual assistive technology to .</p><p>We made the following adjustments to provide better assistive technology support:</p><p>Screen readers can report on the depth of a nested list item. For example, a  element placed inside of a  element nested three levels deep can announce itself as such.</p><p>We found that we needed to explicitly declare the level on each  element to recreate this behavior for a tree view. For our example, we’d also need to set  on the  element.</p><p>This fix addressed multiple forms of assistive technology we tested with.</p><h3>Explicitly set the node’s accessible name on the  element<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#explicitly-set-the-nodes-accessible-name-on-the-li-element\" aria-label=\"Explicitly set the node’s accessible name on the <code>li</code> element\"></a></h3><p>A node’s <a href=\"https://sarahmhigley.com/writing/whats-in-a-name/\">accessible name</a> is typically set by the text string placed inside the  element:</p><p>However, we found that <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/get-started-vo4be8816d70/10/mac/15.0\">VoiceOver on macOS</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/turn-on-and-practice-voiceover-iph3e2e415f/ios\">iOS</a> did not support this. This may be because of the relative complexity of each node’s inner DOM structure.</p><p>We used  to get around this problem, with a value that pointed to the  set on the text portion of each node:</p><pre><code>&lt;li aria-labelledby=\"readme-md\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n   &lt;!-- Icon --&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"readme-md\"&gt;\n    README.md\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre><ul><li>the node’s accessible name is announced when focus is placed on the  element,   </li><li>and that the announcement matches what is shown visually.</li></ul><h2>Where we’d like to go from here<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#where-wed-like-to-go-from-here\" aria-label=\"Where we’d like to go from here\"></a></h2><p>There’s a couple areas we’re prototyping and iterating on to better serve our users:</p><h3>Supporting links inside a node<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#supporting-links-inside-a-node\" aria-label=\"Supporting links inside a node\"></a></h3><p>Browsers apply a lot of behaviors to anchor elements, such as the ability to copy the URL.</p><p>We’d like to replace the JavaScript that listens for middle clicks with a more robust native solution, only without sacrificing interoperability and assistive technology support.</p><h3>Supporting multiple actions per node<a href=\"https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/considerations-for-making-a-tree-view-component-accessible/#supporting-multiple-actions-per-node\" aria-label=\"Supporting multiple actions per node\"></a></h3><p>Tree views constructs were designed assuming a user will only ever navigate to a node and activate it.</p><p>GitHub has use cases that require actions other than activating the node, and we’re exploring how to accomplish that. This is exciting, as it represents an opportunity to evolve the tree view construct on the web.</p><p>An accessible tree view is a complicated component to make, and it requires a lot of effort and testing to get right. However, this work helps to ensure that everyone can use a core part of GitHub, regardless of device, circumstance, or ability.</p><p>We hope that highlighting the considerations that went into our work can help you on your accessibility journey.</p><div><p>: <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/accessibility\">We’d love to hear from you</a> if you’ve run into issues using our tree view component with assistive technology.

Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.</strong></p><p>: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and\ncurrently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with\nthe help of <a href=\"https://github.com/carolynvs\">Carolyn Van Slyck</a>. With time, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.17/release_team.md\">I joined the Release\nteam</a>,\neventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I\nworked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in\nprocess) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and\ncontributing to the Subproject’s work.</p><p><strong>FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of\nintervention?</strong></p><p><strong>FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily\ninvolved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?</strong></p><p>: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/#the-release-cycle\">Every release</a>, the SIGs let the\nRelease Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned\nabove, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors\nmust fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages\">will move\nthrough 3\nphases</a>:\nalpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.</p><p>The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md\">KEP\ntemplate</a>\nhas different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed\ndiscussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and\nperformance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review\nteam and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is\nlooking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and\nperformant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and\nmerge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.</p><p><strong>FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most\nsignificant improvements of that approach?</strong></p><p>: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on\nthe core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way\nto discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP\nprocess is communication and consideration.</p><p>To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP\ntemplate. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancements</a> repo into its current form -- a\ndirectory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with\nProposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted\ntoday, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process\nin place over time.</p><p>As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single\nfeature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user\nexpectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The\naddition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements\n(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).</p><p>: We’re currently working on two things:</p><ol><li><em>Creating a Process KEP template.</em> Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for\nsignificant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to\nsupport this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so\nwill only encourage more discussion and transparency.</li><li> While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we\nbelieve that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with\na versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.</li></ol><p>Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we\nbelieve that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.</p><p><strong>FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were\nintroduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was\nthis a particular area of focus for the subproject?</strong></p><p>: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away\nfrom using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has\nalways been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition\nto an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads \"opt-in\" KEPs for release tracking. This\nhelped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken\non a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid\nintroducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the\nSubproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection\nprocess. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native\nlabels on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancement</a> issues and project boards.</p><p><strong>FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...</strong></p><p>: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the\nEnhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to\ndecisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to\ngive an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the\nRelease Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a\ngreat success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in\nthe KEP process!</p><p><strong>FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the\nrequired skills for participating in the sub-project?</strong></p><p>: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the\nkubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take\nit from there.</p><p><strong>FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to\nshare with our readers?</strong></p><p>: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires\nenormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it\nsuccessful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the\nproject great.
