It is similar to Pytest but specialized for unit testing LLM outputs. DeepEval incorporates the latest research to evaluate LLM outputs based on metrics such as G-Eval, hallucination, answer relevancy, RAGAS, etc., which uses LLMs and various other NLP models that runs  for evaluation.</p><p>Whether your LLM applications are RAG pipelines, chatbots, AI agents, implemented via LangChain or LlamaIndex, DeepEval has you covered.

Create an account <a href=\"https://app.confident-ai.com?utm_source=GitHub\">here.</a></p></blockquote><p>Let's pretend your LLM application is a RAG based customer support chatbot; here's how DeepEval can help test what you've built.</p><h2>Create an account (highly recommended)</h2><p>Using the  platform will allow you to generate sharable testing reports on the cloud. It is free, takes no additional code to setup, and we highly recommend giving it a try.</p><p>Follow the instructions in the CLI to create an account, copy your API key, and paste it into the CLI. All test cases will automatically be logged (find more information on data privacy <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/data-privacy?utm_source=GitHub\">here</a>).</p><h2>Writing your first test case</h2><p>Open  and write your first test case to run an  evaluation using DeepEval, which treats your LLM app as a black-box:</p><pre><code>import pytest\nfrom deepeval import assert_test\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams\n\ndef test_case():\n    correctness_metric = GEval(\n        name=\"Correctness\",\n        criteria=\"Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.\",\n        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],\n        threshold=0.5\n    )\n    test_case = LLMTestCase(\n        input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n        actual_output=\"You have 30 days to get a full refund at no extra cost.\",\n        expected_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n        retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n    )\n    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric])\n</code></pre><p>Set your  as an environment variable (you can also evaluate using your own custom model, for more details visit <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm?utm_source=GitHub\">this part of our docs</a>):</p><pre><code>export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"\n</code></pre><p>And finally, run  in the CLI:</p><pre><code>deepeval test run test_chatbot.py\n</code></pre><p><strong>Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ✅</strong> Let's breakdown what happened.</p><ul><li>The variable  mimics a user input, and  is a placeholder for what your application's supposed to output based on this input.</li><li>The variable  represents the ideal answer for a given , and <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals\"></a> is a research-backed metric provided by  for you to evaluate your LLM output's on any custom custom with human-like accuracy.</li><li>In this example, the metric  is correctness of the  based on the provided .</li><li>All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the  threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/getting-started?utm_source=GitHub\">Read our documentation</a> for more information on more options to run end-to-end evaluation, how to use additional metrics, create your own custom metrics, and tutorials on how to integrate with other tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex.</p><h2>Evaluating Nested Components</h2><p>If you wish to evaluate individual components within your LLM app, you need to run  evals - a powerful way to evaluate any component within an LLM system.</p><p>Simply trace \"components\" such as LLM calls, retrievers, tool calls, and agents within your LLM application using the  decorator to apply metrics on a component-level. Tracing with  is non-instrusive (learn more <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing#dont-be-worried-about-tracing\">here</a>) and helps you avoid rewriting your codebase just for evals:</p><pre><code>from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.dataset import Golden\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval import evaluate\n\ncorrectness = GEval(name=\"Correctness\", criteria=\"Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.\", evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT])\n\n@observe(metrics=[correctness])\ndef inner_component():\n    # Component can be anything from an LLM call, retrieval, agent, tool use, etc.\n    update_current_span(test_case=LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\"))\n    return\n\n@observe\ndef llm_app(input: str):\n    inner_component()\n    return\n\nevaluate(observed_callback=llm_app, goldens=[Golden(input=\"Hi!\")])\n</code></pre><p>You can learn everything about component-level evaluations <a href=\"https://www.deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals\">here.</a></p><h2>Evaluating Without Pytest Integration</h2><p>Alternatively, you can evaluate without Pytest, which is more suited for a notebook environment.</p><pre><code>from deepeval import evaluate\nfrom deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n    actual_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n    retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n)\nevaluate([test_case], [answer_relevancy_metric])\n</code></pre><p>DeepEval is extremely modular, making it easy for anyone to use any of our metrics. Continuing from the previous example:</p><pre><code>from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n    actual_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n    retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n)\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric.measure(test_case)\nprint(answer_relevancy_metric.score)\n# All metrics also offer an explanation\nprint(answer_relevancy_metric.reason)\n</code></pre><p>Note that some metrics are for RAG pipelines, while others are for fine-tuning. Make sure to use our docs to pick the right one for your use case.</p><h2>Evaluating a Dataset / Test Cases in Bulk</h2><p>In DeepEval, a dataset is simply a collection of test cases. Here is how you can evaluate these in bulk:</p><pre><code>import pytest\nfrom deepeval import assert_test\nfrom deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric, AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\n\nfirst_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\", context=[\"...\"])\nsecond_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\", context=[\"...\"])\n\ndataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[first_test_case, second_test_case])\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\n    \"test_case\",\n    dataset,\n)\ndef test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):\n    hallucination_metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.3)\n    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)\n    assert_test(test_case, [hallucination_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])\n</code></pre><pre><code># Run this in the CLI, you can also add an optional -n flag to run tests in parallel\ndeepeval test run test_&lt;filename&gt;.py -n 4\n</code></pre><p>Alternatively, although we recommend using , you can evaluate a dataset/test cases without using our Pytest integration:</p><pre><code>from deepeval import evaluate\n...\n\nevaluate(dataset, [answer_relevancy_metric])\n# or\ndataset.evaluate([answer_relevancy_metric])\n</code></pre><ol><li>Curate/annotate evaluation datasets on the cloud</li><li>Benchmark LLM app using dataset, and compare with previous iterations to experiment which models/prompts works best</li><li>Fine-tune metrics for custom results</li><li>Debug evaluation results via LLM traces</li><li>Monitor &amp; evaluate LLM responses in product to improve datasets with real-world data</li></ol><p>Everything on Confident AI, including how to use Confident is available <a href=\"https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs?utm_source=GitHub\">here</a>.</p><p>To begin, login from the CLI:</p><p>Follow the instructions to log in, create your account, and paste your API key into the CLI.</p><p>Now, run your test file again:</p><pre><code>deepeval test run test_chatbot.py\n</code></pre><p>You should see a link displayed in the CLI once the test has finished running.

This concept allows a user to install only one container with a single command that does the heavy lifting of creating and managing all containers that are needed in order to provide a Nextcloud installation with most features included. It also makes updating a breeze and is not bound to the host system (and its slow updates) anymore as everything is in containers. Additionally, it is very easy to handle from a user perspective because a simple interface for managing your Nextcloud AIO installation is provided.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/issues/5251\">this issue</a> for a list of feature requests that need help by contributors.</p><h3>How many users are possible?</h3><h3>Are reverse proxies supported?</h3><h3>Which ports are mandatory to be open in your firewall/router?</h3><p>Only those (if you access the Mastercontainer Interface internally via port 8080):</p><ul><li> for the Apache container</li><li> if you want to enable http3 for the Apache container</li><li> and  for the Talk container</li></ul><h3>Explanation of used ports</h3><ul><li>: Mastercontainer Interface with self-signed certificate (works always, also if only access via IP-address is possible, e.g. <code>https://ip.address.of.this.server:8080/</code>) ⚠️  do always use an ip-address if you access this port and not a domain as HSTS might block access to it later!

This is a privacy concern and you will need to look for other solutions if it's unacceptable for you.</li><li>Using Cloudflare Tunnel might potentially slow down Nextcloud since local access via the configured domain is not possible because TLS termination is in that case offloaded to Cloudflare's infrastructure. There is no way to disable this behavior in Cloudflare Tunnel.</li><li>Cloudflare only supports uploading files up to 100&nbsp;MB in the free plan, if you try to upload bigger files you will get an error (413 - Payload Too Large) if no chunking is used (e.g. for public uploads in the web, or if chunks are configured to be bigger than 100 MB in the clients or the web). If you need to upload bigger files, you need to disable the proxy option in your DNS settings. Note that this will both disable Cloudflare DDoS protection and Cloudflare Tunnel as these services require the proxy option to be enabled.</li><li>Cloudflare only allows a max timeout of 100s for requests which is not configurable. This means that any server-side processing e.g. for assembling chunks for big files during upload that take longer than 100s will simply not work. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/19223\">https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/19223</a>. If you need to upload big files reliably, you need to disable the proxy option in your DNS settings. Note that this will both disable Cloudflare DDoS protection and Cloudflare Tunnel as these services require the proxy option to be enabled.</li><li>It is known that the in AIO included collabora (Nextcloud Office) does not work out of the box behind Cloudflare. To make it work, you need to add all <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/\">Cloudflare IP-ranges</a> to the wopi-allowlist in <code>https://yourdomain.com/settings/admin/richdocuments</code></li><li>The built-in turn-server for Nextcloud Talk will not work behind Cloudflare Tunnel since it needs a separate port (by default 3478 or as chosen) available on the same domain. If you still want to use the feature, you will need to install your own turnserver or use a publicly available one and adjust and test your stun and turn settings in <code>https://yourdomain.com/settings/admin/talk</code>.</li><li>If you get an error in Nextcloud's admin overview that the HSTS header is not set correctly, you might need to enable it in Cloudflare manually.</li><li>If you are using AIO's built-in Reverse Proxy and don't use your own, then the certificate issuing may possibly not work out-of-the-box because Cloudflare might block the attempt. In that case you need to disable the Proxy feature at least temporarily in order to make it work. Note that this isn't an option if you need Cloudflare Tunnel as disabling the proxy would also disable Cloudflare Tunnel which would in turn make your server unreachable for the verification.

So please follow the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/reverse-proxy.md\">reverse proxy documentation</a> where is documented how to make it run behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. However please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#notes-on-cloudflare-proxytunnel\">caveats</a> before proceeding.</p><h3>How to run Nextcloud via Tailscale?</h3><h3>How to get Nextcloud running using the ACME DNS-challenge?</h3><h3>How to run Nextcloud locally? No domain wanted, or wanting intranet access within your LAN.</h3><p>If you do not want to open Nextcloud to the public internet, you may have a look at the following documentation on how to set it up locally: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/local-instance.md\">local-instance.md</a>, but keep in mind you're still required to have https working properly.</p><h3>Can I use an ip-address for Nextcloud instead of a domain?</h3><p>No and it will not be added. If you only want to run it locally, you may have a look at the following documentation: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/local-instance.md\">local-instance.md</a>. Recommended is to use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a>.</p><h3>Can I run AIO offline or in an airgapped system?</h3><p>No. This is not possible and will not be added due to multiple reasons: update checks, app installs via app-store, downloading additional docker images on demand and more.</p><h3>Are self-signed certificates supported for Nextcloud?</h3><p>No and they will not be. If you want to run it locally, without opening Nextcloud to the public internet, please have a look at the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/local-instance.md\">local instance documentation</a>. Recommended is to use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a>.</p><h3>Can I use AIO with multiple domains?</h3><p>No and it will not be added. However you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/raw/main/multiple-instances.md\">this feature</a> in order to create multiple AIO instances, one for each domain.</p><h3>Are other ports than the default 443 for Nextcloud supported?</h3><p>No and they will not be. If port 443 and/or 80 is blocked for you, you may use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a> if you want to publish it online. If you already run a different service on port 443, please use a dedicated domain for Nextcloud and set it up correctly by following the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/reverse-proxy.md\">reverse proxy documentation</a>. However in all cases the Nextcloud interface will redirect you to port 443.</p><h3>Can I run Nextcloud in a subdirectory on my domain?</h3><p>No and it will not be added. Please use a dedicated (sub-)domain for Nextcloud and set it up correctly by following the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/reverse-proxy.md\">reverse proxy documentation</a>. Alternatively, you may use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a> if you want to publish it online.</p><h3>How can I access Nextcloud locally?</h3><p>Please note that local access is not possible if you are running AIO behind Cloudflare Tunnel since TLS proxying is in that case offloaded to Cloudflares infrastructure. You can fix this by setting up your own reverse proxy that handles TLS proxying locally and will make the steps below work.</p><p>Please make sure that if you are running AIO behind a reverse proxy, that the reverse proxy is configured to use port 443 on the server that runs it. Otherwise the steps below will not work.</p><p>Now that this is out of the way, the recommended way how to access Nextcloud locally, is to set up a local dns-server like a pi-hole and set up a custom dns-record for that domain that points to the internal ip-adddress of your server that runs Nextcloud AIO. Below are some guides:</p><h3>How to skip the domain validation?</h3><p>If you are completely sure that you've configured everything correctly and are not able to pass the domain validation, you may skip the domain validation by adding <code>--env SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used).</p><h3>How to resolve firewall problems with Fedora Linux, RHEL OS, CentOS, SUSE Linux and others?</h3><p>It is known that Linux distros that use <a href=\"https://firewalld.org\">firewalld</a> as their firewall daemon have problems with docker networks. In case the containers are not able to communicate with each other, you may change your firewalld to use the iptables backend by running:</p><pre><code>sudo sed -i 's/FirewallBackend=nftables/FirewallBackend=iptables/g' /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf\nsudo systemctl restart firewalld docker\n</code></pre><p>Afterwards it should work.</p><h3>What can I do to fix the internal or reserved ip-address error?</h3><p>If you get an error during the domain validation which states that your ip-address is an internal or reserved ip-address, you can fix this by first making sure that your domain indeed has the correct public ip-address that points to the server and then adding <code>--add-host yourdomain.com:&lt;public-ip-address&gt;</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) which will allow the domain validation to work correctly. And so that you know: even if the  record of your domain should change over time, this is no problem since the mastercontainer will not make any attempt to access the chosen domain after the initial domain validation.</p><h3>Which CPU architectures are supported?</h3><p>You can check this on Linux by running: </p><ul></ul><h3>Disrecommended VPS providers</h3><ul><li> Strato VPS using Virtuozzo caused problems though ones from Q3 2023 and later should work. If your VPS has a  file and a low  limit set in it your server will likely misbehave once it reaches this limit which is very quickly reached by AIO, see <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/1747#discussioncomment-4716164\">here</a>.</li><li>Hostingers VPS seem to miss a specific Kernel feature which is required for AIO to run correctly. See <a href=\"https://help.nextcloud.com/t/help-installing-nc-via-aio-on-vps/153956\">here</a>.</li></ul><p>In general recommended VPS are those that are KVM/non-virtualized as Docker should work best on them.</p><ul><li>SD-cards are disrecommended for AIO since they cripple the performance and they are not meant for many write operations which is needed for the database and other parts</li><li>SSD storage is recommended</li><li>HDD storage should work as well but is of course much slower than SSD storage</li></ul><h3>Are there known problems when SELinux is enabled?</h3><p>Yes. If SELinux is enabled, you might need to add the <code>--security-opt label:disable</code> option to the docker run command of the mastercontainer in order to allow it to access the docker socket (or <code>security_opt: [\"label:disable\"]</code> in compose.yaml). See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/485\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/485</a></p><h3>How to change the default location of Nextcloud's Datadir?</h3><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] Do not set or adjust this value after the initial Nextcloud installation is done! If you still want to do it afterwards, see <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/890#discussioncomment-3089903\">this</a> on how to do it.</p></blockquote><p>You can configure the Nextcloud container to use a specific directory on your host as data directory. You can do so by adding the environmental variable  to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used). Allowed values for that variable are strings that start with  and are not equal to . The chosen directory or volume will then be mounted to  inside the container.</p><ul><li>An example for Linux is <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/mnt/ncdata\"</code>. ⚠️ Please note: If you should be using an external BTRFS drive that is mounted to , make sure to choose a subfolder like e.g.  as datadir, since the root folder is not suited as datadir in that case. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/2696\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/2696</a>.</li><li>On macOS it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/var/nextcloud-data\"</code></li><li>For Synology it may be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/volume1/docker/nextcloud/data\"</code>.</li><li>On Windows it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/run/desktop/mnt/host/c/ncdata\"</code>. (This path is equivalent to  on your Windows host so you need to translate the path accordingly. Hint: the path that you enter needs to start with . Append to that the exact location on your windows host, e.g.  which is equivalent to .) ⚠️ : This does not work with external drives like USB or network drives and only with internal drives like SATA or NVME drives.</li><li>Another option is to provide a specific volume name here with: <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_datadir\"</code>. This volume needs to be created beforehand manually by you in order to be able to use it. e.g. on Windows with: <pre><code>docker volume create ^\n--driver local ^\n--name nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_datadir ^\n-o device=\"/host_mnt/e/your/data/path\" ^\n-o type=\"none\" ^\n-o o=\"bind\"\n</code></pre> In this example, it would mount  into the volume so for a different location you need to adjust <code>/host_mnt/e/your/data/path</code> accordingly.</li></ul><h3>How to store the files/installation on a separate drive?</h3><p>⚠️ If you encounter errors from richdocuments in your Nextcloud logs, check in your Collabora container if the message \"Capabilities are not set for the coolforkit program.\" appears. If so, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Stop all the containers from the AIO Interface.</li><li>Go to your terminal and delete the Collabora container (<code>docker rm nextcloud-aio-collabora</code>) AND the Collabora image (<code>docker image rm nextcloud/aio-collabora</code>).</li><li>You might also want to prune your Docker () (no data will be lost).</li><li>Restart your containers from the AIO Interface.</li></ol><p>This should solve the problem.</p><h3>How to allow the Nextcloud container to access directories on the host?</h3><p>By default, the Nextcloud container is confined and cannot access directories on the host OS. You might want to change this when you are planning to use local external storage in Nextcloud to store some files outside the data directory and can do so by adding the environmental variable  to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used). Allowed values for that variable are strings that start with  and are not equal to .</p><ul><li>Two examples for Linux are <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/mnt/\"</code> and <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/media/\"</code>.</li><li>On macOS it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/Volumes/your_drive/\"</code></li><li>For Synology it may be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/volume1/\"</code>.</li><li>On Windows it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/run/desktop/mnt/host/d/your-folder/\"</code>. (This path is equivalent to  on your Windows host so you need to translate the path accordingly. Hint: the path that you enter needs to start with . Append to that the exact location on your windows host, e.g.  which is equivalent to .) ⚠️ : This does not work with external drives like USB or network drives and only with internal drives like SATA or NVME drives.</li></ul><p>After using this option, please make sure to apply the correct permissions to the directories that you want to use in Nextcloud. E.g. <code>sudo chown -R 33:0 /mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> and <code>sudo chmod -R 750 /mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> should make it work on Linux when you have used <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/mnt/\"</code>. On Windows you could do this e.g. with <code>docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chown -R 33:0 /run/desktop/mnt/host/d/your-folder/</code> and <code>docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chmod -R 750 /run/desktop/mnt/host/d/your-folder/</code>.</p><p>You can then navigate to <code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/apps/disabled</code>, activate the external storage app, navigate to <code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/externalstorages</code> and add a local external storage directory that will be accessible inside the container at the same place that you've entered. E.g. <code>/mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> will be mounted to <code>/mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> inside the container, etc.</p><p>Be aware though that these locations will not be covered by the built-in backup solution - but you can add further Docker volumes and host paths that you want to back up after the initial backup is done.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] If you can't see the type \"local storage\" in the external storage admin options, a restart of the containers from the AIO interface may be required.</p></blockquote><h3>How to adjust the Talk port?</h3><p>By default will the talk container use port  and  for connections. This should be set to something higher than 1024! You can adjust the port by adding e.g.  to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and adjusting the port to your desired value.

It will not make other interconnectivity between the different containers work, as they expect a valid publicly trusted certificate like one from Let's Encrypt.</p></blockquote><p>For some applications it might be necessary to establish a secure connection to another host/server which is using a certificate issued by a Certification Authority that is not trusted out of the box. An example could be configuring LDAPS against a domain controller (Active Directory or Samba-based) of an organization.</p><p>You can make the Nextcloud container trust any Certification Authority by providing the environmental variable <code>NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_CACERTS_DIR</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used). The value of the variables should be set to the absolute paths of the directory on the host, which contains one or more Certification Authorities certificates. You should use X.509 certificates, Base64 encoded. (Other formats may work but have not been tested!) All the certificates in the directory will be trusted.</p><p>When using , the environmental variable can be set with <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_CACERTS_DIR=/path/to/my/cacerts</code>.</p><p>In order for the value to be valid, the path should start with  and not end with  and point to an existing . Pointing the variable directly to a certificate  will not work and may also break things.</p><h3>How to disable Collabora's Seccomp feature?</h3><p>The Collabora container enables Seccomp by default, which is a security feature of the Linux kernel. On systems without this kernel feature enabled, you need to provide <code>--env COLLABORA_SECCOMP_DISABLED=true</code> to the initial docker run command in order to make it work. If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used.</p><h3>How to adjust the Fulltextsearch Java options?</h3><p>The Fulltextsearch Java options are by default set to  which might not be enough on some systems. You can adjust this by adding e.g. <code>--env FULLTEXTSEARCH_JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Xms1024M -Xmx1024M\"</code> to the initial docker run command. If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used.</p><p>On macOS, there is only one thing different in comparison to Linux: instead of using <code>--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code>, you need to use <code>--volume /var/run/docker.sock.raw:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code> to run it after you installed <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\">Docker Desktop</a> (and don't forget to <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/raw/main/docker-ipv6-support.md\">enable ipv6</a> if you should need that).

Since  is not available on Windows, you simply remove  from the commands and they should work.</p></blockquote><h3>How to run AIO on Synology DSM</h3><p>On Synology, there are two things different in comparison to Linux: instead of using <code>--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code>, you need to use <code>--volume /volume1/docker/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code> to run it. You also need to add <code>--env WATCHTOWER_DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH=\"/volume1/docker/docker.sock\"</code>to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>). Apart from that it should work and behave the same like on Linux. Obviously the Synology Docker GUI will not work with that so you will need to either use SSH or create a user-defined script task in the task scheduler as the user 'root' in order to run the command.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] It is possible that the docker socket on your Synology is located in  like the default on Linux. Then you can just use the Linux command without having to change anything - you will notice this when you try to start the container and it says that the bind mount failed. E.g. <code>docker: Error response from daemon: Bind mount failed: '/volume1/docker/docker.sock' does not exists.</code></p></blockquote><p>Also, you may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud's Datadir to store the files on the host system. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-change-the-default-location-of-nextclouds-datadir\">this documentation</a> on how to do it.</p><p>You'll also need to adjust Synology's firewall, see below:</p><h3>How to run AIO with Portainer?</h3><p>The easiest way to run it with Portainer on Linux is to use Portainer's stacks feature and use <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/compose.yaml\">this docker-compose file</a> in order to start AIO correctly.</p><h3>Can I run AIO on TrueNAS SCALE?</h3><p>With the Truenas Scale Release 24.10.0 (which was officially released on October 29th 2024 as a stable release) IX Systems ditched the Kubernetes integration and implemented a fully working docker environment.</p><p>On older TrueNAS SCALE releases with Kubernetes environment, there are two ways to run AIO. The preferred one is to run AIO inside a VM. This is necessary since they do not expose the docker socket for containers on the host, you also cannot use docker-compose on it thus and it is also not possible to run custom helm-charts that are not explicitly written for TrueNAS SCALE.</p><p>Simply run the following: <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ your-command</code>.

You simply need to change the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code> to <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:beta</code> and vice versa.</p><h3>How to update the containers?</h3><p>If we push new containers to , you will see in the AIO interface below the  section that new container updates were found. In this case, just press  and <code>Start and update containers</code> in order to update the containers. The mastercontainer has its own update procedure though. See below. And don't forget to back up the current state of your instance using the built-in backup solution before starting the containers again! Otherwise you won't be able to restore your instance easily if something should break during the update.</p><p>If a new  update was found, you'll see a note below the  button that allows to show the changelog. If you click that button and the containers are stopped, you will see a new button that allows to update the mastercontainer. After doing so and after the update is gone through, you will have the option again to <code>Start and update containers</code>. It is recommended to create a backup before clicking the <code>Start and update containers</code> button.</p><p>Additionally, there is a cronjob that runs once a day that checks for container and mastercontainer updates and sends a notification to all Nextcloud admins if a new update was found.</p><h3>How to easily log in to the AIO interface?</h3><p>If your Nextcloud is running and you are logged in as admin in your Nextcloud, you can easily log in to the AIO interface by opening <code>https://yourdomain.tld/settings/admin/overview</code> which will show a button on top that enables you to log in to the AIO interface by just clicking on this button.</p><blockquote><p>[!Note] You can change the domain/ip-address/port of the button by simply stopping the containers, visiting the AIO interface from the correct and desired domain/ip-address/port and clicking once on .</p></blockquote><h3>How to change the domain?</h3><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] Editing the configuration.json manually and making a mistake may break your instance so please create a backup first!</p></blockquote><p>If you set up a new AIO instance, you need to enter a domain. Currently there is no way to change this domain afterwards from the AIO interface. So in order to change it, you need to edit the configuration.json manually using <code>sudo docker run -it --rm --volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config:rw alpine sh -c \"apk add --no-cache nano &amp;&amp; nano /mnt/docker-aio-config/data/configuration.json\"</code>, substitute each occurrence of your old domain with your new domain and save and write out the file. Afterwards restart your containers from the AIO interface and everything should work as expected if the new domain is correctly configured. If you are running AIO behind a web server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel and else), you need to obviously also change the domain in your reverse proxy config.</p><p>Additionally, after restarting the containers, you need to open the admin settings and update some values manually that cannot be changed automatically. Here is a list of some known places:</p><ul><li><code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/talk</code> for Turn/Stun server and Signaling Server if you enabled Talk via the AIO interface</li><li><code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/theming</code> for the theming URL</li><li><code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/app_api</code> for the deploy daemon if you enabled the App API via the AIO interface</li></ul><h3>How to properly reset the instance?</h3><p>If something goes unexpected routes during the initial installation, you might want to reset the AIO installation to be able to start from scratch.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] If you already have it running and have data on your instance, you should not follow these instructions as it will delete all data that is coupled to your AIO instance.</p></blockquote><p>Here is how to reset the AIO instance properly:</p><ol><li>Stop all containers if they are running from the AIO interface</li><li>Stop the mastercontainer with <code>sudo docker stop nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer</code></li><li>If the domaincheck container is still running, stop it with <code>sudo docker stop nextcloud-aio-domaincheck</code></li><li>Check that no AIO containers are running anymore by running <code>sudo docker ps --format {{.Names}}</code>. If no  containers are listed, you can proceed with the steps below. If there should be some, you will need to stop them with <code>sudo docker stop &lt;container_name&gt;</code> until no one is listed anymore.</li><li>Check which containers are stopped: <code>sudo docker ps --filter \"status=exited\"</code></li><li>Now remove all these stopped containers with <code>sudo docker container prune</code></li><li>Delete the docker network with <code>sudo docker network rm nextcloud-aio</code></li><li>Check which volumes are dangling with <code>sudo docker volume ls --filter \"dangling=true\"</code></li><li>Now remove all these dangling volumes: <code>sudo docker volume prune --filter all=1</code> (on Windows you might need to remove some volumes afterwards manually with <code>docker volume rm nextcloud_aio_backupdir</code>, <code>docker volume rm nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_datadir</code>).</li><li>If you've configured  to a path on your host instead of the default volume, you need to clean that up as well. (E.g. by simply deleting the directory).</li><li>Make sure that no volumes are remaining with <code>sudo docker volume ls --format {{.Name}}</code>. If no  volumes are listed, you can proceed with the steps below. If there should be some, you will need to remove them with <code>sudo docker volume rm &lt;volume_name&gt;</code> until no one is listed anymore.</li><li>Optional: You can remove all docker images with <code>sudo docker image prune -a</code>.</li><li>And you are done! Now feel free to start over with the recommended docker run command!</li></ol><h3>Can I use a CIFS/SMB share as Nextcloud's datadir?</h3><p>Sure. Add this to the  file on the host system: <code>&lt;your-storage-host-and-subpath&gt; &lt;your-mount-dir&gt; cifs rw,mfsymlinks,seal,credentials=&lt;your-credentials-file&gt;,uid=33,gid=0,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 0 0</code> (Of course you need to modify <code>&lt;your-storage-host-and-subpath&gt;</code>,  and  for your specific case.)</p><p>One example could look like this:<code>//your-storage-host/subpath /mnt/storagebox cifs rw,mfsymlinks,seal,credentials=/etc/storage-credentials,uid=33,gid=0,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 0 0</code> and add into :</p><pre><code>username=&lt;smb/cifs username&gt;\npassword=&lt;password&gt;\n</code></pre><p>(Of course you need to modify  and  for your specific case.)</p><p>Now you can use  as Nextcloud's datadir like described in the section above this one.</p><h3>Can I run this with Docker swarm?</h3><h3>Can I run this with Kubernetes?</h3><h3>How to run this with Docker rootless?</h3><p>You can run AIO also with docker rootless. How to do this is documented here: <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/raw/main/docker-rootless.md\">docker-rootless.md</a></p><h3>Can I run this with Podman instead of Docker?</h3><h3>Access/Edit Nextcloud files/folders manually</h3><p>The files and folders that you add to Nextcloud are by default stored in the following docker directory: <code>nextcloud_aio_nextcloud:/mnt/ncdata/</code> (usually <code>/var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_data/_data/</code> on linux host systems). If needed, you can modify/add/delete files/folders there but : be very careful when doing so because you might corrupt your AIO installation! Best is to create a backup using the built-in backup solution before editing/changing files/folders in there because you will then be able to restore your instance to the backed up state.</p><p>After you are done modifying/adding/deleting files/folders, don't forget to apply the correct permissions by running: <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chown -R 33:0 /mnt/ncdata/</code> and <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chmod -R 750 /mnt/ncdata/</code> and rescan the files with <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ files:scan --all</code>.</p><h3>How to edit Nextclouds config.php file with a texteditor?</h3><p>You can edit Nextclouds config.php file directly from the host with your favorite text editor. E.g. like this: <code>sudo docker run -it --rm --volume nextcloud_aio_nextcloud:/var/www/html:rw alpine sh -c \"apk add --no-cache nano &amp;&amp; nano /var/www/html/config/config.php\"</code>. Make sure to not break the file though which might corrupt your Nextcloud instance otherwise. In best case, create a backup using the built-in backup solution before editing the file.</p><h3>How to change default files by creating a custom skeleton directory?</h3><p>All users see a set of <a href=\"https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/default_files_configuration.html\">default files and folders</a> as dictated by Nextcloud's configuration. To change these default files and folders a custom skeleton directory must first be created; this can be accomplished by copying your skeleton files <code>sudo docker cp --follow-link /path/to/nextcloud/skeleton/ nextcloud-aio-nextcloud:/mnt/ncdata/skeleton/</code>, applying the correct permissions with <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chown -R 33:0 /mnt/ncdata/skeleton/</code> and <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chmod -R 750 /mnt/ncdata/skeleton/</code> and setting the skeleton directory option with <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ config:system:set skeletondirectory --value=\"/mnt/ncdata/skeleton\"</code>. Further information is available in the Nextcloud documentation on <a href=\"https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#skeletondirectory\">configuration parameters for the skeleton directory</a>.</p><h3>How to adjust the version retention policy and trashbin retention policy?</h3><h3>How to enable automatic updates without creating a backup beforehand?</h3><p>If you have an external backup solution, you might want to enable automatic updates without creating a backup first. However note that doing this is disrecommended since you will not be able to easily create and restore a backup from the AIO interface anymore and you need to make sure to shut down all the containers properly before creating the backup, e.g. by stopping them from the AIO interface first.</p><p>But anyhow, is here a guide that helps you automate the whole procedure:</p><p>You can simply copy and paste the script into a file e.g. named  e.g. here: .</p><p>Afterwards apply the correct permissions with <code>sudo chown root:root /root/shutdown-script.sh</code> and <code>sudo chmod 700 /root/shutdown-script.sh</code>.

However due to this, it is vulnerable to receiving DNS challenges for arbitrary hostnames from anyone on the internet. While this does not compromise your server's security, it can result in cluttered logs and rejected certificate renewal attempts due to rate limit abuse. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to place the AIO interface behind a VPN and/or limit its public exposure.</p><h3>How to migrate from an already existing Nextcloud installation to Nextcloud AIO?</h3><p>Nextcloud AIO provides a backup solution based on <a href=\"https://github.com/borgbackup/borg#what-is-borgbackup\">BorgBackup</a>. These backups act as a restore point in case the installation gets corrupted. By using this tool, backups are incremental, differential, compressed and encrypted – so only the first backup will take a while. Further backups should be fast as only changes are taken into account.</p><p>It is recommended to create a backup before any container update. By doing this, you will be safe regarding any possible complication during updates because you will be able to restore the whole instance with basically one click.</p><p>For local backups, the restore process should be pretty fast as rsync is used to restore the chosen backup which only transfers changed files and deletes additional ones. For remote borg backups, the whole backup archive is extracted from the remote, which depending on how clever  is, may require downloading the whole archive.</p><p>If you connect an external drive to your host, and choose the backup directory to be on that drive, you are also kind of safe against drive failures of the drive where the docker volumes are stored on.</p><p>If you want to back up directly to a remote borg repository:</p><p>Backups can be created and restored in the AIO interface using the buttons  and . Additionally, a backup check is provided that checks the integrity of your backups but it shouldn't be needed in most situations.</p><p>The backups themselves get encrypted with an encryption key that gets shown to you in the AIO interface. Please save that at a safe place as you will not be able to restore from backup without this key.</p><p>Daily backups can get enabled after the initial backup is done. Enabling this also allows to enable an option that allows to automatically update all containers, Nextcloud and its apps.</p><p>Be aware that this solution does not back up files and folders that are mounted into Nextcloud using the external storage app - but you can add further Docker volumes and host paths that you want to back up after the initial backup is done.</p><h3>What is getting backed up by AIO's backup solution?</h3><p>Backed up will get all important data of your Nextcloud AIO instance required to restore the instance, like the database, your files and configuration files of the mastercontainer and else. Files and folders that are mounted into Nextcloud using the external storage app are not getting backed up. There is currently no way to exclude the data directory because it would require hacks like running files:scan and would make the backup solution much more unreliable (since the database and your files/folders need to stay in sync). If you still don't want your datadirectory to be backed up, see <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-enable-automatic-updates-without-creating-a-backup-beforehand\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-enable-automatic-updates-without-creating-a-backup-beforehand</a> for options (there is a hint what needs to be backed up in which order).</p><h3>How to adjust borgs retention policy?</h3><p>The built-in borg-based backup solution has by default a retention policy of <code>--keep-within=7d --keep-weekly=4 --keep-monthly=6</code>. See <a href=\"https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html\">https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html</a> for what these values mean. You can adjust the retention policy by providing <code>--env BORG_RETENTION_POLICY=\"--keep-within=7d --keep-weekly=4 --keep-monthly=6\"</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and customize the value to your fitting. ⚠️ Please make sure that this value is valid, otherwise backup pruning will bug out!</p><h3>How to migrate from AIO to AIO?</h3><p>If you have the borg backup feature enabled, you can copy it over to the new host and restore from the backup. This guide assumes the new installation data dir will be on , you can adjust the steps if it's elsewhere.</p><ol><li>Set the DNS entry to 60 seconds TTL if applicable</li><li>On your current installation, use the AIO interface to: \n  <ol><li>Update AIO and all containers</li><li>Stop all containers (from now on, your cloud is down)</li><li>Create a current borg backup</li><li>Note the path where the backups are stored and the encryption password</li></ol></li><li>Navigate to the backup folder</li><li>Create archive of the backup so it's easier to copy: <code>tar -czvf borg.tar.gz borg</code></li><li>Copy the archive over to the new host: <code>scp borg.tar.gz user@new.host:/mnt</code>. Make sure to replace  with your actual user and  with the IP or domain of the actual host. You can also use another way to copy the archive.</li><li>Go to the folder you put the backup archive and extract it with </li><li>Follow the installation guide to create a new aio instance, but do not start the containers yet (the  or  command)</li><li>Change the DNS entry to the new host's IP</li><li>Configure your reverse proxy if you use one</li><li>Start the AIO container and open the new AIO interface in your browser</li><li>Make sure to save the newly generated passphrase and enter it in the next step</li><li>Select the \"Restore former AIO instance from backup\" option and enter the encryption password from the old backup and the path in which the extracted  folder lies in (without the borg part) and hit <code>Submit location and password</code></li><li>Choose the latest backup in the dropdown and hit </li><li>Wait until the backup is restored</li><li>Start the containers in the AIO interface</li></ol><h3>Are remote borg backups supported?</h3><p>Backing up directly to a remote borg repository is supported. This avoids having to store a local copy of your backups, supports append-only borg keys to counter ransomware and allows using the AIO interface to manage your backups.</p><p>Some alternatives, which do not have all the above benefits:</p><h3>Failure of the backup container in LXC containers</h3><p>If you are running AIO in a LXC container, you need to make sure that FUSE is enabled in the LXC container settings. Also, if using Alpine Linux as host OS, make sure to add fuse via . Otherwise the backup container will not be able to start as FUSE is required for it to work.</p><h3>How to create the backup volume on Windows?</h3><p>As stated in the AIO interface, it is possible to use a docker volume as backup target. Before you can use that, you need to create it first. Here is an example how to create one on Windows:</p><pre><code>docker volume create ^\n--driver local ^\n--name nextcloud_aio_backupdir ^\n-o device=\"/host_mnt/e/your/backup/path\" ^\n-o type=\"none\" ^\n-o o=\"bind\"\n</code></pre><p>In this example, it would mount  into the volume so for a different location you need to adjust <code>/host_mnt/e/your/backup/path</code> accordingly. Afterwards enter  in the AIO interface as backup location.</p><h3>Pro-tip: Backup archives access</h3><p>You can open the BorgBackup archives on your host by following these steps: (instructions for Ubuntu Desktop)</p><pre><code># Install borgbackup on the host\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install borgbackup\n\n# In any shell where you use borg, you must first export this variable\n# If you are using the default backup location /mnt/backup/borg\nexport BORG_REPO='/mnt/backup/borg'\n# or if you are using a remote repository\nexport BORG_REPO='user@host:/path/to/repo'\n\n# Mount the archives to /tmp/borg\nsudo mkdir -p /tmp/borg &amp;&amp; sudo borg mount \"$BORG_REPO\" /tmp/borg\n\n# After entering your repository key successfully, you should be able to access all archives in /tmp/borg\n# You can now do whatever you want by syncing them to a different place using rsync or doing other things\n# E.g. you can open the file manager on that location by running:\nxhost +si:localuser:root &amp;&amp; sudo nautilus /tmp/borg\n\n# When you are done, simply close the file manager and run the following command to unmount the backup archives:\nsudo umount /tmp/borg\n</code></pre><h3>Delete backup archives manually</h3><p>You can delete BorgBackup archives on your host manually by following these steps: (instructions for Debian based OS' like Ubuntu)</p><pre><code># Install borgbackup on the host\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install borgbackup\n\n# In any shell where you use borg, you must first export this variable\n# If you are using the default backup location /mnt/backup/borg\nexport BORG_REPO='/mnt/backup/borg'\n# or if you are using a remote repository\nexport BORG_REPO='user@host:/path/to/repo'\n\n# List all archives (if you are using the default backup location /mnt/backup/borg)\nsudo borg list\n\n# After entering your repository key successfully, you should now see a list of all backup archives\n# An example backup archive might be called 20220223_174237-nextcloud-aio\n# Then you can simply delete the archive with:\nsudo borg delete --stats --progress \"::20220223_174237-nextcloud-aio\"\n\n# If borg 1.2.0 or higher is installed, you then need to run borg compact in order to clean up the freed space\nsudo borg --version\n# If version number of the command above is higher than 1.2.0 you need to run the command below:\nsudo borg compact\n\n</code></pre><p>After doing so, make sure to update the backup archives list in the AIO interface! You can do so by clicking on the  button or  button.</p><h3>Sync local backups regularly to another drive</h3><p>For increased backup security, you might consider syncing the local backup repository regularly to another drive.</p><p>To do that, first add the drive to  so that it is able to get automatically mounted and then create a script that does all the things automatically. Here is an example for such a script:</p><p>You can simply copy and paste the script into a file e.g. named  e.g. here: . Do not forget to modify the variables to your requirements!</p><p>Afterwards apply the correct permissions with <code>sudo chown root:root /root/backup-script.sh</code> and <code>sudo chmod 700 /root/backup-script.sh</code>. Then you can create a cronjob that runs e.g. at  each week on Sundays like this:</p><ol><li>Open the cronjob with  (and choose your editor of choice if not already done. I'd recommend nano).</li><li>Add the following new line to the crontab if not already present: <code>0 20 * * 7 /root/backup-script.sh</code> which will run the script at 20:00 on Sundays each week.</li><li>save and close the crontab (when using nano are the shortcuts for this  -&gt;  and close the editor with ).</li></ol><h3>How to exclude Nextcloud's data directory or the preview folder from backup?</h3><p>In order to speed up the backups and to keep the backup archives small, you might want to exclude Nextcloud's data directory or its preview folder from backup.</p><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] However please note that you will run into problems if the database and the data directory or preview folder get out of sync. <strong>So please only read further, if you have an additional external backup of the data directory!</strong> See <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/#how-to-enable-automatic-updates-without-creating-a-backup-beforehand\">this guide</a> for example.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[!TIP] A better option is to use the external storage app inside Nextcloud as the data connected via the external storage app is not backed up by AIO's backup solution. See <a href=\"https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/external_storage_configuration_gui.html\">this documentation</a> on how to configure the app.</p></blockquote><p>If you still want to proceed, you can exclude the data directory by simply creating a  file in the root directory of the specified  target. The same logic is implemented for the preview folder that is located inside the data directory, inside the  folder. So simply create a  file in there if you want to exclude the preview folder.</p><p>After doing a restore via the AIO interface, you might run into problems due to the data directory and database being out of sync. You might be able to fix this by running  and  and . See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-occ-commands\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-occ-commands</a>. If only the preview folder is excluded, the command <code>occ files:scan-app-data preview</code> should be used.</p><h3>How to stop/start/update containers or trigger the daily backup from a script externally?</h3><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] The below script will only work after the initial setup of AIO. So you will always need to first visit the AIO interface, type in your domain and start the containers the first time or restore an older AIO instance from its borg backup before you can use the script.</p></blockquote><p>You can do so by running the  script that is stored in the mastercontainer. It accepts the following environment variables:</p><ul><li> if set to , it will automatically stop the containers, update them and start them including the mastercontainer. If the mastercontainer gets updated, this script's execution will stop as soon as the mastercontainer gets stopped. You can then wait until it is started again and run the script with this flag again in order to update all containers correctly afterwards.</li><li> if set to , it will automatically stop the containers and create a backup. If you want to start them again afterwards, you may have a look at the  option.</li><li> if set to , it will automatically start the containers without updating them.</li><li> if set to , it will automatically stop the containers.</li><li> if set to , it will start the backup check. This is not allowed to be enabled at the same time like . Please be aware that this option is non-blocking which means that the backup check is not done when the process is finished since it only start the borgbackup container with the correct configuration.</li></ul><p>One example for this would be <code>sudo docker exec -it --env DAILY_BACKUP=1 nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer /daily-backup.sh</code>, which you can run via a cronjob or put it in a script.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] None of the option returns error codes. So you need to check for the correct result yourself.</p></blockquote><h3>How to disable the backup section?</h3><p>If you already have a backup solution in place, you may want to hide the backup section. You can do so by adding <code>--env AIO_DISABLE_BACKUP_SECTION=true</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used).</p><p>It is possible to connect to an existing LDAP server. You need to make sure that the LDAP server is reachable from the Nextcloud container. Then you can enable the LDAP app and configure LDAP in Nextcloud manually. If you don't have a LDAP server yet, recommended is to use this docker container: <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/nitnelave/lldap\">https://hub.docker.com/r/nitnelave/lldap</a>. Make sure here as well that Nextcloud can talk to the LDAP server. The easiest way is by adding the LDAP docker container to the docker network . Then you can connect to the LDAP container by its name from the Nextcloud container. There is now a community container which allows to easily add LLDAP to AIO: <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/lldap\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/lldap</a></p><p>If you want to use the user_sql app, the easiest way is to create an additional database container and add it to the docker network . Then the Nextcloud container should be able to talk to the database container using its name.</p><h3>phpMyAdmin, Adminer or pgAdmin</h3><h3>Requirements for integrating new containers</h3><p>What are the requirements?</p><ol><li>New containers must be related to Nextcloud. Related means that there must be a feature in Nextcloud that gets added by adding this container.</li><li>It must be optionally installable. Disabling and enabling the container from the AIO interface must work and must not produce any unexpected side-effects.</li><li>The feature that gets added into Nextcloud by adding the container must be maintained by the Nextcloud GmbH.</li><li>It must be possible to run the container without big quirks inside docker containers. Big quirks means e.g. needing to change the capabilities or security options.</li><li>The container should not mount directories from the host into the container: only docker volumes should be used.</li><li>The container must be usable by more than 90% of the users (e.g. not too high system requirements and such)</li><li>No additional setup should be needed after adding the container - it should work completely out of the box.</li><li>If the container requires being exposed, only subfolders are supported. So the container should not require its own (sub-)domain and must be able to run in a subfolder.</li></ol><p>This project values stability over new features. That means that when a new major Nextcloud update gets introduced, we will wait at least until the first patch release, e.g.  is out before upgrading to it. Also we will wait with the upgrade until all important apps are compatible with the new major version. Minor or patch releases for Nextcloud and all dependencies as well as all containers will be updated to new versions as soon as possible but we try to give all updates first a good test round before pushing them. That means that it can take around 2 weeks before new updates reach the  channel. If you want to help testing, you can switch to the  channel by following <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/#how-to-switch-the-channel\">this documentation</a> which will also give you the updates earlier.</p><h3>How often are update notifications sent?</h3><p>AIO ships its own update notifications implementation. It checks if container updates are available. If so, it sends a notification with the title <code>Container updates available!</code> on saturdays to Nextcloud users that are part of the  group. If the Nextcloud container image should be older than 90 days (~3 months) and thus badly outdated, AIO sends a notification to all Nextcloud users with the title . Thus admins should make sure to update the container images at least once every 3 months in order to make sure that the instance gets all security bugfixes as soon as possible.</p><p>If you should run into issues with huge docker logs, you can adjust the log size by following <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/#usage\">https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/#usage</a>. However for the included AIO containers, this should usually not be needed because almost all of them have the log level set to warn so they should not produce many logs.</p>","contentLength":65765,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"visgl/deck.gl","url":"https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl","date":1751337922,"author":"","guid":177072,"unread":true,"content":"<p>WebGL2 powered visualization framework</p><h5 align=\"center\"> GPU-powered, highly performant large-scale data visualization</h5><p>deck.gl is designed to simplify high-performance, WebGL2/WebGPU based visualization of large data sets.

The llm chooses the structure of the data.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n      \"url\": \"https://docs.firecrawl.dev/\",\n      \"formats\": [\"json\"],\n      \"jsonOptions\": {\n        \"prompt\": \"Extract the company mission from the page.\"\n      }\n    }'\n</code></pre><h3>Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)</h3><p>Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.</p><p>Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n        \"url\": \"google.com\",\n        \"formats\": [\"markdown\"],\n        \"actions\": [\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"textarea[title=\\\"Search\\\"]\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"write\", \"text\": \"firecrawl\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"press\", \"key\": \"ENTER\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 3000},\n            {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"h3\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 3000},\n            {\"type\": \"screenshot\"}\n        ]\n    }'\n</code></pre><h3>Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)</h3><p>You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/batch/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n      \"urls\": [\"https://docs.firecrawl.dev\", \"https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview\"],\n      \"formats\" : [\"markdown\", \"html\"]\n    }'\n</code></pre><pre><code>from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp\nfrom firecrawl.firecrawl import ScrapeOptions\n\napp = FirecrawlApp(api_key=\"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\")\n\n# Scrape a website:\nscrape_status = app.scrape_url(\n  'https://firecrawl.dev', \n  formats=[\"markdown\", \"html\"]\n)\nprint(scrape_status)\n\n# Crawl a website:\ncrawl_status = app.crawl_url(\n  'https://firecrawl.dev',\n  limit=100,\n  scrape_options=ScrapeOptions(\n    formats=[\"markdown\", \"html\"],),\n  poll_interval=30\n)\nprint(crawl_status)\n</code></pre><h3>Extracting structured data from a URL</h3><p>With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:</p><pre><code>class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n    points: int \n    by: str\n    commentsURL: str\n\nclass TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):\n    top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., description=\"Top 5 stories\")\n\njson_config = JsonConfig(schema=TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema())\n\nllm_extraction_result = app.scrape_url('https://news.ycombinator.com', formats=[\"json\"], json=json_config)\n\nprint(llm_extraction_result.json)\n</code></pre><p>To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:</p><pre><code>npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js\n</code></pre><ol><li>Set the API key as an environment variable named  or pass it as a parameter to the  class.</li></ol><pre><code>import FirecrawlApp, { CrawlParams, CrawlStatusResponse } from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';\n\nconst app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: \"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\"});\n\n// Scrape a website\nconst scrapeResponse = await app.scrapeUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {\n  formats: ['markdown', 'html'],\n});\n\nif (scrapeResponse) {\n  console.log(scrapeResponse)\n}\n\n// Crawl a website\nconst crawlResponse = await app.crawlUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {\n  limit: 100,\n  scrapeOptions: {\n    formats: ['markdown', 'html'],\n  }\n} satisfies CrawlParams, true, 30) satisfies CrawlStatusResponse;\n\nif (crawlResponse) {\n  console.log(crawlResponse)\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Extracting structured data from a URL</h3><p>With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:</p><pre><code>import FirecrawlApp from \"@mendable/firecrawl-js\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n\nconst app = new FirecrawlApp({\n  apiKey: \"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\"\n});\n\n// Define schema to extract contents into\nconst schema = z.object({\n  top: z\n    .array(\n      z.object({\n        title: z.string(),\n        points: z.number(),\n        by: z.string(),\n        commentsURL: z.string(),\n      })\n    )\n    .length(5)\n    .describe(\"Top 5 stories on Hacker News\"),\n});\n\nconst scrapeResult = await app.scrapeUrl(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\", {\n  jsonOptions: { extractionSchema: schema },\n});\n\nconsole.log(scrapeResult.data[\"json\"]);\n</code></pre><h2>Open Source vs Cloud Offering</h2><p>Firecrawl is open source available under the AGPL-3.0 license.</p><p>To deliver the best possible product, we offer a hosted version of Firecrawl alongside our open-source offering.

Neko is a powerful tool that allows you to <strong>run a fully-functional browser in a virtual environment</strong>, giving you the ability to <strong>access the internet securely and privately from anywhere</strong>. With Neko, you can browse the web, , and perform other tasks just as you would on a regular browser, all within a <strong>secure and isolated environment</strong>. Whether you are a developer looking to test web applications, a <strong>privacy-conscious user seeking a secure browsing experience</strong>, or simply someone who wants to take advantage of the <strong>convenience and flexibility of a virtual browser</strong>, Neko is the perfect solution.</p><p>In addition to its security and privacy features, Neko offers the <strong>ability for multiple users to access it simultaneously</strong>. This makes it an ideal solution for teams or organizations that need to share access to a browser, as well as for individuals who want to use <strong>multiple devices to access the same virtual environment</strong>. With Neko, you can <strong>easily and securely share access to a browser with others</strong>, without having to worry about maintaining separate configurations or settings. Whether you need to , access shared resources, or simply want to <strong>share access to a browser with friends or family</strong>, Neko makes it easy to do so.</p><p>Neko is also a great tool for  and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are , without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to <strong>stay connected with friends and colleagues</strong>, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an , whether it's for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and <strong>interact with them in real-time</strong>.</p><p>This app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it\">rabb.it</a> went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few  clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found <a href=\"https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus\">Turtus</a> and he was able to figure out the rest.</p><p>Then I found <a href=\"https://github.com/nurdism/neko\">this</a> project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.</p><p>Neko started as a virtual browser that is streamed using WebRTC to multiple users.</p><ul><li>It is <strong>not only limited to a browser</strong>; it can run anything that runs on linux (e.g. VLC). Browser only happens to be the most popular and widely used use-case.</li><li>In fact, it is not limited to a single program either; you can install a full desktop environment (e.g. XFCE, KDE).</li><li>Speaking of limits, it does not need to run in a container; you could install neko on your host, connect to your X server and control your whole VM.</li><li>Theoretically it is not limited to only X server, anything that can be controlled and scraped periodically for images could be used instead. \n  <ul><li>Like implementing RDP or VNC protocol, where neko would only act as WebRTC relay server. This is currently only future.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Primary use case is connecting with multiple people, leveraging real time synchronization and interactivity:</p><ul><li> - watching video content together with multiple people and reacting to it (chat, emotes) - open source alternative to <a href=\"https://giggl.app/\">giggl.app</a> or <a href=\"https://watch.hyperbeam.com\">hyperbeam</a>.</li><li> - not only screen sharing, but others can control the screen.</li><li> - brainstorming ideas, cobrowsing, code debugging together.</li><li> - interactively guiding people in controlled environment.</li><li> - embed virtual browser in your web app - open source alternative to <a href=\"https://hyperbeam.com/\">hyperbeam API</a>. \n  <ul><li>open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Other use cases that benefit from single-user:</p><ul><li> - streaming containerized apps and desktops to end-users - similar to <a href=\"https://www.kasmweb.com/\">kasm</a>.</li><li> - own browser with persistent cookies available anywhere - similar to <a href=\"https://www.mightyapp.com/\">mightyapp</a>. \n  <ul><li>no state is left on the host browser after terminating the connection.</li><li>sensitive data like cookies are not transferred - only video is shared.</li></ul></li><li> - a better solution for planning secret parties and buying birthday gifts off the internet. \n  <ul><li>use Tor Browser and <a href=\"https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-vpn\">VPN</a> for additional anonymity.</li><li>mitigates risk of OS fingerprinting and browser vulnerabilities by running in container.</li></ul></li><li> - broadcast room content using RTMP (to e.g. twitch or youtube...).</li><li> - broadcast RTMP can be saved to a file using e.g. <a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/modules/rtmp-media-streaming/\">nginx-rtmp</a><ul><li>have clean environment when recording tutorials.</li><li>no need to hide bookmarks or use incognito mode.</li></ul></li><li> - access your internal applications securely without the need for VPN.</li><li> - you can install <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\">playwright</a> or <a href=\"https://pptr.dev/\">puppeteer</a> and automate tasks while being able to actively intercept them.</li></ul><ul><li> because it uses WebRTC and not images sent over WebSockets.</li><li> support, what is not part of Apache Guacamole or noVNC.</li><li><strong>Multi-participant control</strong>, what is not natively supported by Apache Guacamole or noVNC.</li></ul><p>I like cats 🐱 ( is the Japanese word for cat), I'm a weeb/nerd.</p><p> Because cats are , but you love them anyways.</p><p>For neko room management software, visit <a href=\"https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-rooms\">neko-rooms</a>.</p><p>Full documentation is available at <a href=\"https://neko.m1k1o.net/\">neko.m1k1o.net</a>.

Co-STORM further enhanced its feature by enabling human to collaborative LLM system to support more aligned and preferred information seeking and knowledge curation. \n<p>While the system cannot produce publication-ready articles that often require a significant number of edits, experienced Wikipedia editors have found it helpful in their pre-writing stage.</p><p><strong>More than 70,000 people have tried our <a href=\"https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/\">live research preview</a>. Try it out to see how STORM can help your knowledge exploration journey and please provide feedback to help us improve the system 🙏!</strong></p><h2>How STORM &amp; Co-STORM works</h2><p>STORM breaks down generating long articles with citations into two steps:</p><ol><li>: The system conducts Internet-based research to collect references and generates an outline.</li><li>: The system uses the outline and references to generate the full-length article with citations.</li></ol><p>STORM identifies the core of automating the research process as automatically coming up with good questions to ask. Directly prompting the language model to ask questions does not work well. To improve the depth and breadth of the questions, STORM adopts two strategies:</p><ol><li><strong>Perspective-Guided Question Asking</strong>: Given the input topic, STORM discovers different perspectives by surveying existing articles from similar topics and uses them to control the question-asking process.</li><li>: STORM simulates a conversation between a Wikipedia writer and a topic expert grounded in Internet sources to enable the language model to update its understanding of the topic and ask follow-up questions.</li></ol><p>Co-STORM proposes <strong>a collaborative discourse protocol</strong> which implements a turn management policy to support smooth collaboration among</p><ul><li>: This type of agent generates answers grounded on external knowledge sources and/or raises follow-up questions based on the discourse history.</li><li>: This agent generates thought-provoking questions inspired by information discovered by the retriever but not directly used in previous turns. Question generation can also be grounded!</li><li>: The human user will take the initiative to either (1) observe the discourse to gain deeper understanding of the topic, or (2) actively engage in the conversation by injecting utterances to steer the discussion focus.</li></ul><p>Co-STORM also maintains a dynamic updated , which organize collected information into a hierarchical concept structure, aiming to <strong>build a shared conceptual space between the human user and the system</strong>. The mind map has been proven to help reduce the mental load when the discourse goes long and in-depth.</p><p>Both STORM and Co-STORM are implemented in a highly modular way using <a href=\"https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy\">dspy</a>.</p><p>To install the knowledge storm library, use <code>pip install knowledge-storm</code>.</p><p>You could also install the source code which allows you to modify the behavior of STORM engine directly.</p><ol><li><p>Clone the git repository.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm.git\ncd storm\n</code></pre></li><li><p>Install the required packages.</p><pre><code>conda create -n storm python=3.11\nconda activate storm\npip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre></li></ol><p>Currently, our package support:</p><ul><li>Language model components: All language models supported by litellm as listed <a href=\"https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers\">here</a></li><li>Embedding model components: All embedding models supported by litellm as listed <a href=\"https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/embedding/supported_embedding\">here</a></li><li>retrieval module components: , , , , , , , , , and  as</li></ul><p>Both STORM and Co-STORM are working in the information curation layer, you need to set up the information retrieval module and language model module to create their  classes respectively.</p><p>The STORM knowledge curation engine is defined as a simple Python  class.

STORM engine consists of 4 modules:</p><ol><li>Knowledge Curation Module: Collects a broad coverage of information about the given topic.</li><li>Outline Generation Module: Organizes the collected information by generating a hierarchical outline for the curated knowledge.</li><li>Article Generation Module: Populates the generated outline with the collected information.</li><li>Article Polishing Module: Refines and enhances the written article for better presentation.</li></ol><p>The interface for each module is defined in <code>knowledge_storm/interface.py</code>, while their implementations are instantiated in <code>knowledge_storm/storm_wiki/modules/*</code>. These modules can be customized according to your specific requirements (e.g., generating sections in bullet point format instead of full paragraphs).</p><p>If you have installed the source code, you can customize Co-STORM based on your own use case</p><ol><li>Co-STORM introduces multiple LLM agent types (i.e. Co-STORM experts and Moderator). LLM agent interface is defined in <code>knowledge_storm/interface.py</code> , while its implementation is instantiated in <code>knowledge_storm/collaborative_storm/modules/co_storm_agents.py</code>. Different LLM agent policies can be customized.</li><li>Co-STORM introduces a collaborative discourse protocol, with its core function centered on turn policy management. We provide an example implementation of turn policy management through  in <code>knowledge_storm/collaborative_storm/engine.py</code>. It can be customized and further improved.</li></ol><p>To facilitate the study of automatic knowledge curation and complex information seeking, our project releases the following datasets:</p><p>The FreshWiki Dataset is a collection of 100 high-quality Wikipedia articles focusing on the most-edited pages from February 2022 to September 2023.

It is an Open source alternative to Perplexity AI</p><p>Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.</p><p>Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.</p><p>Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it <a href=\"https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md\">here</a>.</p><ul><li>: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.</li><li><ul><li> (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.</li><li> Processes your query and performs a web search.</li></ul></li><li> Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes: \n  <ul><li> Searches the entire web to find the best results.</li><li> Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.</li><li> Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.</li><li> Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.</li><li><strong>Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:</strong> Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.</li><li> Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.</li></ul></li><li> Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.</li><li>: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.</li></ul><p>It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/master/#upcoming-features\">upcoming features</a>.</p><p>There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.</p><h3>Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)</h3><ol><li><p>Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.</p></li><li><p>Clone the Perplexica repository:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git\n</code></pre></li><li><p>After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.</p></li><li><p>Rename the  file to . For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:</p><ul><li><p>: Your OpenAI API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as <code>http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER</code>. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code>. For other ports, adjust accordingly. <strong>You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Groq API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Anthropic API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Gemini API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Google's models</strong>.</p><p>: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.</p></li><li><p>: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Ensure you are in the directory containing the  file and execute:</p></li><li><p>Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a> in your web browser.</p></li></ol><p>: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.</p><ol><li>Install SearXNG and allow  format in the SearXNG settings.</li><li>Clone the repository and rename the  file to  in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.</li><li>After populating the configuration run .</li><li>Install the dependencies and then execute .</li><li>Finally, start the app by running </li></ol><p>: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.</p><p>If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Check your Ollama API URL:</strong> Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.</p></li><li><p><strong>Update API URL Based on OS:</strong></p><ul><li> Use <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code></li><li> Use <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code></li><li> Use <code>http://&lt;private_ip_of_host&gt;:11434</code></li></ul><p>Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Inside <code>/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service</code>, you need to add <code>Environment=\"OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0\"</code>. Then restart Ollama by . For more information see <a href=\"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/raw/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux\">Ollama docs</a></p></li><li><p>Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Open your browser's settings.</li><li>Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.</li><li>Add a new site search with the following URL: <code>http://localhost:3000/?q=%s</code>. Replace  with your IP address or domain name, and  with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.</li><li>Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.</li></ol><p>Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.</p><p>For more details, check out the full documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md\">here</a>.</p><h2>Expose Perplexica to network</h2><p>Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.</p><p>If you find Perplexica useful, consider giving us a star on GitHub.

All agents on this platform are open source and, over time, will cover a very large variety of use cases.</p><p>The goal with the studio is to build an educational platform for you to learn how to do incredible things with AI, while still providing practical value so that you’ll want to use the agents just for the sake of what they can do for you!</p><p>This platform is still in beta – expect longer response times under load, a rapidly growing agent library over the coming months, and a lot more content on this platform soon on Cole Medin’s YouTube channel!</p><p>This repository contains the source code/workflow JSON for all the agents on the Live Agent Studio! Every agent being added to the platform is currently be open sourced here so we can not only create a curated collection of cutting-edge agents together as a community, but also learn from one another!</p><p>Most agents on the Live Agent Studio cost tokens to use, which are purchasable on the platform. However, when you first sign in you are given some tokens to start so you can use the agents free of charge! The biggest reason agents cost tokens is that we pay for the LLM usage since we host all the agents developed by you and the rest of the community!</p><p>As the Live Agent Studio develops, it will become the go-to place to stay on top of what is possible with AI agents! Anytime there is a new AI technology, groundbreaking agent research, or a new tool/library to build agents with, it’ll be featured through agents on the platform. It’s a tall order, but we have big plans for the oTTomator community, and we’re confident we can grow to accomplish this!</p><h3>I want to build an agent to showcase in the Live Agent Studio! How do I do that?</h3><p>Head on over here to learn how to build an agent for the platform:</p><h3>How many tokens does it cost to use an agent?</h3><p>Each agent will charge tokens per prompt. The number of tokens depends on the agent, as some agents use larger LLMs, some call LLMs multiple times, and some use paid APIs.</p><h3>Where can I go to talk about all these agents and get help implementing them myself?</h3><p>Head on over to our Think Tank community and feel free to make a post!</p><p>© 2024 Live Agent Studio.

With tools that let him create &amp; edit files, explore large projects, use the browser, and execute terminal commands (after you grant permission), he can assist you in ways that go beyond code completion or tech support. Cline can even use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create new tools and extend his own capabilities. While autonomous AI scripts traditionally run in sandboxed environments, this extension provides a human-in-the-loop GUI to approve every file change and terminal command, providing a safe and accessible way to explore the potential of agentic AI.</p><ol><li>Enter your task and add images to convert mockups into functional apps or fix bugs with screenshots.</li><li>Cline starts by analyzing your file structure &amp; source code ASTs, running regex searches, and reading relevant files to get up to speed in existing projects. By carefully managing what information is added to context, Cline can provide valuable assistance even for large, complex projects without overwhelming the context window.</li><li>Once Cline has the information he needs, he can: \n  <ul><li>Create and edit files + monitor linter/compiler errors along the way, letting him proactively fix issues like missing imports and syntax errors on his own.</li><li>Execute commands directly in your terminal and monitor their output as he works, letting him e.g., react to dev server issues after editing a file.</li><li>For web development tasks, Cline can launch the site in a headless browser, click, type, scroll, and capture screenshots + console logs, allowing him to fix runtime errors and visual bugs.</li></ul></li><li>When a task is completed, Cline will present the result to you with a terminal command like&nbsp;<code>open -a \"Google Chrome\" index.html</code>, which you run with a click of a button.</li></ol><blockquote><p>[!TIP] Use the&nbsp;&nbsp;shortcut to open the command palette and type&nbsp;\"Cline: Open In New Tab\"&nbsp;to open the extension as a tab in your editor.

You can also configure any OpenAI compatible API, or use a local model through LM Studio/Ollama. If you're using OpenRouter, the extension fetches their latest model list, allowing you to use the newest models as soon as they're available.</p><p>The extension also keeps track of total tokens and API usage cost for the entire task loop and individual requests, keeping you informed of spend every step of the way.</p><img align=\"left\" width=\"370\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81be79a8-1fdb-4028-9129-5fe055e01e76\"><p>Thanks to the new <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_terminal-shell-integration-api\">shell integration updates in VSCode v1.93</a>, Cline can execute commands directly in your terminal and receive the output. This allows him to perform a wide range of tasks, from installing packages and running build scripts to deploying applications, managing databases, and executing tests, all while adapting to your dev environment &amp; toolchain to get the job done right.</p><p>For long running processes like dev servers, use the \"Proceed While Running\" button to let Cline continue in the task while the command runs in the background. As Cline works he’ll be notified of any new terminal output along the way, letting him react to issues that may come up, such as compile-time errors when editing files.</p><img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5977833-d9b8-491e-90f9-05f9cd38c588\"><p>Cline can create and edit files directly in your editor, presenting you a diff view of the changes. You can edit or revert Cline's changes directly in the diff view editor, or provide feedback in chat until you're satisfied with the result. Cline also monitors linter/compiler errors (missing imports, syntax errors, etc.) so he can fix issues that come up along the way on his own.</p><p>All changes made by Cline are recorded in your file's Timeline, providing an easy way to track and revert modifications if needed.</p><img align=\"left\" width=\"370\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2e85ba-dfeb-4fe6-9942-7cfc4703cbe5\"><p>With Claude 3.5 Sonnet's new <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use\">Computer Use</a> capability, Cline can launch a browser, click elements, type text, and scroll, capturing screenshots and console logs at each step. This allows for interactive debugging, end-to-end testing, and even general web use! This gives him autonomy to fixing visual bugs and runtime issues without you needing to handhold and copy-pasting error logs yourself.</p><p>Try asking Cline to \"test the app\", and watch as he runs a command like , launches your locally running dev server in a browser, and performs a series of tests to confirm that everything works. <a href=\"https://x.com/sdrzn/status/1850880547825823989\">See a demo here.</a></p><img align=\"right\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac0efa14-5c1f-4c26-a42d-9d7c56f5fadd\"><p>Thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol\">Model Context Protocol</a>, Cline can extend his capabilities through custom tools. While you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers\">community-made servers</a>, Cline can instead create and install tools tailored to your specific workflow. Just ask Cline to \"add a tool\" and he will handle everything, from creating a new MCP server to installing it into the extension.

You can use the 'Compare' button to see a diff between the snapshot and your current workspace, and the 'Restore' button to roll back to that point.</p><p>For example, when working with a local web server, you can use 'Restore Workspace Only' to quickly test different versions of your app, then use 'Restore Task and Workspace' when you find the version you want to continue building from.

For example if using Docker Desktop, this can be done by going to Docker Desktop Settings &gt; Resources &gt; Advanced &gt; Memory Limit, and increasing it to the maximum possible value.</p><p>Run the following commands from the root of the repository.</p><p>If you’re using a Mac or if your machine has CPU-only support:</p><pre><code>docker-compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-cpu\n</code></pre><p>If you're using a machine with an officially supported GPU:</p><pre><code>docker-compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-gpu\n</code></pre><p>If  does not work when running the above commands, please try  (no hyphen) instead. I.e. <code> docker compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-gpu</code>. This issue sometimes occurs on users running Ubuntu.</p><h3>Experimental (advanced) mode</h3><pre><code>python3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n./run_rl_swarm.sh\n</code></pre><ol><li>Login with your preferred method.</li></ol><p>If you would like to upload your model to Hugging Face, enter your Hugging Face access token when prompted. You can generate one from your Hugging Face account, under <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens\">Access Tokens</a>.</p><h3>Initial peering and training</h3><p>From this stage onward your device will begin training. You should see your peer register and vote on-chain <a href=\"https://gensyn-testnet.explorer.alchemy.com/address/0xFaD7C5e93f28257429569B854151A1B8DCD404c2?tab=logs\">here</a>.</p><p>You can also track your training progress in real time:</p><p>On-chain identity is managed via an Alchemy modal sign-in screen. You need to supply an email address or login via a supported method (e.g. Google). This creates an EOA public/private key (which are stored by Alchemy). You will also receive local session keys in the . Note that these aren't your EOA public/private keys.</p><p>During the initial set-up process, you will also create a  file which maintains the identity of your peer. This is then registered on chain using the EOA wallet hosted in Alchemy, triggered using your local api keys. This links the  to the  (and corresponding EOA in Alchemy).</p><p><strong>If you want to link multiple nodes to a single EOA</strong>, simply sign up each node using the same email address. You will get a new peer ID for each node, however they will all be linked to the same EOA that your email is linked to.</p><p>: if you are using a fork of this repo, or a service organised by someone else (e.g. a 'one click deployment' provider) the identity management flow below is not guaranteed.</p><p>In the following two scenarios, everything will work (i.e. you will have an on-chain identity linked with your RL Swarm peer training):</p><ul><li>The very first time you run the node from scratch with a new email address. The smart account will be created fresh and linked with the swarm.pem that is also fresh.</li><li>If you run it again with a  AND login the original  used with that . Note: this will throw an error into the log on registration but will still be able to sign transactions.</li></ul><p>In the following two scenarios, it will not work (i.e. you won't have an on-chain identity linked with your RL Swarm peer training):</p><ul><li>If you keep your  and try to link it to an  distinct from the one with which it was first registered.</li></ul><p>Therefore, you should do these actions in the following scenarios</p><ul><li><strong>Signed up with , generated , BUT lost </strong> OR <strong>You want to run multiple nodes at once</strong>: run from scratch with the same email address and generate a new .</li><li><strong>Signed up with , generated , kept </strong> -&gt; you can re-run a single node using this pair if you've still got them both.</li></ul><ul><li><p> You can find them inside the  directory:</p><ul><li>: This file contains logs for the modal login server.</li><li>: This is the main log file for the RL Swarm application.</li><li>: This directory contains various logs related to your training runs, including a  file. These can be updated to Weights &amp; Biases (only available if you log_with wandb).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>My peer 'skipped a round'</strong>: this occurs when your device isn't fast enough to keep up with the pace of the swarm. For example, if you start training at round 100 and by the time you finish training the rest of the swarm reaches round 102, you will skip round 101 and go straight to 102. This is because your peer is more valuable if it is participating in the active round.</p></li><li><p><strong>My model doesn't seem to be training?</strong></p><ul><li>If you're using a consumer device (e.g. a MacBook), it is likely just running slowly - check back in 20 minutes.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Logging in with a new account after previous login?</strong></p><ul><li>Make sure you click 'Logout' on the login screen before you leave your previous session</li><li>Make sure you delete  from the root directory (try ). If you don't do this, and you previously registered with the peer-id stored in this file, it will disrupt the training process.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Issues with the Login screen</strong></p><ul><li>: some users report issues with the  package. There are two fixes: \n    <ul><li>in the  update: </li><li>in the terminal <code>cd /root/rl-swarm/modal-login/ &amp;&amp; yarn upgrade &amp;&amp; yarn add next@latest &amp;&amp; yarn add viem@latest</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>I'm getting lots of warnings</strong></p><ul><li>This is expected behaviour and usually the output of the package managers or other dependencies. The most common is the below Protobuf warning - which can be ignored <pre><code>WARNING: The candidate selected for download or install is a yanked version: 'protobuf' candidate...\n</code></pre></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><p><strong>How do I access the login screen if I'm running in a VM?</strong>: port forwarding. Add this SSH flag:  when connecting to your VM. E.g. <code>gcloud compute ssh --zone \"us-central1-a\" [your-vm] --project [your-project] -- -L 3000:localhost:3000</code>. Note, some VPSs may not work with . Check the Gensyn <a href=\"https://discord.gg/AdnyWNzXh5\">discord</a> for up-to-date information on this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disconnection/general issues</strong>: If you are tunneling to a VM and suffer a broken pipe, you will likely encounter OOM or unexpected behaviour the first time you relaunch the script. If you  and kill the script it should spin down all background processes. Restart the script and everything should work normally.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Issues with npm/general installation?</strong></p><ul><li>Try <code>npm install -g node@latest</code></li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Try this (experimental) fix to increase memory: <pre><code>export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0\n</code></pre></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>I have a Windows machine, can I still train a model on the swarm?</strong>: Yes - but this is not very well tested and may require you to do some debugging to get it set up properly. Install WSL and Linux on your Windows machine using the following instructions: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a></p></li><li><p><strong>I want to move my to a different machine and/or restart with a fresh build of the repo, but I want my animal name/peer id to persist.</strong>: To achieve this simply backup the  file on your current machine and then put it in the corresponding location on your new machine/build of the repo.</p></li><li><p><strong>I have multiple GPUs on one machine, can I run multiple peers?</strong>: Yes - but you'll need to manually change things. You'll need to isolate each GPU, install this repo for each GPU, and expose each peer under a different port to pass the modal onboard.</p></li><li><p><strong>My round/stage is behind the smart contract/other peers?</strong>: This is expected behaviour given the different speeds of machines in the network. Once your machine completes it's current round, it will move to the the current round.</p></li><li><p><strong>I want to use a bigger and/or different model in the RL swarm, can I do that?</strong>: Yes - but we only recommend doing so if you are comfortable understanding what size model can reasonably run on your hardware. If you elect to bring a custom model, just paste the repo/model name into the command line when prompted.</p></li><li><p><strong>I am running a model in the swarm on my CPU, have received a python , and my training progress seems to have stopped.</strong>: There are several possible causes for this, but before trying anything please wait long enough to be sure your training actually is frozen and not just slow (e.g., wait longer than a single training iteration has previously taken on your machine). If you're sure training is actually frozen, then some things to try are:</p><ul><li>Set this (experimental) fix: <code>export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0 &amp;&amp; ./run_rl_swarm.sh</code></li></ul></li></ul>","contentLength":10287,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners","date":1750991844,"author":"","guid":172652,"unread":true,"content":"<p>21 Lessons, Get Started Building with Generative AI 🔗 https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/</p><h3>21 Lessons teaching everything you need to know to start building Generative AI applications</h3><h4>Supported via GitHub Action (Automated &amp; Always Up-to-Date)</h4><p>Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 21-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates.</p><p>This course has 21 lessons.

Those commands are still available but are hidden in the  menu. Take a look at this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/zricethezav/b325bb93ebf41b9c0b0507acf12810d2\">gist</a> for easy command translations. If you find v8.19.0 broke an existing command (/), please open an issue.</p><p>There are three scanning modes: , , and .</p><p>The  command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, gitleaks uses the  command to scan patches. You can configure the behavior of  with the  option. For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following command: <code>gitleaks git -v --log-opts=\"--all commitA..commitB\" path_to_repo</code>. See the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log\">git log</a> documentation for more information. If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.</p><p>The  (aliases include , ) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: <code>gitleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file</code>. If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will scan the current working directory.</p><p>You can also stream data to gitleaks with the  command. Example: <code>cat some_file | gitleaks -v stdin</code></p><p>When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline, gitleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any gitleaks report. To create a gitleaks report, run gitleaks with the  parameter.</p><pre><code>gitleaks git --report-path gitleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json\n</code></pre><p>Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:</p><pre><code>gitleaks git --baseline-path gitleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json\n</code></pre><p>After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.</p><p>You can run Gitleaks as a pre-commit hook by copying the example  script into your  directory.</p><p>The order of precedence is:</p><ol><li> option: <pre><code>gitleaks git --config /home/dev/customgitleaks.toml .\n</code></pre></li><li>Environment variable  with the file path: <pre><code>export GITLEAKS_CONFIG=\"/home/dev/customgitleaks.toml\"\ngitleaks git .\n</code></pre></li><li>Environment variable  with the file content: <pre><code>export GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customgitleaks.toml`\ngitleaks git .\n</code></pre></li><li>A  file within the target path: </li></ol><p>If none of the four options are used, then gitleaks will use the default config.</p><p>Gitleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:</p><pre><code># Title for the gitleaks configuration file.\ntitle = \"Custom Gitleaks configuration\"\n\n# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:\n#\n# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply\n#\n#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:\n#    https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml\n#\n# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended\n#\n#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the\n#    default rules.

In release v8.10.0 Gitleaks added a  value to the Gitleaks report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the  file to ignore that specific secret. See Gitleaks' <a href=\"https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/raw/master/.gitleaksignore\">.gitleaksignore</a> for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.</p><p>Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode encoded text. The flag  enables this feature (the default value \"0\" means the feature is disabled by default).</p><p>Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded text. The flag  sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really high max depth doesn't mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases scan times.</p><p>The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following ways:</p><ul><li>The location points the bounds of the encoded text \n  <ul><li>If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to include that as well</li></ul></li><li>The match and secret contain the decoded value</li><li>Two tags are added  and </li></ul><p>Currently supported encodings:</p><ul><li> - Any printable ASCII percent encoded values</li><li> - Any printable ASCII hex encoded values &gt;= 32 characters</li><li> - Any printable ASCII base64 encoded values &gt;= 16 characters</li></ul><p>Sometimes secrets are packaged within archive files like zip files or tarballs, making them difficult to discover. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically extract and scan the contents of archives. The flag  enables this feature for both  and  scan types. The default value of \"0\" means this feature is disabled by default.</p><p>Recursive scanning is supported since archives can also contain other archives. The  flag sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops when there are no new archives to extract, so setting a very high max depth just sets the potential to go that deep. It will only go as deep as it needs to.</p><p>The findings for secrets located within an archive will include the path to the file inside the archive.

target string. This implementation calculates each\ncandidate's fitness based on the alphabetical distance between the candidate\nand the target. A candidate is selected as a parent with probabilities proportional\nto the candidate's fitness. Reproduction is implemented as a single-point\ncrossover between pairs of parents. Mutation is done by randomly assigning\nnew characters with uniform probability.\n\nParameters\n----------\nTarget String: 'Genetic Algorithm'\nPopulation Size: 100\nMutation Rate: 0.05\n\n[0 Closest Candidate: 'CJqlJguPlqzvpoJmb', Fitness: 0.00]\n[1 Closest Candidate: 'MCxZxdr nlfiwwGEk', Fitness: 0.01]\n[2 Closest Candidate: 'MCxZxdm nlfiwwGcx', Fitness: 0.01]\n[3 Closest Candidate: 'SmdsAklMHn kBIwKn', Fitness: 0.01]\n[4 Closest Candidate: '  lotneaJOasWfu Z', Fitness: 0.01]\n...\n[292 Closest Candidate: 'GeneticaAlgorithm', Fitness: 1.00]\n[293 Closest Candidate: 'GeneticaAlgorithm', Fitness: 1.00]\n[294 Answer: 'Genetic Algorithm']\n</code></pre><pre><code>$ python mlfromscratch/examples/apriori.py\n+-------------+\n|   Apriori   |\n+-------------+\nMinimum Support: 0.25\nMinimum Confidence: 0.8\nTransactions:\n    [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    [1, 2, 4]\n    [1, 2]\n    [2, 3, 4]\n    [2, 3]\n    [3, 4]\n    [2, 4]\nFrequent Itemsets:\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, [1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4], [1, 2, 4], [2, 3, 4]]\nRules:\n    1 -&gt; 2 (support: 0.43, confidence: 1.0)\n    4 -&gt; 2 (support: 0.57, confidence: 0.8)\n    [1, 4] -&gt; 2 (support: 0.29, confidence: 1.0)\n</code></pre><p>If there's some implementation you would like to see here or if you're just feeling social, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:eriklindernoren@gmail.com\">email</a> me or connect with me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eriklindernoren/\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>","contentLength":7654,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["trending"]}
