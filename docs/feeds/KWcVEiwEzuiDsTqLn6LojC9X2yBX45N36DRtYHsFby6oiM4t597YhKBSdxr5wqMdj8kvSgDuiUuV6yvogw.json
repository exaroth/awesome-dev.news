This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.</p><p>Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n        \"url\": \"google.com\",\n        \"formats\": [\"markdown\"],\n        \"actions\": [\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"textarea[title=\\\"Search\\\"]\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"write\", \"text\": \"firecrawl\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"press\", \"key\": \"ENTER\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 3000},\n            {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"h3\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 3000},\n            {\"type\": \"screenshot\"}\n        ]\n    }'\n</code></pre><h3>Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)</h3><p>You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/batch/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n      \"urls\": [\"https://docs.firecrawl.dev\", \"https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview\"],\n      \"formats\" : [\"markdown\", \"html\"]\n    }'\n</code></pre><pre><code>from firecrawl import Firecrawl\n\nfirecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key=\"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\")\n\n# Scrape a website (returns a Document)\ndoc = firecrawl.scrape(\n    \"https://firecrawl.dev\",\n    formats=[\"markdown\", \"html\"],\n)\nprint(doc.markdown)\n\n# Crawl a website\nresponse = firecrawl.crawl(\n    \"https://firecrawl.dev\",\n    limit=100,\n    scrape_options={\"formats\": [\"markdown\", \"html\"]},\n    poll_interval=30,\n)\nprint(response)\n</code></pre><h3>Extracting structured data from a URL</h3><p>With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL.

The first of which is to install all needed pieces of the system locally. The second is to use the officially supported Docker image.</p><h4>Local Production Installation</h4><ul><li>Download latest release package (file is called: Leantime-vx.x.x.zip) from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Leantime/leantime/releases\">release page</a></li><li>Create an empty MySQL database</li><li>Upload the entire directory to your server</li><li>Point your domain root to the  directory</li><li>Rename  to </li><li>Fill in your database credentials (username, password, host, dbname) in </li><li>Navigate to </li><li>Follow instructions to install database and set up first user account</li></ul><p>Whilst the steps above are applicable to Internet Information Services (IIS), there is an additional configuration change that may be required in IIS to ensure full functionality - you need to allow the PATCH method:</p><ul><li>Expand the server and sites on the left and select the LeanTime site</li><li>Double click on </li><li>Double click on the PHP handler mapping that is used by the site</li><li>Click </li><li>In the <code>One of the following verbs</code> text box, add  - for example: </li><li>In the  text box, put a double quote character () at the start and at the end of the path to the  file (<em>this isn't needed if the path doesn't have a space in it</em>)</li><li>A popup will appear asking if you want to create a FastCGI application - click </li></ul><p>Note: You may need to repeat this when you upgrade PHP.</p><h4>Production Installation via Docker</h4><p>We maintain an official <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/leantime/leantime\">Docker image on dockerhub</a>. To run the image enter your MySQL credentials and execute. You can pass in all the configuration variables from .env</p><pre><code>docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 --network leantime-net \\\n-e LEAN_DB_HOST=mysql_leantime \\\n-e LEAN_DB_USER=admin \\\n-e LEAN_DB_PASSWORD=321.qwerty \\\n-e LEAN_DB_DATABASE=leantime \\\n-e LEAN_EMAIL_RETURN=changeme@local.local \\\n--name leantime leantime/leantime:latest\n</code></pre><p>Once started you can go to  and run the installation script.</p><p><strong>Important: If you are planning to use plugins you need to mount the plugin folder <code>plugins:/var/www/html/app/Plugins</code> and ensure the www-data user has access to it. Otherwise installation may fail or plugins will be removed after a restart</strong></p><h5>Docker Installation Notes</h5><p>If you intend to place Leantime behind a reverse proxy (nginx, etc.) to handle custom domain name resolution and SSL offloading, you will need to set the following environment variable in docker</p><pre><code>-e LEAN_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com \\\n</code></pre><ul><li>Update yourdomain.com to your custom domain name. </li></ul><h3>🤓 Installation (Development)</h3><p>There are two ways to install a development setup of LeanTime. The first (but most technical) is to install all pieces of the system locally. The second (and preferred method) is to use a docker containerized development environment.</p><h4>Local Development Installation</h4><ul><li>Clone repository to your local server</li><li>Run webpack builder via </li><li>Point your local domain to the  directory</li><li>Rename  to </li><li>Fill in your database credentials (username, password, host, dbname) in </li><li>Navigate to </li><li>Follow instructions to install database and user account</li></ul><h4>Development Installation via Docker</h4><p>For development, we use a dockerized development environment. You will need to have , , , ,  and  installed.</p><ul><li>Notes for Windows Environments: \n  <ul><li>Run all commands within the git bash terminal in order to utilize unix specific commands</li><li>If installing php from a zip file, make sure to configure php.ini It does not exist initially, so copy C:\\php\\php.ini-development to C:\\php\\php.ini. You will also need to edit php.ini in a text editor and enable all needed extensions for the build process. You can find these by running the make commands and looking for any extensions that error out as missing. You can enable them by searching php.ini for the extension that will look like:  and removing the semicolon.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In order to build the development docker image, in the root of this repository, run a primer with</p><p>this will start the development server on port 8090.</p><p>The dev environment provides a MySQL server, mail server, s3 server, and should be good to go for your needs out of the box. The configuration of the development environment is found in , and is already seeded with the appropriate values. <strong>You should probably not be modifying this unless you plan to work on a feature for a specific integration</strong>. the applications you get are as follows</p><p>Additionally, Xdebug is enabled, but you will have to modify your IDE key in the  file(or alternatively, on your IDE). You also need to have port 9003 temporarily open on your firewall so you can utilize it effectively. This is because connections from docker to the host will count as external inbound connections </p><p>Static Analysis  Code Style  (to fix code style automatically use ) Unit Tests  Acceptance Tests  (requires docker)</p><p>You can test individual acceptance test groups directly using: For api: <code>docker compose --file .dev/docker-compose.yaml --file .dev/docker-compose.tests.yaml exec leantime-dev php vendor/bin/codecept run -g api --steps</code> For timesheets: <code>docker compose --file .dev/docker-compose.yaml --file .dev/docker-compose.tests.yaml exec leantime-dev php vendor/bin/codecept run -g timesheet --steps</code></p><ul><li>Make sure to take a backup of your database and files</li><li>Replace all files in your directory with the updated version</li><li>If there were any database changes, the system will redirect you to </li></ul><ul><li>Run <code>php bin/leantime system:update</code></li></ul><ul><li>Before updating, make sure your mysql container was started using a mounted volume, otherwise your content will be deleted</li><li>Delete/Stop existing container</li><li>Pull the latest docker image and rebuild using your compose file</li></ul><p>Please refer to our <a href=\"https://docs.leantime.io/installation/common-issues\">documentation</a> about common issues found when installing or updating Leantime</p><h4>You can extend Leantime by:</h4><h2>🛟 Let us install it for you.</h2><p>Hassle free installation service in your environments.

Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.</p></blockquote><p>An MCP Server is a lightweight program that exposes specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol. Host applications (such as chatbots, IDEs, and other AI tools) have MCP clients that maintain 1:1 connections with MCP servers. Common MCP clients include agentic AI coding assistants (like Q Developer, Cline, Cursor, Windsurf) as well as chatbot applications like Claude Desktop, with more clients coming soon. MCP servers can access local data sources and remote services to provide additional context that improves the generated outputs from the models.</p><p>AWS MCP Servers use this protocol to provide AI applications access to AWS documentation, contextual guidance, and best practices. Through the standardized MCP client-server architecture, AWS capabilities become an intelligent extension of your development environment or AI application.</p><p>AWS MCP servers enable enhanced cloud-native development, infrastructure management, and development workflows—making AI-assisted cloud computing more accessible and efficient.</p><p>The Model Context Protocol is an open source project run by Anthropic, PBC. and open to contributions from the entire community. For more information on MCP, you can find further documentation <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\">here</a></p><h2>Server Sent Events Support Removal</h2><p> On May 26th, 2025, Server Sent Events (SSE) support was removed from all MCP servers in their latest major versions. This change aligns with the Model Context Protocol specification's <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#backwards-compatibility\">backwards compatibility guidelines</a>.</p><p>We are actively working towards supporting <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#streamable-http\">Streamable HTTP</a>, which will provide improved transport capabilities for future versions.</p><p>For applications still requiring SSE support, please use the previous major version of the respective MCP server until you can migrate to alternative transport methods.</p><p>MCP servers enhance the capabilities of foundation models (FMs) in several key ways:</p><ul><li><p>: By providing relevant information directly in the model's context, MCP servers significantly improve model responses for specialized domains like AWS services. This approach reduces hallucinations, provides more accurate technical details, enables more precise code generation, and ensures recommendations align with current AWS best practices and service capabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Access to Latest Documentation</strong>: FMs may not have knowledge of recent releases, APIs, or SDKs. MCP servers bridge this gap by pulling in up-to-date documentation, ensuring your AI assistant always works with the latest AWS capabilities.</p></li><li><p>: MCP servers convert common workflows into tools that foundation models can use directly. Whether it's CDK, Terraform, or other AWS-specific workflows, these tools enable AI assistants to perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Specialized Domain Knowledge</strong>: MCP servers provide deep, contextual knowledge about AWS services that might not be fully represented in foundation models' training data, enabling more accurate and helpful responses for cloud development tasks.</p></li></ul><h2>Available MCP Servers: Quick Installation</h2><p>Get started quickly with one-click installation buttons for popular MCP clients. Click the buttons below to install servers directly in Cursor or VS Code:</p><h3>🚀 Getting Started with AWS</h3><p>For general AWS interactions and comprehensive API support, we recommend starting with:</p><h3>Browse by What You're Building</h3><h4>📚 Real-time access to official AWS documentation</h4><h3>🏗️ Infrastructure &amp; Deployment</h3><p>Build, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code best practices.</p><p>Enhance AI applications with knowledge retrieval, content generation, and ML capabilities</p><p>Work with databases, caching systems, and data processing workflows.</p><h3>🛠️ Developer Tools &amp; Support</h3><p>Accelerate development with code analysis, documentation, and testing utilities.</p><h3>📡 Integration &amp; Messaging</h3><p>Connect systems with messaging, workflows, and location services.</p><p>Monitor, optimize, and manage your AWS infrastructure and costs.</p><h3>🧬 Healthcare &amp; Lifesciences</h3><p>Interact with AWS HealthAI services.</p><h3>Browse by How You're Working</h3><h4>👨‍💻 Vibe Coding &amp; Development</h4><p><em>AI coding assistants like Amazon Q Developer CLI, Cline, Cursor, and Claude Code helping you build faster</em></p><h5>Core Development Workflow</h5><h5>Container &amp; Serverless Development</h5><h5>Lifesciences Workflow Development</h5><h4>💬 Conversational Assistants</h4><p><em>Customer-facing chatbots, business agents, and interactive Q&amp;A systems</em></p><h5>Content Processing &amp; Generation</h5><h4>🤖 Autonomous Background Agents</h4><p><em>Headless automation, ETL pipelines, and operational systems</em></p><h2>MCP AWS Lambda Handler Module</h2><p>A Python library for creating serverless HTTP handlers for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using AWS Lambda.

Here's when to use each approach:</p><ul><li>: Perfect for local development, testing, and debugging</li><li>: Continue working when internet connectivity is limited</li><li>: Keep sensitive data and credentials on your local machine</li><li>: Minimal network overhead for faster response times</li><li>: Direct control over server resources and configuration</li></ul><ul><li>: Share consistent server configurations across your team</li><li>: Offload heavy processing to dedicated cloud resources</li><li>: Access your MCP servers from anywhere, any device</li><li>: Get the latest features and security patches automatically</li><li>: Easily handle varying workloads without local resource constraints</li></ul><blockquote><p>: Some MCP servers, like AWS Knowledge MCP, are provided as fully managed services by AWS. These AWS-managed remote servers require no setup or infrastructure management on your part - just connect and start using them.</p></blockquote><h2>Use Cases for the Servers</h2><p>For example, you can use the <strong>AWS Documentation MCP Server</strong> to help your AI assistant research and generate up-to-date code for any AWS service, like Amazon Bedrock Inline agents. Alternatively, you could use the  or the  to have your AI assistant create infrastructure-as-code implementations that use the latest APIs and follow AWS best practices. With the , you could ask \"What would be the estimated monthly cost for this CDK project before I deploy it?\" or \"Can you help me understand the potential AWS service expenses for this infrastructure design?\" and receive detailed cost estimations and budget planning insights. The  enables natural language interaction with Valkey data stores, allowing AI assistants to efficiently manage data operations through a simple conversational interface.</p><p>Each server has specific installation instructions with one-click installs for Cursor and VSCode. Generally, you can:</p><ol><li>Install Python using </li><li>Configure AWS credentials with access to required services</li><li>Add the server to your MCP client configuration</li></ol><p>Example configuration for Amazon Q CLI MCP ():</p><pre><code>{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"awslabs.core-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL\": \"ERROR\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>See individual server READMEs for specific requirements and configuration options.</p><p>When configuring MCP servers on Windows, you'll need to use a slightly different configuration format:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"awslabs.core-mcp-server\": {\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"timeout\": 60,\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"tool\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"--from\",\n        \"awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest\",\n        \"awslabs.core-mcp-server.exe\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL\": \"ERROR\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>If you have problems with MCP configuration or want to check if the appropriate parameters are in place, you can try the following:</p><pre><code># Run MCP server manually with timeout 15s\n$ timeout 15s uv tool run &lt;MCP Name&gt; &lt;args&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 || echo \"Command completed or timed out\"\n\n# Example (Aurora MySQL MCP Server)\n$ timeout 15s uv tool run awslabs.mysql-mcp-server --resource_arn &lt;Your Resource ARN&gt; --secret_arn &lt;Your Secret ARN&gt; ... 2&gt;&amp;1 || echo \"Command completed or timed out\"\n\n# If the arguments are not set appropriately, you may see the following message:\nusage: awslabs.mysql-mcp-server [-h] --resource_arn RESOURCE_ARN --secret_arn SECRET_ARN --database DATABASE\n                                --region REGION --readonly READONLY\nawslabs.mysql-mcp-server: error: the following arguments are required: --resource_arn, --secret_arn, --database, --region, --readonly\n</code></pre><p><strong>Note about performance when using  suffix:</strong></p><p>Using the  suffix checks and downloads the latest MCP server package from pypi every time you start your MCP clients, but it comes with a cost of increased initial load times. If you want to minimize the initial load time, remove  and manage your uv cache yourself using one of these approaches:</p><ul><li>: where {tool} is the mcp server you want to delete from cache and install again (e.g.: \"awslabs.lambda-tool-mcp-server\") (remember to remove the '&lt;&gt;').</li><li>: this will refresh the tool with the latest version and add it to the uv cache.</li></ul><h3>Running MCP servers in containers</h3><p><em>This example uses docker with the \"awslabs.nova-canvas-mcp-server and can be repeated for each MCP server</em></p><ul><li><p>Optionally save sensitive environmental variables in a file:</p><pre><code># contents of a .env file with fictitious AWS temporary credentials\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\nAWS_SESSION_TOKEN=AQoEXAMPLEH4aoAH0gNCAPy...truncated...zrkuWJOgQs8IZZaIv2BXIa2R4Olgk\n</code></pre></li><li><p>Use the docker options: , , and  as needed because the  are not available within the container.</p><pre><code>{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"awslabs.nova-canvas-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"--interactive\",\n        \"--env\",\n        \"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR\",\n        \"--env\",\n        \"AWS_REGION=us-east-1\",\n        \"--env-file\",\n        \"/full/path/to/.env\",\n        \"--volume\",\n        \"/full/path/to/.aws:/app/.aws\",\n        \"public.ecr.aws/awslabs-mcp/awslabs/nova-canvas-mcp-server:latest\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></li><li><p>For testing local changes you can build and tag the image.

This shift represents a fundamental change in how we approach cybersecurity challenges. <em>AI is not just another tool - it's becoming essential for addressing complex security vulnerabilities and staying ahead of sophisticated threats. As organizations face more advanced cyber attacks, AI-enhanced security testing will be crucial for maintaining robust defenses.</em></p><p>This work builds upon prior efforts[^4] and similarly, we believe that democratizing access to advanced cybersecurity AI tools is vital for the entire security community. That's why we're releasing Cybersecurity AI () as an open source framework. Our goal is to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools. By making these capabilities openly available, we aim to level the playing field and ensure that cutting-edge security AI technology isn't limited to well-funded private companies or state actors.</p><p>Bug Bounty programs have become a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, providing a crucial mechanism for organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities in their systems before they can be exploited. These programs have proven highly effective at securing both public and private infrastructure, with researchers discovering critical vulnerabilities that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. CAI is specifically designed to enhance these efforts by providing a lightweight, ergonomic framework for building specialized AI agents that can assist in various aspects of Bug Bounty hunting - from initial reconnaissance to vulnerability validation and reporting. Our framework aims to augment human expertise with AI capabilities, helping researchers work more efficiently and thoroughly in their quest to make digital systems more secure.</p><h3>Ethical principles behind CAI</h3><p>You might be wondering if releasing CAI  given its capabilities and security implications is ethical. Our decision to open-source this framework is guided by two core ethical principles:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Democratizing Cybersecurity AI</strong>: We believe that advanced cybersecurity AI tools should be accessible to the entire security community, not just well-funded private companies or state actors. By releasing CAI as an open source framework, we aim to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools, leveling the playing field in cybersecurity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transparency in AI Security Capabilities</strong>: Based on our research results, understanding of the technology, and dissection of top technical reports, we argue that current LLM vendors are undermining their cybersecurity capabilities. This is extremely dangerous and misleading. By developing CAI openly, we provide a transparent benchmark of what AI systems can actually do in cybersecurity contexts, enabling more informed decisions about security postures.</p></li></ol><p>CAI is built on the following core principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Cybersecurity oriented AI framework</strong>: CAI is specifically designed for cybersecurity use cases, aiming at semi- and fully-automating offensive and defensive security tasks.</li><li><strong>Open source, free for research</strong>: CAI is open source and free for research purposes. We aim at democratizing access to AI and Cybersecurity. For professional or commercial use, including on-premise deployments, dedicated technical support and custom extensions <a href=\"mailto:research@aliasrobotics.com\">reach out</a> to obtain a license.</li><li>: CAI is designed to be fast, and easy to use.</li><li><strong>Modular and agent-centric design</strong>: CAI operates on the basis of agents and agentic patterns, which allows flexibility and scalability. You can easily add the most suitable agents and pattern for your cybersecuritytarget case.</li><li>: CAI integrates already built-in tools, and allows the user to integrate their own tools with their own logic easily.</li><li><strong>Logging and tracing integrated</strong>: using <a href=\"https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix\"></a>, the open source tracing and logging tool for LLMs. This provides the user with a detailed traceability of the agents and their execution.</li><li>: more than 300 supported and empowered by <a href=\"https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm\">LiteLLM</a>.

This approach not only squanders valuable engineering resources but also represents an economic waste and results in redundant efforts, as they often end up reinventing the wheel. Here are some of the closed-source initiatives we keep track of and attempting to leverage genAI and agentic frameworks in cybersecurity AI:</p><pre><code>pip install cai-framework\n</code></pre><p>Always create a new virtual environment to ensure proper dependency installation when updating CAI.</p><p>The following subsections provide a more detailed walkthrough on selected popular Operating Systems.

An Agent in <em>an intelligent system that interacts with some environment</em>. More technically, within CAI we embrace a robotics-centric definition wherein an agent is anything that can be viewed as a system perceiving its environment through sensors, reasoning about its goals and and acting accordingly upon that environment through actuators ( from Russel &amp; Norvig, AI: A Modern Approach). In cybersecurity, an  interacts with systems and networks, using peripherals and network interfaces as sensors, reasons accordingly and then executes network actions as if actuators.

This is implemented across <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliasrobotics/cai/main/cai/core.py\">core.py</a> and also in the REPL abstractions <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliasrobotics/cai/main/cai/repl\">REPL</a>.</p><p>To start CAI after installing it, just type  in the CLI:</p><pre><code>└─# cai\n\n          CCCCCCCCCCCCC      ++++++++   ++++++++      IIIIIIIIII\n       CCC::::::::::::C  ++++++++++       ++++++++++  I::::::::I\n     CC:::::::::::::::C ++++++++++         ++++++++++ I::::::::I\n    C:::::CCCCCCCC::::C +++++++++    ++     +++++++++ II::::::II\n   C:::::C       CCCCCC +++++++     +++++     +++++++   I::::I\n  C:::::C                +++++     +++++++     +++++    I::::I\n  C:::::C                ++++                   ++++    I::::I\n  C:::::C                 ++                     ++     I::::I\n  C:::::C                  +   +++++++++++++++   +      I::::I\n  C:::::C                    +++++++++++++++++++        I::::I\n  C:::::C                     +++++++++++++++++         I::::I\n   C:::::C       CCCCCC        +++++++++++++++          I::::I\n    C:::::CCCCCCCC::::C         +++++++++++++         II::::::II\n     CC:::::::::::::::C           +++++++++           I::::::::I\n       CCC::::::::::::C             +++++             I::::::::I\n          CCCCCCCCCCCCC               ++              IIIIIIIIII\n\n                      Cybersecurity AI (CAI), vX.Y.Z\n                          Bug bounty-ready AI\n\nCAI&gt;\n</code></pre><p>That should initialize CAI and provide a prompt to execute any security task you want to perform. The navigation bar at the bottom displays important system information. This information helps you understand your environment while working with CAI.</p><p>Here's a quick <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/zm7wS5DA2o0S9pu1Tb44pnlvy\">demo video</a> to help you get started with CAI. We'll walk through the basic steps — from launching the tool to running your first AI-powered task in the terminal. Whether you're a beginner or just curious, this guide will show you how easy it is to begin using CAI.</p><p>From here on, type on  and start your security exercise. Best way to learn is by example:</p><p>For using private models, you are given a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliasrobotics/cai/main/.env.example\"></a> file. Copy it and rename it as . Fill in your corresponding API keys, and you are ready to use CAI.</p><p>The Cybersecurity AI (CAI) platform offers seamless integration with OpenRouter, a unified interface for Large Language Models (LLMs). This integration is crucial for users who wish to leverage advanced AI capabilities in their cybersecurity tasks. OpenRouter acts as a bridge, allowing CAI to communicate with various LLMs, thereby enhancing the flexibility and power of the AI agents used within CAI.</p><p>To enable OpenRouter support in CAI, you need to configure your environment by adding specific entries to your  file. This setup ensures that CAI can interact with the OpenRouter API, facilitating the use of sophisticated models like Meta-LLaMA. Here’s how you can configure it:</p><pre><code>CAI_AGENT_TYPE=redteam_agent\nCAI_MODEL=openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick\nOPENROUTER_API_KEY=&lt;sk-your-key&gt;  # note, add yours\nOPENROUTER_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1\n</code></pre><p>CAI supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for integrating external tools and services with AI agents. MCP is supported via two transport mechanisms:</p><ol><li> - For web-based servers that push updates over HTTP connections:</li></ol><pre><code>CAI&gt;/mcp load http://localhost:9876/sse burp\n</code></pre><ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>STDIO (Standard Input/Output)</strong> - For local inter-process communication:</li></ol><pre><code>CAI&gt;/mcp load stdio myserver python mcp_server.py\n</code></pre><p>Once connected, you can add the MCP tools to any agent:</p><pre><code>CAI&gt;/mcp add burp redteam_agent\nAdding tools from MCP server 'burp' to agent 'Red Team Agent'...\n                                 Adding tools to Red Team Agent\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n┃ Tool                              ┃ Status ┃ Details                                         ┃\n┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩\n│ send_http_request                 │ Added  │ Available as: send_http_request                 │\n│ create_repeater_tab               │ Added  │ Available as: create_repeater_tab               │\n│ send_to_intruder                  │ Added  │ Available as: send_to_intruder                  │\n│ url_encode                        │ Added  │ Available as: url_encode                        │\n│ url_decode                        │ Added  │ Available as: url_decode                        │\n│ base64encode                      │ Added  │ Available as: base64encode                      │\n│ base64decode                      │ Added  │ Available as: base64decode                      │\n│ generate_random_string            │ Added  │ Available as: generate_random_string            │\n│ output_project_options            │ Added  │ Available as: output_project_options            │\n│ output_user_options               │ Added  │ Available as: output_user_options               │\n│ set_project_options               │ Added  │ Available as: set_project_options               │\n│ set_user_options                  │ Added  │ Available as: set_user_options                  │\n│ get_proxy_http_history            │ Added  │ Available as: get_proxy_http_history            │\n│ get_proxy_http_history_regex      │ Added  │ Available as: get_proxy_http_history_regex      │\n│ get_proxy_websocket_history       │ Added  │ Available as: get_proxy_websocket_history       │\n│ get_proxy_websocket_history_regex │ Added  │ Available as: get_proxy_websocket_history_regex │\n│ set_task_execution_engine_state   │ Added  │ Available as: set_task_execution_engine_state   │\n│ set_proxy_intercept_state         │ Added  │ Available as: set_proxy_intercept_state         │\n│ get_active_editor_contents        │ Added  │ Available as: get_active_editor_contents        │\n│ set_active_editor_contents        │ Added  │ Available as: set_active_editor_contents        │\n└───────────────────────────────────┴────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nAdded 20 tools from server 'burp' to agent 'Red Team Agent'.\nCAI&gt;/agent 13\nCAI&gt;Create a repeater tab\n</code></pre><p>You can list all active MCP connections and their transport types:</p><p>Development is facilitated via VS Code dev. environments.

No make, no cmake, no shell, no cmd, no PowerShell etc. Only C compiler. So with the C compiler you bootstrap your build system and then you use the build system to build everything else.</p><h2>This is an Experimental Project</h2><p>I'm not sure if this is even a good idea myself. This is why I'm implementing it. This is a research project. I'm not making any claims about suitability of this approach to any project.</p><h2>It's likely Not Suitable for Your Project</h2><p>If you are using <a href=\"https://cmake.org/\">cmake</a> with tons of modules to manage and find tons of dependencies you probably don't want to use this tool.

Which may enable some interesting code reusage strategies. The build system can use the code of the project itself directly and the project can use the code of the build system also directly.</li></ul><ul><li>You need to be comfortable with C and implementing things yourself. As mentioned above this is like writing shell scripts but in C.</li><li>It probably does not make any sense outside of C/C++ projects.</li></ul><h2>Why is it called \"nobuild\" when it's clearly a build tool?</h2><p>You know all these BS movements that supposedly remove the root cause of your problems? Things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL\">NoSQL</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-code_development_platform\">No-code</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing\">Serverless</a>, etc. This is the same logic. I had too many problems with the process of building C projects.
