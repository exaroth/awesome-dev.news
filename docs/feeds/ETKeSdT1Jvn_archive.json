It is a symptom of how complex workflow orchestration has gotten. Is it a dominant trend or will we cycle back to ‚ÄúDAG specifications‚Äù? At Stitchfix, we had our own DSL that ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù into airflow DAGs and at MicroByre, we used a external workflow langauge. Both had a batch task executor on K8s but at MicroByre, we had human and robot in the loop workflows.// BioDr. Milowski is a serial entrepreneur and computer scientist with experience in a variety of data and machine learning technologies. He holds a PhD in Informatics (Computer Science) from the University of Edinburgh, where he researched large-scale computation over scientific data. Over the years, he's spent many years working on various aspects of workflow orchestration in industry, standardization, and in research.// MLOps Swag/Merch<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>// Related Links<a href=\"website: https://www.milowski.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">Website: https://www.milowski.com/</a> --------------- ‚úåÔ∏èConnect With Us ‚úåÔ∏è -------------Join our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>Follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/@mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">@mlopscommunity</a>Sign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://mlops.community/</a>Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>Connect with Alex on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmilowski/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmilowski/</a></p>","contentLength":1617,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98492189/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-14%2F394870366-44100-2-f81b1b5d49c1e.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Risky Biz Soap Box: Run your own open source IDP with Authentik","url":"https://risky.biz/soapbox93/","date":1739492664,"author":"","guid":432,"unread":true,"content":"<article></article>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media3.risky.biz/soapbox93.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_izoDLdUW0","date":1739466054,"author":"Jack Rhysider","guid":317,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications\n\n#podcast #airport #privacy \n\nListen to the full episode üéô Darknet Diaries Ep: Jammer!

We also get into some gnarly challenges around memory, tool integration, and evaluation frameworks, and some lessons learned from deploying to engineering teams.// BioWillem Pienaar, CTO of Cleric, is a builder with a focus on LLM agents, MLOps, and open source tooling. He is the creator of Feast, an open source feature store, and contributed to the creation of both the feature store and MLOps categories.Before starting Cleric, Willem led the open-source engineering team at Tecton and established the ML platform team at Gojek, where he built high-scale ML systems for the Southeast Asian Decacorn.// MLOps Swag/Merch<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>// Related Links<a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Insights-from-Cleric-Building-an-Autonomous-AI-SRE--Willem-Pienaar--290-e2unikg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">Website: willem.co</a> --------------- ‚úåÔ∏èConnect With Us ‚úåÔ∏è -------------Join our slack community:<a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>Follow us on Twitter:<a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/@mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">@mlopscommunity</a>Sign up for the next meetup:<a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more:<a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn:<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>Connect with Willem on LinkedIn:<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/willempienaar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/willempienaar/</a></p>","contentLength":1703,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98338896/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-11%2F394679162-44100-2-e1c6c10bbd504.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LangChain and Agentic AI Engineering with Erick Friis","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/11/langchain-and-agentic-ai-engineering-with-erick-friis/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=langchain-and-agentic-ai-engineering-with-erick-friis","date":1739268011,"author":"SEDaily","guid":370,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p><a href=\"https://www.langchain.com/\">LangChain</a> is a popular open-source framework to build applications that integrate LLMs with external data sources like APIs, databases, or custom knowledge bases.
