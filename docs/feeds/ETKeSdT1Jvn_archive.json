It used to be that the first step of data science was to get familiar with your data. However, as modern LLM datasets have gotten larger, dataset exploration tools have not kept up. Kenny makes the case that user interfaces have been under-appreciated in the Python-centric world of AI, and new tools are needed to enable advances in machine learning. Our conversation also dives into new methods of using LLM models themselves to assist data engineers in actually looking at their data.</p><p>Kenny has been working in AI for over 20 years. First in academia as a ML Ph.D. student at USC (before it was cool). Kenny then co-founded Algorithmia to solve the problem of hosting and distribution of ML models running on GPUs (also before it was cool). Algortihmia was an early pioneer of the MLOps space and was acquired by DataRobot in 2021. Kenny is currently founder and CEO of Hyperparam, building new tools to make AI dataset curation orders of magnitude more efficient.</p><p> ~~~~~~~~ ‚úåÔ∏èConnect With Us ‚úåÔ∏è ~~~~~~~</p>","contentLength":1415,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98686316/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-19%2F395182406-44100-2-112a6f4e517d4.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Docusign for Developers with Dan Selman and Larry Jin","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/18/the-docusign-developer-api-with-dan-selman-and-larry-jin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-docusign-developer-api-with-dan-selman-and-larry-jin","date":1739872828,"author":"SEDaily","guid":4055,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Agreements and contracts are a fundamental innovation and govern everything from personal commitments to major financial decisions.
