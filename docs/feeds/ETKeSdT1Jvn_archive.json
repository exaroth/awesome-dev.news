Firms are increasing efforts to mitigate risks associated with LLMs regarding sensitive data exfiltration of personally identifiable information and sensitive company data. The primary mitigation strategy is to build guardrails around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to safeguard data while also optimizing query response quality and efficiency. \n\nTo enable precise guardrails, one must implement permissions systems with advanced fine grained authorization capabilities such as returning lists of authorized subjects and accessible resources. Such systems ensure that LLMs can access only authorized data while preventing exfiltration of sensitive information, making RAGs more efficient and improving performance at scale. \n\nThis session will cover how modern permissions systems can safeguard sensitive data in RAG pipelines. We'll start with why Authorization is critical for RAG pipelines to protect sensitive data from potential vulnerabilities and also the various techniques for permissions-aware data retrieval. The talk will also include a practical demo implementing fine-grained authorization for RAG using Pinecone, Langchain, OpenAI, and SpiceDB - an Open Source authorization database.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1539,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/aeace8MDlhk?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SRE'ing the SRE AI Agents - DevConf.CZ 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz_0TDzJD_U","date":1750926018,"author":"DevConf","guid":171980,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Boran SEREF\n\nSo, you‚Äôve got a new colleague: an AI agent.

While there is work underway in the upstream community to reduce its scope, today this mutex is a major source of scalability problems in the kernel networking subsystem. It mostly affects control path operations (such as bringing network interfaces up and down), but unless care is taken to avoid it, RTNL lock issues can also spill over into the data path, causing intermittent stalls in networking applications that can be\nhard to debug.\n\nIn this talk I will dive into techniques for debugging applications stalls caused by contention on the RTNL lock, using an example application that is derived from a real-world case.

However, this approach posed challenges for edge and IoT environments, where devices often operate with constrained resources and behind firewalls.\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll dive into the transition from a pull-based model to a push-based (agent-driven) attestation model, where the agent on the monitored system actively pushes integrity measurements to the verifier. We‚Äôll explore the architectural changes, the technical challenges we tackled, and how this shift makes remote attestation more practical for edge, cloud, and IoT deployments.\n\nAdditionally, we‚Äôll highlight how this work was made possible through open-source collaboration, showcasing not only the technical advancements in Keylime but also the power of open-source development in solving real-world security challenges.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1106,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/qZPgfzNaDXI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Passwordless Auth: a JSON-Based Approach for modern authentication w/ SSSD & GNOME - DevConf.CZ 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWK95DCurcw","date":1750925839,"author":"DevConf","guid":171974,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Iker Pedrosa\n\nThis presentation explores a novel approach to passwordless authentication in Gnome, leveraging the power of [SSSD](https://sssd.io/) and a newly developed extension to the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) conversation. We introduce a JSON-based messaging system that significantly enriches the communication between PAM modules and client applications, enabling sophisticated authentication flows. This enhanced communication facilitates contextual information sharing, adaptive authentication, and seamless multi-factor authentication, all within the familiar GNOME desktop environment.\nThe talk delves into the technical details of this JSON-based interface between SSSD and [GDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager), providing insights into its [design](https://github.com/SSSD/sssd.io/pull/79) and implementation. Furthermore, a simple PAM rust application will be presented as a practical example, serving as a reference for developers seeking to integrate this protocol into their own PAM applications. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for enhanced authentication flows, including:\n\n* **Contextual information**: sharing user-specific data or authentication challenges.\n* **Adaptive authentication**: dynamically adjusting authentication steps.\n* **Multi-Factor authentication**: orchestrating complex authentication sequences.\n\nThe presentation will conclude with live demonstrations showcasing the capabilities of this extended PAM conversation and its potential for innovation in authentication systems.\nWe will also share the current development status and preliminary GUI designs, subject to ongoing development progress.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1806,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/qWK95DCurcw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Generative AI Model Data Pre-Training on Kubernetes: A Use Case Study - DevConf.CZ 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyu_yggCNmk","date":1750925839,"author":"DevConf","guid":171975,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Anish Asthana\n\nLarge Language Models (LLM) require preprocessing vast amounts of data, a process that can span days due to its complexity and scale, often involving PetaBytes of data.

How do I know if the pre-training datasets are unbiased or if the tuning and inference methods ensure fairness? Can I trust the results from these models?\n\nThe key to navigating this emerging path is adopting the flexibility, transparency, and collaboration of open source that many of us are familiar with. What does this mean in practice? How can we equip ourselves and our communities with the right tools and knowledge to dispel doubts and address uncertainties?
