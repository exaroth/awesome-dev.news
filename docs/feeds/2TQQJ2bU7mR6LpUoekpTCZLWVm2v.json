Entre estas herramientas,  destacan por su versatilidad y eficiencia. Aunque ambos servicios comparten el principio de la ejecución sin servidores, tienen objetivos y funcionalidades distintas. En este artículo, exploraremos las diferencias clave, sus ventajas y limitaciones, y cuándo elegir cada uno.</p><p>AWS Glue es un servicio administrado de integración de datos que facilita la preparación, transformación y carga de datos (ETL). Su función principal es conectar diversas fuentes de datos, organizarlas y prepararlas para su posterior análisis. AWS Glue es especialmente útil en escenarios donde se manejan grandes volúmenes de información y se necesita automatizar procesos repetitivos.</p><p><strong>Principales componentes de AWS Glue</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li> Repositorio centralizado que almacena los metadatos y define la estructura de las fuentes de datos.</li><li> Programas que examinan las fuentes de datos, detectan su estructura y actualizan automáticamente el catálogo.</li><li> Procesos que ejecutan las transformaciones de datos, programados en Python o Scala.</li><li> Reglas que activan la ejecución de trabajos según un cronograma o la ocurrencia de ciertos eventos.</li><li> Entornos interactivos para escribir y probar el código ETL.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Automatización del Proceso ETL:</strong> Reduce significativamente el tiempo necesario para preparar datos gracias a la detección automática de esquemas.</li><li> Se conecta de manera sencilla con otros servicios de AWS, como Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift y AWS Athena.</li><li> Ajusta la capacidad de procesamiento según el volumen de datos.</li><li> Elimina la necesidad de gestionar infraestructura.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li> Al trabajar con un entorno distribuido basado en Apache Spark, el inicio de los trabajos puede tardar algunos minutos.</li><li><strong>Soporte de Lenguajes Limitado:</strong> Solo admite Python y Scala, lo que puede ser un inconveniente si se utilizan otros lenguajes en el ecosistema.</li><li> Para trabajos esporádicos o de poca carga, el costo puede resultar elevado en comparación con otras alternativas.</li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Ejemplo Diagrama de Arquitectura - Pipeline Glue</strong></p><p>AWS Lambda es un servicio serverless que permite ejecutar código en respuesta a eventos específicos sin la necesidad de aprovisionar ni gestionar servidores. Su uso es ideal para aplicaciones que requieren respuestas rápidas a eventos en tiempo real, como la carga de archivos en S3 o el procesamiento de mensajes de una cola.</p><p><strong>Principales componentes de AWS Lambda</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li> Fragmentos de código que se ejecutan al activarse un evento.</li><li> Eventos que inician la ejecución de las funciones, como cambios en bases de datos, flujos de eventos o solicitudes a través de API Gateway.</li><li> Elementos reutilizables que permiten compartir bibliotecas y configuraciones entre funciones.</li><li> Recibe y procesa eventos desde diversas fuentes, facilitando la construcción de arquitecturas basadas en eventos.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ejecución Basada en Eventos:</strong> Se activa automáticamente al detectarse un evento relevante, eliminando la necesidad de supervisión constante.<strong>Soporte para Múltiples Lenguajes:</strong> Compatible con Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby y otros. Escala horizontalmente para manejar picos de demanda sin intervención manual. Se paga únicamente por el tiempo de ejecución y el número de invocaciones.</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Tiempo Máximo de Ejecución:</strong> Las funciones no pueden superar los 15 minutos de ejecución, lo que limita su aplicación en procesos extensos.</li><li> La memoria y el tiempo de procesamiento tienen límites que podrían afectar cargas intensivas.</li><li> Al tratarse de un servicio sin estado, se necesita recurrir a otras herramientas, como DynamoDB, para almacenar información entre invocaciones.</li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Ejemplo Diagrama de Arquitectura - Pipeline Lambda</strong></p><p><strong>Comparativa entre AWS Glue y AWS Lambda</strong></p><p>Aunque ambos servicios pertenecen al ecosistema serverless de AWS, tienen aplicaciones distintas. La siguiente tabla resume las diferencias más relevantes:</p><p>AWS Glue es la mejor opción cuando se necesita:</p><ul><li>Realizar transformaciones complejas y procesamiento por lotes.</li><li>Gestionar y organizar metadatos para análisis posteriores.</li><li>Automatizar tareas de integración de datos en proyectos de Big Data.</li><li>Trabajar con datos almacenados en Amazon S3, Redshift o Data Lakes.</li></ul><p>\nUna empresa que procesa información de ventas históricas para generar reportes mensuales podría usar AWS Glue para consolidar, limpiar y transformar estos datos de manera eficiente.</p><p>AWS Lambda es más adecuado cuando:</p><ul><li>Se requieren respuestas inmediatas a eventos en tiempo real.</li><li>Se necesita construir microservicios ligeros y altamente escalables.</li><li>Se desea automatizar tareas basadas en eventos sin preocuparse por la infraestructura.</li><li>Se implementan flujos de trabajo orquestados con Step Functions.</li></ul><p>\nUna aplicación que notifica en tiempo real a los clientes cada vez que se realiza una compra puede usar Lambda para procesar los eventos generados por las transacciones.</p><p>AWS Glue y AWS Lambda son herramientas poderosas en el ecosistema de AWS, pero están orientadas a tareas diferentes. Mientras AWS Glue se destaca en el procesamiento y preparación de datos a gran escala, AWS Lambda es ideal para ejecutar tareas rápidas en respuesta a eventos. La elección entre uno u otro dependerá de los requisitos específicos de tu proyecto, el volumen de datos y la frecuencia de las operaciones. Si tu objetivo es transformar y organizar datos en procesos ETL, AWS Glue es la opción indicada. Por otro lado, si buscas una ejecución inmediata basada en eventos, AWS Lambda será tu mejor elección.</p>","contentLength":5629,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Learning for Everyone! 🚀","url":"https://dev.to/hrudu/ai-learning-for-everyone-2mgc","date":1739711504,"author":"Hrudu Shibu","guid":616,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Learn Generative AI with Microsoft Copilot – Free AI Course\nAI is revolutionizing the world, and now you can learn generative AI for free with Microsoft Copilot through the Explore AI Learn Plan! 🚀</p><p>What Will You Learn?\nIn this short 53-minute learning path, you will:<p>\n✅ Understand the basics of generative AI.</p>\n✅ Use Microsoft Copilot to research and create AI-generated content.<p>\n✅ Design your own dream destination using AI-powered tools.</p></p><p>Who Should Join?\n💡 Students who want to explore AI applications.<p>\n💡 Tech enthusiasts looking to boost their AI skills.</p>\n💡 Educators who want to introduce AI to their students.</p><p>No prior experience required—just a passion for learning! 🌟</p>","contentLength":694,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Week 12 Recap of #100DaysOfCode","url":"https://dev.to/lymah/week-12-recap-of-100daysofcode-21h7","date":1739710478,"author":"Lymah","guid":623,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Firebase Integration, API Enhancements &amp; DSA Learning\n</h2><p>This week, I focused on enhancing my Expense Tracker App by integrating Firebase for receipt storage and authentication, improving API functionality, and diving deeper into data structures and algorithms (DSA).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Developments in the Expense Tracker App\n</h2><p>🔹 Integrated Firebase for Receipt Storage\nI implemented a workflow where users can upload receipts from the frontend, which are then processed by the backend and stored securely in Firebase Storage.</p><p>🔹 Enhanced API &amp; Report Generation</p><ul><li>Improved API handlers to ensure efficient communication between the frontend and backend.</li><li>Worked on report generation to help users analyze their expenses better.</li><li><p>Faced a form handling issue while testing report generation but successfully troubleshot and fixed it.\n🔹 Implemented Firebase Authentication</p></li><li><p>Set up Firebase Authentication for user registration and login.</p></li><li><p>Developed authentication middleware to manage secure access.</p></li><li><p>Organized and refined API routes for better structure and efficiency.</p></li></ul><p>## Learning &amp; Problem-Solving</p><p>Aside from working on the app, I spent time improving my DSA skills and solving LeetCode problems:</p><ul><li>Insert Delete Get Random – Practiced hashmaps and randomized data structures.</li><li>Product of Array Except Self – Strengthened understanding of prefix sum techniques.</li></ul><p>With the major backend integrations complete, my focus will now be on:</p><ul><li>Finalizing app testing and fixing any edge cases.</li><li>Optimizing performance and deployment readiness.</li><li>Continuing DSA practice to sharpen my problem-solving skills.</li></ul><p>Week 12 was packed with important features, debugging, and learning! 🚀 Excited for the next phase of this journey!</p>","contentLength":1696,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"GIT haqida ma'lumot","url":"https://dev.to/sunnat_qayumov/git-8a","date":1739710429,"author":"Sunnat Qayumov","guid":605,"unread":true,"content":"<p> bu loyihalar saqlash uchun va dasturchilar birga loyihalar ustida jamoaviy ishlashida kerak bo'ladigan platforma(<code>bulutli texnologiya - cloud technology</code>).</p><p> - bu dasturiy ta'minot versiyalarni nazorat qiluvchi tizim('version control system`).

Docker, a renowned containerization platform, has revolutionized the way we build, deploy, and manage applications. To optimize your Docker development workflow, this comprehensive guide delves into advanced techniques, best practices, and performance optimization strategies that experienced developers may not be aware of.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Latest Advanced Techniques\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Podman: Unleashing Container Management Potential\n</h3><p>Traditional Docker commands can be replaced with the lightweight and sandboxed  utility. This alternative offers enhanced security, reduced resource consumption, and simplified container management:</p><div><pre><code># Create a container using podman\npodman create --name my-container my-image\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. BuildKit: Accelerating Image Building\n</h3><p>BuildKit accelerates image building by leveraging incremental builds, caching, and parallel execution. By integrating BuildKit into your Dockerfile, you can significantly reduce build times:</p><div><pre><code># Dockerfile using BuildKit\nFROM my-base-image as build-stage\nRUN apk add ... # Use BuildKit syntax\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Swarm Mode: Distributed Container Orchestration\n</h3><p>Swarm mode enables seamless scaling of containerized applications across multiple hosts. It provides advanced load balancing, service discovery, and automated container placement:</p><div><pre><code># Initialize a Swarm cluster\ndocker swarm init\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Multi-Stage Builds for Optimized Images\n</h3><p>Multi-stage builds allow you to create smaller and more efficient images by separating build steps into distinct stages. This minimizes the transfer of unnecessary dependencies:</p><div><pre><code># Multi-stage Dockerfile\nFROM node:lts AS build\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm install --production\n\nFROM nginx:latest\nCOPY --from=build /usr/src/app /usr/share/nginx/html\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Performance Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana\n</h3><p>Prometheus and Grafana provide comprehensive monitoring and visualization for Docker environments. They enable real-time tracking of container metrics, performance bottlenecks, and resource usage:</p><div><pre><code># Docker Compose configuration for monitoring\nversion: '3'\nservices:\nprometheus:\nimage: prom/prometheus\nvolumes:\n- ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml\ngrafana:\nimage: grafana/grafana\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Modern Development Workflow\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. CI/CD Automation with GitHub Actions\n</h3><p>GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with Docker to automate build, test, and deployment processes. This facilitates continuous integration and delivery practices:</p><div><pre><code># GitHub Actions workflow\nname: Docker Build and Deploy\non: [push]\njobs:\nbuild:\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: docker/build-push-action@v3\nwith:\npush: true\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Remote Container Debugging for Enhanced Efficiency\n</h3><p>Remote debugging allows you to troubleshoot running containers from your local IDE. This simplifies issue identification and resolution:</p><div><pre><code># Enable remote debugging in Docker Compose\nversion: '3'\nservices:\nmy-app:\nimage: my-image\ncommand: [\"/usr/local/bin/debug\", \"--host=0.0.0.0\", \"--port=5678\", \"--wait\", \"true\"]\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Docker Compose v2: Simplified Configuration and Automation\n</h3><p>Docker Compose v2 introduces a simplified syntax, improved performance, and support for multiple Dockerfiles. It streamlines container orchestration:</p><div><pre><code># Docker Compose v2 configuration\nversion: '2'\nservices:\ndb:\nimage: postgres:latest\nweb:\nimage: my-web-app\ndepends_on:\n- db\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.

Microinteractions are those subtle, engaging animations or design elements that guide users, provide feedback, and add personality to your digital product. Think of the gentle bounce of a button after it's clicked or the satisfying swipe animation when archiving an email. These can be minor moments, but they can change a good user experience into an unforgettable one.</p><p>Why Microinteractions Matter</p><p>Microinteractions are not just about aesthetics; they serve very real functional purposes. Here's why they're so important:</p><p>Provide Feedback: They tell users what happened with their action, whether it was a button click or a process that is complete.</p><p>Guide the User: Subtle animations can draw attention to important elements or actions. For example, a blinking cursor in a search bar encourages users to start typing.</p><p>Enhance Engagement: When designed well, microinteractions are pleasurable moments that make users want to come back for more.</p><p>Strengthen Branding: Custom animations unique to your brand can create a memorable identity that stands out.</p><p>Key Elements of Microinteractions</p><p>Every microinteraction is composed of four major parts:</p><p>Trigger: What starts the microinteraction? It can be an explicit user action-like clicking or swiping-or an implicit system event, such as a timer or condition being met.</p><p>Rules: These determine how the microinteraction works. For example, what happens when a button is clicked?</p><p>Feedback: The visual, auditory, or tactile response users get, such as a click sound or a color change.</p><p>Loops and Modes: These are the conditions that determine if the microinteraction repeats or evolves over time.</p><p>Practical Tips for Designing Effective Microinteractions</p><p>Here’s how to implement microinteractions that enhance user experience:</p><ol><li><p>Keep It Simple\nMicrointeractions should be subtle and straightforward. Overloading users with flashy animations can make your design look cluttered and confuse users. Stick to minimal, functional designs.</p></li><li><p>Prioritize Functionality\nEvery animation should have a purpose. Never add microinteractions just because they look good. For instance, a loading spinner tells the user that something is happening, while an animation of a toggle switch explains how it works.</p></li><li><p>Be Consistent\nConsistency in microinteractions is important to create a cohesive user experience. Align animations with your brand identity and ensure they behave predictably across different platforms and devices.</p></li><li><p>Design for Context\nConsider the user's intention and the context of the interaction. For example, an animated behavior may be perfectly fine for a gaming application, but it may look like it doesn't belong if it's part of financial software.</p></li><li><p>Employ the Right Tools\nFigma, Adobe After Effects, or Lottie are some tools that make designing and prototyping microinteractions a breeze. Experiment with these to bring your designs to life.</p></li></ol><p>Real-World Examples of Microinteractions</p><p>Facebook Reactions: Hover on the \"Like\" button and a row of emojis pops out, making it fun and interactive for users to express themselves.</p><p>LinkedIn Endorsements: The animation of skill endorsement is so subtle, yet interactive, sans overwhelming the user.</p><p>Heart Animation by Instagram: Users can get instant feedback when they double-tap a post, which results in an animated heart popping up. </p><p>Common Mistakes to Avoid  While\n micro-interactions are powerful, this is how they can become counter-productive if not implemented well:</p><p>Overcomplicating the Animations: Too-long or flashy animations irritate the users.</p><p>Disregarding Accessibility: Make sure microinteractions are accessible for all users, whether they have visual or motor impairments.</p><p>Overloading the Interface: Too many animations can make performance worse and confuse users.</p><p>The Future of Microinteractions</p><p>As technology evolves, microinteractions will also get more intelligent. With AI and machine learning, in the future, designs may automatically adapt microinteractions based on user behavior, thus creating even more personalized experiences.</p><p>While micro in nature, microinteractions make great impacts on user experiences. By paying attention to minute details, you will also be able to create not just functional but delightful interfaces. So, go live with microinteractions in all your projects and watch your UX soar high.</p><p>What's your favorite microinteraction in the apps or websites that you use?

By the end of this part, users will be able to initiate and join video calls, similar to the \"Huddle\" feature in Slack.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Creating a Call Using the Huddle Button\n</h2><p>First, we need a way for users to start and stop video calls easily. Let's create a button for this purpose, which we'll call the .</p><p>Go to the  directory, and create a  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the component above, we update the current state of the call, including creating a new call, updating the call details, joining the call, or leaving the call using the following functions:</p><ul><li><p>: This function creates a new call by setting the required data, including channel details and workspace members. If there's an existing call, it first leaves that call.</p></li><li><p>: This function toggles the state between joining and leaving the call, depending on whether the user is already in an active call.</p></li></ul><p>We also use the  and  hooks to keep track of the current call state. The button updates its appearance and behavior based on whether a call is ongoing, available, or inactive.</p><p>Next, let's integrate the  into the channel page.</p><p>Navigate to <code>/client/[workspaceId]/[channelId]/page.tsx</code> and update it as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, we integrate the  component with the channel toolbar. We also wrap it with the  component to manage the call state.</p><h2><strong>Implementing a Custom Hook for Huddles</strong></h2><p>With the huddle button in place, let's move on to creating a custom hook for our huddle feature. This hook will help manage different aspects of a call, such as toggling the microphone, camera, and screen sharing. It will also track the current state of the call, like whether the user is joining, speaking, or sharing their screen.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: The  hook uses several hooks from <code>@stream-io/video-react-sdk</code> to manage different aspects of a call. It tracks the current call state, such as the , whether the user is muted, if screen sharing is active, and if the user has permission to perform specific actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toggling Microphone, Camera, and Screen Share</strong>: The , , and  functions allow users to control their microphone, camera, and screen sharing during calls.</p></li><li><p>: The  variable helps determine whether the spotlight layout should be used. This typically happens if one participant shares their screen or is pinned.</p></li><li><p>: The  function allows the user to leave the call. If the user has the required permission, they can also end the call for all participants.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Building and Showing a Call</strong></h2><p>So far, users can create and join calls, but now we want to add the UI for the calls themselves. In this section, we'll integrate the huddle UI components, allowing users to manage video calls within a workspace, similar to Slack's huddle feature.</p><h3><strong>Creating the Call Control Button</strong></h3><p>The first component we need is a call control button. This button will toggle features during a call, like muting the microphone, turning the camera on or off, and more.</p><p>Create a new  file in the  directory, and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  component adjusts its styles based on whether it is  or not. The button changes its background color and hover behavior to indicate the active state, helping users visually understand the button's current state.</p><h3><strong>Customizing the Participant View</strong></h3><p>The main component we’ll use in our video layouts is Stream’s <a href=\"https://getstream.io/video/docs/react/ui-components/core/participant-view/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> component. This component displays the participant’s video, plays their audio, shows their information, and provides action buttons for controls like pinning or muting.</p><p>However, the  default UI doesn't match our design, so we'll override it by creating our own custom UI using the  prop.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  is divided into several components:</p><ul><li><p>: The  component shows details for each participant, such as their name and audio status, making it easy to identify who is currently speaking or pinned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speech Indicator and Speech Ring</strong>: The  component gives a clear visual cue to users when a participant is speaking. We also included a speech ring effect highlighting the participant's video when speaking.</p></li><li><p>: The <code>DefaultScreenShareOverlay</code> is used when a participant is sharing their screen, providing a visual indication to other participants.</p></li><li><p>: The menu allows participants to perform actions such as pinning or muting themselves or another participant.</p></li></ul><p>With the main call controls and participant view in place, it's time to create the huddle interface. This UI will contain the video feed layout and call controls and ensure the interface responds dynamically to different situations, like toggling between the sidebar and modal views.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the code snippet above:</p><ul><li><p>: We use the  and  to arrange participants based on the context (e.g., sidebar vs. full screen).</p></li><li><p>: We use the  component to toggle the microphone, camera, and screen sharing.</p></li><li><p>: We use the  and  props to handle when the huddle is open in another window or embedded in the sidebar.</p></li></ul><p>Now that we've developed the core user interface for our video calls, it's time to integrate the functionality into a single cohesive component. The huddle component will be responsible for managing the different states of a video call, such as when a user is joining, leaving, or responding to an invitation.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: The  from the  hook is used to determine the appropriate UI to display. For example, if the call is ringing and wasn't initiated by the current user (), an invitation message, and options to join or decline the call are shown.</p></li><li><p><strong>Joining and Declining a Call</strong>: The  and  functions handle the respective actions. The  function invokes the  method, while the  function invokes  with the option to reject.</p></li><li><p>: Depending on the call state, the component renders different UI sections, including:</p><ul><li>The invitation view, when the call is  but not initiated by the user.</li><li>The call UI when the user has  or is .</li></ul></li></ul><p>The huddle modal component will give an expanded view of the video call interface. It provides a more immersive experience for users when compared to the sidebar view.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The component accepts an  prop to control when to display the modal. The modal also uses fixed positioning and includes styles that provide a centered, full-screen overlay.</p><p>With the  and  now created, we can add them to our app.</p><p>Normally, we could place our  component in the . However, the  is a child component in our  file, and layout files persist across routes and maintain the same state.</p><p>This feature would be unsuitable for our needs as we want the current call state to be able to reset and effects to re-run each time a user navigates between channels.</p><p>So instead, we'll use a template file. <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#templates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Templates</a> in Next.js are similar to layouts in that they wrap a child layout or page. However, unlike layouts, they create a new instance of their children each time the user navigates.</p><p>This behavior makes templates perfect for our huddle feature, as it allows us to reset the state and re-synchronize effects seamlessly when the channel or call data changes.</p><p>In the  directory, create a new  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: This hook allows us to get the active call. We use it along with the  from our app context to determine which call to display.</p></li><li><p>: We use the  hook to decide the currently active call, giving priority to matching calls from both the current call and channel call.</p></li><li><p>: The  function from  is used to render the Huddle and HuddleModal components to specific parts of the DOM—the sidebar and body. This allows us to dynamically position the components and ensure they integrate smoothly with the UI layout.</p></li><li><p>: The  wrapper is used to pass the active call to our Huddle components, allowing them to manage the video and audio streams effectively.</p></li></ul><p>Before wrapping things up, let's add some important styles to our  file to ensure our huddle interface looks just right:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this, our huddles are fully functional, allowing users to collaborate seamlessly during video calls!</p><p>We've covered a lot in this three-part series, from setting up the foundation of our Slack clone with a database, authentication, and initial pages, to adding real-time messaging and video calling.</p>","contentLength":8520,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hacking Go-TFE and Fetching All Workspaces in Terraform Enterprise: A Journey Through Pagination","url":"https://dev.to/muhammetberdi_jepbarov/hacking-go-tfe-and-fetching-all-workspaces-in-terraform-enterprise-a-journey-through-pagination-4lel","date":1739707176,"author":"Muhammetberdi Jepbarov","guid":596,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Terraform Enterprise (TFE) is a powerful platform for organizations using Terraform at scale.

The most straightforward way to list workspaces looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>However, there was a catch.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Pain Point: Pagination Woes\n</h3><p>When we ran this code, we noticed something odd — it only returned . After digging into the documentation and the source code of the  library, it became clear that the API defaults to a . Even when we explicitly set the page size to the maximum limit of 100, it still only gave us one page of results:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The issue was evident: . This means that if your organization has more than 100 workspaces (which is not uncommon for larger teams), you have to make multiple requests to get all of them.</p><p>But we didn’t want to be bound by pagination. We wanted all the workspaces in one go — a clean, consolidated list.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: Handling Pagination Manually\n</h3><p>To work around the pagination limit, the only solution was to  through the results until all workspaces were fetched. We crafted the following solution:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Down the Solution\n</h3><p>Let’s walk through the logic step by step:</p><ol><li>: We start with an empty slice to hold all workspaces and set the page number to 1.</li><li>: Inside the  loop, we make requests using the , setting both the page number and the maximum page size.</li><li>: After each request, we append the returned workspaces to our  slice.</li><li>: If the number of workspaces in the current response is less than the page size (meaning we’ve reached the last page), we break out of the loop.</li><li>: Finally, we return the full list of workspaces.</li></ol><p>Fetching all workspaces might seem like a trivial task at first glance, but it highlights a crucial aspect of working with APIs — understanding and handling pagination correctly.</p><p>When dealing with APIs that support pagination:</p><ul><li>Always check default page sizes.</li><li>Understand the max page size allowed.</li><li>Implement proper loop termination to avoid infinite loops.</li><li>Consider API rate limits when making multiple requests.</li></ul><p>In our case, the solution was not only about fetching data but about ensuring the stability and reliability of our automation pipelines.</p><p>In the end, handling pagination in TFE’s API required us to step back, understand the underlying mechanics, and build a robust way to gather all the data we needed. The final solution is now part of our infrastructure tooling, allowing us to work seamlessly with Terraform Enterprise’s workspaces.</p><p>So next time you hit a wall with an API and pagination, remember — it’s not a bug; it’s a feature. Master it, and your automation game will only grow stronger.</p>","contentLength":3683,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Slack Clone with Next.js and TailwindCSS - Part Two","url":"https://dev.to/tropicolx/building-a-slack-clone-with-nextjs-and-tailwindcss-part-two-11cl","date":1739707085,"author":"Oluwabusayo Jacobs","guid":595,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In part one of this series, we built the basics of our Slack clone by setting up user authentication, workspace creation, and designing a responsive layout for our workspace hub.</p><p>In this second part, we'll bring our Slack clone to life by adding real-time messaging with <a href=\"https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steam React Chat SDK</a>. We'll add features like rich text, file sharing, images, and emoji reactions.</p><p>By the end of this part, users will be able to communicate with each other, making our app a functional chat platform.</p><h2><strong>Adding More Channels To Your Workspace</strong></h2><p>Currently, users can only have one channel in a workspace, which is the channel added during the workspace creation process. Before adding the messaging feature to our app, let's enable users to create additional channels within a workspace.</p><p>To add more channels, we'll create a pop-up modal that appears when users click an '' button in the sidebar.</p><h3><strong>Creating the Channel API Route</strong></h3><p>First, we need an API route to handle channel creation. Create a  directory inside the existing <code>/api/workspaces/[workspaceId]</code> directory, then add a  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p><strong>Authentication and Validation</strong>: We check if the user is authenticated and if they belong to the workspace.</p></li><li><p>: Only users with an '' role can create new channels.</p></li><li><p>: We ensure that no other channel in the workspace has the same name.</p></li><li><p>: If all checks pass, the channel is created and saved in the database.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Creating the Add Channel Modal</strong></h3><p>Next, let's create a modal for adding new channels. In the  directory, create a file called  with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let’s break down some of the component's key features:</p><ul><li><p>We use the  regular expression to ensure that each channel name is unique within the workspace by comparing it against existing channel names.</p></li><li><p>: We use the  state to show a loading spinner () while the channel creation is ongoing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Navigation to New Channel</strong>: After successfully creating a channel, we redirect users to the new channel page. The modal is also closed by resetting the input fields and calling the  function.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Adding the 'Add Channel' Button to the Sidebar</strong></h3><p>Next, let's add the  to the  file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In , we add a  hook to manage the modal's open state, and an ““ button that shows the modal if the current user is the workspace owner. This button is placed below the channel list for easy access.</p><p>With this setup, users can now create new channels to help organize conversations within the workspace.</p><h2><strong>Building the Chat Interface</strong></h2><p>Now that users can create multiple channels, let's start working on our main chat interface. First, we'll be building the loading state for our chat UI, then the main chat interface, and finally, we'll customize different aspects of the chat, like the message input, date separator, and more.</p><h3><strong>Creating a Channel Loading Indicator</strong></h3><p>To let users know the channel chat is loading, we will create a loading indicator that provides a visual cue while fetching data. Stream already provides a default loading UI, but we want a custom one to match our application's design.</p><p>Navigate to the  directory and create a new file called  with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The component shows a skeleton screen, which gives users a visual hint that content is loading.</p><p>Next, let's build the main chat interface so users can send messages and see their conversation history.</p><p>Go to the  folder, create a new file named , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  component accepts the  data as a prop and uses the <a href=\"https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/components/core-components/channel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> component from  to manage chat sessions. Here are its key components:</p><ul><li><p>: This displays the conversation history within the current channel.</p></li><li><p>: This component allows users to type and send messages. The  is rendered using React Portals, which helps position the input field in a different part of the DOM to match the layout we want for our Slack clone.</p></li><li><p>: The  component also accepts our custom  component as a prop to override the default loading UI.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Integrating the Channel Chat Component</strong></h3><p>Next, we need to integrate the  component into our channel page. Go to the <code>/client/[workspaceId]/[channelId]/page.tsx</code> file and update it as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>We check if the channel is still loading using the  state. If it is, we display the  component.</p></li><li><p>Once the channel data is loaded, we display the  component, which provides the main chat interface for users to interact with.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, let’s add some styling to customize the look of our chat UI. Navigate to the  directory and update the  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And with that, users can now send messages. However, the current UI still looks far from what we want, so in the following sections, we'll add custom components to enhance it.</p><h2><strong>Adding a Custom Date Separator</strong></h2><p>To help users follow conversations more easily, we'll add custom date separators that indicate when messages are from different days.</p><p>Go to the  folder, create a new file called , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This component shows a separator to help users see when messages are from different days. Using the  function, we provide labels like \"\", \"\", or a formatted date with an ordinal suffix.</p><p>Next, let’s add the  to the  component to make conversations more readable:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2><strong>Creating a Custom Emoji Picker</strong></h2><p>In this section, we'll create a custom emoji picker for our Slack clone using the  library. While Stream already provides an <a href=\"https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/guides/customization/emoji_picker/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> using the same library, we want to build a more flexible version that better suits our chat components and integrates seamlessly into our clone.</p><p>Firstly, we need to install the necessary packages for the emoji picker. These include:</p><ul><li><p>: This library provides the emoji picker component.</p></li><li><p>: This package is specifically for using the emoji picker in React apps.</p></li><li><p>: This contains all the data needed for the emojis.</p></li></ul><p>Run the following command in your terminal to install the packages:</p><div><pre><code>npm emoji-mart @emoji-mart/react @emoji-mart/data\n</code></pre></div><p>Next, go to your  folder, create a new file called , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: We use  to display the emoji picker and  to get all the emoji data. We also use  from  to handle the positioning of our emoji picker.</p></li><li><p>: The component accepts several props, such as  for the button that triggers the picker,  to handle emoji selection, and optional styling classes for customization.</p></li><li><p>: The  hook positions the emoji picker correctly relative to the button.</p></li><li><p>: We use the  state to show or hide the picker. We also handle clicks outside the picker to close it.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Implementing a Custom Message Input</strong></h2><p>In this section, we'll implement a custom message input for our Slack clone. This new input will allow users to easily add rich formatting, such as bold or italics, and even upload files and add emojis, creating a more dynamic chatting experience.</p><p>To achieve this, we'll use <a href=\"https://docs.slatejs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, which is a robust framework for building rich text editors. We'll also use <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-hotkey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> to define keyboard shortcuts for formatting text.</p><p>First, let's install the necessary libraries. Open your terminal and run the following commands:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we'll create our custom input component, which will act as the primary input container for our chat.</p><p>Navigate to the  directory, create a new file named , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down:</p><ul><li><p>: We use Slate to create a rich text editor that supports multiple formatting options, like bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough.</p></li><li><p>: The  and  functions convert the editor's content to markdown format, allowing us to maintain rich formatting in text.</p></li><li><p>: Functions like , , and  help manage file uploads, previews, and removal, making the chat input more versatile.</p></li><li><p>: The buttons for formatting text (bold, italic, etc.) call the  function to add or remove specific text styles.</p></li><li><p>: The  library binds hotkeys like  for bold,  for italics, and so on, making the editor more user-friendly.</p></li><li><p>: The  function is responsible for sending the message by serializing the editor's content and then using Stream's  function.</p></li></ul><p>Next, let's integrate the  with our channel chat interface.</p><p>Open the  file and update it with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the code above, we import the  component and pass it as the  prop for the  component to override the default UI.</p><p>Next, let’s add some styling to support the rich text formatting features, ensuring elements like  blocks and other inline styles look polished.</p><p>Open your  file, and include the following styles:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>While the chat interface is now visually improved with a customized message input, the message UI still needs work to match the look of the rest of the app.</p><h2><strong>Creating a Custom Message UI</strong></h2><p>In this section, we'll create a custom message UI to match the look and feel of our Slack clone. This custom message component will display user messages in a clean interface with the ability to send reactions and view attachments.</p><p>To get started, navigate to the  directory, create a new file named , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the  component:</p><ul><li><p> We use the  hook to get information about the current message displayed, such as the message content and its author.</p></li><li><p> Using , we calculate the number of reactions and whether the user has reacted to the message or not. Users can add or remove reactions by clicking on the reaction buttons.</p></li><li><p> The message can contain attachments such as images or files. We provide download and preview options for attachments.</p></li><li><p> We added a button to send reactions using our custom .</p></li></ul><p>Now, let's integrate our new  component into our . Navigate to <code>components/ChannelChat.tsx</code> and update it to use :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In , we update the  to use our custom  component. This change allows our newly defined custom message UI to display each message.</p><p>And that’s it! We now have a fully customized chat experience similar to Slack.</p><p>In this part, we made our Slack clone more interactive by implementing core messaging features using <a href=\"https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stream React Chat SDK</a>. We added custom components to further style and enhance the user interface with features like rich text formatting, emojis, and file sharing.</p><p>In this series's next and final part, we will integrate a video calling feature using <a href=\"https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stream React Video and Audio SDK</a>. This feature will allow users to transition between text and video conversations, making the app more versatile and interactive.</p>","contentLength":10020,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🐞Debugging Life: The Software Engineering Lessons You Can’t Ignore","url":"https://dev.to/hassanshahzadaheer/debugging-life-the-software-engineering-lessons-you-cant-ignore-4n79","date":1739707082,"author":"Hassan Shahzad Aheer","guid":594,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In software engineering, every line of code has a purpose.
