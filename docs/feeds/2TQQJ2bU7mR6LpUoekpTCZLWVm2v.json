Whether you're a beginner or an experienced cloud professional, this guide will empower you to leverage the efficiency and scalability of serverless architectures.</p><p>AWS Lambda is Amazon's Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offering.  Think of it as a team of highly efficient, on-demand servers working for you. You upload your code, and AWS handles all the underlying infrastructure—provisioning, scaling, patching, and maintenance. You only pay for the compute time your function actually uses, making it incredibly cost-effective.</p><p>Lambda supports various programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET, and even custom runtimes via containers.  For the most up-to-date list and details, check out the official <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda documentation</a>.</p><p>This frees you from the following responsibilities:</p><ul><li> No more wrestling with instance types and configurations.</li><li> AWS keeps your environment secure and up-to-date.</li><li> Scaling is handled automatically based on demand.</li></ul><p>Lambda's flexibility makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, especially within event-driven architectures.  Here are some compelling use cases:</p><ul><li> Schedule functions to generate reports using CloudWatch Events, eliminating manual processes. For instance, automatically generate a daily sales report.</li><li> Process orders instantly when new items are added to your DynamoDB database, ensuring rapid order fulfillment.</li><li> Automatically resize or apply watermarks to images uploaded to S3, optimizing your media library.</li><li> Build REST APIs using Lambda and API Gateway, creating modern, scalable backends without managing servers.</li><li> Automate security tasks like IAM policy violation remediation or credential rotation.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, Lambda excels at building microservices: small, independent functions focused on specific tasks. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Under the Hood: How Lambda Works\n</h3><p>Deploying a Lambda function is a straightforward process:</p><ol><li>  This specifies your function's entry point – the code that gets executed when triggered.</li><li> Upload your code to AWS.  This can be done directly through the console or via the AWS CLI.</li><li> AWS packages your code into an execution environment (often a container). When triggered:\n\n<ul><li>The container is initialized.</li><li>The container is terminated (or kept warm for faster subsequent executions).</li></ul></li></ol><p>You might hear about \"cold starts,\" the initial delay while the container loads.  However, AWS has made significant improvements, and techniques like provisioned concurrency can minimize this effect.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Deep Dive into Serverless Computing\n</h3><p>AWS Lambda integrates seamlessly with a vast ecosystem of AWS services, enabling powerful workflows.  Some key integrations include:</p><ul><li>  Manages incoming requests and routes them to your Lambda functions.</li><li>  A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.</li><li>  Object storage for storing files and media.</li><li>  Messaging services for asynchronous communication.</li><li>  A serverless event bus that routes events to your Lambda functions.</li><li>  Orchestrates complex workflows involving multiple Lambda functions.</li></ul><p>For a comprehensive understanding of the Lambda execution model, refer to this resource: [Link to Lambda Execution Model -  ]</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating Your First Lambda Function\n</h3><p>Let's get hands-on! Creating your first Lambda function is easy, whether you prefer the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Method 1: AWS Management Console\n</h4><ol><li>Select \"Author from scratch.\"</li><li>Configure the function name, runtime (e.g., Python 3.11), and permissions (a basic Lambda execution role is sufficient).</li><li>Add your code using the inline editor or upload a ZIP file.</li><li>Test your function using the \"Test\" button or trigger it via an event.</li></ol><p>The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CLI</a> offers a more streamlined approach:</p><div><pre><code>aws lambda create-function  helloLambda  python3.11  lambda_function.lambda_handler  arn:aws:iam::&lt;account-id&gt;:role/lambda-execute-role  fileb://function.zip  us-east-1\n</code></pre></div><p>Remember to replace placeholders like  with your actual values.  Ensure your IAM role () has the necessary permissions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Invoke your function using:</p><div><pre><code>aws lambda invoke  helloLambda \n    response.json\n</code></pre></div><p>This completes your first step into the serverless world!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h3><p>AWS Lambda integrates seamlessly with Amazon CloudWatch, providing comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

Turns out I’m not the only one. Research shows that 67% of users abandon sign-up processes that feel clunky or confusing. Even more telling, modern UX studies reveal that micro-interactions and instant feedback can boost conversion rates by up to 45%. Wild, right?</p><p>Ever since I started working on frontend-heavy products, I’ve been obsessed with crafting login pages that feel smooth and intuitive. Turns out I’m not alone. Studies show that 88% of users are less likely to return after a poor user experience. Even more interesting, responsive and interactive login flows can increase sign-in success rates by over 40%. Pretty compelling, right?</p><p>By using the <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/vibe-coding-tools/#how-to-choose-the-right-vibe-coding-tool-for-your-needs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, from UI prototyping to animation libraries and smart validation systems, I built a fully interactive login page that feels modern, responsive, and frictionless.</p><h2><strong>Top Vibe Coding Tools for Creating an Interactive Login Page</strong></h2><p>Here is the list of vibe coding tools that I used for creating interactive login pages:</p><p>For the first version of the login page, I centered everything around <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>. I wanted to see how far I could go by using it to plan, structure, and simulate the entire user flow, without relying on traditional design tools or manual wireframing.</p><p>Vitara focuses on interaction logic. It helped me map out user behavior in a visual way before I wrote a single line of code. I built the flow using Vitara’s editor, which made it easy to define states like “login success,” “invalid input,” or “server error” without jumping back and forth between notes and code.</p><p>What stood out most was how Vitara visualized every possible path a user could take. I could test edge cases, preview how feedback would look, and even simulate what happens during slow network conditions. This helped me think more deeply about the user experience early on.</p><p>I then translated that flow directly into a React project, keeping Vitara’s logic as the foundation. The final page felt smooth and predictable. Every interaction made sense because I had already accounted for it during planning.</p><p>This approach worked best for building a well-structured, thought-through login flow. It didn't cover the visual flair or backend logic, but as a design-first experience, Vitara helped me get the interaction right from the start.</p><p>For the second version of the login page, I decided to focus entirely on feel. My goal was to see how much personality and warmth I could add using Lovable as the main driver.</p><p><a href=\"https://vitara.ai/lovable-alternatives/#what-is-lovable\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> specializes in micro-interactions. It helped me layer in small moments that made the page feel alive—hover lifts on input fields, soft fades between states, and gentle bounce effects when users completed actions. These weren’t just visual touches. They made the interface feel responsive and emotionally engaging.</p><p>The implementation was smooth. I didn’t need to overhaul my styling or animation stack. Lovable worked alongside my existing setup and offered presets that just worked out of the box. Within minutes, I had a login form that felt welcoming and fun.</p><p>What surprised me most was how much users responded to these small touches. During test runs, people stayed longer, interacted more, and even commented on how “clean” or “modern” the experience felt. The core logic was simple, but the vibe was memorable.</p><p>This version didn’t focus much on backend or advanced validation, but it nailed the emotional layer. If you care about user perception and want your interface to stand out, Lovable adds that finishing polish.</p><p>For the third version of my login page, I focused entirely on backend functionality. I used <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/top-bolt-new-alternatives/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> to handle authentication logic, user sessions, and API responses—all without writing custom server code from scratch.</p><p>Bolt.new gave me a ready-to-use backend with login, signup, password reset, and JWT-based auth out of the box. I didn’t need to spin up a database or configure middleware. Everything was pre-wired and easy to test.</p><p>What made this version interesting was how quickly I could go from zero to production-ready. I connected the frontend via simple REST calls, and within minutes, I had a real working auth system. It even supported OAuth providers like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, which made it feel like a feature-rich platform without the usual setup time.</p><p>This version wasn’t flashy on the frontend, but it was rock-solid under the hood. I focused on functionality, error handling, and response times. It gave me a great foundation to build more complex auth flows in future projects.</p><p>For the fourth login page, I tried building the entire flow inside , the AI-powered code editor. I was curious to see how far I could push a login page using real-time suggestions and AI-driven refactoring as my coding partner.</p><p><a href=\"https://vitara.ai/replit-alternatives/#7-cursor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> felt like having an experienced teammate sitting beside me. I started by describing the login flow in plain English, and the editor instantly scaffolded a working React form with clean structure and state handling. I refined the logic as I went, and Cursor kept up with suggestions that felt natural and context-aware.</p><p>When I got stuck thinking about edge cases like token expiration or redirect logic, Cursor suggested patterns I hadn’t even considered yet. It wasn’t just completing code, it was helping me design smarter.</p><p>The final result was solid. Not the flashiest UI, but one of the fastest builds I’ve done. Cursor helped me avoid mistakes and saved time on boilerplate setup. I still had to guide the structure, but it took care of the grunt work.</p><p>For the last version, I went all-in on simplicity. I used <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/cursor-alternatives/#top-cursor-alternatives-in-2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, a UI component library focused on minimal design and smooth user flows. I wanted to build a fast, clean login page with almost no custom styling or layout logic.</p><p>Windsurf gave me ready-to-use form components that looked good and worked well across screen sizes. I dragged in a form block, added input fields, and everything adjusted responsively without a single media query. It was almost like building with Lego pieces, but for UI.</p><p>The built-in animations were subtle but effective. Focus states, error messages, and button feedback all felt intentional. I didn’t touch CSS once, which was a nice change from tweaking styles manually.</p><p>This version had the cleanest UI out of all five. The look and feel were modern, focused, and friction-free. It didn’t have the deep logic of the Cursor version or the smart flow planning from Vitara, but it absolutely nailed the \"just works\" experience.</p><p>To really understand what works, I built five different login pages—each one centered around a single tool. The goal was simple: test each tool in its own space and see what kind of experience it could create on its own.</p><p>Vitara impressed me with intelligent flow design and user-state logic. Lovable turned a basic form into something fun and emotionally engaging. Bolt.new helped me ship a fully functional login backend in no time. React Hook Form with Zod made validation clean and user-friendly. Framer Motion brought everything to life with fluid, app-like animations.</p><p>Each version had its strengths and challenges. Some tools offered speed, others delivered polish. The process helped me see what really matters for users and how different tools shape the same idea in unique ways.</p><p>If you’re working on your own login flows, try this experiment. Build a few variations using different tools. Compare them. Learn what fits your style, your stack, and your users.</p><p>Have a favorite tool for login UX?

But now, they are under siege. Crypto mining bots are exploiting these free tools to mine coins for personal profit, bringing down services and leaving honest users with limited access or none at all.</p><h2><strong>Why Crypto Miners Target Free CI/CD Tools</strong></h2><p>CI/CD platforms offer free compute power, bandwidth, and fast processors. Crypto miners see this as an opportunity. They hijack pipelines and use them to run mining scripts. This abuse often goes unnoticed until performance drops or usage costs skyrocket.</p><p>Most free CI/CD providers rely on automation and trust. Unfortunately, crypto miners exploit that trust with automated scripts that mimic legitimate builds. It’s easy, quick, and profitable — for them.</p><h2><strong>Popular Platforms Affected by Crypto Mining Abuse</strong></h2><p>Many well-known CI/CD services have fallen victim. Here are the most affected:</p><ul><li><p>\nOnce known for generous free minutes, it has drastically reduced free usage due to widespread abuse.</p></li><li><p>\nGitLab had to restrict free-tier runners because of repeated crypto mining attacks.</p></li><li><p>\nOne of the earliest to feel the impact, Travis CI now limits build minutes and accounts for abuse.</p></li></ul><p>These platforms now apply strict verification, usage caps, and auto-suspensions, affecting developers who never intended harm.</p><h2><strong>How Crypto Mining Impacts Honest Developers</strong></h2><p>Developers are the real victims here. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p>\nResources get throttled due to overuse. Queues get longer, and jobs take forever to complete.</p></li><li><p>\nFalse positives lead to bans. Legitimate users get flagged while bots find workarounds.</p></li><li><p>\nTo counter abuse, many platforms strip down features or make them paywalled, reducing access for open-source contributors.</p></li><li><p>\nNew developers hesitate to use free CI/CD tools, fearing unreliable performance or policy changes overnight.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What Platforms Are Doing to Fight Back</strong></h2><p>The battle is ongoing, but some measures are helping:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stronger Identity Verification</strong>\nPhone number and credit card verifications are now mandatory on many platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Usage Monitoring and Alerts</strong>\nAutomated tools now monitor for crypto mining behavior and flag abnormal usage.</p></li><li><p>\nDaily or monthly limits help reduce the window of abuse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Private Runners and Paid Tiers</strong>\nEncouraging users to move to paid plans or self-hosted runners adds a layer of accountability.</p></li></ul><p>Still, none of these are perfect. Crypto miners evolve quickly and often adapt faster than protections can be deployed.</p><h2><strong>What Developers Can Do Now</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting caught in the crossfire, developers should:</p><ul><li><p>\nAlways verify your account and link it to a trusted identity.</p></li><li><p>\nOptimize your CI/CD pipelines. Shorter jobs are less likely to trigger suspicion.</p></li><li><p>\nFlag suspicious projects or public repos that seem to run meaningless or repeated jobs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consider Hybrid Workflows</strong>\nMix local builds and cloud CI/CD usage. This minimizes dependency on free tools.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>The Future of Free CI/CD Services</strong></h2><p>Unless crypto mining abuse is tackled head-on, the free-tier era may end. Platforms may shift to invite-only models or enforce paywalls to survive. Community support and responsible usage are the only ways to keep free CI/CD alive.</p><p>The open-source ecosystem thrives on free tools. Crypto mining abuse threatens that foundation. Developers, platforms, and communities must act together. Otherwise, free CI/CD may become a relic of the past.</p><p> Crypto miners are draining the life out of free CI/CD services.

But it’s also creating chaos in the world of development tools. One major issue is the abuse of free Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platforms by crypto miners. These platforms were designed to help developers test and deploy code efficiently—not to run mining operations.</p><h2><strong>Why Free CI/CD Tools Are Under Threat</strong></h2><p>Free CI/CD services like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and others offer valuable computing power. Their free tiers are meant for small teams and individual developers. However, bad actors exploit these platforms to run crypto mining scripts. The result? Overloaded servers, higher maintenance costs, and drained resources.</p><p>CI/CD providers are being forced to restrict access, limit usage, or shut down free tiers altogether. This directly affects the open-source community and early-stage developers who rely on these tools.</p><h2><strong>How Hackers Exploit CI/CD Systems</strong></h2><p>Cybercriminals target misconfigured CI/CD pipelines or create fake repositories. They then inject mining scripts into build processes. Once deployed, these scripts start mining cryptocurrencies like Monero in the background.</p><p>Some use advanced automation to create thousands of fake accounts. This way, they bypass rate limits and maximize computational gains—all at someone else's cost.</p><h2><strong>CI/CD Platforms Fighting Back</strong></h2><p>In response, platforms are tightening their security and usage policies. GitHub has implemented stricter verification processes. GitLab has begun limiting free usage and detecting unusual activity patterns. CircleCI and Travis CI now monitor and block suspicious scripts faster than ever.</p><p>But these countermeasures also bring inconvenience for legitimate users. Verification steps slow down workflows. Usage restrictions disrupt productivity. Free-tier developers are now forced to look for alternatives or pay for previously free services.</p><p>Open-source developers suffer the most. These users don’t have the budget for premium plans. They depend on free CI/CD services to build and deploy community-driven projects. Now, they face usage limits, account bans, and delayed deployments.</p><p>Startups and students are also hit hard. They lose access to essential automation tools during critical development phases.</p><h2><strong>The Ripple Effect on the Developer Ecosystem</strong></h2><p>When free CI/CD tools vanish or become unusable, the entire developer ecosystem suffers. Collaboration slows down. Innovation stalls. Small contributors drop out. It becomes harder for new developers to gain experience with modern deployment workflows.</p><p>Even larger companies feel the impact indirectly. Many of their libraries and frameworks come from open-source efforts that now face disruption.</p><h2><strong>Possible Solutions to This Growing Problem</strong></h2><p>Stopping this trend isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible. Here are a few potential ways to tackle the issue:</p><ul><li> Platforms can implement stricter sign-up processes to block bots.</li><li> Set clear usage limits and use AI to detect abuse.</li><li><strong>Paid Plans for Serious Users:</strong> Offering low-cost plans for verified users might reduce abuse.</li><li> Educating users about misuse and how to secure their pipelines helps too.</li></ul><h2><strong>A Call to Action for the Developer Community</strong></h2><p>It's time for the tech community to act. Support platforms under pressure. Report suspicious activity. Advocate for fair usage. Donate to open-source developers and maintainers. Help keep the ecosystem alive and thriving.</p><p>Crypto mining may be profitable for some, but when it threatens tools meant for progress and collaboration, everyone loses.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: We Must Protect Developer Resources</strong></h2><p>Free CI/CD platforms are crucial for innovation. But their future is at risk. Unless we take immediate action, these valuable resources could vanish. Developers, maintainers, and platform providers must work together to stop crypto abuse before it’s too late.</p><p>Let’s secure the future of software development—before it's mined out of existence.</p>","contentLength":4026,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"IBM Fundamentals: Gp Cordova Plugin","url":"https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/ibm-fundamentals-gp-cordova-plugin-okm","date":1751434219,"author":"DevOps Fundamental","guid":179591,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Securing Mobile Access: A Deep Dive into the IBM Gp Cordova Plugin\n</h2><p>Imagine you're a field service technician for a large energy company. You need instant access to critical schematics, work orders, and safety protocols – all on your mobile device, while working in remote locations with potentially unreliable network connectivity.  Or consider a healthcare professional needing secure access to patient records on a tablet during rounds.  These scenarios demand robust security, seamless authentication, and reliable access, even in challenging environments.  Traditional mobile app security often falls short, leaving organizations vulnerable to data breaches and compliance violations.</p><p>Today, the need for secure mobile access is paramount.  The rise of cloud-native applications, coupled with the increasing adoption of zero-trust security models and hybrid identity solutions, has created a complex landscape.  According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023, the average cost of a data breach reached a record high of $4.45 million.  Mobile devices are frequently a point of vulnerability.  Companies like Siemens, a global technology powerhouse, rely on secure mobile access for their field service engineers, and financial institutions like Bank of America are constantly innovating to protect customer data on mobile platforms.  This is where the IBM Gp Cordova Plugin comes into play, offering a powerful solution for securing mobile applications built with Cordova.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is the IBM Gp Cordova Plugin?\n</h3><p>The IBM Gp Cordova Plugin (often referred to as the \"GP Plugin\") is a security plugin for Cordova-based mobile applications. In layman's terms, it's a set of code libraries that you integrate into your Cordova app to add a layer of robust security features, primarily focused on authentication and authorization.  It allows your app to securely interact with IBM Security Verify (formerly IBM Security Access Manager) and other identity providers, enabling strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA), risk-based authentication, and single sign-on (SSO).</p><p>The core problem the GP Plugin solves is bridging the gap between traditional web-based security infrastructure (like IBM Security Verify) and the mobile app world. Cordova apps, being essentially web applications wrapped in a native container, require a secure way to leverage existing security investments.  Without a plugin like this, developers would need to implement complex security protocols from scratch, increasing development time, cost, and the risk of vulnerabilities.</p><ul><li> The plugin includes native code (Java for Android, Objective-C/Swift for iOS) that handles the low-level security interactions with the operating system and the identity provider.</li><li> A JavaScript API provides a simple and consistent interface for Cordova app developers to access the plugin's functionality.</li><li>  Configuration files define the connection details to your IBM Security Verify server and other security settings.</li><li> The Software Development Kit provides documentation, samples, and tools to help developers integrate the plugin into their applications.</li></ul><p>Companies like a large logistics provider use the GP Plugin to secure access to their driver apps, ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive delivery information.  Retailers utilize it to protect customer data within their mobile shopping apps.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Use the IBM Gp Cordova Plugin?\n</h3><p>Before the GP Plugin, developers faced several challenges when securing Cordova apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Complex Security Implementation:</strong> Implementing robust security features like MFA and SSO from scratch is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise.</li><li><strong>Maintaining Security Standards:</strong> Keeping up with evolving security standards and patching vulnerabilities is a constant effort.</li><li><strong>Integration with Existing Infrastructure:</strong> Integrating mobile apps with existing identity management systems can be complex and costly.</li><li><strong>User Experience Concerns:</strong>  Poorly implemented security can lead to a frustrating user experience, hindering app adoption.</li></ul><p><strong>Industry-Specific Motivations:</strong></p><ul><li> HIPAA compliance requires strict access control to patient data.</li><li> PCI DSS compliance mandates strong authentication and data protection for financial transactions.</li><li>  Federal regulations require secure access to sensitive government information.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Secure Field Service App:</strong> A utility company needs to ensure only authorized technicians can access critical infrastructure data on their mobile devices.

These smart kitchen buddies build weekly meal plans based on your dietary needs, time constraints, and what’s in stock. AND they generate grocery lists. Hallelujah.</p></li></ul><p>I started dabbling with AI cooking after a friend showed me an app that recommended dinner just by scanning the items in her fridge. I was skeptical. Then it turned my random mix of bell peppers, rice, and chickpeas into a spicy stir-fry I’ve made five times since. It’s like cooking got fun again—less chore, more “ooh let’s try this!”</p><p>And here’s a wild stat to chew on: By 2025, the smart kitchen market is projected to hit . That means more tools, apps, gadgets—and yes, savvy robot sous-chefs—coming into your home to make cooking smarter, healthier, and way more fun.</p><p>If you love food but  love the grindy parts of cooking, AI is your new BFF. It’s not about replacing your instincts or creativity—it’s about supercharging it. You're still the head chef... you're just getting some seriously futuristic backup.</p><p>Ready to make your kitchen smarter—and your meals tastier? Let’s dive in. 🍳</p><h2><p>\n  AI-Powered Meal Planning That Gets You</p></h2><p>Did you know that the average person spends over  just deciding what to eat? That’s more than five straight days of staring into the fridge and saying, “Ugh, nothing sounds good.”</p><p>Yeah. I’ve been there. In fact, there was a solid week last month when I survived almost entirely on sad little tuna sandwiches. No pizzazz. No crunch. Just… tuna. On bread. Every day. Why? Because I was mentally exhausted and creatively tapped out. That dreaded combo of  and zero meal inspiration had hit me hard.</p><p>But here’s the good news: AI is stepping in to rescue us from our mealtime Groundhog Day. Seriously—think of it like having a culinary sidekick who just gets you.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Meet Your New Kitchen BFF: AI Meal Planners\n</h3><p>There are some pretty awesome tools out there helping home cooks shake things up—and they’re smarter than ever. Platforms like ,  (yes, that’s Samsung’s AI-driven app!), and even  are stepping in to give you customized recipe suggestions based on:</p><ul><li><p><em>What’s already in your fridge or pantry</em> (finally a use for that rogue can of chickpeas!)</p></li><li><p> (vegetarian? gluten-free? keto? all set)</p></li><li><p> (spicy and bold or cozy comfort food?)</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How They Actually Work (and Yes, It’s Easy)\n</h3><p>Here’s the magic: You either sync your pantry items (some apps do this with your shopping history) or tell the AI what you’ve got on hand. Then, boom—recipes tailored to your vibe.</p><p>For example, last week I told the Whisk app I had sweet potatoes, black beans, and cilantro, and it hit me back with a killer Southwest stuffed sweet potato idea—with zero scrolling through Pinterest. It even let me adjust for “I don’t want to go to the grocery store today” mode. Absolute win.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Easy Ways to Start Using AI Meal Planning\n</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Try Whisk or Samsung SmartThings Cooking:</strong> These apps are free to download, and you can instantly start plugging in ingredients or syncing grocery lists.</p></li><li><p> Yep, ChatGPT can meal plan too! With the right plugin, it can learn your preferences and suggest weekly meal plans AND shopping lists. Hello, stress-free Sundays.</p></li><li><p> Don’t overhaul your entire week—maybe just start with dinner tonight. Try feeding the AI your favorite go-to ingredients and see what magic it offers up.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Final Taste: You Deserve a Break from \"What’s for Dinner?\"\n</h3><p>Here’s the real talk—cooking should be joyful, not another to-do that drains you. And with AI on your side, you can get back to loving your time in the kitchen. It’s like having a super-organized foodie friend who knows your pantry better than you do and never runs out of ideas.</p><p>No more tuna sandwich weeks, I promise. Let’s give our brains a break and let tech help us fall back in love with home-cooked meals. You in?</p><h2><p>\n  Smart Kitchens Are Listening (And Helping)</p></h2><p><strong>Did you know that nearly 40% of U.S. households now use a smart speaker in the kitchen?</strong> Yep. That means millions of us are casually bossing around Alexa while stirring tomato sauce like we’re on a cooking show. Wild, right?</p><p>If you're anything like me, multitasking in the kitchen can feel like you're juggling flaming spatulas. You’re trying not to overcook the chicken, remember if you already added the cumin, and somehow keep your toddler from raiding the spice rack. It’s chaos with a side of stress. For a long time, I thought “smart kitchens” were just fancy toys for tech bros or something you'd see on HGTV. But let me tell you—these tools are legit lifesavers, especially when you’re short on time, hands, or, ya know, sanity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Are Smart Kitchens Actually Doing?\n</h3><p>Let’s get real. Smart appliances aren’t just beeping at you or tossing timers—</p><ul><li><p><strong>Voice assistants (like Alexa or Google Assistant)</strong> can walk you through recipes step-by-step. No more smudging your phone screen with greasy fingers. Just say, “Hey Google, what’s the next step?” and boom—you’re golden.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart ovens (think Samsung’s connected ovens)</strong> let you preheat or adjust the temperature from your phone. I once started preheating the oven while still at Trader Joe’s. Peak efficiency. Look at me, adulting!</p></li><li><p><strong>Devices like the Amazon Echo Show</strong> even show video tutorials and recipe suggestions as you cook. Much needed when you’ve got recipe block and don't want to Google “how do I know if fish is done” for the fifty-eleventh time.</p></li></ul><p>During my first-ever dinner party, I was legit panicking about timing—getting apps, mains, and dessert all ready without something burning. But with a combo of Alexa reminders, preset cooking times on my oven, and hands-free help from the Echo Show, I actually pulled it off. And get this—people asked me if I had help.  I did. It was Alexa. 😎</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How to Make Your Kitchen Smarter Today\n</h3><p>If you're ready to invite some AI into your kitchen (no apron required), here are a few beginner-friendly ways to start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Get yourself a smart speaker.</strong> Doesn’t need to be top-of-the-line. Even a basic Echo Dot can handle timers, conversions, and recipe questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use a smart plug for your slow cooker or coffee maker.</strong> You’d be surprised how much easier mornings get when you can schedule your brew before even getting out of bed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try one appliance at a time.</strong> Maybe a Wi-Fi-enabled air fryer or a smart oven if you’re feeling fancy. Start small and build as you go.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Bottom Line: Let Tech Take the Stress Off Your Plate\n</h3><p>Here’s the thing—cooking should nourish you, not stress you out. With a few smart tools and voice-controlled pals in the kitchen, you’re not just heating up meals—you’re cooking with confidence, calm, and maybe even a little swagger. So go ahead and let your kitchen listen (for once). It’s about time dinner felt a little more effortless, right?</p><h2><p>\n  From Scraps to Gourmet: AI Recipe Generators</p></h2><p><strong>Did you know that the average household throws away around  they buy?</strong> Yep. That sad half-avocado, lonely carrot, and last scoop of hummus often meet their untimely end in the bin—usually because we just don’t know what to do with them.</p><p>Know that feeling when you open the fridge and think, “Okay... I’ve got kale, rice, and hummus. Now what?” Trust me, I’ve been there—hungry, impatient, and seconds away from ordering delivery. But here’s where the magic of  comes in. And honestly? They’re a total game changer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  When Leftovers Meet Tech Genius\n</h3><p>AI tools like <strong>SuperCook, ChatGPT, and Whisk</strong> are basically your digital sous-chefs. They take whatever ingredients you feed them—literally—and spin up a customized recipe that’s actually edible (and sometimes even impressive!).</p><p>I once had  seven ingredients in my fridge, including wilted spinach and a mystery jar of tahini. I plugged them into ChatGPT with a prompt like, \"Create a healthy vegetarian lunch using spinach, tahini, and quinoa.\" Boom—out popped a delicious warm spinach quinoa salad with a zesty tahini dressing. Not only did I save dinner, but I felt like a kitchen wizard.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Tips to Get Delicious Results Every Time\n</h3><p>AI can do a lot, but it needs a little input love. Here are some quick wins to get better results with recipe generators:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Be specific with your prompt.</strong> Instead of “recipes with rice,” try “healthy, gluten-free dinner with rice, black beans, tomatoes, and carrots.” Give the AI context to cook with.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mention dietary preferences or cuisines.</strong> Craving Thai or need something vegan? Tell it! AI will tailor the recipe vibe to your tastes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t be afraid to remix the idea.</strong> If the output doesn't sound quite right, ask for alternatives: “Can you make this spicier?” or “Can I sub the peanuts with sunflower seeds?”</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Eat Smarter, Waste Less, Feel Like a Pro\n</h3><p>Playing around with AI cooktools doesn’t just help you whip up meals from scraps—it’s an incredible way to , stay on budget, and even learn new cooking skills. Think of it like having a private chef whispering sweet suggestions in your ear...without the price tag. 😉</p><p>So next time your fridge looks like a sad dating profile—“has potential, just needs direction”—reach for your favorite AI buddy. You’ll not only surprise your tastebuds, you might just fall in love with cooking all over again.</p><h2><p>\n  Eating Healthier with Smart Nutrition Features</p></h2><p>Did you know that most of us  we’re eating healthy, but studies show we underestimate our daily calorie intake by up to 30%? Yep. That bowl of granola? Sneakier than it looks. And don’t even get me started on artisanal smoothies.</p><p>I’ve always tried to eat well—lots of veggies, home-cooked meals, the big food-prep Sunday ritual. But I still hit that dreaded . You know the one where your energy nosedives and suddenly a third cup of coffee and a donut is calling your name? So frustrating, right?</p><p>Turns out, I wasn’t fueling my body the way it needed. That’s where AI—and specifically apps like <strong>MyFitnessPal with smart AI features</strong>—came in and seriously changed the game for me.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How AI Gave My Meals a Glow-Up\n</h3><p>What I love about today’s nutrition apps is that they're not just digital food diaries anymore (so 2005). With new AI integrations, these tools have leveled up. Here's how they help:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Track your macros without the math headache:</strong> Just take a pic or scan a barcode and boom—AI breaks down your protein, carbs, fats, and even sugar intake. It's weirdly satisfying.</p></li><li><p> Say you log a bagel with cream cheese. Your app might suggest a whole grain wrap with avocado instead—for more fiber, better fats, and longer-lasting energy. Super helpful when you get stuck in a food rut (hi, me).</p></li><li><p><strong>Allergen + sensitivity alerts:</strong> Some apps now flag ingredients that may not align with your health goals, allergies, or even personal preferences. Planning a gluten-free week? The AI's got you. Lactose-intolerant? It won’t let dairy sneak into your smoothie.</p></li></ul><p>For me, the biggest shift was understanding how much protein I  getting earlier in the day. Once the app flagged it, I started tweaking my breakfast and lunch—hello eggs, hello Greek yogurt—and my energy stopped plummeting mid-afternoon. Wild how small changes make a big impact, right?</p><p>Ready to upgrade your food game? Here are a few AI-powered apps that make nutrition feel less like a chore and more like your foodie BFF:</p><ul><li><p> Great for scanning, logging, and spotting trends across your meals. Now AI-powered with meal recommendations and pattern recognition.</p></li><li><p> Another clean, user-friendly option for meal planning, with a great macro focus and customizable diet plans.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lumen (paired with their device):</strong> Uses your breath (yup, seriously) to tell you if your body’s burning carbs or fat—then suggests what to eat based on your metabolism that day.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Let Tech Be Your Sous-Chef\n</h3><p>Eating healthier doesn’t have to mean obsessing over every bite or reading the fine print on every label. With AI handling the data and decoding your habits, you get to focus on what matters: enjoying your food, feeling amazing, and guilt-free seconds of sweet potato chili (yes please).</p><p>So, if you’ve been feeling stuck, tired, or just trying to figure out what “healthy” really means for  body, try letting smart nutrition tools lend a hand. It's like having a nutritionist in your pocket—minus the lectures.</p><p>And trust me, once you stop crashing mid-day and feel more in tune with your meals? Total game-changer. Your body will thank you with energy, better sleep, and fewer “hangry” moments. Win-win-win.</p><h2><p>\n  Ready to Cook Smarter, Not Harder?</p></h2><p>Did you know the average person spends about <strong>51 minutes a day thinking about what to eat</strong>? Not cooking—just . Yup, nearly an hour lost to fridge-staring and \"What do you want for dinner?\" debates. Sound familiar?</p><p>I used to be that person too. I'd come home after a long day, open up the pantry, and—boom—brain freeze. Too tired to be creative, too hungry to wait for inspiration. And with a picky partner and a gluten-intolerant kid, let’s just say dinnertime wasn’t always joyful. More like a culinary version of Survivor.</p><p>But lately? It’s been a game-changer. I started using a meal planning app powered by AI, and let me tell you—it knows me better than I know  Seriously. It recommends meals based on what’s in my fridge, tracks our allergies and preferences, and even makes a shopping list. Heaven!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  So how can you actually cook ?\n</h3><ul><li><p> Tools like Whisk or Yummly can generate personalized recipes based on your dietary needs and what’s hiding in your fridge. No more avocado roulette.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try a smart kitchen assistant:</strong> Devices like the CHEF iQ smart cooker or an AI-powered smart oven help you cook things perfectly with step-by-step prompts. Overcooked salmon? A thing of the past.</p></li><li><p> Apps like Instacart now suggest what to buy based on your favorite meals and health goals. Your cart starts to look a lot more “wellness wins” and a lot less “snacks from 2007.”</p></li></ul><p>I’m not saying tech replaces good ol’ cooking instincts—but it frees up your mental space, so you can enjoy the fun part: the sizzle, the flavor, the “Oh wow, I made this?” moment. Whether you’re meal prepping for the week, trying to eat healthier, or just need a 20-minute dinner before soccer practice, AI’s got your back.</p><p><strong>So, what’s your first AI-enhanced meal gonna be?</strong> A spicy tofu stir-fry? Keto-friendly tacos? Grandma’s meatballs — but make ’em plant-based? Whatever it is, you’re no longer cooking alone. AI is quietly standing by, ready to nudge you toward better, easier, healthier meals—without the kitchen frustration.</p><p>Take a deep breath, let the tech lend a hand, and get ready to fall back in love with your kitchen. Smarter cooking means more flavor, more time, and way fewer “ugh, what’s for dinner?” sighs. You've got this—and now, you've got AI, too.</p>","contentLength":16431,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RIP CRA - Now what?","url":"https://dev.to/annaspies/rip-cra-now-what-1h9a","date":1751422633,"author":"Anna","guid":179548,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Maybe I'm strange, but I always feel a little sad when an app or framework that has been a regular part of my workflow goes to the great repository in the sky. That was certainly my initial reaction after hearing that Create React App (or CRA to its friends) was being <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deprecated</a>. My second reaction: now what do I use?</p><p>Luckily, the React team put up a <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">list of possible CRA replacements</a> as part of the deprecation announcement, and in this post I'm going to focus on the first option: Next.js. Why? IMO it offers the most features for going above and beyond just a simple migration. But we'll get into that later.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Comparing CRA with Next.js\n</h2><p>If you're new to Next.js, here's a quick breakdown of its 1:1 feature equivalents for CRA users, as well as potential server-side functionality:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Client-side equivalent in Next.js</strong></th><th><strong>Server-side possibility in Next.js</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> (same, supports both modes)</td></tr><tr><td>Full TypeScript setup for both client and server components</td></tr><tr><td>File-based routing in </td><td>App Router with nested layouts and server components</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamic  updates in server components</td></tr><tr><td>Static file serving at </td><td> with built-in image optimization</td></tr><tr><td> or  in a client component</td><td>Fetch data directly in server component, RSC fetch</td></tr><tr><td>Component state with </td><td> in client components ()</td><td>Server-rendered props via RSC + cookies/session context</td></tr><tr><td>Local dev server with Webpack</td><td>Webpack + incremental adoption of Turbopack</td></tr><tr><td>Environment variables in </td><td>Same, plus bundle for the browser with  prefix</td><td>Same, plus runtime env vars via Docker image</td></tr><tr><td>Requires separate Node server</td><td>Built-in API routes ()</td></tr><tr><td>User-installed Jest or Vitest</td><td>User-installed Jest or Vitest (no native test runner)</td></tr><tr><td>CSS with plain files or modules</td><td>Global CSS and CSS Modules supported, built-in code-splitting</td><td>Full support for Tailwind, Sass, PostCSS, and scoped CSS</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The initial setup and much of the configuration of Next.js will seem familiar to CRA users. Like CRA, Next.js has a one-line  command: . For TypeScript users, adding the  flag means your project is automatically configured for TypeScript, much like the  flag for CRA. Both frameworks ship with Webpack, but Next.js also includes <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turbopack</a>, a newer and in most cases more performant bundler from the Next.js team. For testing, CRA uses Jest under the hood, while Next.js leaves it up to the user to choose a testing library.</p><p>The main differences between the two frameworks mainly come down to the features Next.js offers that aren't available in CRA. These can be divided into two categories: performance improvements and developer experience (DX) improvements.</p><p>Performance improvements:</p><ul><li>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for faster initial loads</li><li>Image optimization for responsive, lazy-loaded images</li><li>Built-in code splitting by default at the page level</li><li>Edge and serverless function support</li></ul><ul><li>File-based routing, so no need to manually configure routes</li><li>API routes - build backend logic right in your app</li><li>Built-in support for layouts and nested routing in the App Router</li><li>Next.js Middleware makes A/B testing, i18n, etc. much easier to implement</li></ul><p>Now that we've seen how Next.js compares feature-for-feature with CRA, the next question is: why make the switch at all?</p><p>If you have a legacy app or side project that hasn't been updated in years, you may be wondering why bother migrating if the CRA setup is working? For deployed apps, the answer is vulnerabilities: at some point, you or dependabot will need to update a library with high severity vulnerabilities, and will likely run into the dreaded <code>Conflicting peer dependency</code> error. As CRA's dependencies are no longer being updated, that error is more likely to occur the longer you wait.</p><p>Additionally, you'll need to migrate if you want to get newer versions of core libraries such as TypeScript or React. While React 19 currently works with CRA, TypeScript is sadly stuck at version 4, meaning you won't get the speed or size improvements or expanded ESM support of version 5.</p><p>But the best reason to migrate is to take advantage of Next.js server-side features and built-in optimizations. So, let's explore some migration strategies next.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Migrating an existing CRA app to Next.js with client-side features only\n</h2><p>If you're ready to migrate an existing CRA app to Next.js but want to start with a 1:1 move that keeps your app functioning as a single-page client-side app (SPA), the  directory is the best place to begin. This setup allows you to preserve familiar patterns while getting immediate benefits like built-in routing.</p><p>Let's walk through migrating a simple component; in this case, a minimal login UI from a CRA app:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In Next.js, we would first create , to replace , then move the component mostly as-is to the new file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is still a purely client-side component. You get immediate access to Next.js features like routing without giving up control over how your app behaves. To complete the example, we also need to add a login endpoint under :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Pretty straightforward, with minimal code changes. Of course, in a large codebase, things can get more complex, so if you want to see what a migration like this looks like in practice, see <a href=\"https://github.com/bildungsroman/case-study/commit/255e44254482c1e4a0020e1164659abc3dbeb289\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this commit</a> of a working example app. If you have an existing CRA app that you're ready to migrate to Next.js, you can follow this <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/migrating/from-create-react-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">step-by-step migration guide</a>.</p><p>The migration guide and commit linked above offer examples of straightforward, 1:1 SPA migrations. But to really take advantage of Next.js, let's see what a migration to using server-side rendering (SSR) looks like.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Migrate a SPA to React Server Components\n</h2><p>While migrations are often done out of necessity, they can also serve as an opportunity to make significant performance improvements and modernize a legacy app's architecture. Refactoring an SPA to use server components will reduce your client-side JavaScript bundle size, improving initial load times and your users' experience. Server components also allow for resolving authentication state server-side, which has the added benefit of being more secure while also reducing load times. And the final bonus: server-rendered content is better for search engines, if SEO is important to you. <a href=\"https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">React Server Components</a> go one step further than SSR, allowing parts of the component tree to render only on the server, never reaching the client as JavaScript.</p><p>What does this look like in practice? Let's return to our authentication example, now migrated to the App Router. In a server component like , we use  to access login state directly from the server:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Only the  component remains client-side. This keeps the interactive part of the app lightweight, while moving the auth check to the server where it belongs:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This structure allows the app to render personalized content without requiring a round trip to the client to determine the user's session. It's a small change that brings meaningful performance and security improvements. To see what this looks like in an existing codebase, <a href=\"https://github.com/bildungsroman/case-study/commit/c50dfe3ce02a33137a1055249ade0c8caf99d34e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this commit</a> from the same repository referenced earlier shows a migration from client components to using server-side API routes and middleware.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Stretch goal: implement Partial Prerendering for the best of both worlds\n</h2><p>If you want to go even further into Next.js's experimental features, you can implement <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Partial Prerendering</a> (PPR) in the same component. While React Server Components are great for applications that need real-time dynamic data, and static generation is great for infrequently updated data, such as content from a CMS, PPR is a new feature that gives you the best of both. PPR uses React Suspense to separate dynamic content from static content, allowing Next.js to pre-render the static content at build time, while dynamic content is streamed at runtime from the server.</p><p>Here's an example of our auth component using PPR. First, we'd create a dynamic user component and skeleton:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, using , we designate the dynamic part of our page while allowing the remainder to load as static content:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With just a few tweaks, our legacy CRA auth code has evolved into a modern, flexible component that plays nicely with both static and dynamic rendering.</p><p>So yes, it's always a little sad to say goodbye to an old tool, especially one that's been part of your team's routine. But as we've seen, moving from CRA to Next.js doesn't mean starting over. It just means migrating to a more flexible, more capable way of building React apps.</p>","contentLength":8285,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Temporary Email: Privacy Guardians in the Digital Age","url":"https://dev.to/john_wilson/temporary-email-privacy-guardians-in-the-digital-age-44kn","date":1751422515,"author":"John Wilson","guid":179547,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today's world of increasing information security awareness, more and more people are focusing on online privacy protection. Questions like \"When should I use a temporary email?\" and \"What risks exist when using my real email?\" frequently appear in daily conversations. This article will delve into the value of temporary email addresses, share practical scenarios, and provide security advice to help you better protect your personal privacy in the digital world.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Typical Application Scenarios for Temporary Email\n</h2><p>With the booming development of AI technology, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and various AI writing tools are emerging one after another, most requiring email registration to experience them. However, not every AI product is worth leaving your real email information for.</p><p>: I once had high expectations for a highly recommended AI drawing tool and registered with my real email without hesitation. The product experience was mediocre, but I began receiving product update emails every day. Although unsubscribing is an option, who can guarantee that your email address hasn't been sold to other marketing agencies?</p><p>: First try with a temporary email, and if the product is truly excellent, consider re-registering with your real email – protecting your privacy while not missing out on quality services.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Software Downloads and Trials\n</h3><p>Many software manufacturers adopt a \"free trial\" marketing strategy that seems attractive on the surface but often comes with:</p><ul><li>Frequent reminder emails about the trial period ending soon</li><li>Continuous feature upgrade notifications</li><li>Various \"user research\" and \"product feedback\" requests</li></ul><p>: After downloading an image editing software, my inbox received over 30 related emails in just one month! Experience tells me that temporary email addresses are ideal for these situations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Development and Testing Work\n</h3><p>For programmers, product managers, or testers, temporary emails are essential tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Registration Process Testing</strong>: Verifying the completeness and reliability of email sending functions</li><li><strong>Multi-User Scenario Simulation</strong>: Evaluating system performance under different user conditions</li><li>: Testing key features like email notifications and password resets</li><li>: When creating numerous test accounts is needed</li></ul><p>During product testing phases, you might need to create dozens of test accounts. Using real emails is not only impractical but would also lead to inbox management chaos.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Competitive Analysis Research\n</h3><p>When conducting market research, registering for competitors' services to understand their product strategies and marketing methods is a common practice. Using temporary emails has significant advantages here:</p><ul><li>Effectively protects identity information, avoiding exposure of research intentions</li><li>Specifically observes competitors' email marketing strategies and user communication methods</li><li>Prevents marketing emails from interfering with daily work and personal inboxes</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. One-Time Event Participation\n</h3><p>Online prize drawings, free resource downloads, and webinars usually require providing an email address. These situations are particularly suitable for temporary emails:</p><ul><li>No longer receiving related emails after the event ends, reducing information interference</li><li>Avoiding having your email added to various marketing databases</li><li>Important notifications (such as winning information) are usually communicated through other channels</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Potential Risk Analysis of Using Real Email Addresses\n</h2><p>Many people might think \"it's just a few spam emails,\" but the actual risks far exceed imagination:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Commercial Trading of Email Addresses\n</h3><p>This is the most prevalent risk. Unscrupulous websites may sell user email information to marketing companies, causing your email to appear in countless marketing databases. One of my friends receives hundreds of spam emails daily because of this, making management difficult.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Phishing Email Threats\n</h3><p>When your email is exposed in various databases, the probability of becoming a phishing attack target greatly increases. Scammers will impersonate websites you've registered with, sending fake emails like \"account abnormality\" or \"password about to expire\" to induce clicking on malicious links.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Chain Leakage of Personal Information\n</h3><p>Email addresses are usually associated with other personal information, such as real names and phone numbers. Once an email leaks, it may trigger wider exposure of personal information, constituting privacy security risks.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Decreased Work Efficiency\n</h3><p>Spam email flooding seriously affects normal email processing efficiency. Data shows that professionals may spend 30 minutes or more daily clearing spam emails, which is undoubtedly a waste of time resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Email Security Usage Strategies\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Layered Management Approach\n</h3><p>I recommend adopting a \"layered use\" strategy, rationally allocating services of different importance:</p><ol><li>: Dedicated to the most important services, such as bank accounts, work communications, and main social media</li><li>: Used for general service registrations, such as e-commerce platforms and commonly used software</li><li>: Suitable for one-time needs, test experiences, and trial evaluations</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Choosing Reliable Temporary Email Services\n</h3><p>There are many temporary email services in the market. When choosing, consider these key factors:</p><ul><li>: Ensuring stable access when needed</li><li>: Not recording or leaking email content, protecting user privacy</li><li>: Intuitive and concise interface, convenient and efficient operation</li><li>: Supporting multiple domain choices, providing email favorites functionality</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Practical Application Experience Sharing\n</h2><p>While recently using <a href=\"https://tempmail100.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temp Mail</a> for work, I discovered a particularly practical application scenario:</p><p>When testing the new user registration process for the company, I needed to create multiple test accounts. Previously, when using other temporary email services, I frequently encountered problems like domains being blocked or emails expiring too quickly, causing testing interruptions. This service solved key pain points:</p><ul><li>Provides multiple domain choices, ensuring there are always available options</li><li>Email favorites feature supports long-term retention of test emails</li><li>Fast generation speed, seamlessly integrated into the testing process</li></ul><p>Now, I save commonly used test emails as favorites and call them directly when needed, greatly improving work efficiency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Regular Maintenance Management\n</h3><p>Even if you adopt a layered strategy, you should regularly maintain your email:</p><ul><li>Clean up unnecessary emails, keeping the inbox tidy</li><li>Proactively unsubscribe from mailing lists you no longer follow</li><li>Regularly update email addresses and security settings for important services</li><li>Check suspicious login or registration emails to detect security threats early</li></ul><p>Temporary email, as a simple yet practical technical tool, can effectively protect personal privacy and improve work efficiency in various scenarios. The key is to clearly understand when to use it and when not to.</p><p>Remember this core principle: For services of questionable reliability or only temporary use, choose <a href=\"https://tempmail365.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temporary email</a> for important services used long-term, use your real email.</p><p>In the digital age of information explosion, learning to protect personal privacy has become an essential skill. <a href=\"https://tempmail365.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temporary email</a> may be small, but it can provide an extra layer of protection for your digital life.

It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support.</p><p><strong>Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results</strong></p><ul><li> test (single-core):\n\n<ul></ul></li><li> test (10,000 requests, 100 concurrency):\n\n<ul></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Peak Performance: Understated Power</strong></p><p>Performance is a cornerstone for any web framework. In my prior experiences, achieving high performance often came at the cost of development efficiency and code readability, involving convoluted asynchronous logic and manual memory management. This framework, however, managed to strike an artful balance between these aspects.</p><p>Its core philosophy seems to be \"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" Constructed upon an advanced asynchronous non-blocking I/O model and an optimized event loop, it lays a robust foundation for high-performance operations. When I developed a campus forum API to simulate high-concurrency scenarios, it demonstrated a nearly 70% improvement in QPS (Queries Per Second) and reduced the average response time by half compared to a framework I had used previously. For someone keenly focused on user experience, this was a thrilling outcome.</p><p>Its resource management was equally impressive. Throughout stress tests, memory usage remained consistently low, and CPU utilization was stable. This efficiency stems from its intelligent coroutine scheduling and effective memory management strategies. It doesn't chase speed at the expense of stability but rather aims for sustainable high performance. As an architect once wisely noted, \"True performance is sustained composure, not just a momentary burst.\"</p><p><strong>Smooth Experience: Unadulterated Creation</strong></p><p>If performance represents the hard power of a framework, then the development experience is its soft power, directly impacting developer satisfaction and project timelines. This framework excelled in this domain as well.</p><p>Its API design is remarkably concise, intuitive, and expressive, offering a gentle learning curve. As a student, I was able to begin writing functional modules within a matter of hours, relying solely on the official documentation, which was clear, comprehensive, and of high quality. This ease of adoption is a testament to its well-abstracted yet flexible interfaces and a deep understanding of the developer's mindset.</p><p>Modularity and extensibility are thoughtfully designed. It provides elegant, out-of-the-box solutions for common needs such as logging, parameter validation, and authentication. It leverages a powerful macro system, a feature popular in languages that prioritize efficiency, to generate code at compile time. This significantly reduces boilerplate and enhances code reusability. Defining a RESTful API endpoint, for instance, might require only a few lines of code, with the framework adeptly handling routing, request parsing, and response serialization.</p><p>I also appreciated its support for modern web trends, including native WebSocket capabilities. When tasked with building a real-time campus event notification system, its WebSocket module proved to be both easy to integrate and highly performant, facilitating bidirectional communication without the need for additional external libraries. This is a significant advantage for agile development methodologies and maintaining a unified technology stack.</p><p><strong>A Quiet Comparison: Discerning the Truth</strong></p><p>Throughout my studies, I've encountered a multitude of web frameworks. Some boast vast ecosystems, others offer convenient Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), or excel in specific niche areas. However, this \"unsung hero\" impressed me the most with its exceptional balance between raw performance and developer-centric experience.</p><p>For high-concurrency applications, developers often find themselves needing to fine-tune thread pools, integrate message queues, or implement complex caching mechanisms. This framework, with its robust underlying architecture, frequently allows developers to concentrate primarily on business logic. Its speed is a product of sophisticated design, not achieved by sacrificing code elegance.</p><p>While some frameworks are straightforward to begin with, they can become restrictive as projects scale, often leading to bloated and unwieldy codebases. This framework, with its flexible design philosophy and effective use of metaprogramming, consistently offers concise and maintainable solutions, making the code feel more \"alive\" and adaptable.</p><p><strong>Future Outlook: Journeying with Giants</strong></p><p>As a newcomer to the software development industry, I feel fortunate to have discovered such an outstanding framework so early in my journey. It has not only improved my development efficiency but also broadened my technical horizons and deepened my understanding of what constitutes a high-performance application.</p><p>I am aware that the long-term success of any framework heavily relies on its community and ecosystem. Although it may not yet possess the widespread recognition of established industry giants, I firmly believe that its excellent performance, superior development experience, and forward-thinking design will carve out a significant place for it in the web development landscape, potentially even setting new trends.</p><p>My exploration of this framework has only just begun. However, I have a strong sense that this \"unsung hero\" will become an invaluable partner throughout my career. If you are someone who is curious about pushing the boundaries of technology and unwilling to compromise on quality, I encourage you to explore it. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised, just as I was.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive: The Framework's Core \"Secret Sauce\"</strong></p><p>To truly appreciate its efficiency, one must examine its core architecture. It's not merely a superficial wrapper around existing technologies; it embodies a meticulously crafted design. As an experienced architect once stated, \"An excellent system's elegance often stems from a profound understanding and ultimate application of first principles.\"</p><p>This framework is built using Rust. The inherent memory safety and concurrency advantages of Rust provide a solid foundation for developing high-performance applications. The absence of a garbage collector grants developers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, thereby avoiding common performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, Rust's ownership system eliminates many concurrency-related problems at compile time, which offers significant peace of mind when building high-concurrency servers.</p><p>It deeply integrates the Tokio asynchronous runtime. Tokio, being Rust's most mature and widely adopted asynchronous solution, offers powerful non-blocking I/O capabilities. When an operation is waiting for external resources, such as network requests, it yields system resources to other tasks, thereby enhancing overall concurrency. While reading its source code was a challenging endeavor, it revealed an unwavering commitment to maximizing resource utilization and meticulous attention to detail. The design aims for both \"ease of use\" and \"high efficiency.\"</p><p>It also employs coroutines (or lightweight threads) effectively. Each incoming request is treated as an independent execution unit, collaborating efficiently under the asynchronous runtime environment. This model incurs lower context-switching overhead compared to traditional multi-threading approaches and can support a vast number of concurrent connections. This brought to mind concepts from operating systems courses, validating theoretical knowledge with practical application. True \"speed\" often originates from system-level architectural innovation, not solely from algorithmic optimization.</p>","contentLength":7856,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Better safe than sorry","url":"https://dev.to/adarshmaharjan/better-safe-than-sorry-2c7m","date":1751415015,"author":"Adarsh","guid":179419,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>How to remove a leaked .env file from GitHub permanently...</h2>","contentLength":59,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/adarshmaharjan/-f9p","date":1751414978,"author":"Adarsh","guid":179418,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>How to remove a leaked .env file from GitHub permanently...</h2>","contentLength":59,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gemini CLI: O Agente de IA do Google Para o Terminal dos Desenvolvedores","url":"https://dev.to/ikauedev/gemini-cli-o-agente-de-ia-do-google-para-o-terminal-dos-desenvolvedores-4eg1","date":1751414827,"author":"Kauê Matos","guid":179417,"unread":true,"content":"<p>O Gemini CLI é uma ferramenta inovadora desenvolvida pelo Google que traz o poder do modelo de inteligência artificial Gemini diretamente para o terminal de comandos.

In order to build a culture informed by observability, it must first be easily understood.</p><p>One simple way to do this that many elite teams have embraced is a strategy of using a golden metric to simplify observability.</p><p>A single golden metric can help in surfacing business critical issues. While the specific metric varies product to product depending on the case, selecting a key indicator makes assessing general product health much simpler.</p><p>Netflix Engineering, in their tech blog, outlines how they use Streams per Second (SPS) as their primary service health metric. Since streaming is core to their business, an irregularity in SPS is a strong signal that they’re experiencing a significant problem.</p><p>By embedding this metric into company-wide language, going so far as to categorize all production incidents as “SPS impacting” or “not SPS impacting”, they frame observability as a shared cultural touchstone across teams.</p><p>This clarity is critical. Just like how a doctor relies on pulse and blood pressure as primary indicators of our body’s health, teams can trust a golden metric to get a broad sense of their product’s health.</p><p>However, our doctor probably could run more tests than pulse and blood pressure if they needed to. Similarly, more complex metrics inform deeper investigation.</p><p>This is likely too product specific to generalize, but ideally for these smaller metrics, the reasoning behind following a metric should ideally be largely understandable to non-technical team members. This opens up access to our source of truth (more on this later).</p><p>Unfortunately, even well-intentioned teams can sabotage their observability culture through alert fatigue. When every service anomaly triggers a page, teams quickly learn to ignore or delay responding to alerts, eroding trust in your team's monitoring systems.</p><p>The golden metric approach directly combats this by establishing clear hierarchy: alerts tied to your core business metric demand immediate attention, while secondary metrics can trigger notifications that are reviewed during regular business hours. This prevents the all-too-common scenario where engineers become numb to constant noise, ultimately missing the signals that actually matter for user experience and business impact.</p><p>When simplified, metrics and dashboards become more easily referenced, conversationally and otherwise, building a foundation for observability minded decision making across the organization.</p><p>*<em>Monitoring Embedded in Rituals\n*</em>\nThere’s no way to be randomly attentive to observability.</p><p>As workloads increase, vibe-based investment in telemetry metrics ends up just becoming convenience-based. In order to be proactive, it’s useful to embed consideration of observability into defined rituals.</p><p>Stand-ups, retros, and incident reviews are all rituals that can be used as an opportunity to survey dashboards, key metrics, and relevant traces.</p><p>GitLab showcases the power of this approach through their experience operationalizing Observability-Based Performance Testing. Their aim was to embed observability culture deeply into operations to proactively and systematically identify potential performance problems.</p><p>In an initial implementation, they primarily focused on adapting rituals to promote observability culture. In their canary group, 5 minutes of daily standup was carved out to scan dashboards and cut tickets for any anomalies.</p><p>They attributed this simple discipline as being responsible for “maintaining a 99.999% uptime during 10x growth period” and consistently meeting performance KPIs. A testament to how consistently proactive observability practices enable performance at scale.</p><p>Non-event based rituals can be used as well. Adopting Observability as Code (OaC) intuitively ingrains observability changes into existing development workflows, ensuring they are reviewed and well documented like a code contribution.</p><p>Some teams even go so far as to weave observability directly into the service of their core product. For example, teams like Ritual use triggers in their feature flags to tie components of their product to real-time monitors.</p><p>Although each team’s implementation will differ, establishing consistent observability routines serve to build a more proactive culture, shifting teams towards prevention rather than firefighting.</p><p>*<em>Telemetry is the source of truth\n*</em>\nWithout telemetry grounding every conversation about product usage and user behavior, teams often fall back on subjective assumptions. While anecdotal feedback has its place, the overhead of reconciling opinions simply isn’t worth it, and risks producing decisions that don’t align with actual customer needs..</p><p>That’s why telemetry must be treated as a first-class citizen: the definitive source of truth for an organization to rely on.</p><p>Stripe emphasizes this point in their AWS blog detailing their transition from a traditional time-series database to cloud-hosted Prometheus and Grafana for storing observability metrics.</p><p>One key decision to note about the migration process is that Stripe didn’t just switch metrics from one service to another and expect their engineers to adapt overnight. They recognized that rapid, mandatory migration would risk damaging their observability culture and undermine the perceived reliability and importance of these metrics.</p><p>Instead, they opted to write metrics to both the old and new services simultaneously, asking engineering teams to manually verify parity. They gradually built confidence using team-wide trainings, internal documentation practices, office hours, and internal champions, ensuring that respect for observability as the trusted source of truth endured across their engineering team.</p><p>This principle even extends beyond engineering teams.</p><p>As the definitive source of truth for product usage, observability metrics are equally critical to technical support, product, and customer success teams. By championing observability as a shared source of truth, every team gains a powerful tool to advocate effectively on level footing.</p><p>By consistently applying a unified, metrics-driven view as the single source of truth, observability culture empowers an entire organization to discuss product usage in lock-step and maintain cohesive, objective communication across all functions.</p><p>Observability culture is not a one-time project, but an evolving mindset.</p><p>Across these companies, despite differing implementations, the principles remain consistent: prioritize obvious metrics, embed monitoring into rituals, and treat telemetry as the ultimate source of truth.</p><p>Netflix, Stripe, and GitLab earned their reputations as elite engineering organizations partly because they mastered this culture. Their systems reliability and product stability at scale show that an investment in observability culture is one of the highest-leverage moves any team can make.</p>","contentLength":7967,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Playing with Stemming","url":"https://dev.to/erikhatcher/playing-with-stemming-5cad","date":1751406297,"author":"Erik Hatcher","guid":179331,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Playground \"unit test\" technique\n</h2><p>Before we get into the textual analysis stemming topic, I want to share a different way of displaying search results in a playground.

It executes a synchronous function for you and automatically catches any exceptions, wrapping the outcome in a .</li></ul><p><strong>Why is this better than try-catch?</strong> It transforms unpredictable runtime exceptions into a predictable return value. Your function’s signature declares that it can fail, and the caller must handle that possibility. There are no hidden exceptions waiting to crash your program.</p><p>Let’s write a parsing function that is truly exception-free.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Result: 200\nFailed to parse: FormatException: Invalid radix-10 number at character 1\nHello!\n^\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The  Outcome: Taming Asynchronous Failures\n</h3><p>An  outcome combines the concepts of  and . It’s a box that represents a value that will resolve in the future to either an  or an . It’s the ultimate tool for robust asynchronous pipelines, as it handles both network/IO exceptions and logical failures.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Big Payoff: Building an Unbreakable Pipeline\n</h2><p>Let’s put it all together. Imagine a common real-world scenario:</p><p>For a given user ID, fetch the user’s configuration data from an API, parse it as JSON, and then safely extract a deeply nested, optional setting: <code>config.notifications.sound</code>.</p><p>This process can fail at every single step:</p><ul><li>The network request to fetch  could fail (no internet, 404, etc.).</li><li>The response body might not be valid JSON.</li><li>The JSON might be valid, but the  key could be missing.</li><li>The  key could be missing.</li><li>The  key could be missing.</li></ul><p>Here’s how you’d build this logic robustly with outcomes from the <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/df_safer_dart\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">df_safer_dart</a> package.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Define the failable operations using outcomes\n</h3><p>We wrap our primitive operations, letting the outcome types handle the error context.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Chain them together into a beautiful, linear flow\n</h3><p>Now we compose these functions. We’ll use  to chain operations. If any step produces an , all subsequent  calls in the chain are automatically skipped.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Execute and handle the final result\n</h3><p>Finally, we run our pipeline and use  to handle the final outcome in a type-safe way.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Processing User ID: 1\n  -&gt; Success: Sound setting is chime.mp3\n\nProcessing User ID: 2\n  -&gt; Success: Sound setting was not specified.\n\nProcessing User ID: 3\n  -&gt; Success: Sound setting was not specified.\n\nProcessing User ID: 4\n  -&gt; Failure: An error occurred: Exception: User Not Found\n\nProcessing User ID: 5\n  -&gt; Failure: An error occurred: Exception: User Not Found\n</code></pre></div><p>This is the power of outcome-based design in Dart. The  function is a clean, declarative, and robust description of a complex operation. Every potential point of failure is handled gracefully and implicitly by the outcome wrappers. You write the code for the ideal scenario, and the outcomes take care of the messy reality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why You Should Use This Pattern\n</h2><ol><li><strong>Eliminates Error-Prone Boilerplate:</strong> You no longer write  or . This removes entire classes of common bugs.</li><li><strong>Explicitness and Predictability:</strong> Failures are not hidden exceptions; they are predictable values encoded in the type system. You are forced to handle them.</li><li> You build complex operations from small, simple, and independently testable functions.</li><li> Your code describes what you want to achieve (the happy path), not the low-level mechanics of how you’re avoiding crashes.</li><li> For the critical parts of your application, this pattern creates pipelines that don’t just handle errors — they are fundamentally designed around them, making them resilient by construction.</li></ol><p>To get started with these powerful patterns in your own Dart or Flutter projects, check out the <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/df_safer_dart\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">df_safer_dart</a> package on pub.dev.</p>","contentLength":6029,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Domain Mapping Architecture（1751405750066100）","url":"https://dev.to/member_a5799784/domain-mapping-architecture1751405750066100-262p","date":1751405752,"author":"member_a5799784","guid":179327,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

In one project, delivered by a software house, we had to fully refactor it before going live due to excessive domain, pass-through, shared data, and content coupling. These interdependencies made the services fragile and undermined their autonomy, scalability, and maintainability.</p><p>Understanding the different forms of coupling and their implications is essential for designing robust and scalable microservice systems.</p><p>Before we explore the types of coupling, let’s understand how components communicate in different architectural styles.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Component Communication: In-Process vs. Inter-Process\n</h3><p>In monolithic systems, modules interact within the same process, sharing memory, objects, and direct calls. This in-process communication is fast, reliable, and flexible. Although coupling exists between modules, developers can manage them more easily since everything resides in the same space and they can coordinate changes directly.</p><p>In contrast, microservices-based architectures run each service in separate processes, often in distributed environments. Inter-process communication occurs over the network using REST APIs, asynchronous events, and gRPC, among others. This introduces challenges such as latency, network failures, versioning, and observability, requiring well-defined contracts and service decoupling. </p><p>Thus, while coupling in monolithic systems is more tolerable, it can directly compromise system autonomy, scalability, and resilience in microservices.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How Communication Affects Coupling in Microservices\n</h3><p>The way services or modules communicate determines the type and severity of coupling. In monoliths, content coupling or shared data coupling is common (we’ll discuss these later), as modules can access each other’s internal structures directly.</p><p>In microservices, the ideal is to maintain loose domain coupling, where services depend only on public, stable contracts, such as APIs or events, and never on internal logic or data structures. This separation preserves service autonomy and prevents cascading side effects.</p><p>Now that we understand the different communication contexts and their impact on coupling, let’s examine the main types of coupling.</p><p>Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between two modules or services and how much one must know or rely on the other to function properly. The lower the coupling, the greater the service autonomy and flexibility.</p><p>Not all coupling is inherently bad; eliminating it completely is unfeasible in real-world systems. The goal is to reduce unnecessary or harmful forms of coupling as much as possible.</p><p> presents the four main types of coupling that can occur between microservices, ordered from the most desirable (low coupling) to the least desirable (high coupling).</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7trvbcatpr1ez4a8vgvz.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7trvbcatpr1ez4a8vgvz.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: Types of coupling in order of increasing dependency\" width=\"602\" height=\"201\"></a> Types of coupling in order of increasing dependency</p><p>The most common types of coupling in microservices are domain coupling, pass-through coupling, shared data coupling, and content coupling, which are ordered in increasing dependency. They are organized from the most desirable (low coupling) to the least desirable (high coupling).</p><p>Designing effective microservices requires careful attention to these forms of dependency and applying best practices to mitigate them, such as using asynchronous events, well-defined APIs, and clear separation of responsibilities. Next, we analyze each of these types, starting with domain coupling.</p><p>Domain coupling occurs when one microservice directly depends on another to perform a business function. It is a common and acceptable type of dependency in microservices since each service handles a specific business domain. Communication between services is natural to fulfill broader system requirements. For example, in a digital library system, a Loan service might need to query a User service to obtain user details such as name, email, address, and the Catalog service to get book details.  illustrates domain coupling between the loans, users, and catalog services.</p><p>The Loan service is domain-coupled with both the User and Catalog services. The Catalog service is also domain-coupled with the Loan service, while the User service remains independent and has no domain coupling to other services.</p><p>It is worth noting that domain coupling becomes particularly problematic when the boundaries of responsibility between services are not clearly defined. In many projects, the lack of explicit domain modeling leads to situations where one service depends on rules or decisions belonging to another or, worse, replicates them in parallel. This results in data inconsistencies, duplicated logic, semantic coupling, and difficulty evolving the system.</p><p>Without clear boundaries, what would be a natural coupling, such as querying data from a neighboring domain, becomes a fragile and dysfunctional link that requires coordinated deployments, increases the risk of regressions, and undermines service autonomy. In the long run, the system loses the benefits of modularity and tends to become a distributed monolith, where everything depends on everything else.</p><p>Therefore, defining business domains, as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) proposed, is fundamental to ensure that domain coupling remains healthy and controlled.</p><p>Pass-through Coupling occurs when a service passes data to another, not because it needs the data itself, but because a third service will use it.  illustrates a pass-through coupling scenario where the delivery of a book needs to notify other users about its availability via email.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffn7gjbf181y3clbyv73d.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffn7gjbf181y3clbyv73d.png\" alt=\"Pass-through coupling\" width=\"621\" height=\"92\"></a> Pass-through coupling</p><p>The loan service queries the User service to retrieve user emails and passes them to the Notification service. The Loan service merely forwards the user data to the notification service without using it directly, creating a pass-through coupling.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Drawbacks of Pass-Through coupling\n</h4><p>Pass-through coupling may initially seem harmless, but it introduces several architectural issues that undermine distributed systems’ cohesion, maintainability, and evolution. The harms of pass-through coupling are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increase in unnecessary coupling:</strong> The intermediary service, in this case, the Loan service, does not need the data for itself, yet it becomes dependent on the format, semantics, and contract of data that belongs to the Notification service. As a result, changes in the source (User service) or the destination (Notification service) can break the intermediary service (Loan service).</p></li><li><p><strong>Violation of the single responsibility principle:</strong> The intermediary service starts handling responsibilities outside its domain, merely to satisfy the needs of another service. This leads to a loss of cohesion, as the service becomes too aware of foreign domains.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unnecessary exposure of internal details:</strong> Internal data from one service, such as email structure or addresses, is leaked to another service, even if that service doesn’t use it directly. This increases the risk of abstraction leakage and breaks encapsulation.</p></li><li><p> Changes to how data is represented or used now affect three services instead of two: the original producer (User service), the final consumer (Notification service), and the intermediary (loan service). This increases maintenance costs and the risk of regressions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unnecessary complexity in the data flow:</strong> The data path becomes longer and harder to trace. Understanding where the data came from and why it is there becomes more challenging, complicating debugging, observability, and auditing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing and isolation become harder:</strong> Since the intermediary service now depends on the data and contracts of two other services, its tests must mock or simulate more external behaviors, making them more fragile and time-consuming.</p></li></ul><p>Pass-through coupling violates the principles of modularity and service autonomy. It causes a service to become responsible for data and contracts that do not belong to its domain, making the system more rigid, fragile, and difficult to evolve.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  How can we avoid pass-through coupling?\n</h4><p>A viable alternative would be for the Loan service to forward only the IDs of the users waiting for the book delivery to the Notification service. The Notification service would then be responsible for querying the User service to retrieve the corresponding email addresses.  illustrates this alternative.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2un1pf2xosdgubekynz7.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2un1pf2xosdgubekynz7.png\" alt=\"Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling\" width=\"371\" height=\"242\"></a> Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling</p><p>To avoid temporal coupling, a topic that will be addressed later, we can adopt the same logic of interaction between services, but use asynchronous communication via a message broker instead of direct calls.  illustrates this approach.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8bgv6bjmujwa3369gwxs.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8bgv6bjmujwa3369gwxs.png\" alt=\"Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling using message brokers\" width=\"335\" height=\"302\"></a> Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling using message brokers</p><p>As we have seen, pass-through coupling introduces unnecessary dependencies by making a service intermediate data that does not fall under its responsibility. Now, let’s examine shared data coupling.</p><p>At an even more concerning level, shared data coupling occurs when two or more services directly share the same data source, compromising the independence and isolation of functionalities.  illustrates a shared data coupling.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9ivnxr0dgi3stvmkgr3d.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9ivnxr0dgi3stvmkgr3d.png\" alt=\"Shared data coupling\" width=\"301\" height=\"205\"></a> Shared data coupling</p><p>Using the previous scenario where users on the waiting list must be notified of a book delivery, shared data coupling would arise if the Notification service accessed the User service’s database directly to retrieve email addresses.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Drawbacks of shared data coupling\n</h4><p>The main problems associated with shared data coupling are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Loss of service autonomy:</strong> When two or more services access the same data source, be it a database, memory, or shared file system, they are no longer truly autonomous. As a result, any change to the data schema can impact multiple services simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fragility in structural changes:</strong> Since services share the physical data structure, changes such as renaming columns, adding indexes, or modifying constraints require team coordination. This makes independent and safe service evolution more difficult.</p></li><li><p> It becomes nearly impossible to version data independently per service, as all services are tied to the same model and schema. This limits practices such as controlled migrations or safe rollbacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concurrency and integrity conflicts:</strong> Different services may attempt to update the same data simultaneously without orchestration or control logic. This can result in inconsistencies, data loss, or transactional corruption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased testing and deployment complexity:</strong> Integration testing and deployments become more difficult, as a change in one service may require regression testing in all other services that share the data. This leads to tighter organizational coupling, delays, and increased risk in production environments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unintentional exposure of internal structures:</strong> Sharing a data source often reveals implementation details such as relationships and normalization. This can result in misuse, duplicated logic, and inconsistent interpretations of the data across services.</p></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  When shared data coupling may be accepted\n</h4><p>Shared data coupling is one of the most problematic forms of coupling, as it violates the principle of service autonomy. Despite the risks, shared data coupling can be tolerated in specific scenarios, such as reading static data, such as lists of usernames, countries, or even cities, provided this information is relatively stable and rarely changes. However, services should never directly access another service’s database, as when the Notification service accesses the User service’s database.</p><p>In situations like the country list example, a more appropriate approach would be to expose this data through a shared cache, such as Redis, thus preserving the independence between services.</p><p>Next, we will examine content coupling, which is considered the most critical among all coupling types.</p><p>This is the most undesirable type of coupling. It occurs when an external service directly accesses the internal data of another service, modifying its internal state while completely bypassing the API or business logic responsible for protecting that access.  illustrates this scenario.</p><p>Using our digital library case study, this would be equivalent to the Payment service directly accessing the loans table to update the status field to “Regularized” after a fine is paid without calling the Loan service’s API, which should be responsible for validating and applying this change.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Drawbacks of content coupling\n</h3><p>The main consequences of content coupling are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Violation of encapsulation:</strong> The consuming service bypasses the business logic of the service that owns the data, breaking domain boundaries and allowing changes without validation or control.</p></li><li><p><strong>High risk of regressions:</strong> Any change in the internal structure, such as field names, data types, or business rules, can silently break the consuming service. Local tests may fail to catch these issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inability to evolve safely:</strong> The service that owns the data becomes constrained, as it can no longer refactor its internal structure without directly affecting other services. This creates hidden bidirectional coupling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Difficulty in tracing and auditing:</strong> Since changes occur outside the official API, logs, events, and traces become inconsistent. Another service may modify the data without the service owner even realizing it.</p></li></ul><p>Even in emergencies we must avoid the content coupling. Communication between services should always occur through well-defined public interfaces that encapsulate business rules and ensure data consistency. Otherwise, the system becomes fragile, difficult to maintain, and prone to errors that are hard to diagnose.</p><p>Temporal coupling occurs when a service depends on another being available at the exact moment of interaction for a functionality to complete successfully. Unlike logical coupling types such as domain, pass-through, content, or shared data coupling, temporal coupling is related to runtime availability.</p><p>An example would be the Loan service making a synchronous HTTP call to the User service to verify if the user is active before completing a book checkout. The loan process is blocked or fails if the User service is unavailable or experiencing high latency. Figure 8 illustrates a synchronous call to the User service from the Loan service.</p><p>Temporal coupling is not always harmful, but it is essential to recognize its presence. In scenarios where a sequence of microservices communicates synchronously, the challenges of this type of coupling tend to intensify, potentially impacting the system’s scalability and resilience.  presents a blocking, synchronized network call.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2u8fv53lgvftdbvsumae.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2u8fv53lgvftdbvsumae.png\" alt=\"Loan service makes a synchronous call to the user service\" width=\"561\" height=\"92\"></a> Loan service makes a synchronous call to the user service</p><p>One way to reduce temporal coupling is to adopt asynchronous, event-based communication using a broker such as Kafka or RabbitMQ. In addition, it is essential to apply fault-tolerance best practices to mitigate the effects of this type of coupling, such as circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, and degraded responses. The use of local or distributed caching, as well as the separation of critical and non-critical flows, also helps prevent non-essential functionalities from blocking the main operation.</p><p>Designing microservices requires awareness of the different types of coupling, how they arise, and how to mitigate them. Understanding coupling types such as domain, pass-through, shared data, content, and temporal is essential to ensure autonomy, scalability, and maintainability in distributed architectures.</p><p>While certain coupling levels, such as domain coupling, are inevitable, the goal should always be to minimize unnecessary coupling by favoring well-defined contracts, asynchronous event-driven communication, fault tolerance, and proper encapsulation of each service’s responsibilities.</p><p>By correctly identifying the type of coupling involved in an interaction and applying the appropriate strategies to reduce it, we can build more resilient, evolvable systems aligned with the principles of service-oriented architecture.

No epicentro dessa revolução, os Modelos de Linguagem de Grande Escala (LLMs), como GPT-4 e Gemini 2.5, emergem como ferramentas com capacidades sem precedentes para automatizar tarefas cognitivas, gerar conteúdo e interagir com usuários de forma fluida. No entanto, a verdadeira promessa da IA em ambientes corporativos não reside apenas no poder intrínseco desses modelos, mas em sua capacidade de se integrar e operar de forma harmoniosa dentro dos complexos ecossistemas de software já existentes.</p><p>Esta disciplina, em sua jornada, explorou como a engenharia de prompts nos permite dialogar com esses modelos, extraindo respostas inteligentes e direcionadas. Agora, avançamos para o próximo nível: entender como a IA pode transcender a mera geração de texto para se tornar um agente ativo e estratégico em um ambiente de negócios. A chave para essa evolução está na  – a capacidade de LLMs e outros modelos de IA se comunicarem e colaborarem com sistemas externos, acessando dados, executando ações e orquestrando fluxos de trabalho complexos. Este artigo desvendará os desafios e as soluções para essa integração, com foco em padrões como o <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>, e explorará as vastas oportunidades, bem como os riscos inerentes, que surgem quando a inteligência artificial se conecta plenamente ao ambiente operacional das empresas.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Fragmentação dos LLMs Isolados e as Limitações das APIs Tradicionais\n</h2><p>A ascensão dos  (LLMs) como o GPT-4 e o Gemini 2.5 tem revolucionado a forma como concebemos a interação humano-máquina e a automação de tarefas cognitivas. A capacidade de gerar texto coerente, traduzir idiomas, sumarizar informações e até mesmo codificar tem aberto um leque de oportunidades em diversos setores, desde o atendimento ao cliente até a análise de dados complexos. <strong>No artigo anterior, exploramos em profundidade a Engenharia de Prompt, desvendando como a formulação cuidadosa de instruções e contextos é crucial para extrair o máximo valor desses modelos. Vimos que um LLM, por mais poderoso que seja, depende da qualidade do prompt para gerar respostas precisas e relevantes.</strong> No entanto, a euforia em torno do poder intrínseco desses modelos muitas vezes obscurece um desafio fundamental: a sua <strong>interoperabilidade e integração efetiva</strong> em ecossistemas de software já existentes. Um LLM, por mais eficaz que seja em gerar texto a partir de um prompt, raramente opera em um vácuo. Para que seu potencial seja plenamente explorado em um ambiente de negócios, ele precisa se comunicar de forma fluida e eficiente com bancos de dados, sistemas de CRM, ERPs, APIs de terceiros e uma miríade de outras aplicações.</p><p>A utilização de LLMs de forma isolada, ainda que útil para prototipagem e tarefas pontuais, rapidamente atinge suas limitações em cenários empresariais complexos. Considere, por exemplo, um  de atendimento ao cliente que utiliza um LLM para gerar respostas. Se esse LLM, mesmo com prompts otimizados, não puder acessar o histórico de compras do cliente, o status de um pedido ou informações de estoque em tempo real, sua utilidade será significativamente mitigada. Ele se torna uma ferramenta de comunicação genérica, incapaz de fornecer assistência personalizada e precisa, frustrando tanto o cliente quanto a empresa. Essa desconexão revela a insuficiência de uma abordagem \"\" superficial, onde o LLM é visto apenas como uma <strong>caixa preta de texto-para-texto</strong>, sem considerar as <strong>complexas interações que definem um processo de negócio real</strong>.</p><p>As APIs (<em>Application Programming Interfaces</em>) tradicionais, embora sejam o pilar da conectividade na era digital, também apresentam desafios significativos quando se trata de integrar LLMs de forma sofisticada. Enquanto as APIs permitem a comunicação entre diferentes softwares, elas geralmente são projetadas para requisições e respostas estruturadas, com formatos de dados predefinidos e esquemas rígidos. A natureza fluida e contextualmente rica da linguagem natural, que é a base dos LLMs, muitas vezes não se encaixa perfeitamente nesses modelos. Isso leva a um esforço considerável no desenvolvimento de \"\" e \"\" entre o LLM e as APIs existentes, o que pode introduzir latência, complexidade de manutenção e um alto custo de desenvolvimento. Além disso, a gestão do contexto conversacional, essencial para interações significativas com LLMs, é frequentemente negligenciada ou implementada de forma  nessas integrações, limitando a capacidade do LLM de manter uma \"\" da conversa. <strong>Se na Engenharia de Prompt focamos em como o LLM  instruções para gerar texto, nesta aula, voltamos nossa atenção para como o LLM pode  e  informações de sistemas externos para realizar ações concretas e acessar dados relevantes.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  O Modelo Context Protocol (MCP): Um Paradigma para a Interoperabilidade de LLMs\n</h2><p>Diante dos desafios impostos pela fragmentação dos LLMs isolados e pelas limitações das APIs tradicionais, emerge a necessidade de um padrão robusto para a interoperabilidade, capaz de orquestrar a comunicação entre LLMs e sistemas externos de maneira eficiente e contextualizada. É nesse cenário que o <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> se apresenta como uma solução promissora. O MCP não é apenas mais uma API; <strong>ele representa uma arquitetura conceitual e um conjunto de convenções projetadas para otimizar a interação de LLMs com recursos externos, habilitando-os a atuar como agentes inteligentes em ecossistemas de software complexos</strong>. A sua essência reside na capacidade de fornecer aos LLMs o contexto necessário para que possam não apenas gerar texto, mas também tomar decisões informadas e executar ações no mundo real.</p><p>No cerne do MCP está a ideia de que um LLM pode ser mais do que um gerador de linguagem. Ele pode se tornar um \"\" para um agente de IA, capaz de interagir com ferramentas, acessar informações e modificar o estado de sistemas externos. Imagine um LLM que não só responde a perguntas, mas também pode, por exemplo, consultar um banco de dados de clientes, fazer uma reserva de voo via uma API de viagens, ou até mesmo gerar um relatório financeiro baseado em dados extraídos de um sistema ERP. Para que isso seja possível, o LLM precisa de um mecanismo padronizado para \"\" quais ferramentas estão disponíveis, como usá-las, e como interpretar os resultados de suas chamadas. O MCP fornece essa ponte crucial, definindo um vocabulário comum e um fluxo de comunicação que permite aos LLMs interagir com funcionalidades externas de forma programática. Isso é um salto qualitativo em relação às integrações onde o LLM apenas produz texto para ser processado por outro sistema.</p><p>A arquitetura do MCP envolve a representação de \"\" e \"\" que os LLMs podem invocar. Um recurso <strong>pode ser um banco de dados, um serviço web, ou até mesmo outro modelo de IA</strong> especializado em uma tarefa específica (como reconhecimento de imagem ou análise de sentimentos). As ferramentas, por sua vez, são as <strong>operações ou funções que podem ser executadas nesses recursos</strong>. O MCP define como essas ferramentas são descritas para o LLM, permitindo que ele \"\" a ferramenta mais apropriada para uma determinada tarefa e \"\" os parâmetros necessários para executá-la. Por exemplo, se um LLM precisa obter a temperatura atual de uma cidade, o MCP poderia expor uma ferramenta \"\" com um parâmetro \"\". O LLM, ao receber uma requisição de temperatura, identificaria a necessidade de usar essa ferramenta, extrairia o nome da cidade da requisição do usuário, e formataria a chamada para a ferramenta de acordo com o protocolo. Essa abordagem modular e padronizada simplifica o desenvolvimento e a manutenção de sistemas baseados em LLMs, promovendo a reutilização e a escalabilidade. <strong>A Engenharia de Prompt, neste contexto, se torna a chave para instruir o LLM sobre o \"\" para selecionar a ferramenta correta e para \"\" a intenção do usuário em uma chamada de função estruturada que o MCP pode processar.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Análise de Cenários de Integração: Casos de Sucesso e Desafios Reais\n</h2><p>A adoção do <em>Model Context Protoco*l (MCP) e de abordagens similares para a interoperabilidade de LLMs tem gerado casos de sucesso notáveis, mas também expõe desafios inerentes à complexidade da integração de IA em ambientes de negócios. Um exemplo clássico de sucesso é a **automação do atendimento ao cliente</em>*, onde LLMs integrados via MCP podem acessar bases de conhecimento, históricos de clientes e sistemas de gerenciamento de pedidos. Em vez de apenas responder perguntas frequentes de forma genérica, esses sistemas podem, por exemplo, verificar o status de uma entrega, iniciar um processo de devolução ou até mesmo agendar uma chamada com um atendente humano para casos mais complexos, tudo isso de forma autônoma e contextualmente rica. Isso se traduz em maior eficiência operacional e melhor experiência do cliente. Empresas como a <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com.br/blog/advanced-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk</a> e a <a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/campaign/ai-metrics-guide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intercom</a> têm explorado ativamente essa integração, mostrando o potencial de LLMs para transcender a simples automação e oferecer interações verdadeiramente inteligentes.</p><p>Outro cenário promissor é a <strong>otimização de processos de negócios</strong>, especialmente em áreas como finanças e logística. Um LLM, habilitado pelo MCP, pode ser integrado a sistemas de ERP para analisar dados de vendas, identificar tendências, e até mesmo sugerir ajustes em cadeias de suprimentos. Por exemplo, um LLM poderia analisar dados históricos de vendas e, ao identificar uma anomalia, consultar um sistema de previsão de demanda para propor uma alteração no estoque, comunicando essa sugestão a um gerente via um sistema de notificação. Essa capacidade de interligar dados e ações em diferentes sistemas, mediada por um LLM, demonstra o potencial transformador da IA na tomada de decisões operacionais. A <a href=\"https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/bibin-baby/2025/06/18/ai-powered-ibm-business-automation-workflow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM</a> e a <a href=\"https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SAP</a> têm liderado esforços para integrar LLMs em suas plataformas de automação de processos, vislumbrando um futuro onde a inteligência artificial se torna um componente central da inteligência de negócios.</p><p>No entanto, a jornada da interoperabilidade não está isenta de . Um dos maiores é a <strong>confiabilidade e a \"\" dos LLMs</strong>. Mesmo com o MCP fornecendo as ferramentas corretas, o LLM ainda pode, ocasionalmente, gerar respostas incorretas ou inventar informações, especialmente em cenários complexos ou com dados ambíguos. Isso exige a implementação de mecanismos robustos de <a href=\"https://dev.to/vinicius3w/etica-e-privacidade-na-era-da-ia-dilemas-oportunidades-e-o-futuro-da-governanca-no-cenario-de-f48\"><strong>validação e revisão humana</strong></a>, especialmente em aplicações críticas. A <strong>segurança e a privacidade dos dados</strong> também representam um desafio colossal. Ao permitir que LLMs acessem e manipulem dados sensíveis, é imperativo garantir que todas as interações estejam em conformidade com regulamentações como a  e a , e que haja salvaguardas contra vazamentos e acessos não autorizados. A auditoria das interações do LLM e a implementação de <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/access-management/role-based-access-control-rbac/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">controles de acesso baseados em funções (RBAC)</a> são cruciais. Além disso, a <strong>complexidade de design e depuração</strong> de sistemas baseados em agentes de IA pode ser assustadora. A depuração de um erro que ocorre na interação entre um LLM, um recurso externo e a lógica de negócios exige ferramentas sofisticadas e um profundo entendimento de todo o pipeline de dados.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Design Conceitual de Ferramentas e Recursos MCP: Praticando a Orquestração\n</h2><p>Para aprofundar a compreensão sobre o  (MCP) e sua aplicação prática, é fundamental exercitar o design conceitual de ferramentas e recursos que um LLM poderia utilizar. Imagine um cenário onde estamos construindo um agente de IA para um sistema de gestão de projetos. Este agente precisa ser capaz de realizar tarefas como <strong>criar novas tarefas, atualizar o status de tarefas existentes, atribuir tarefas a membros da equipe, e consultar prazos</strong>. Para que o LLM execute essas ações, precisamos expor um conjunto de ferramentas e recursos que ele possa invocar.</p><p>Primeiramente, identificaríamos os  que o LLM precisaria acessar. Nesse caso, o principal recurso seria o <strong>Sistema de Gerenciamento de Projetos (SGP)</strong>, que armazena todas as informações sobre tarefas, projetos e membros da equipe. Esse SGP poderia ser um software como Jira, Trello, ou uma base de dados interna. O MCP então definiria como o LLM \"\" esse recurso, talvez como uma representação de esquema JSON que descreve as entidades (tarefas, projetos, usuários) e seus atributos. Essa descrição é crucial para que o LLM possa entender a estrutura dos dados que irá manipular.</p><p>Em seguida, conceberíamos as  que o LLM pode usar para interagir com o SGP. Cada ferramenta seria uma função específica que o LLM pode \"\". Por exemplo:</p><ul><li><strong><code>create_task(project_id: str, task_name: str, description: \"str, assignee_id: Optional[str], due_date: Optional[str]) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Esta ferramenta permitiria ao LLM criar uma nova tarefa em um projeto específico, com parâmetros para o nome da tarefa, descrição, responsável e prazo. O LLM precisaria extrair essas informações da requisição do usuário.\"</li><li><strong><code>update_task_status(task_id: str, new_status: str) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Uma ferramenta para atualizar o status de uma tarefa (e.g., \"\", \"\", \"\"), exigindo o ID da tarefa e o novo status.</li><li><strong><code>assign_task(task_id: str, assignee_id: str) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Permite atribuir uma tarefa a um membro da equipe, necessitando do ID da tarefa e do ID do responsável.</li><li><strong><code>get_task_details(task_id: str) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Para consultar os detalhes de uma tarefa específica, fornecendo o ID da tarefa e retornando suas informações.</li></ul><p>O MCP não apenas define a assinatura dessas funções, mas também como o LLM \"\" sobre qual ferramenta usar em um dado momento e como formatar a entrada e saída dessas ferramentas. O design cuidadoso dessas ferramentas é um passo crítico, pois elas são a interface entre a capacidade de compreensão e geração de linguagem do LLM e as ações concretas que ele pode realizar no ambiente de negócios. A clareza na descrição das ferramentas e a robustez na manipulação de seus parâmetros são essenciais para evitar erros e garantir que o agente de IA funcione de forma previsível e confiável. Este é o ponto de partida para a criação de sistemas mais complexos, que veremos a seguir.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Próxima Fronteira: Orquestração de Agentes e Fluxos de Trabalho Complexos com LLMs\n</h2><p>Se o  (MCP) fornece a linguagem para que um LLM interaja com o mundo, a  eleva essa capacidade, permitindo que múltiplos LLMs e outros modelos de IA colaborem em tarefas mais sofisticadas e processos de negócios que transcendem a capacidade de um único agente. A complexidade do mundo real raramente se encaixa em uma única interação de pergunta-resposta; em vez disso, exige uma <strong>série orquestrada de ações, decisões e comunicações entre diferentes componentes de software</strong>. É aqui que frameworks de orquestração entram em cena, oferecendo a estrutura para construir \"\" de agentes de IA, cada um com sua especialidade, trabalhando em conjunto para atingir um objetivo comum.</p><p>A emergência de <strong>arquiteturas de múltiplos agentes</strong> sinaliza uma evolução natural na forma como a IA é aplicada. Em vez de ter um LLM monolítico tentando resolver todos os problemas, podemos ter um agente especializado em compreender a intenção do usuário, outro em buscar informações em bancos de dados, um terceiro em gerar código, e assim por diante. Essa divisão de trabalho permite maior modularidade, escalabilidade e, potencialmente, maior precisão, pois cada agente pode ser otimizado para sua tarefa específica. Frameworks como  e  exemplificam essa abordagem, fornecendo abstrações e ferramentas para encadear LLMs, ferramentas e fontes de dados, criando \"\" de raciocínio e ação. Eles permitem definir <strong>fluxos de trabalho complexos</strong>, onde o resultado de uma ação de um agente se torna a entrada para outro, mimetizando a colaboração humana em equipes.</p><p>A gestão do <strong>estado e memória distribuída</strong> é um desafio central nessa orquestração. Em uma conversa ou processo de negócios de longa duração, é crucial que os agentes mantenham um histórico relevante para o contexto. Isso vai além da simples janela de contexto de um LLM; exige mecanismos para persistir e compartilhar informações entre diferentes etapas do processo e entre múltiplos agentes. Ferramentas de banco de dados vetoriais, caches de contexto e sistemas de gerenciamento de sessão tornam-se essenciais para garantir que a inteligência do sistema seja cumulativa e não efêmera. Além disso, a  e a  são aspectos críticos. Como múltiplos agentes tomam decisões e interagem com recursos, pode haver situações de concorrência ou ações contraditórias. Estratégias de arbitragem, sistemas de fila e monitoramento em tempo real são necessários para garantir a coerência e a integridade das operações. A capacidade de depurar e auditar esses fluxos de trabalho complexos, entendendo o raciocínio de cada agente em cada etapa, é vital para a confiabilidade e a responsabilidade.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Engenharia de Prompts e a Gestão do Ciclo de Vida dos Agentes de IA: Operacionalizando a Interoperabilidade\n</h2><p>A eficácia da interação dos LLMs com as ferramentas expostas via MCP, e a precisão de sua colaboração em fluxos de trabalho orquestrados, dependem criticamente de como eles são \"\" ou \"\" via prompts.  Nesta seção, estendemos esse conceito, mostrando como a engenharia de prompts se torna fundamental para a operacionalização dos agentes de IA, permitindo que eles não apenas gerem texto, mas  de forma inteligente e interajam com sistemas externos de forma consistente.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Importância da Engenharia de Prompts na Interação com Ferramentas\n</h3><p>A Engenharia de Prompts, no contexto de agentes de IA, transcende a mera geração de conteúdo. Ela se torna o mecanismo primordial para instruir o LLM sobre:</p><ul><li> Como o LLM decide qual ferramenta (definida via MCP) é a mais adequada para uma determinada solicitação do usuário. Um prompt bem elaborado pode descrever o propósito de cada ferramenta e como ela se relaciona com as intenções do usuário.</li><li><strong>Uso Correto dos Parâmetros:</strong> Uma vez que a ferramenta é selecionada, o LLM precisa extrair os parâmetros corretos da entrada do usuário para invocar a ferramenta. Por exemplo, em um pedido como \"<em>Qual a temperatura em Londres?</em>\", o LLM deve ser promptado para identificar \"\" como o parâmetro \"\" para a ferramenta .</li><li><strong>Interpretação de Resultados:</strong> Após a execução de uma ferramenta, o LLM recebe uma resposta (e.g., dados de um banco de dados, o resultado de uma API). O prompt deve instruir o LLM a interpretar esses resultados e transformá-los em uma resposta coerente e amigável para o usuário, ou a usá-los para uma próxima etapa do raciocínio.</li></ul><p>Técnicas avançadas de prompt, como o <strong><em>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting</em></strong> ou o <strong><em>ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)</em></strong>, são particularmente relevantes aqui. O ReAct, por exemplo, incentiva o LLM a alternar entre \"\" (pensar sobre o problema, planejar a próxima ação) e \"\" (invocar uma ferramenta). Um prompt que incorpora ReAct pode instruir o LLM a primeiro \"\" qual ferramenta usar, depois \"\" chamando a ferramenta, e então \"\" o resultado para continuar o raciocínio. Isso melhora drasticamente a capacidade do LLM de planejar e executar tarefas complexas que envolvem múltiplas interações com ferramentas.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Gestão do Ciclo de Vida dos Agentes de IA (<em>AI Agent Lifecycle Management</em>)\n</h3><p>A construção de um agente de IA não termina com sua primeira implantação. Assim como qualquer software, sistemas baseados em LLMs e orquestração de agentes exigem uma gestão contínua do seu ciclo de vida para garantir sua performance, confiabilidade e adaptabilidade.</p><ul><li><strong>Versionamento de Prompts e Lógica de Orquestração:</strong> À medida que os prompts são refinados e a lógica de orquestração evolui, é crucial versionar essas configurações. Isso permite rastrear mudanças, realizar  em caso de regressões e colaborar eficientemente em equipes.</li><li><strong>Testes e Validação Contínua:</strong> Além dos testes iniciais, os agentes de IA precisam ser submetidos a testes de regressão frequentes. Isso garante que as atualizações nos prompts, nos modelos de LLM subjacentes ou nas integrações externas não introduzam comportamentos indesejados. A criação de conjuntos de dados de teste que cobrem casos de borda e cenários críticos é essencial.</li><li><strong>Mecanismos de  e Tratamento de Erros:</strong> É inevitável que agentes de IA encontrem situações para as quais não foram treinados ou que resultem em falhas de ferramenta/API. Implementar mecanismos de , como encaminhar a solicitação para um operador humano ou fornecer uma resposta padrão, é crucial para manter a experiência do usuário e a robustez do sistema.</li><li><strong>Monitoramento e Observabilidade em Produção:</strong> Ferramentas de monitoramento são indispensáveis para acompanhar o comportamento dos agentes em tempo real. Isso inclui rastrear a taxa de sucesso das chamadas de ferramentas, a latência, o uso de recursos e, crucialmente, identificar padrões de \"\" ou comportamento inesperado. A observabilidade permite que as equipes respondam rapidamente a problemas e coletem dados para futuras otimizações de prompts e orquestração.</li><li> O ambiente de negócios e os dados evoluem constantemente. Os agentes de IA precisam se adaptar a essas mudanças. Um ciclo de  contínuo, onde o desempenho é avaliado, os dados de uso são analisados e os prompts/orquestrações são ajustados, é vital para manter a relevância e a eficácia do sistema ao longo do tempo. Isso minimiza o risco de \"\" e garante que o agente continue a entregar valor.</li></ul><p>A integração da Engenharia de Prompts como uma ferramenta operacional e a adoção de uma abordagem de gestão de ciclo de vida para agentes de IA são pilares para transformar protótipos de LLMs em soluções empresariais robustas e sustentáveis. Com essa compreensão das ferramentas e um plano de ação claro, podemos agora aprofundar o cenário de avaliação de resultados e suas implicações.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Avaliação de Desempenho e Métricas de Sucesso para Agentes de IA e Sistemas Orquestrados\n</h2><p>A avaliação do desempenho de sistemas baseados em LLMs, especialmente aqueles que operam como agentes orquestrados e interagem com o mundo real via MCP, vai muito além das métricas de linguagem natural tradicionalmente utilizadas. <strong>Enquanto na Engenharia de Prompt avaliamos a qualidade da geração de texto, aqui, o foco se desloca para o impacto funcional e de negócio.</strong> A complexidade desses sistemas exige uma abordagem multifacetada para determinar se estão realmente entregando valor e operando de forma confiável.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Métricas Multidimensionais para Agentes de IA\n</h3><p>Para sistemas que envolvem ações e interações com sistemas externos, as métricas devem refletir não apenas a qualidade do texto gerado, mas a eficácia da  e o impacto no negócio.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Métricas de Sucesso da Tarefa ou Objetivo de Negócio:</strong> Esta é a métrica mais crítica. Ela avalia se o agente atingiu o objetivo final para o qual foi projetado. Exemplos incluem:</p><ul><li> Em  de atendimento, a porcentagem de problemas que o agente conseguiu resolver sem intervenção humana.\n\n<ul><li> Para agentes de vendas, o percentual de interações que resultaram em uma venda ou  qualificado.</li><li><strong>Redução de Tempo de Processo:</strong> Em automação de , a diminuição no tempo necessário para completar uma tarefa (e.g., processar um pedido, gerar um relatório).</li><li> Se o agente deveria agendar uma reunião, a métrica seria se a reunião foi agendada corretamente na data e hora especificadas.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Correção da Ferramenta e Ação:</strong> Avaliam a capacidade do LLM de selecionar e utilizar as ferramentas do MCP corretamente.</p><ul><li><strong>Taxa de Seleção Correta de Ferramenta:</strong> Quantas vezes o LLM escolheu a ferramenta apropriada para a intenção do usuário.\n\n<ul><li> Se os parâmetros extraídos pelo LLM para a chamada da ferramenta estavam corretos.</li><li><strong>Taxa de Erro de Execução de Ferramenta:</strong> Frequência com que as chamadas às ferramentas resultam em erros (sejam por erro do LLM ou da própria API externa).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Eficiência e Latência:</strong> Essenciais para a experiência do usuário e custos operacionais.</p><ul><li><strong>Tempo de Resposta ():</strong> O tempo total desde a entrada do usuário até a resposta final, incluindo todas as chamadas de LLM e APIs.\n\n<ul><li> O custo financeiro associado às chamadas dos LLMs e ao uso de recursos externos.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Robustez e Resiliência:</strong> Avaliam a capacidade do sistema de lidar com condições adversas.</p><ul><li><strong>Taxa de Falha em Casos de Borda:</strong> Como o agente se comporta em cenários não previstos ou com entradas ambíguas.</li><li> Frequência com que o sistema precisa recorrer a mecanismos de contingência (e.g., transferir para humano).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Viés e Justeza (ou  em inglês):</strong> Embora complexas, são cruciais para a IA responsável.</p><ul><li> Avaliar se as decisões ou respostas do agente variam injustamente entre diferentes grupos demográficos ou categorias sensíveis.</li><li><strong>Rastreabilidade e Explicabilidade:</strong> A capacidade de auditar o \"\" do agente (via , por exemplo) para entender como uma decisão foi tomada, auxiliando na identificação e mitigação de vieses.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Desafios na Avaliação de Sistemas Agentes\n</h3><p>A avaliação de sistemas complexos de IA é inerentemente desafiadora. A natureza probabilística e não-determinística dos LLMs significa que a mesma entrada pode gerar saídas ligeiramente diferentes, tornando os testes de regressão mais complexos. Além disso, a criação de conjuntos de dados de teste que cobrem todas as interações possíveis com múltiplas ferramentas e fluxos de trabalho é um desafio significativo. A dependência de feedback humano para avaliar a qualidade subjetiva (e.g., fluidez, tom, relevância para o usuário) é escalável apenas até certo ponto, exigindo metodologias eficientes de rotulagem e validação. A complexidade do \"\" e da identificação da causa raiz de um erro (foi o prompt, o LLM, a ferramenta ou a lógica de orquestração?) também exige ferramentas de observabilidade sofisticadas.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Riscos vs. Oportunidades na Adoção de IA: Um Olhar Crítico para Novas Fronteiras de Negócios\n</h2><p>A adoção de tecnologias de Inteligência Artificial, em especial os LLMs e os agentes de IA habilitados pelo MCP e pela orquestração, representa um terreno fértil para a <strong>criação de novos negócios e a transformação de modelos existentes</strong>. As oportunidades são vastas e se estendem por todos os setores da economia. A capacidade de automatizar tarefas cognitivas complexas, personalizar interações em escala, e extrair  de grandes volumes de dados são apenas a ponta do . Imagine um escritório de advocacia que utiliza LLMs para analisar contratos e identificar cláusulas de risco em minutos, um sistema financeiro que detecta fraudes com maior precisão ou uma plataforma de  que oferece recomendações de produtos ultrabásicas baseadas em preferências implícitas do usuário. Esses são apenas alguns exemplos que demonstram o potencial disruptivo da IA para otimizar operações, reduzir custos e, mais importante, gerar novas fontes de valor.</p><p>A agilidade na construção de protótipos e a capacidade de escalar soluções inovadoras são impulsionadas pela maturidade das ferramentas e padrões de interoperabilidade como o MCP. Startups podem alavancar LLMs e frameworks de agentes para criar produtos e serviços que, há poucos anos, exigiriam equipes de engenharia massivas e investimentos proibitivos. O \"\" e \"\" impulsionados por IA, onde LLMs auxiliam na geração de código ou na configuração de sistemas, democratizam ainda mais o desenvolvimento de software, permitindo que profissionais de negócios com menos experiência técnica criem suas próprias soluções. A proliferação de plataformas e APIs de LLMs, juntamente com a crescente adoção de padrões de interoperabilidade, facilita a experimentação e a inovação em um ritmo sem precedentes. Isso cria um ambiente propício para a emergência de \"\" que constroem seus modelos de negócios fundamentalmente sobre as capacidades da inteligência artificial.</p><p>Contudo, a mesma inovação que gera oportunidades traz consigo um conjunto considerável de <strong>riscos que precisam ser cuidadosamente gerenciados</strong>. O primeiro e mais premente é o <strong>risco de viés e discriminação algorítmica</strong>. LLMs são treinados em vastos conjuntos de dados que podem conter preconceitos sociais existentes, replicando e até mesmo amplificando-os em suas saídas. Isso é particularmente crítico em aplicações que envolvem tomada de decisões sensíveis, como contratação de pessoal ou concessão de crédito. Ignorar esse risco não apenas leva a resultados injustos, mas também pode resultar em danos reputacionais e legais significativos para as empresas. A transparência e a auditabilidade dos modelos, juntamente com estratégias de mitigação de viés, tornam-se imperativas.</p><p>Outro risco substancial é a <strong>dependência excessiva e a perda de controle humano</strong>. À medida que mais e mais processos são delegados a agentes de IA, a compreensão humana sobre as operações pode diminuir, dificultando a intervenção em caso de falha ou comportamento inesperado. A \"\" dos LLMs, onde o raciocínio por trás de uma decisão nem sempre é transparente, exacerba esse problema. Além disso, a  assume uma nova dimensão com a IA. LLMs podem ser explorados para gerar conteúdo malicioso,  mais convincentes, ou até mesmo para auxiliar em ataques cibernéticos sofisticados. A proteção dos modelos contra ataques adversariais e a garantia de que não sejam usados para fins maliciosos são desafios contínuos e em evolução. Finalmente, a <strong>competitividade e a ética no mercado</strong> são cruciais. À medida que a IA se torna uma vantagem competitiva, questões sobre o acesso equitativo à tecnologia, o impacto no emprego e a responsabilidade por decisões autônomas se tornam centrais. Uma abordagem ética e responsável na adoção da IA não é apenas uma questão de conformidade, mas um <a href=\"https://dev.to/vinicius3w/etica-e-privacidade-na-era-da-ia-dilemas-oportunidades-e-o-futuro-da-governanca-no-cenario-de-f48\">pilar para a sustentabilidade e a aceitação social dessas tecnologias</a>. A discussão sobre estes riscos e oportunidades é vital para que a transformação digital com IA seja não apenas eficaz, mas também justa e sustentável.</p><p>A engenharia de prompt transcendeu sua fase inicial de experimentação para se consolidar como uma competência fundamental no desenvolvimento de soluções baseadas em Inteligência Artificial. Conforme explorado, não se trata apenas de formular perguntas inteligentes, mas de uma disciplina que integra a  com a <strong>ciência da computação e da orquestração de sistemas</strong>. A capacidade de interagir eficazmente com LLMs, utilizando técnicas como  e o estabelecimento de personas, aliada ao domínio de ferramentas como LangChain, DSPy e plataformas  como Flowise/Dify, é o que diferenciará os profissionais e as organizações no cenário da transformação digital. A adoção de modelos estruturados de prompts, como R-T-F e C-A-R-E, exemplifica a evolução de uma prática empírica para uma abordagem mais metodológica e replicável.</p><p>Os casos de sucesso demonstraram o imenso potencial dos LLMs para otimizar processos, personalizar experiências e gerar insights. Contudo, é imperativo que essa exploração seja pautada por uma consciência crítica dos riscos inerentes, como alucinações e vieses, e por uma avaliação rigorosa e contínua dos resultados. A responsabilidade na aplicação da IA é um tema central, exigindo que os desenvolvedores e estrategistas de negócio não apenas busquem a inovação, mas também garantam a ética, a segurança e a confiabilidade de suas soluções. A engenharia de prompt, em sua essência, é a ponte entre a capacidade bruta dos LLMs e a sua aplicação prática, estratégica e responsável no mundo real dos negócios. O futuro da interação homem-máquina e o sucesso das iniciativas de IA dependem diretamente do aprimoramento contínuo dessa intersecção entre inteligência artificial e inteligência humana.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Referências para Leituras Futuras:\n</h2><ul><li>Bender, E.

For a long time, AWS S3 was the go-to option for most of us, but nowadays their competition is huge, offering reliable alternatives at a fraction of the price.</p><p>We researched some providers to use in our cloud platform <a href=\"https://sliplane.io/?utm_source=5-object-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sliplane</a> some time ago and I want to share our top picks with you.</p><p>Here are 5 cheap object storage providers you can consider as an AWS S3 alternative.</p><blockquote><p> You might have very specific requirements for your object storage solution. For this article, I only include providers in the list of known brands with overall good reputation and we are mainly comparing prices here.</p></blockquote><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Free up to 3× storage, then $0.01 / GB</td><td>Widely adopted, solid reliability, easy S3 API</td></tr><tr><td>Requires 90-day minimum retention, fully S3-compatible</td></tr><tr><td>10 GB storage + 1M writes + 10M reads/month</td><td>Pays for read/write ops, strong edge caching network</td></tr><tr><td>Great price/performance, limited data centers, restrictive account policy</td></tr><tr><td>Self-hosted, open-source, requires setup and maintenance, durability is debatable</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Backblaze B2 offers reliable, low-cost object storage with an easy-to-use S3-compatible API. The <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/pricing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storage price</a> is very affordable at $0.006/GB/month, and egress is free up to 3× your storage volume per month, then $0.01/GB for additional egress.</p><p>Backblaze is widely adopted and a solid choice when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-resiliency-durability-and-availability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">durability</a> (99.999999999% annual durability) and general <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/company/policy/sla\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reliability</a> (99.9% uptime SLA). We use it at <a href=\"https://sliplane.io/?utm_source=5-object-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sliplane.io</a> for example for storing backups but also to store configuration and init scripts.</p><p>With $0.00699/GB/month, storage is only slightly more expensive than on Backblaze, but egress is completely free on <a href=\"https://wasabi.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wasabi</a>. <a href=\"https://docs.wasabi.com/v1/docs/how-durable-is-wasabi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Durability</a> is given at 11 nines as well and in their <a href=\"https://wasabi.com/legal/sla\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SLA</a> they start discounting you if availability of their service drops below 99.9%.</p><p>Wasabi is fully S3-compatible, but it requires a 90-day minimum retention period on stored data when using their pay-as-you-go pricing.</p><p>Similar to Wasabi, Cloudflare R2 provides object storage with zero egress fees as well, which is ideal for applications with heavy outbound data transfers. Storage costs are higher than Wasabi's at $0.015/GB/month, but still much cheaper compared to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS S3</a> which comes at $0.023/GB/month. They also have a free tier for the first 10GB of storage, making it ideal for small projects. While egress is free, you pay for read ($0.36 / M) and write ($4.50 / M) operations, although Cloudflare has a free tier of 1M writes and 10M reads per month as well.</p><p>A main benefit of R2 is access to Cloudflare's edge caching network, giving you fast global access to your data.</p><p>Hetzner provides a great European alternative for Object storage. Although their service is comparably new and when we tested it in beta we stumbled into issues, which they probably got all sorted by now, Hetzner is known to provide great service at an exceptional price/performance ratio.</p><p>At $0.00713/GB/month storage costs are very competitive and especially their $0.00143/GB egress pricing can be an attractive alternative to AWS where egress costs are about 60x higher. Its downsides include limited global data center locations and it can be tricky to open an account at Hetzner since they are very restrictive as part of their effort to keep scammers in check.</p><p>MinIO is a self-hosted, open-source object storage software fully compatible with the S3 API. Since it runs on your own servers or cloud, storage fees—costs depend on your infrastructure but you must also include the time it takes to set up and maintain your object storage solution.</p><p>Is it a good idea to <a href=\"https://sliplane.io/blog/5-things-that-should-be-illegal-to-selfhost\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-host object storage</a>? That's debatable. An important point of good object storage is high durability and achieving the same 11 nines (99.999999999%) as other providers offer at a similar price is going to be tough.</p><p>Hope any of that helped! Each of these providers offers different advantages depending on your specific needs:</p><ul><li> is great for reliable, cost-effective storage with reasonable egress allowances</li><li> excels when you need unlimited free egress but can commit to 90-day retention</li><li> is perfect for applications that benefit from global edge caching</li><li> offers excellent European-focused pricing with competitive egress costs</li><li> gives you complete control but requires significant setup and maintenance effort</li></ul><p>When choosing an object storage provider, consider not just the storage costs but also egress fees, your geographic requirements, integration complexity, and the total cost of ownership including your time investment.</p>","contentLength":4494,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Musk's attempts to politicize his Grok AI are bad for users and enterprises — here's why","url":"https://dev.to/future_ai/musks-attempts-to-politicize-his-grok-ai-are-bad-for-users-and-enterprises-heres-why-32ch","date":1751390318,"author":"AI News","guid":179171,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\n          As an independent business owner or leader, how could you possibly trust Grok to give you unbiased results?\n        </p>","contentLength":127,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Apple Research just unearthed a forgotten AI technique and is using it to generate images","url":"https://dev.to/future_ai/apple-research-just-unearthed-a-forgotten-ai-technique-and-is-using-it-to-generate-images-4ic1","date":1751390304,"author":"AI News","guid":179161,"unread":true,"content":"<p> Apple dusted off an old AI trick—Normalizing Flows—and spiced it up with Transformers to create two new image generators: TarFlow and STARFlow.

So, if you're ready to swap your current commute for a London tube ride or a stroll through Manchester's tech parks, let's break down exactly what it takes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Get a Dev Job in the UK with Visa Sponsorship: Your Ultimate Guide\n</h2><p>Dreaming of a UK Tech Career? It's More Attainable Than You Think!\nThe UK tech scene is booming, constantly seeking fresh talent, innovative minds, and skilled developers from all corners of the world. From bustling startups in Shoreditch to established tech giants in Manchester and Edinburgh, opportunities abound. </p><p>But for international candidates, the visa process can feel like navigating a maze blindfolded. Don't worry, we're going to demystify it, step by step, so you can confidently pursue your dream dev job in the UK.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the UK Visa Sponsorship Landscape\n</h2><p>Before you even start <a href=\"https://techwaka.net/cv-writing-for-beginners/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">polishing your CV</a>, it’s crucial to grasp the primary visa route that will allow you to work as a developer in the UK.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Skilled Worker Visa: Your Golden Ticket\n</h2><p>For most international developers, the Skilled Worker Visa (formerly Tier 2 General) is the main pathway to employment in the UK. This visa allows you to come to or stay in the UK to do an eligible job with an approved employer. Yes, that's the key: an approved employer. Not every company can sponsor a visa, so knowing which ones can is half the battle.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Eligibility Criteria: What You Need to Know\n</h2><p>To qualify for a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skilled Worker visa</a>, you generally need to meet several criteria and score enough points. Here are the main ones:</p><p>Job Offer from a Licensed Sponsor: You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK employer that holds a valid sponsorship licence. This is non-negotiable.</p><p> Your job must be on the list of eligible occupations (which includes most developer roles). The government publishes a list of occupations that qualify.</p><p><strong>Minimum Salary Threshold:</strong> You must be paid a minimum salary, which is either a general threshold (e.g., £38,700 as of April 2024, subject to change) or the 'going rate' for your specific job code, whichever is higher. There are some exceptions for 'new entrants' (younger applicants or recent graduates) or jobs on the shortage occupation list.</p><p><strong>English Language Proficiency:</strong> You'll need to prove your English language skills. This usually means passing an approved English language test (like <a href=\"https://ielts.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IELTS</a> for UKVI) or having a degree taught in English.</p><p><strong>Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):</strong> Your employer will issue you a Certificate of Sponsorship, which is a unique reference number, not a physical certificate, that confirms your job details and sponsorship.</p><p> You might need to show you have enough money to support yourself when you arrive in the UK, though your employer can sometimes certify this for you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Sponsorship Process: How It Works\n</h2><p>Once you've landed a job offer from a sponsoring company, here's a simplified overview of what happens:</p><p> Once you receive the CoS, you'll use it to apply for your Skilled Worker visa online. You'll need to provide supporting documents, including your passport, English language test results, and evidence of funds.</p><p> You'll typically attend an appointment at a visa application centre to provide your fingerprints and a photo (biometrics). Some applicants may also be invited for an interview.</p><p> The Home Office reviews your application and makes a decision. If approved, you'll receive your visa.</p><p><strong>Other Visa Routes (Briefly):</strong><a href=\"https://techwaka.net/uk-global-talent-visa-all-you-need-to-know/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Global Talent</a>, Youth Mobility\nWhile the Skilled Worker Visa is the most common, a couple of other routes might be relevant for some developers:</p><p> If you're a recognized leader or emerging leader in digital technology, you might qualify for this endorsement-based visa. It doesn't require a job offer or sponsorship upfront, offering more flexibility.</p><p><strong>Youth Mobility Scheme Visa (Tier 5):</strong> If you're aged 18-30 (or 18-35 for some nationalities) and from certain countries, this allows you to live and work in the UK for up to two years. It's not sponsorship-dependent, but it's temporary.</p><p> Essential Steps Before You Apply\nBefore you even start hitting 'apply,' there are crucial preparatory steps that will significantly boost your chances.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Skill Up: In-Demand Technologies in the UK Market\n</h2><p>The UK tech market has its own unique demands.

Understanding microservices and API development is key.</p><p> Expertise across both frontend and backend is highly valued, particularly for startups looking for versatile talent.</p><p> The Hot Skills\nBeyond core development languages, certain areas are experiencing explosive growth:</p><p> AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) skills are extremely sought after. Certifications can make you stand out.</p><p> Experience with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab CI, and automation tools is a massive plus. Companies are constantly looking to streamline their development and deployment processes.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Machine Learning (ML):</strong> Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and a solid understanding of ML algorithms are in high demand, especially in fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Crafting a UK-Optimized CV/Resume\n</h2><p>Your CV is your first impression. Make it count, and tailor it for the UK market.</p><p><strong>ATS-Friendly Formatting and Keywords:</strong> Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter CVs. Use clear, standard formatting, and incorporate keywords from the job description. Avoid overly fancy designs that might confuse an ATS.</p><p><strong>Highlighting Relevant Experience (Even International):</strong> Clearly articulate your experience, focusing on achievements rather than just duties. Quantify your impact whenever possible (e.g., \"Improved load time by 20%,\" \"Reduced bugs by 15%\"). If your experience is international, explain how it's relevant to a UK context. Be mindful of UK English spelling and terminology.</p><p><strong>No Photo or Personal Info (Generally):</strong> Unlike some countries, it's generally not expected or even advisable to include a photo, marital status, or date of birth on a UK CV due to anti-discrimination laws.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building a Standout Portfolio/GitHub Profile\n</h2><p>For developers, your code speaks louder than words.</p><p><strong>Showcasing Real-World Projects:</strong> A strong portfolio with live demos or clear descriptions of projects you've worked on (personal or professional) is invaluable.

And the environment where those ideas begin to breathe is the human mind, where they grow larger with each passing thought until they become ready to step out and walk the earth.</p><p>After ninth grade, my twin sister and I spent several months in our grandparents’ rural home while they were away. The atmosphere was serene but far removed from the city, and we lacked a vehicle. Anytime we needed something — groceries, lunch, simple supplies — we had to ask our father to bring them from afar. Even common deliveries weren’t feasible, since our parents were uncomfortable allowing strangers near the house while we were home alone.</p><p>One day, half-joking but half-serious, I turned to my sister and said:</p><p>“Why don’t we just invent a flying robot to handle all of this for us?”</p><p>That sentence planted a seed. What began as a casual remark quickly grew into a vision — not just for us, but for anyone frustrated by the invisible labor of running everyday errands.</p><p>🤖 The Vision: A Reliable Personal Courier</p><p>This robot isn’t just a flying device. It’s a practical assistant — a safe, intelligent courier that receives instructions, carries items, and delivers them without human interaction on either end.</p><p>It features three attachable cargo containers in small, medium, and large sizes. Depending on the item — a bottle of medicine, a stack of documents, a hot meal, or even a boxed television — the user selects the appropriate box, and the robot locks it in securely.</p><p>An integrated touchscreen panel on one of its mechanical arms allows users to input the destination address, verify identity, and collect a digital signature at the delivery point.</p><p>The device could run on solar or electric power, helping reduce emissions from short-distance errands and offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional deliveries.</p><p>But perhaps most compelling is this: it speaks — and it feels almost human.</p><p>🧠 A Robot That Feels Human</p><p>Upon reaching its destination, the robot doesn’t just beep. Instead, it initiates a brief phone call using the recipient’s number entered by the sender. With a calm, human-like voice, it says:</p><p>“Your delivery has arrived. Please come to the door to receive it.”</p><p>This simple gesture — the tone, the language, the autonomy — transforms the experience from mechanical to meaningful.</p><p>Once the recipient approaches, the robot uses facial recognition and voice ID to verify their name. Only if the data fully matches the original sender’s input does the box unlock. This prevents misdeliveries and unauthorized access.</p><p>If the sender chose to include a short note — a message, birthday wish, or kind phrase — the robot reads it aloud as part of the final handoff.</p><p>In that moment, even a delivery feels personal.</p><p>🔐 More Than Just Smart: A Safer System</p><p>Safety isn’t optional. Especially for vulnerable users — like elderly individuals, children, or those living alone — interaction with delivery personnel can be stressful or unsafe.</p><p>To address this, the robot relies on a strict multi-factor verification system:</p><p>Voice confirmation (full name)</p><p>Precise GPS-matching of destination</p><p>A fail-safe locking mechanism</p><p>If any of these criteria aren’t satisfied, the box remains locked. It protects both the item and the recipient, with no room for error or intrusion.</p><p>Although designed with care and engineering, this isn’t a luxury product. It’s intended for everyone.</p><p>You’re at school and forget your homework folder — it arrives before the bell rings.</p><p>Your grandfather’s prescription is ready, but he’s unable to leave the house — it comes directly to him.</p><p>You’re sick on your best friend’s birthday, but still want to celebrate — the robot delivers a handwritten note, a flower, and your voice saying “Happy Birthday.”</p><p>You leave for work in a rush and forget your phone and wallet — your spouse sends them to your office instantly.</p><p>Your friend with asthma forgets their inhaler before heading out — the robot gets it to them before anything goes wrong.</p><p>These are not exaggerated scenarios. They are normal, frequent, and often stressful moments in people’s lives — ones this robot could help ease.</p><p>At first, this courier would fly across towns or districts. But in the long run, why not across countries?</p><p>One day, someone might send their relative a special gift, or order something unavailable in their region — and it could arrive not in days, but in minutes.</p><p>This robot doesn't carry people. It carries time, urgency, peace of mind — and occasionally, the voice of someone who couldn’t show up in person.</p><p>I don’t claim to have the tools or funding — not yet. But I plan to study computer science in university, with the goal of developing technologies that prioritize both functionality and empathy.</p><p>Of course, engineering this device will come with obstacles: navigation, regulation, energy supply, weather, safety systems. But innovation isn’t about avoiding problems — it’s about trusting that the right collaborators, tools, and timing will come together. That’s how real solutions form.</p><p>No invention is truly the work of a single person. Like humans, ideas need time to grow, guidance to develop, and community to stand. They begin as fragile whispers and evolve into voices that shape the world.</p><p>🪶 Final Thought: When Flying Means Freedom</p><p>It can’t walk. It can’t run. It can’t drive. But it can fly.</p><p>And maybe, that’s all we need.</p><p>Forgot your passport before a flight? Need to deliver medicine before the pharmacy closes? Leave your exam paper at home, moments before a critical deadline? Know someone who needs baby formula at 2 a.m., but the nearest shop is closed?</p><p>This robot eliminates the pressure of being in two places at once. It doesn’t just save time — it restores calm.</p><p>This isn’t luxury. It’s liberation.</p><p>And beyond its day-to-day benefits, this robot could help reduce commuting, limit unnecessary trips, and operate on clean energy. With every trip, it cuts down emissions and brings us closer to more efficient, more breathable cities.</p>","contentLength":6319,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Install Jan-Nano-128k: The AI Model with 128K Context Window for Deep Research","url":"https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/how-to-install-jan-nano-128k-the-ai-model-with-128k-context-window-for-deep-research-2hp4","date":1751387528,"author":"Aditi Bindal","guid":179101,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you've been exploring compact language models for research, chances are you've already come across the impressive Jan-Nano, a lightweight, high-performance model that recently gained popularity for its speed and versatility. But one of its key limitations was its relatively short context window, which often forced researchers and developers to chunk or truncate large documents. Since long context window is a very important factor in areas like deep research, Menlo Research team just launched Jan-Nano-128k, a game-changing upgrade that natively supports an astonishing 128,000-token context window. It is built from the ground up to handle long-form content without the performance degradation seen in traditional context extension methods like YaRN. If you're analyzing full-length research papers, synthesizing knowledge across multiple documents, or engaging in complex multi-turn conversations, Jan-Nano-128k empowers you to dive deeper with unmatched efficiency and precision. Its architecture is optimized not just for length, but for performance at scale, maintaining coherent, high-quality responses across massive inputs. Fully compatible with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, it’s a dream tool for researchers, AI Scientists, and enteprises focusing on AI tools for deep research.</p><p>In this guide, we'll walk you through the easiest way to install Jan-Nano-128k and get it running on GPU accelerated environment, so you can start building, exploring, and reasoning at an entirely new scale.</p><p>The minimum system requirements for this use case are:</p><ul><li><p>GPUs: 1x RTX A6000 or 1x A100</p></li><li><p>Disk Space: 50 GB (preferable)</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Note: The prerequisites for this are highly variable across use cases. A high-end configuration could be used for a large-scale deployment.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-step process to install and run Jan Nano 128k\n</h2><p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll use a GPU-powered Virtual Machine by <a href=\"https://nodeshift.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NodeShift</a> since it provides high compute Virtual Machines at a very affordable cost on a scale that meets GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001 requirements. Also, it offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for beginners to get started with Cloud deployments. However, feel free to use any cloud provider of your choice and follow the same steps for the rest of the tutorial.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Setting up a NodeShift Account\n</h3><p>Visit <a href=\"https://app.nodeshift.com/sign-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app.nodeshift.com</a> and create an account by filling in basic details, or continue signing up with your Google/GitHub account.</p><p>If you already have an account, <a href=\"http://app.nodeshift.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">login</a> straight to your dashboard.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Create a GPU Node\n</h3><p>After accessing your account, you should see a dashboard (see image), now:</p><p>1) Navigate to the menu on the left side.</p><p>2) Click on the&nbsp;&nbsp;option.</p><p>3) Click on  to start creating your very first GPU node.</p><p>These GPU nodes are GPU-powered virtual machines by NodeShift. These nodes are highly customizable and let you control different environmental configurations for GPUs ranging from H100s to A100s, CPUs, RAM, and storage, according to your needs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Selecting configuration for GPU (model, region,&nbsp;storage)\n</h3><p>1) For this tutorial, we’ll be using the H100 GPU; however, you can choose any GPU of your choice based on your needs.</p><p>2) Similarly, we’ll opt for 200GB storage by sliding the bar. You can also select the region where you want your GPU to reside from the available ones.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Choose GPU Configuration and Authentication method\n</h3><p>1) After selecting your required configuration options, you'll see the available GPU nodes in your region and according to (or very close to) your configuration. In our case, we'll choose a 1x RTX A6000 48GB GPU node with 64vCPUs/63GB RAM/200GB SSD.</p><p>2) Next, you'll need to select an authentication method. Two methods are available: Password and SSH Key. We recommend using SSH keys, as they are a more secure option. To create one, head over to our <a href=\"https://docs.nodeshift.com/gpus/create-gpu-deployment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official documentation</a>.</p><p>The final step would be to choose an image for the VM, which in our case is , where we’ll deploy and run the inference of our model.</p><p>That's it! You are now ready to deploy the node. Finalize the configuration summary, and if it looks good, click  to deploy the node.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Connect to active Compute Node using SSH\n</h3><p>1) As soon as you create the node, it will be deployed in a few seconds or a minute. Once deployed, you will see a status  in green, meaning that our Compute node is ready to use!</p><p>2) Once your GPU shows this status, navigate to the three dots on the right and click on . This will open a pop-up box with the Host details. Copy and paste that in your local terminal to connect to the remote server via SSH.</p><p>As you copy the details, follow the below steps to connect to the running GPU VM via SSH:</p><p>1) Open your terminal, paste the SSH command, and run it.</p><p>2) In some cases, your terminal may take your consent before connecting. Enter ‘yes’.</p><p>3) A prompt will request a password. Type the SSH password, and you should be connected.</p><p>Next, If you want to check the GPU details, run the following command in the terminal:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Set up the project environment with dependencies\n</h3><p>1) Create a virtual environment using <a href=\"https://nodeshift.com/blog/set-up-anaconda-on-ubuntu-22-04-in-minutes-simplify-your-ai-workflow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anaconda</a>.</p><div><pre><code>conda create -n jann python=3.11 &amp;&amp; conda activate jann\n</code></pre></div><p>2) Once you’re inside the environment, run the following command to install the torch and other packages.</p><div><pre><code>pip install torch torchvision torchaudio einops timm pillow\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\npip install huggingface_hub\npip install sentencepiece bitsandbytes protobuf decord numpy\n</code></pre></div><p>3) Run the following command to install vllm and any other remaining packages needed to run vllm and not installed already.</p><div><pre><code>pip install --upgrade vllm\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 8: Download and Run the Model\n</h3><p>1) Start the vllm server with this command that will also download the model.</p><div><pre><code>vllm serve Menlo/Jan-nano-128k \\\n    --host 0.0.0.0 \\\n    --port 1234 \\\n    --enable-auto-tool-choice \\\n    --tool-call-parser hermes \\\n    --rope-scaling '{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":3.2,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":40960}' --max-model-len 131072\n</code></pre></div><p>2) Once all the model checkpoints are downloaded, we’ll connect our local VSCode editor to the remote server to write a code snippet to test the model during inference.</p><p>If you’re using a GPU through a remote server (e.g., NodeShift), you can connect it to your visual studio code editor by following the steps below:</p><p>a) Install the “Remote-SSH” Extension by Microsoft on VS Code.\nb) Type “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host” on the Command Palette.<p>\nc) Click on “Add a new host”.</p>\nd) Enter the host details, such as username and SSH password, and you should be connected.</p><p>3) Inside VSCode, create a new project directory and a python file inside the directory. Ensure you’re inside the virtual environment created earlier.</p><div><pre><code>mkdir test-app\ncd test-app\ntouch app.py\n</code></pre></div><p>4) Copy and paste the below code snippet in  file.</p><p>This is just a test script that tests the model’s long context capabilities on a very long context i.e., the novel <em>“The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes”</em> in the form of text file.

Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall precision, exhibited unexpected conditional dependencies not captured during offline evaluation. This highlighted a critical gap: our existing monitoring lacked the ability to track and validate the  behind model predictions, not just the predictions themselves. This incident underscored the need for integrating Bayesian Networks (BNs) not as standalone models, but as a crucial component within our broader MLOps infrastructure for explainability, risk assessment, and robust model monitoring. BNs, in this context, aren’t simply probabilistic graphical models; they’re a system-level tool for understanding and controlling model behavior across the entire ML lifecycle – from data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment, monitoring, and eventual deprecation.  They address increasing compliance demands (e.g., GDPR’s right to explanation) and the need for scalable inference in high-stakes applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is Bayesian Networks in Modern ML Infrastructure?\n</h3><p>From a systems perspective, a “Bayesian Network example” isn’t a single artifact, but a collection of components and workflows. It’s the integration of a BN – typically learned from data or expert knowledge – with our existing ML infrastructure. This includes:</p><ul><li>  Models are trained using libraries like  or  (Python) and serialized (e.g., using  or a custom format) for storage in a model registry like MLflow.  Version control is paramount.</li><li><strong>Feature Store Integration:</strong> BNs often rely on features derived from our feature store (e.g., Feast).  Maintaining feature lineage and detecting feature skew is critical for BN accuracy.</li><li>  BN inference is typically served via a dedicated microservice, often built using frameworks like Ray Serve or FastAPI, and deployed on Kubernetes.</li><li>  BN-specific metrics (e.g., evidence propagation paths, marginal probabilities) are streamed to our observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry).</li><li><strong>ML Pipeline Orchestration:</strong> Airflow or similar orchestrators manage the BN training, validation, and deployment pipelines.</li></ul><p>The key trade-off is complexity.  BNs add overhead to the pipeline. System boundaries must be clearly defined:  BNs are best suited for augmenting existing models, not replacing them entirely, particularly in high-throughput scenarios.  A typical implementation pattern involves using the BN to provide explanations for predictions made by a primary model (e.g., a deep neural network).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection (Fintech):</strong>  BNs can explain  a transaction was flagged as fraudulent, providing evidence for risk assessment and regulatory compliance.</li><li><strong>Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):</strong>  BNs can reveal the factors driving a recommendation, increasing user trust and transparency.</li><li><strong>Medical Diagnosis (Health Tech):</strong>  BNs can assist clinicians by providing probabilistic reasoning behind a diagnosis, highlighting key symptoms and risk factors.</li><li><strong>Autonomous Vehicle Safety (Autonomous Systems):</strong>  BNs can model the uncertainty in sensor data and predict potential failure modes, enhancing safety and reliability.</li><li> BNs can model the causal relationships between different A/B test variations and key metrics, providing more robust insights than traditional statistical tests.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Architecture &amp; Data Workflows\n</h3><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Data Source] --&gt; B(Feature Store);\n    B --&gt; C{BN Training Pipeline (Airflow)};\n    C --&gt; D[MLflow Model Registry];\n    D --&gt; E(BN Inference Service - Ray Serve/Kubernetes);\n    E --&gt; F[Primary Model Inference Service];\n    F --&gt; G(Monitoring &amp; Alerting - Prometheus/Grafana);\n    E --&gt; G;\n    G --&gt; H{Incident Response};\n    B --&gt; F;\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style E fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n</code></pre></div><p>The workflow: Data is ingested, features are extracted and stored.  The BN training pipeline (orchestrated by Airflow) learns the network structure and parameters. The trained BN is registered in MLflow.  During inference, the primary model makes a prediction, and the BN provides an explanation.  Metrics from both the primary model and the BN are monitored.  Traffic shaping (e.g., using Istio) allows for canary rollouts of new BN versions. Rollback mechanisms are triggered by anomaly detection in BN metrics.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Implementation Strategies\n</h3><p><strong>Python (BN Inference Wrapper):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Kubernetes Deployment (YAML):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Experiment Tracking (Bash):</strong></p><div><pre><code>mlflow experiments create \nmlflow runs create \n\nmlflow model log </code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. Failure Modes &amp; Risk Management\n</h3><ul><li>  BNs can become outdated if the underlying data distribution changes.  Automated retraining pipelines and drift detection are essential.</li><li>  Discrepancies between training and inference features can invalidate BN inferences.  Monitoring feature distributions is crucial.</li><li>  Complex BN inference can introduce latency.  Caching, model optimization, and autoscaling are necessary.</li><li><strong>Incorrect Network Structure:</strong> A poorly designed BN can lead to inaccurate explanations.  Expert review and sensitivity analysis are vital.</li><li> Malicious data can corrupt the BN learning process.  Data validation and anomaly detection are required.</li></ul><p>Mitigation: Implement alerting on BN-specific metrics (e.g., evidence propagation time, marginal probability variance).  Use circuit breakers to isolate failing BN instances.  Automated rollback to previous BN versions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Performance Tuning &amp; System Optimization\n</h3><ul><li>  Optimize BN structure, use efficient inference algorithms (e.g., Variable Elimination), and leverage caching.</li><li>  Horizontal scaling (Kubernetes), batching requests, and vectorization can improve throughput.</li><li><strong>Model Accuracy vs. Infra Cost:</strong>  Regularly evaluate the trade-off between BN complexity and performance.  Consider model pruning or simplification.</li><li>  Parallelize BN training and inference tasks.  Optimize data loading and feature extraction.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  8. Monitoring, Observability &amp; Debugging\n</h3><ul><li>  Inference latency, evidence propagation time, marginal probability variance, number of evidence updates.</li><li>  Visualize BN metrics, track data drift, and monitor model performance.</li><li>  Trace requests through the BN inference service.</li><li>  Monitor data drift and model performance.</li><li>  Trigger alerts on latency spikes, data drift, or unexpected changes in BN behavior.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  9. Security, Policy &amp; Compliance\n</h3><ul><li>  Log all BN training and inference events.</li><li>  Version control BN models, data, and code.</li><li><strong>Secure Model/Data Access:</strong>  Use IAM roles and policies to restrict access to sensitive data and models.</li><li>  Track BN lineage, training parameters, and performance metrics.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  10. CI/CD &amp; Workflow Integration\n</h3><p>GitHub Actions/GitLab CI pipelines can automate BN training, validation, and deployment.  Deployment gates can enforce quality checks (e.g., model performance thresholds, data drift tests).  Automated tests can verify BN functionality and accuracy. Rollback logic can automatically revert to previous BN versions in case of failure. Argo Workflows or Kubeflow Pipelines can orchestrate complex BN pipelines.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Ignoring Conditional Independence Assumptions:</strong>  BNs rely on conditional independence assumptions.  Violating these assumptions can lead to inaccurate inferences.</li><li>  BNs require sufficient data to learn accurate network structures and parameters.</li><li>  Complex BNs can overfit the training data.  Regularization techniques and cross-validation are essential.</li><li><strong>Lack of Domain Expertise:</strong>  BNs often require domain expertise to define the network structure and interpret the results.</li><li><strong>Treating BNs as Black Boxes:</strong>  Failing to understand the underlying reasoning behind BN inferences can lead to misinterpretations and incorrect decisions.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  12. Best Practices at Scale\n</h3><p>Mature ML platforms (e.g., Uber Michelangelo, Spotify Cortex) emphasize modularity, automation, and observability. Scalability patterns include microservices architecture, horizontal scaling, and caching. Tenancy is achieved through resource isolation and access control. Operational cost tracking is essential for optimizing resource utilization.  BNs should be treated as a first-class citizen within the platform, with dedicated infrastructure and tooling.</p><p>Integrating Bayesian Networks into production ML systems is not merely about adding another model; it’s about building a more robust, explainable, and trustworthy ML infrastructure.  By focusing on architecture, observability, and scalable inference, we can unlock the full potential of BNs for risk assessment, compliance, and improved decision-making. Next steps include benchmarking BN performance against alternative explainability techniques, integrating BNs with our automated model monitoring system, and conducting a security audit of our BN infrastructure.  Regular audits and continuous improvement are crucial for maintaining the reliability and effectiveness of our Bayesian Network-powered ML systems.</p>","contentLength":9237,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bidirectional Communication Protocols（1751386811749900）","url":"https://dev.to/member_14fef070/bidirectional-communication-protocols1751386811749900-2d39","date":1751386814,"author":"member_14fef070","guid":179106,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

In this blog, we’re going to walk through an exciting real-world project — deploying a <strong>three-tier Todo List application</strong> on <strong>Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)</strong> using .</p><p>This project is perfect if you're looking to get hands-on experience with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Provisioning infrastructure using Terraform</strong></p></li><li><p> to containerize services</p></li><li><p><strong>Deploying applications on AWS using EKS, ECR, IAM</strong>, and more</p></li></ul><p>We’ll break it down step-by-step — from writing Terraform code to spinning up your Kubernetes cluster, containerizing the frontend, backend, and MongoDB services, and deploying everything seamlessly.</p><p>Whether you're new to DevOps or brushing up on your cloud skills, this guide will help you understand how everything connects in a modern microservices-based deployment.</p><p>So without further ado, let’s get started and bring our infrastructure to life! 🌐🛠️</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔧 <strong>Prerequisites: What You’ll Need Before We Start</strong></h2><p>Before we dive into the fun part — building and deploying — let’s quickly make sure your system is ready for action. Here’s what you’ll need:</p><p>✅ <p>\nIf you don’t already have one, head over to </p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aws.amazon.com</a> and sign up. We’ll be using AWS services like EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and IAM (Identity and Access Management), so having an account is essential.</p><p>✅ <p>\nWe’ll use Docker to containerise the three components of our app: the frontend, backend, and MongoDB database. You can download Docker Desktop from the official Docker website and install it like any other app.</p></p><p>✅ <p>\nTerraform will be our tool of choice for provisioning the infrastructure on AWS. You can download Terraform from </p><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">terraform.io</a>. Just install it — no need to configure anything yet.</p><p>That’s it! Once you have these basics set up, you’re good to go. Let’s start building!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔐 <strong>Step 1: Set Up AWS CLI and IAM User</strong></h2><p>Before Terraform can talk to AWS and spin up resources, we need to set up the  and create an  with the right permissions. Let’s walk through it step-by-step.</p><ul><li> to your AWS account as the root user (the one you used to sign up).</li></ul><ul><li>In the AWS Management Console, go to  and click on .</li></ul><ul><li><p>Give the user a name — something like  works great — and click .</p></li><li><p>On the  page, attach the policy named .</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>⚠️ : We’re giving full admin access here just to avoid permission issues during learning and experimentation. <strong>Never use this approach in production</strong> — always follow the <strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong>!</p></blockquote><ul><li>Click  and then . You’re done with the IAM part!</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  📦 Install AWS CLI (Ubuntu/Linux)\n</h3><p>If you're using , you can install the AWS CLI by running these commands in your terminal:</p><div><pre><code>curl \nunzip awscliv2.zip\n ./aws/install\n</code></pre></div><p>If you're using a different operating system (like macOS or Windows), just head over to the official install guide here:<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CLI Installation Guide</a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔑 Generate Access Keys &amp; Configure AWS CLI\n</h3><ul><li><p>Go back to the  and click on your new user ().</p></li><li><p>Under the  tab, click on .</p></li></ul><ul><li>Choose <strong>Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong> as the use case, agree to the terms, and proceed.</li></ul><ul><li>Once the keys are generated, <strong>copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key</strong> (you’ll need them right away!).</li></ul><p>Now, go to your terminal and configure the AWS CLI:</p><p>It will prompt you to enter:</p><ul><li><p>: You can use  for this demo</p></li><li><p>: Enter </p></li></ul><p>That’s it! Your AWS CLI is now set up and ready to communicate with your AWS account 🚀</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ <strong>Step 2: Install Terraform and Set Up Remote Backend</strong></h2><p>Now that our AWS CLI is ready and configured, let’s install , our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool of choice for this project. We’ll also set up a secure and scalable way to store our Terraform state using an .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  📥 Installing Terraform on Ubuntu (amd64)\n</h3><p>If you're using <strong>Ubuntu on an amd64 system</strong>, follow these commands to install Terraform:</p><div><pre><code>apt-get update apt-get  gnupg software-properties-common\n\nwget  https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \ngpg  |  /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg  /dev/null\n\ndpkg  /etc/os-release  lsb_release  |  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list\n\napt update\napt-get terraform\n</code></pre></div><p>✅ After this, you can verify the installation with:</p><p>🖥️ If you're on a different operating system or architecture, follow the official installation guide here:<a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terraform Install Guide</a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔐 AWS CLI + Terraform: Working Together\n</h3><p>Since we’ve already configured the AWS CLI, Terraform will automatically use the credentials (access key &amp; secret key) stored by . This means you’re ready to provision AWS resources securely and seamlessly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ☁️ Best Practice: Use Remote Backend for Terraform State\n</h3><p>Terraform tracks the state of your infrastructure in a file called . By default, it’s stored locally, but that’s risky and not scalable. So, we’ll follow best practices and store this file remotely in an .</p><p>Here’s how to create an S3 bucket to act as your Terraform :</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🪣 Create an S3 Bucket for State Storage\n</h4><div><pre><code>aws s3api create-bucket  pravesh-terra-state-bucket  us-east-1\n</code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  📜 Enable Versioning for State History\n</h4><div><pre><code>aws s3api put-bucket-versioning  pravesh-terra-state-bucket Enabled\n</code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔐 Enable Default Encryption\n</h4><div><pre><code>aws s3api put-bucket-encryption  pravesh-terra-state-bucket </code></pre></div><p>And that’s it! You now have a secure, versioned, and encrypted S3 bucket ready to store your Terraform state files — a key step toward building a production-grade infrastructure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📦 <strong>Step 3: Clone the Project and Provision Infrastructure with Terraform</strong></h2><p>With all the groundwork done — AWS CLI set up, Terraform installed, and the backend ready — it’s time to move on to the actual project!</p><p>The codebase for our  is available on my GitHub repository:</p><p>To get started, open your terminal and run the following commands:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/3-tier-app-Deployment\n3-tier-app-Deployment/\n</code></pre></div><p>Inside the cloned repo, you'll find a folder named . That’s where all the Terraform magic happens. Navigate into that directory:</p><p>Now initialize the Terraform backend (which we configured to use your S3 bucket earlier):</p><p>This will configure Terraform to use the remote backend for storing the state file. If your bucket name is different from mine (<code>pravesh-terra-state-bucket</code>), make sure to update the name in .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  📁 Understanding the Terraform Code Structure\n</h3><p>Instead of dumping everything into a single  file, I’ve broken the configuration into logical modules for clarity and scalability. Here’s a quick overview:</p><ul><li><p>: Specifies the cloud provider. In our case, it’s AWS (no surprise there!).</p></li><li><p>: Configures Terraform to store state remotely in our S3 bucket.</p></li><li><p>: Creates two public repositories in ECR:  and  for storing Docker images.</p></li><li><p>: Fetches the default VPC and subnet details.</p></li><li><p>: Defines IAM roles:</p><ul><li>One for the EKS cluster (includes )</li><li>One for the Node Group (includes policies like <code>AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy</code>, <code>AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly</code>, and )</li></ul></li><li><p>: Provisions the EKS cluster named .</p></li><li><p>: Creates the worker node group for the cluster with one  EC2 instance.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  ⏳ Apply the Terraform Configuration\n</h3><p>Now we’re ready to provision the infrastructure! Run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>terraform apply </code></pre></div><p>⏱️ This might take , especially since provisioning EKS clusters and node groups can take some time. Be patient — AWS is building your cloud infrastructure behind the scenes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🐳 Push Docker Images to ECR\n</h3><p>Once the infrastructure is up, it’s time to push our Docker images for the frontend and backend to AWS ECR.</p><ul><li>Go to your <strong>AWS Console &gt; ECR &gt; Repositories</strong></li></ul><ul><li><p>Click on the  repository</p></li><li><p>Click on  — AWS will show you four CLI commands   </p></li></ul><p>Now, go to the  folder in your project directory:</p><p>Run each of the four commands one by one to build the image and push it to ECR.</p><p>Repeat the same steps for the  repository:</p><ul><li><p>Go back to </p></li><li><p>Select  and click </p></li></ul><ul><li>Navigate to the backend directory:\n</li></ul><p>Run the ECR commands provided to push the backend Docker image.</p><p>🎉 Once done, your container images will be hosted in your private AWS ECR repositories — ready to be deployed to your EKS cluster!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🌐 <strong>Step 4: Deploy to EKS with kubectl and Set Up Ingress via ALB</strong></h2><p>Now that your EKS cluster and ECR repositories are ready, it’s time to interact with the cluster, deploy your workloads, and expose your application to the internet.

Cloud-native platforms like AWS offer unmatched agility, but they also require a deliberate and structured approach to security and compliance.\nAs companies adopt AWS for mission-critical systems, it’s essential to integrate compliance and risk management into every layer — from architecture to deployment.<p>\nThis article explores proven practices for securing cloud-native environments, particularly during cloud migration, legacy refactoring, and modern software development.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Rethinking IAM: From Open Access to Fine-Grained Control\n</h2><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the bedrock of security in AWS. Yet, many organizations still rely on broad permissions inherited from on-prem or legacy cloud setups.\nDuring cloud migration, it's vital to:</p><ul><li>Scope IAM roles to specific services and workloads.</li><li>Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations to enforce boundaries.</li><li>Continuously analyze permissions using IAM Access Analyzer.</li></ul><p>Refactoring access controls early can prevent privilege creep and reduce the blast radius of potential security incidents.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Encrypt Everything — Intelligently\n</h2><p>Encryption is a regulatory and operational must-have in financial systems — but it should be applied thoughtfully.\nOn AWS, effective encryption includes:</p><ul><li>Customer-managed KMS keys for services like S3, RDS, and EBS.</li><li>TLS enforcement at all entry points (API Gateway, ALB, CloudFront).</li><li>Explicit bucket policies that deny unencrypted uploads.</li></ul><p>During legacy refactoring, it’s not uncommon to discover plaintext storage or services running with weak cipher configurations. Identifying and correcting these patterns is essential for a secure software development lifecycle.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Infrastructure as Code: Compliance at Scale\n</h2><p>Manual configuration of cloud resources introduces risk and inconsistency. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for secure and compliant software development.\nIaC enables:</p><ul><li>Consistent enforcement of security baselines across environments.</li><li>Version control of infrastructure for auditability and rollback.</li><li>Automated validation in CI/CD pipelines.</li></ul><p>In regulated industries, IaC is often the fastest path to audit readiness, particularly when migrating and modernizing complex systems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Continuous Monitoring and Threat Detection\n</h2><p>Security doesn’t end at deployment. Post-migration environments must be actively monitored and assessed.\nRecommended AWS tools include:</p><ul><li>CloudTrail for detailed activity logs.</li><li>Amazon GuardDuty for anomaly detection.</li><li>AWS Config for continuous compliance checks.</li><li>Security Hub for a centralized view of security posture.</li></ul><p>These tools provide visibility into security posture, misconfigurations, and unexpected activity — especially valuable during high-change periods like cloud migration or legacy refactoring.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Designing with Compliance in Mind\n</h2><p>Frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS can guide architectural decisions when applied early in the software development process.\nExamples:</p><ul><li>Role-based access control and MFA help satisfy access control requirements.</li><li>VPC segmentation and resource tagging map directly to asset management policies.</li><li>Centralized logging and alerting support incident response requirements.</li></ul><p>Rather than retrofitting compliance, integrating these controls into design accelerates both development and certification.</p><p>Security and compliance in AWS environments require more than best-effort configurations. They demand clear strategies, automation, and constant validation.\nWhether you're navigating a large-scale cloud migration, working through the challenges of legacy refactoring, or building systems from the ground up, the key is to embed these principles early and evolve them as you scale.<p>\nCloud-native systems in financial services can be both fast and secure — when the foundations are solid.</p></p><p>Stay safe, your OptiTechDev</p>","contentLength":3975,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Deconstructing a Perfect Product Launch: What a Fictional K-Pop Movie Can Teach Us","url":"https://dev.to/aigame/deconstructing-a-perfect-product-launch-what-a-fictional-k-pop-movie-can-teach-us-39f0","date":1751384300,"author":"owen peter","guid":179041,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As developers, designers, and product people, we're constantly thinking about how to launch our projects. How do we build hype? How do we create an authentic experience? How do we turn users into a community?</p><p>Every so often, a project comes along that serves as a perfect blueprint. Today, that project is \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" a fictional animated film. I stumbled upon its landing page and was blown away. It’s not just a movie promo; it's a masterclass in building a universe and launching it with precision.</p><p>Let's break down the key strategies from this fictional campaign that we can apply to our own real-world products, apps, and open-source projects.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The High-Concept Pitch: Clarity Above All\n</h3><p>The first thing you see is the tagline: <strong>\"Where idol dreams meet supernatural destiny.\"</strong></p><p>In a single line, you know  what this is. It's K-pop meets . This immediate clarity is the hook. There’s no jargon, no vague mission statement. The core concept is so strong that it does the heavy lifting.</p><ul><li> Can you describe your app, library, or SaaS product in one, compelling sentence? If you have to explain for a full minute, you may have a messaging problem. A powerful high-concept pitch is your best entry point.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Ecosystem, Not Just the Product\n</h3><p>The \"KPop Demon Hunters\" website isn't just a landing page for a movie. It's a portal to an entire universe.</p><ul><li> Deep lore for those who want to dive in.</li><li> The soundtrack is treated as a first-class product, not an afterthought.</li><li> The site explicitly calls out sections for discussions, fan art, and Discord.</li></ul><p>This isn't just \"selling a movie.\" It's building a world and inviting you to live in it. The product (the movie) is the entry point to a larger ecosystem of content and community.</p><ul><li> Don't just ship your code. Ship the ecosystem. Your  is the start. What about the documentation site? The Discord server for support? The blog for tutorials and case studies? Build a hub, not just a destination.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The \"Authenticity Stack\": Leveraging Real-World Credibility\n</h3><p>This is where the strategy goes from good to brilliant. The project builds trust by integrating authentic talent at every level.</p><p>\nInstead of having one actor do both speaking and singing, they split the roles:</p><ul><li> Professional actors like Arden Cho and Daniel Dae Kim.</li><li> Accomplished K-pop artists and composers like Ejae (aespa, TWICE) and Andrew Choi (NCT 127, Monsta X).</li></ul><p>This decision shows a deep respect for both crafts. It tells the target audience (K-pop fans) that the music isn't a cheap imitation; it's the real deal, made by people who shape the industry.</p><p>\nFeaturing members of a globally recognized group like TWICE is the ultimate stamp of approval. It’s not just a feature; it’s a strategic partnership that provides instant credibility and a massive promotional boost.</p><ul><li> Who are the \"TWICE\" of your domain? If you're building a dev tool, getting a respected developer to contribute or even just use it is invaluable social proof. If you're building a design tool, a collaboration with a well-known designer can be a game-changer. Authenticity is built through genuine partnership.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Engineering Virality and Social Proof\n</h3><p>The campaign doesn't just hope for success; it designs for it.</p><blockquote><p>\nJoin millions of fans in the viral KPop Demon Hunters dance challenge featuring TWICE's soundtrack contribution.</p></blockquote><p>This is a direct call to create user-generated content (UGC), perfectly tailored for platforms like TikTok. It's participatory and shareable by design.</p><p>Furthermore, the site prominently displays success metrics as social proof:</p><ul><li><strong>Debuted at No. 8 on Billboard 200</strong></li><li><strong>No. 1 on Billboard Soundtracks</strong></li><li><strong>Multiple Entries on Spotify Global</strong></li></ul><p>This data transforms a potential viewer's mindset from \"Should I check this out?\" to \"I'm missing out if I don't.\"</p><ul><li> Build shareable moments into your product. For an app, it might be a beautifully designed results screen that users want to post. For a library, it might be a cool demo on CodePen. Then, showcase your traction. GitHub stars, download counts, positive testimonials—these aren't vanity metrics; they are powerful tools for building trust and momentum.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. The UX of Hype: A Flawless Funnel\n</h3><p>Finally, the landing page itself is a masterclass in information architecture and user journey.</p><ol><li> You get the pitch, the brand, and the primary Call-To-Action ().</li><li> The official trailer is right there, offering an instant, low-commitment way to experience the product.</li><li> You can get the quick details (release date, rating) or dive deep into the cast, characters, and story. The user controls their level of engagement.</li><li><ul><li><code>Learn More About The Story</code></li><li><code>Find KPop Demon Hunters Screenings Near You</code></li></ul></li><li> The \"Limited theatrical screenings\" create urgency and make the event feel more exclusive and special.</li></ol><ul><li> Structure your project's landing page or  with the same logic.

Two prominent patterns are MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVT (Model-View-Template).

Let's explore both patterns, their core functions and strength</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding MVC Architecture\n</h2><p>MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. It was originally developed for desktop applications but has been widely adapted for web development.</p><p>: The data layer that manages the application's data, business logic, and rules. It directly manages data, logic, and rules of the application.</p><p>: The presentation layer that displays data to the user. It represents the user interface and handles how information is presented.</p><p>: The intermediary that handles user input, processes requests, and coordinates between Model and View. It acts as the brain of the application.</p><div><pre><code>User Input → Controller → Model (data processing) → Controller → View (presentation)\n</code></pre></div><p>The Controller receives user requests, interacts with the Model to fetch or manipulate data, and then updates the View to display the results.</p><p><strong>Clear Separation of Concerns</strong>: Each component has a distinct responsibility, making code more organized and maintainable.</p><p>: Models can be reused across different controllers and views, promoting code reuse.</p><p>: Each component can be tested independently, improving overall code quality.</p><p>: Different team members can work on different components simultaneously.</p><p>: Changes to one component don't necessarily affect others, allowing for easier modifications.</p><p>: Widely understood and implemented across many frameworks and languages.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding MVT Architecture\n</h2><p>MVT (Model-View-Template) is Django's interpretation of the MVC pattern. It reorganizes the traditional MVC structure to better suit web development needs and Python.</p><p>: Similar to MVC, it handles data structure, database operations, and business logic.</p><p>: Unlike MVC, the View in MVT contains the business logic and acts as the controller. It processes requests and coordinates between Model and Template.</p><p>: The presentation layer that defines how data is displayed. It's Django's equivalent of the View in MVC.</p><div><pre><code>User Request → URL Dispatcher → View → Model (if needed) → Template → Response\n</code></pre></div><p>Django's URL dispatcher routes requests to appropriate views, which then process the request, interact with models, and render templates.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Designed specifically for Django, providing seamless integration with Django's features.</p><p>: Django's template system is more powerful than traditional view systems, with inheritance, filters, and tags.</p><p>: The URL dispatcher provides clean URL routing that's easy to understand and maintain.</p><p>: Aligns well with Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability.</p><p>: Leverages Django's built-in features like ORM, admin interface, and middleware.</p><p>: Optimized for quick development cycles with convention over configuration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Differences Between MVC and MVT\n</h2><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Separate Controller component</td><td>Logic handled by Django framework</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>View handles presentation</td><td>Template handles presentation</td></tr><tr><td>Controller processes requests</td><td>View functions process requests</td></tr><tr><td>URL dispatcher with direct view mapping</td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul><li>: User → Controller → Model → Controller → View</li><li>: User → URL → View → Model → Template</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibility Distribution</strong>:</p><ul><li>: Controller handles business logic</li><li>: View handles business logic, Django handles control flow</li></ul><p><strong>Difference btw MVC and MVT</strong>:</p><ul><li>: Views are often programmatic</li><li>: Templates are declarative with limited logic</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

MVC provides a traditional, widely-understood approach that offers maximum flexibility and control. MVT, on the other hand, is optimized for rapid web development with Django, providing a more streamlined approach that reduces complexity.</p><p>Django's choice of MVT reflects its principle of \"batteries included\" and rapid development. By handling the controller logic internally, Django allows developers to focus on what matters most: building features quickly and efficiently. The MVT pattern works exceptionally well for content-heavy websites, rapid prototyping, and teams that value convention over configuration.</p><p>For Django developers, embracing the MVT pattern means using the framework's full power and philosophy.

In this blog, we’ll explore why more developers are making the switch from JavaScript to TypeScript and why you might want to consider it too.</p><p>TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft It adds optional type annotations, interfaces, and modern JavaScript features, then compiles (transpiles) down to plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or JavaScript environment.</p><p><strong>What does it mean to transpile code?</strong>\nIf you’ve decided to transition from JavaScript to TypeScript, chances are you already understand what it means to compile code. But you might still be wondering: “What in the world does it mean to transpile code?”</p><p>It’s actually nothing far-fetched or complicated. The key difference is that transpiling means converting your code to a different version of the same or a similar language, like TypeScript to JavaScript, or ES6 to ES5. Unlike compiling, which transforms code from a high-level language into a lower-level one (like C to machine code). To help visualize the difference: think of transpiling as two similar languages, like Spanish and Italian which are rooted in Latin and compiling as comparing a language like English with Chinese which have completely different structures and roots. I'll share a few code snippets below to help solidify our understanding of transpilation.<strong>TypeScript (before transpilation)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Transpiled JavaScript (after running )</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With a clear grasp of TypeScript and how transpilation works, it’s time to explore why this language leaves JavaScript in the dust.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How TypeScript Outshines JavaScript in Real Projects\n</h2><p>TypeScript offers many advantages that address common pitfalls in JavaScript. In this section, we’ll walk through each benefit using clear analogies and code examples to show exactly how TypeScript helps solve the pain points JavaScript developers often face.</p><p>Type safety is a common feature in statically typed languages that allows developers to declare variables with specific types. At first, this may feel restrictive or even inconvenient, especially coming from JavaScript’s flexibility. But as we grow as developers and begin working on larger, more complex codebases, the benefits of type safety become clear: </p><ul><li>stronger collaboration across teams.</li></ul><p>Let’s look at a few code snippets that demonstrate how enforcing type safety can make a real difference and why this extra step pays off in the long run.</p><p><strong>Type Safety in Action (TypeScript Example)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let's start with a simple example where we declare a variable intended to store an array of numerical values only. At first, this might seem restrictive or like extra work. But imagine you're working on a team, and someone accidentally tries to push a string into that array.</p><p>In JavaScript, this kind of mistake could easily go unnoticed and cause hard-to-debug errors later.</p><p>With TypeScript, this isn’t a problem. It will immediately flag the issue and refuse to transpile the file until the type mismatch is fixed. TypeScript doesn’t just whisper, it screams when something’s wrong.</p><p>At this point, you might still have some doubts about TypeScript. Maybe you're someone who enjoys working on solo projects and values the flexibility that JavaScript offers. The good news is, TypeScript doesn’t take that freedom away, it simply gives you more control when you need it.</p><p>In fact, if you want to work with arrays that hold different types of values, TypeScript has a perfect solution: tuples. Let’s take a look at how they work.</p><p><strong>Tuple Example in TypeScript</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Using tuples, we can explicitly define what types of values a variable should hold, the exact order they should appear in, and even how many elements the array should contain. Pretty cool, right?</p><p>By now, many of you might be convinced that switching to TypeScript is worth it and honestly, you should be!</p><p>But there's still one issue that some of you might have already spotted.\nYou might be wondering: What if I need 50 or even 100 different tuples with the same structure?<p>\nDo I really have to declare the same tuple type over and over again?</p></p><p>Instead of repeating the tuple type every time, we can follow the DRY principle by creating a reusable type alias.</p><p>Before we dive into an example of type aliases, let’s do a quick refresher on the DRY principle, a key concept for improving the maintainability of our codebases.</p><p>\nDRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself — a core software engineering principle that emphasizes having a single, clear source of truth for each piece of knowledge in a system. This improves maintainability and helps avoid unnecessary duplication.</p><p>In React, we apply the DRY principle through a component-based architecture. By creating reusable, customizable components, we can use the same logic and UI in multiple parts of a project — reducing repetition and making our codebase easier to manage.</p><p><strong>Type Alias Example in TypeScript</strong>\nNow let's take a look at how type aliases help us enforce the DRY principle in our code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the example above, we used a type alias. A popular TypeScript feature that allows developers to define reusable type structures.</p><p>Let’s say we want to reuse an object structure in multiple parts of our code. Instead of rewriting the type each time, we can define it once using a type and then reference it wherever needed. This not only speeds up development but also helps prevent assigning incorrect values to variables, whether by others or by ourselves.</p><p>I’ll drop a link to a TypeScript course at the end of this blog so you can dive into learning this amazing language as soon as possible.</p><p>But for now, let’s keep going with a few more key advantages that TypeScript offers.</p><p>You might already be convinced and that’s great but remember: the title of this section doesn’t just claim that TypeScript is better than JavaScript.\nWe boldly stated that it leaves it in the dust.</p><p>So let’s continue until there’s not even a millimeter of doubt left.</p><p><strong>What are Enums in TypeScript?</strong>\nEnums is short for enumerations and is a feature in TypeScript that allows us to define a set of named constants, essentially giving human-readable names to numeric or string values.</p><p>They help describe a fixed set of possible options for a value.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>TypeScript doesn’t just prevent us (or others) from assigning values of the wrong type to existing variables, it also stops us from adding properties that were never part of the original design.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, this isn’t just a language.\nThis is a tool built to give you full control over your code.</p><p>It’s now clear why TypeScript completely leaves JavaScript behind.</p><p>Good luck on your TypeScript journey! Stay patient and as your projects grow, you'll consistently reap the benefits of this powerful transition.</p>","contentLength":7048,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Network IO Multiplexing Analysis（1751381015282000）","url":"https://dev.to/member_a5799784/network-io-multiplexing-analysis1751381015282000-3oja","date":1751381017,"author":"member_a5799784","guid":178999,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

It was a subtle, insidious issue: a misconfigured  session left running on a production server, silently consuming all available  resources, effectively locking out legitimate SSH connections. This incident underscored a critical truth: in modern infrastructure, particularly on Ubuntu-based systems, mastery of the terminal isn’t just a skill – it’s a foundational requirement for operational excellence.  We operate a hybrid cloud environment, with a significant footprint of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS servers powering our microservices, alongside containerized applications orchestrated by Kubernetes.  The terminal is the common denominator for managing all of it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is \"terminal\" in Ubuntu/Linux context?\n</h2><p>The term \"terminal\" is often used loosely. In the Ubuntu/Linux context, it’s crucial to differentiate between the  and the . The terminal emulator (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole, xterm) is the graphical application providing the interface.  The shell (typically , , or ) is the command-line interpreter that processes your commands.  Underneath both lies the pseudo-terminal (PTY), a pair of character devices () that allows a program to interact with a terminal-like interface.  </p><p>Ubuntu 22.04 defaults to  version 5.1.16.  Key system tools involved include  (managing terminal sessions via ),  (handling PTY device creation), and  (inter-process communication related to terminal state).  Configuration is largely handled through user-specific shell configuration files (, ) and system-wide settings in .  Distro-specific differences are minimal, but Debian-based systems generally adhere to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) more strictly than some other distributions.</p><ol><li> When network connectivity to a server is degraded, but not entirely lost, a terminal session via a console server (e.g., IPMI, iLO) is often the only way to diagnose and remediate the issue.</li><li><code>docker exec -it &lt;container_id&gt; bash</code> is the primary method for interactive debugging within a running container.  Understanding shell internals is vital for effective troubleshooting.</li><li><strong>Cloud Image Customization:</strong>  Using  and shell scripts executed during instance boot to configure servers in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  This requires precise terminal-based configuration.</li><li><strong>Secure Remote Administration:</strong>  Strictly controlling SSH access via  and utilizing tools like  to mitigate brute-force attacks.

You’ve just created a cloud storage container that will hold your website files.</p><p><strong>📁 Step 2: Upload Website Files</strong>\nNext, open your newly created bucket and click on the “Upload” button. You’ll need to upload your static website files — typically index.html, along with folders for CSS, images, and JavaScript.</p><p>It’s important to keep your folder structure consistent so your site behaves the same after upload. Start by uploading the root-level files (like index.html), then add folders like /css, /img, or /js.</p><p>Once all files and folders are selected, click Upload and wait until the upload succeeds.</p><p><strong>🔓 Step 3: Enable Public Access</strong>\nBy default, all files and buckets in S3 are private. To allow users to access your website, you must enable public access to the bucket.</p><p>To do this, go to the Permissions tab of your bucket. Click Edit under “Block public access,” uncheck “Block all public access,” and then confirm your change. AWS may prompt you to type a confirmation statement to avoid accidental misconfiguration.</p><p>Once this is saved, your bucket is now publicly accessible — but we still need to set permissions for each file. That’s where the next step comes in.</p><p><strong>📝 Step 4: Set a Bucket Policy</strong>\nNow let’s configure a bucket policy — a JSON-based configuration that defines who can access your bucket and what actions they can perform.</p><p>In the Permissions tab, scroll down to Bucket policy, click Edit, and paste this policy:</p><div><pre><code>{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"PublicReadGetObject\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": \"*\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace \"your-bucket-name\" with your actual bucket name. This policy gives the public read-only access to all files in your bucket — exactly what we need for a static website.</p><p>Save the policy to apply the settings.</p><p><strong>🌐 Step 5: Enable Static Website Hosting</strong>\nNow for the final touch — let’s tell AWS to serve this bucket as a website.</p><p>Go to the Properties tab of your bucket and scroll down to find Static website hosting. Click Edit, then enable the setting.</p><p>You’ll need to provide the name of your entry file, usually index.html. You can leave the error document field empty or add error.html if your site has one.</p><p>Click Save changes, and AWS will generate a public URL for your website in the format:</p><p><code>ttp://your-bucket-name.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com/</code>\nOpen this link in your browser — and voila! Your website is live and accessible to the world.</p><p>\nAt this point, you’ve completed all the essential steps to host a website on Amazon S3:</p><p>You created a secure bucket\nUploaded all required files<p>\nSet public access and policies</p>\nEnabled static website hosting<p>\nReceived a live link to your project</p>\nYou can now share this link with clients, friends, or on your resume. And next time someone asks how to host a simple website, you’ll be ready!</p><p><strong>💡 Pro Tips (Optional but Helpful)</strong>\nUse IAM roles instead of root access for better security and monitoring.<p>\nEnable versioning on your bucket to track changes and recover deleted files.</p>\nConnect a custom domain via Route 53, and add CloudFront for global speed boost.<p>\nIf needed, create CI/CD pipelines to auto-upload files using GitHub Actions or AWS CLI.</p></p>","contentLength":5676,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Who's hiring — July 2025","url":"https://dev.to/fmerian/whos-hiring-july-2025-d23","date":1751375040,"author":"flo merian","guid":178925,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Product engineers, Developer advocates, or Technical writers?</strong></p><p><strong>If you're looking for a new opportunity in the dev tools space, this post is for you.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  16+ developer-first companies hiring in July 2025\n</h2><p>Below are 16+ open roles in dev-first companies.</p><p><strong>That's a wrap!

Forget about spending weeks writing code from scratch. Now, you can use natural language prompts to create React Native apps. It sounds like science fiction, but it's real, and it's here to stay. This shift is making app development more accessible and  than ever before.</p><h3>Accelerating Mobile App Creation</h3><p><strong>The biggest advantage of using prompts is speed.</strong> Instead of manually coding every component, you describe what you want, and the AI generates the code. This means you can build a basic app in hours instead of weeks. Think about it: you can go from idea to prototype in a single day. This speed is a game-changer for startups and established companies alike. Imagine being able to quickly test new features or create proof-of-concept apps without a huge time investment. It's all about getting to market faster and staying ahead of the competition. This is especially useful when you need to quickly create <a href=\"https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/best-ai-coding-assistant-tools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI code generators</a> to test out different ideas.</p><h3>Bridging Natural Language and Code</h3><p>It used to be that you needed to be fluent in a programming language to build an app. Now, you can use plain English (or any other natural language) to tell the computer what to do. The AI acts as a translator, converting your words into React Native code. This opens up app development to a whole new group of people. Designers, project managers, and even marketers can now contribute to the development process.</p><blockquote>This doesn't mean that developers are obsolete. Instead, it means that their role is changing. They're becoming more like architects, guiding the AI and refining the code it generates. It's a collaborative process where humans and AI work together to build amazing apps.</blockquote><p>Here's a quick look at the steps involved:</p><ol><li>Describe the app's features in natural language.</li><li>The AI generates the React Native code.</li><li>Developers review and refine the code.</li><li>The app is tested and deployed.</li></ol><h2>Unlocking Efficiency in React Native Workflows</h2><h3>Streamlining Iteration with AI</h3><p>Okay, so picture this: you're building a <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">React Native app</a>, and you've got this idea, right? Instead of spending hours coding a prototype, what if you could just  what you want, and AI generates the initial code? That's the dream, and it's getting closer to reality. <strong>AI can now help you iterate faster by automating repetitive tasks and suggesting code improvements.</strong> It's not perfect, but it can definitely speed things up. Think of it like having a junior developer who never sleeps and always suggests the obvious fixes.</p><p>Here's how it might work:</p><ul><li>Describe the feature you want.</li><li>AI generates the basic component structure.</li><li>You tweak and refine the code.</li><li>Repeat until you're happy.</li></ul><blockquote>This approach can drastically reduce the time it takes to get from idea to working prototype. It also allows for quicker experimentation with different UI/UX approaches.</blockquote><h3>From Concept to Cross-Platform Reality</h3><p>React Native already makes cross-platform development easier, but AI can take it to the next level. Imagine feeding your app's design specifications into an AI tool, and it spits out <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iOS Live Activities</a> and Android code that's 80% complete. You still need to do the fine-tuning, but the heavy lifting is done. This means you can focus on the unique aspects of your app and deliver a polished product faster. It's about making the whole process less painful and more efficient.</p><ul><li>Reduced development costs.</li><li>More consistent user experience across platforms.</li></ul><h2>The Future of Mobile Engineering: Prompt to React Native</h2><h3>Empowering Developers with AI-Driven Tools</h3><p>The mobile engineering landscape is changing fast. We're moving beyond traditional coding methods. Now, AI is stepping in to help developers build apps more efficiently. Think about it: less time writing boilerplate code, more time focusing on the . Tools like \"<a href=\"https://codia.ai/code?from=thbk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Codia Code - AI-Powered Pixel-Perfect UI for Web, Mobile &amp; Desktop in Seconds</a>\" are becoming essential. They let you create interfaces quickly, freeing you up to tackle the harder problems.</p><h3>Enhancing User Experiences Through Rapid Prototyping</h3><p><strong>Rapid prototyping is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity.</strong> Users expect apps that are fast, intuitive, and meet their needs perfectly. AI-powered tools are making it easier than ever to create prototypes and test ideas quickly. This means you can get feedback early and often, leading to better apps. Imagine being able to build a working prototype during your commute. That's the power of mobile AI development.</p><blockquote>The ability to quickly iterate on ideas and get user feedback is transforming the way we build mobile apps. It's about creating a continuous loop of improvement, ensuring that the final product is something that users truly love.</blockquote><p>Here's a simple comparison of traditional vs. AI-assisted prototyping:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><p>Imagine a world where making apps is super easy, like drawing a picture.

We’re the TATOMAMO team behind <a href=\"https://kidstime.ai/foodfestival3_pre-order_platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food Festival 3</a>, a family-friendly cooking simulator that’s all about fun, not frustration. In our previous post, we shared how we built a “playable cartoon” look and feel. Today, we’d like to dive into a topic we found even more challenging for mobile game development: how to design an engaging game loop that stays stress-free.</p><p><strong>The Problem with Most Cooking Games</strong>\nMany cooking games or restaurant simulators rely on strict timers, failing customers, and penalties to drive difficulty. While that can be fun for some players, we saw how it turned away younger audiences and families looking for a relaxing user experience. Kids especially can feel anxious about losing, and parents don’t want tantrums over missing a timer by half a second.</p><p>We realized that pressure-based game loop design was at odds with our mission: a cozy, cartoon-style game that feels like a playground.</p><p><a href=\"https://kidstime.ai/foodfestival3_pre-order_platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Core Principles We Followed</a>\n✅ No harsh fail states<p>\nPlayers never get a big red “YOU FAILED” screen. Instead, if they miss an order, the game gently suggests trying again.</p></p><p>✅ Soft time incentives\nWe do use timers, but more as a way to reward speed, not to punish slowness. The dish still gets made, but if you’re faster, you get a little bonus — perfect for family-friendly gameplay.</p><p>✅ Positive reinforcement\nEvery dish, even a “less-than-perfect” one, gets positive feedback. We framed it as, “Hey, you did it! Next time you can make it even better!”</p><p>✅ Low cognitive load\nComplexity builds up very gradually, and levels are bite-sized so kids (and parents) don’t feel overwhelmed.</p><p>Iterations We Tested\nOur first prototype had hard fail states with angry customers storming off. We quickly saw playtesters getting stressed, which damaged their user experience. Instead, we switched to a friendly mascot-style feedback system that cheers you on no matter what. This alone made the gameplay feel stress-free, even if the tasks were still challenging.</p><p>We also removed mandatory upgrades. Many mobile games lock you into upgrades to keep up with higher-level customers, adding hidden pressure. We wanted players to upgrade food trucks because it’s fun, not because they’re forced to.</p><p>What Worked\nBy shifting from “fail or win” to “learn and improve,” we found kids played longer, parents were more comfortable letting them play, and our retention numbers improved. That’s a great lesson for stress-free gameplay design.</p><p>If you’re working on mobile game development for a family audience (or even casual gamers), think about:</p><p>Does failure have to feel punishing?</p><p>Can you reward success without shaming mistakes?</p><p>Are your time constraints motivating, or just anxiety-inducing?</p><p>Final Thoughts\nGames can still be challenging without being stressful. Designing a stress-free game loop takes more work, but the results are worth it — for happier players, stronger user experience, and a brand you can feel proud of.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about our Unity pipeline, or how we built the 3D assets for a family-friendly cooking simulator follow us - <a href=\"https://kidstime.ai/foodfestival3_pre-order_platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">link</a>.</p>","contentLength":3108,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mastering Laravel 12 Conditional Validation","url":"https://dev.to/techsolver94/mastering-laravel-12-conditional-validation-4e5h","date":1751373009,"author":"TechSolve Central","guid":178917,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Laravel 12’s validation system is a powerhouse for ensuring data integrity in web applications.

My goal was to:</p><ul><li>Write a  that sets up Python, dependencies, and the Django project.</li><li>Use  to run both the Django app and a MYSQL database together.</li><li>Set up a reverse proxy using NGINX to expose the app on a clean port (like 8080).</li><li>Make sure everything can be started with just  using .</li></ul><p>This project helped me understand how multi-container apps work, how services interact inside a Docker network, and how to troubleshoot startup issues in web apps.</p><p><strong>1. Forgot to Add Containers to the Same Network</strong><p>\nAt first, my app and NGINX couldn’t talk to each other.I didn’t realize that all related containers need to be on the same Docker network to communicate.This tiny thing cost me a lot of time — everything looked okay, but nothing worked until I added the correct network in the </p>.</p><p><strong>2. Database Connection Problems</strong><p>\nMy Django app kept throwing errors when trying to connect to MySQL. After a lot of digging, I found out it was due to small things like incorrect hostnames or missing environment variables.One wrong word in the DB settings was enough to break everything.Lesson learned: always double-check your database config.</p></p><p><strong>3. Used Wrong Name in NGINX Config</strong><p>\nIn the NGINX config, I accidentally used the container name instead of the service name from the Docker Compose file.This gave me “bad gateway” errors. I didn’t know at the time that NGINX looks for the </p>, not the container name, when it tries to connect. It seems obvious now, but it wasn’t when I first started — and that’s okay.</p><p><strong>1. Docker Network Confusion</strong>, I make sure that all services are assigned to a common network — even if it seems optional at first.This way, containers can talk to each other smoothly without throwing “connection refused” errors.<p>\nHere's a small reminder I use now:</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>2. MySQL Connection Troubles</strong>\nA small typo in your environment variable (like , , or ) can ruin your day. I spent hours figuring out that my Django app couldn’t talk to  just because I had a wrong key in the env file. Now I double-check every setting and make sure all configs match between app and database.</p><p><strong>3. NGNIX Configuration Issue</strong>\nIn the beginning, I was giving the service name inside the  config, like:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Which didn’t work.\nSo I changed it to:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here’s how the app looks running inside Docker containers:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffuwfhhqjiqwhjitxzrgs.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffuwfhhqjiqwhjitxzrgs.png\" alt=\"Containerize the Django App\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Project -2: Java Maven-Based Application\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔧 What I Tried to Do (Java Maven App)\n</h4><p>After successfully containerizing my Django app, I wanted to push myself a little further — this time by working with a Java-based Maven application. The idea was to set up everything inside Docker and manage it through Docker Compose, just like I did with the Django app.But this project came with its own set of new learning curves. Unlike Python, Java applications involve build steps using Maven, so I had to:</p><ul><li>Write a custom Dockerfile that builds the app using Maven and then runs the JAR file.</li><li>Handle MySQL integration inside containers (again), but with a slightly different config structure.</li><li>Configure NGINX to reverse proxy requests to the Java backend.</li></ul><p>One of the most confusing parts was figuring out <strong>where the database settings were written</strong> in the Java Maven project. In Django, it's easy to find — it's in .

Now it's time to enhance our CMS with more advanced features to improve user experience: search capabilities, filtering options, and pagination. These features must be implemented at both the backend and frontend levels to ensure smooth, efficient operation. Let's begin by setting up the server-side infrastructure needed to support these new functionalities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Building the Backend Foundation: Search, Filter, and Pagination Infrastructure\n</h2><p>Okay, for pagination we will need to get from the frontend page number and rows per page; for search, we will get a string (we will search in titles and subtitles); for filters, we will wait for status, language, and date range (you can add any filters you need). Great, now we can start with the posts controller.</p><ul><li>we will wait for additional data from the URL query, and in this case, we need to modify the \"getPostsList\" function. Get all the data that we mentioned earlier from the request value, setting default values where it is possible. Send those values as params into our model, and return as a response all the data to the client;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>open our \"posts.model.js\" file and find the \"getPostsList\" function;</p></li><li><p>we need to add new checkers and filters, and modify our main query;</p></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And that's it, we prepared our server for additional functionality, and now can move to the frontend part.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Crafting the User Interface: Implementing Interactive Search and Navigation Components\n</h2><p>It was fast with the backend and now let's jump into the frontend part, but previously, please, create a few more posts for testing purposes.</p><ul><li>modify the \"getPostsList\" function from the \"posts.services.js\" file that we use to call the \"posts\" endpoint;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>we will store all the filters and search fields data in the \"Redux\" storage, in that case, we need to add additional functionality and state values to the \"posts\" storage;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>apply \"Search\" functionality to our \"Search\" field inside the \"PostsAction.component.jsx\" file. Add the \"onClick\" event to the \"Search\" button, create a new \"applySearch\" function that will send all necessary params to the endpoint, and update our \"posts list\" with data from the response;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>create new \"filters\" modal type with date pickers, status and language dropdowns, also we will add \"Apply\" and \"Clear Filters\" buttons, all these fields will modify data from storage, and the \"Apply\" button will call the same function that we are using on the search button (I will not copy-paste this component because that will be more than 200 lines of code, you can develop this feature by your own or check in my repo). In my case, it will look like this:</li></ul><p>Nice, and the last feature that we need to finish, is our pagination. We will use the \"TablePagination\" component from the MUI library, it's an awesome solution with minimum effort.</p><ul><li>import the \"TablePagination\" component from MUI;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>add pagination component at the bottom of the table, and define necessary values like \"total posts amount\", \"page number\", \"rows per page\", and events that will call predefined functions on some values change;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>add two functions that will update \"page\" and \"rowsPerPage\" values;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>add set \"useEffect\" hook, that will fetch posts data if page or ros amount were updated;\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Nice, we finished with pagination, now we can relaunch our app, and check the results.</p><p>In this tutorial, we've enhanced our Content Management System by implementing advanced search, filtering, and pagination features. By carefully designing both backend and frontend components, we've created a more dynamic and user-friendly content management experience. These improvements transform our CMS from a basic listing tool into a powerful platform that allows users to efficiently navigate and discover content. The implementation demonstrates the importance integration between server-side logic and client-side interfaces, showcasing how modern web technologies like React and Node.js can work together to create content management solutions.

Here are ten tips to help you get the most out of combining Alpine.js with Phoenix LiveView.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use  to preserve Alpine state\n</h3><p>LiveView patches can wipe out Alpine component state. To prevent this, wrap Alpine-controlled elements with  so that LiveView skips updating them. This allows Alpine to retain its state and reactive bindings across patches.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Re-initialize Alpine components after LiveView DOM updates\n</h3><p>When LiveView updates the DOM and adds new Alpine-powered elements, you may need to re-initialize Alpine. You can do this with  inside a LiveView hook's  or  callback.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Alpine for UI interactivity, LiveView for state\n</h3><p>Let Alpine handle UI-only interactions like toggling dropdowns or modals, and delegate shared state or server-side logic to LiveView. This keeps responsibilities clearly separated and avoids complexity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Leverage  with LiveView forms\n</h3><p>You can use Alpine’s  alongside LiveView forms. Inputs can still emit  or  events while Alpine manages local two-way bindings. This is useful for real-time validation or preview updates.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dispatch LiveView events from Alpine\n</h3><p>Use Alpine’s event system to trigger LiveView events. You can dispatch a  that bubbles up and is caught by , , or other handlers. This lets Alpine-driven interactions communicate with the server.</p><p>Alpine’s  directive is great for performing client-side setup like setting focus or initializing values when a component mounts. This runs once after the Alpine component is initialized.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Add Alpine transitions to LiveView content\n</h3><p>Alpine’s  directives add smooth enter/exit animations. This helps soften LiveView DOM changes that show/hide content, such as flash messages or modals.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use LiveView hooks for Alpine coordination\n</h3><p>Create LiveView hooks to coordinate with Alpine when the DOM updates. For example, re-initialize Alpine components after an update using  inside a hook’s  method.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Avoid DOM conflicts by isolating concerns\n</h3><p>Make sure Alpine and LiveView don’t fight over the same DOM. Use proper scoping and  where necessary to isolate Alpine-managed parts from LiveView patches.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Test interop edge cases carefully\n</h3><p>When combining Alpine and LiveView, be cautious about DOM updates, race conditions, and duplicated events. Use LiveView test tools and browser debugging to ensure the hybrid behavior works reliably.</p><p>By combining Alpine.js with Phoenix LiveView, you get the best of both worlds: rich, reactive interfaces without a full SPA. Alpine adds a sprinkle of JavaScript where you need it, while LiveView keeps your app scalable, maintainable, and fast.</p>","contentLength":2900,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🧩 From REST to Events: Why Event-Driven Microservices Are the Upgrade You Didn’t Know You Needed","url":"https://dev.to/niel_morphius/from-rest-to-events-why-event-driven-microservices-are-the-upgrade-you-didnt-know-you-needed-p8k","date":1751369995,"author":"Moses Daniel Kwaknat","guid":178888,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>Building scalable systems today isn’t about throwing more servers at the problem, it’s about rethinking how your services talk to each other.</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve ever been burned by tightly coupled REST calls in a microservice architecture, long chains of service-to-service calls, failed transactions halfway through, retry hell, you’re not alone.</p><p>Been there.

While this works well for isolated sessions, there are many situations where LiveView processes need to share or coordinate state. Redis can serve as a fast, reliable bridge between LiveView sessions, enabling shared counters, collaborative editing, global feature toggles, and more. Here are ten tips for effectively integrating Redis into your LiveView applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Redis for global counters across sessions\n</h3><p>One of the simplest and most effective ways to use Redis is for global counters. Whether you are tracking active users, page views, or real-time votes, Redis allows for atomic increment and decrement operations. Using <code>Redix.command(conn, [\"INCR\", \"liveview:counter\"])</code> from your LiveView lets multiple users interact with the same state without race conditions. Pair this with PubSub broadcasts to push the updated count to all connected LiveViews in real time.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Back shared form state with Redis in collaborative UIs\n</h3><p>In collaborative apps where users fill out forms or work on shared documents together, Redis can act as a central store for intermediate state. Each keystroke or selection can be pushed to Redis with  and read by all other sessions working on the same resource. This makes it easier to support real-time collaboration features like co-editing or watching someone else’s cursor move across a form.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Set expiration times to manage temporary state\n</h3><p>Redis keys support expiration out of the box. Use  to store temporary values like verification codes, onboarding progress, or one-time tokens that should disappear after a short time. This keeps your data layer clean and allows LiveViews to reference ephemeral state without needing to create dedicated database tables or cleanup jobs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Leverage Redis PubSub for lightweight broadcasting\n</h3><p>While Phoenix has excellent built-in PubSub, Redis also provides a cross-platform publish and subscribe system. You can use Redis PubSub to push updates to worker nodes, non-Phoenix services, or third-party integrations. This is especially useful in polyglot systems where Elixir is just one part of the backend stack.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use JSON encoding for structured state\n</h3><p>When storing more complex state in Redis, always serialize it as JSON. This makes the data human-readable and portable. You can use  in Elixir to safely round-trip maps and structs through Redis. This approach helps when syncing structured UI state across multiple LiveViews, such as configuration panels or dashboards.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Avoid bottlenecks by namespacing keys\n</h3><p>When storing data in Redis, choose your key names carefully. Use consistent namespacing like  or <code>dashboard:project456:settings</code>. This prevents conflicts and helps you selectively delete or update related groups of keys. It also makes debugging and monitoring easier, as you can filter keys by namespace patterns.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Redis as a feature toggle backend\n</h3><p>For applications with live feature rollout needs, Redis can be used to manage toggles in real time. Set boolean flags like  or  in Redis and check them inside your LiveView mount functions. Because Redis updates are fast and in-memory, changes to toggles take effect across all users almost instantly without needing a redeploy.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Handle Redis disconnects with backoff and retry\n</h3><p>Redis is fast but not immune to failure. Always wrap your Redis interactions in retry logic, especially for writes that must succeed. Use exponential backoff and structured error logging to handle timeouts or connection issues gracefully. This ensures your LiveViews continue to function even when Redis becomes temporarily unavailable.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Watch Redis keys for change detection\n</h3><p>Although Redis does not natively support watching keys for change notifications in the same way a database might, you can simulate this using Redis PubSub. When one LiveView updates a key, it can publish a message on a related channel. Other LiveViews subscribed to that channel can then fetch the updated value from Redis and refresh their UI accordingly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Redis to share presence-like data outside Phoenix Presence\n</h3><p>Phoenix Presence is a great tool, but it can be overkill in some scenarios. If you need lightweight tracking of which users are viewing a page or working on a document, consider using a Redis set. Each LiveView can add its user ID to a set on mount and remove it on terminate. This pattern works well for presence outside of traditional channels, especially in systems that mix Phoenix and non-Phoenix clients.</p><p>By introducing Redis into your Phoenix LiveView stack, you gain access to a shared, fast state layer that is well-suited for real-time features, cross-session coordination, and integration with other services. It complements the LiveView process model and allows your app to scale horizontally while keeping UIs consistent and synchronized.</p>","contentLength":5006,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Agents, Clearly Explained","url":"https://dev.to/giri_f_437ca53c03d2fffb79/ai-agents-clearly-explained-156n","date":1751369908,"author":"Giri F","guid":178886,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Unlocking the Power of AI Agents: A Beginner's Guide</strong></p><p>Are you tired of feeling overwhelmed by the technical jargon surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

To illustrate this concept, let's consider an example where we add multiple steps to the workflow, including accessing weather data via an API and using a text-to-audio model to speak the answer.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong></p><p>You might have come across the term RAG, which stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. In simple terms, RAG is a process that helps AI models look things up before answering, like accessing your calendar or weather service. Think of it as a type of AI workflow.</p><p><strong>Real-World Example: Creating an AI Workflow</strong></p><p>Let's create a simple AI workflow using Make.com, where we compile links to news articles in Google Sheets, summarize them using Perplexity, and draft LinkedIn and Instagram posts using Claude. This workflow follows a predefined path set by us, with each step building upon the previous one.</p><p>Now, let's introduce the game-changer: AI agents. To become an AI agent, our workflow needs to replace human decision-making with LLMs. In other words, the AI agent must reason and act autonomously.</p><p>The three key traits of AI agents are:</p><ol><li>: The AI agent determines the best approach to achieve a goal.</li><li>: The AI agent takes action using tools to produce an interim result.</li><li>: The AI agent observes the interim result and decides whether iterations are required to produce a final output that achieves the initial goal.</li></ol><p><strong>Real-World Example: Andrew's Demo Website</strong></p><p>Let's explore a real-world example of an AI agent in action. Andrew, a prominent figure in AI, created a demo website that illustrates how an AI agent works. When you search for a keyword like \"skier,\" the AI vision agent reasons what a skier looks like and then acts by looking at video footage to identify the skier.</p><p>In conclusion, our journey through the three levels of AI has shown us that AI agents are not just a buzzword, but a powerful tool that can revolutionize the way we interact with technology. By understanding how LLMs, AI workflows, and AI agents work together, we can unlock new possibilities for automation, innovation, and productivity.</p><p>Whether you're a beginner or an expert in AI, I hope this article has provided you with a deeper understanding of AI agents and their capabilities.

You're not alone. As someone who uses AI tools regularly but lacks a technical background, you want to understand how AI agents work and how they can impact your life. In this post, we'll embark on a simple three-level learning journey to explore the world of AI agents, using relatable examples and avoiding jargon.</p><p><strong>Level 1: Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong></p><p>Let's start with popular AI chatbots like CHBT, Google Gemini, and Claude. These applications are built on top of LLMs, which are fantastic at generating and editing text. Here's how it works: you provide an input, and the LLM produces an output based on its training data. For instance, if you ask a chatbot to draft an email, your prompt is the input, and the resulting email is the output.</p><p>However, LLMs have two key limitations:</p><ol><li>: Despite being trained on vast amounts of data, they lack access to proprietary information like personal or internal company data.</li><li>: LLMs wait for your prompt and respond; they don't take initiative or make decisions on their own.</li></ol><p>Keep these traits in mind as we move forward.</p><p>Let's build on our example. What if you told the LLM to perform a search query and fetch data from your Google calendar before providing a response? With this logic implemented, the next time you ask about a personal event, the LLM will first check your calendar and then provide an answer.</p><p>Here's where it gets interesting:</p><ul><li>: AI workflows can only follow predefined paths set by humans. If you want to get technical, this path is also called the control logic.</li><li>: Even if you add multiple steps to the workflow, it's still just an AI workflow. The human decision-maker remains in control.</li></ul><p>You might have heard of terms like \"retrieval augmented generation\" (RAG). In simple terms, RAG is a process that helps AI models look things up before answering, like accessing your calendar or a weather service. Essentially, RAG is just a type of AI workflow.</p><p><strong>Real-World Example: Creating an AI Workflow</strong></p><p>Let's say you want to create social media posts based on news articles. You can use tools like Make.com to compile links to news articles in Google Sheets, summarize them using Perplexity, and then draft LinkedIn and Instagram posts using Claude. This is an example of an AI workflow because it follows a predefined path set by you.</p><p>However, if you test this workflow and don't like the final output, you'll need to manually go back and rewrite the prompt for Claude. This trial-and-error iteration is currently being done by you, a human.</p><p>So, what's the difference between an AI workflow and an AI agent? The key change is that an AI agent must  and  autonomously. In other words, the AI agent replaces the human decision-maker.</p><p>Using our previous example, an AI agent would:</p><ol><li>: Determine the most efficient way to compile news articles, such as using Google Sheets instead of Microsoft Word.</li><li>: Take action using tools like Perplexity and Claude to produce an interim result.</li><li>: Autonomously refine the output until it meets the desired criteria.</li></ol><p>The most common configuration for AI agents is the React framework, which allows them to reason and act in a flexible and adaptive way.</p><p><strong>Real-World Example: An AI Agent in Action</strong></p><p>Andrew, a prominent figure in AI, created a demo website that illustrates how an AI agent works. When you search for a keyword like \"skier,\" the AI vision agent in the background reasons what a skier looks like and then acts by looking at clips in video footage, trying to identify what it thinks a skier is, indexing that clip, and returning it to you.</p><p>This might not seem impressive at first, but remember that an AI agent did all this without human intervention. The programming behind the scenes is complex, but that's the point – the average user wants a simple app that just works.</p><p>In summary, we've covered three levels of AI:</p><ol><li>: Provide input and receive output based on training data.</li><li>: Follow predefined paths set by humans, with limited flexibility.</li><li>: Reason and act autonomously, iterating until a desired outcome is achieved.</li></ol><p>By understanding these levels, you'll be better equipped to harness the power of AI agents in your personal and professional life.

For developers building crypto-related applications, these sustained inflows indicate growing institutional API demands and infrastructure requirements.</p>\nThe distribution across providers tells an interesting story: BlackRock's IBIT captured $1.31 billion, Fidelity's FBTC added $504.4 million, and Ark/21 Shares' ARKB contributed $268.1 million. This diversification suggests that institutional-grade applications need to support multiple provider integrations and data feeds.\nThe institutional adoption of Bitcoin through ETF structures creates several technical considerations:</p><p>API Scalability: Over the past three weeks, cumulative inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs have now reached $4.63 billion. This volume suggests increasing demands on market data APIs and trading infrastructure.\nData Quality: Most Bitcoin ETF inflows are driven by long-only fundamental investors, not short-term traders, according to industry analysis. This indicates that institutional applications require different data granularity and historical analysis capabilities compared to retail trading platforms.<p>\nRegulatory Compliance: The ETF structure provides regulatory clarity that influences application architecture decisions, particularly around KYC/AML implementations and reporting requirements.</p></p><p>Market Data Considerations\nSince Bitcoin ETFs launched 18 months ago, they've attracted over $40 billion in total inflows. This institutional adoption creates opportunities for developers building:</p><p>Portfolio management tools for institutional clients\nRisk management systems for crypto exposure<p>\nData analytics platforms for institutional research</p>\nTrading infrastructure supporting large-volume transactions</p><p>The Ubleu Perspective\nAt Ubleu, we recognize that institutional adoption fundamentally changes the technical requirements for crypto-related applications. The sustained ETF inflows indicate that developers need to prioritize enterprise-grade solutions over purely retail-focused products.<p>\nThe weekly $501 million Friday inflow demonstrates that institutional trading patterns differ significantly from retail behavior.

Until recently, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) were the primary means of facilitating this interaction. However, in late 2024, Anthropic introduced a game-changing open standard protocol called Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is revolutionizing the way applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this article, we'll delve into the world of MCP and APIs, exploring their similarities and differences, and examining how MCP is poised to transform the AI landscape.</p><p><strong>What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?</strong></p><p>Imagine a USB-C port for your AI applications – that's essentially what MCP represents. It standardizes connections between AI applications, LLMs, and external data sources, allowing them to communicate seamlessly. Just as a laptop's USB-C ports can accommodate various peripherals, MCP enables AI agents to interact with diverse services and tools using a common protocol.</p><p>At its core, MCP consists of an MCP host that runs multiple MCP clients. Each client opens a JSON RPC 2.0 session, connecting to external MCP servers via the MCP protocol. This client-server relationship exposes capabilities such as database access, code repositories, or email servers. The architecture is designed to address two primary needs of LLM applications: providing contextual data and enabling tool usage.</p><p>MCP offers three key primitives:</p><ol><li>: Discrete actions or functions that AI agents can call, such as a weather service or calendar integration.</li><li>: Read-only data items or documents that servers can provide on demand, like text files or database schema.</li><li>: Predefined templates providing suggested prompts.</li></ol><p>MCP servers advertise their available primitives, allowing AI agents to discover and invoke new capabilities at runtime without requiring code redeployment. This dynamic discovery mechanism is a significant advantage of MCP, enabling AI agents to adapt to changing server capabilities.</p><p><strong>APIs: A Traditional Approach</strong></p><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are another way for systems to access external functionality or data. APIs act as an abstraction layer, hiding internal details and providing a standardized interface for requesting information or services. RESTful APIs, in particular, have become the de facto standard for web-based interactions.</p><p>However, APIs were not designed specifically with AI or LLMs in mind, which means they lack certain assumptions that are useful for AI applications. Traditional REST APIs do not typically expose runtime discovery mechanisms, requiring clients to be updated manually when new endpoints are added.</p><p><strong>MCP vs. APIs: Similarities and Differences</strong></p><p>While both MCP and APIs employ client-server architectures and provide abstraction layers, there are significant differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Purpose-built vs. General-purpose</strong>: MCP is designed specifically for LLM applications, whereas APIs are more general-purpose.</li><li>: MCP supports runtime discovery of available capabilities, whereas traditional REST APIs do not.</li><li>: Every MCP server speaks the same protocol and follows the same patterns, whereas each API is unique.</li></ul><p>Interestingly, many MCP servers actually use traditional APIs under the hood to perform their work. This means that MCP and APIs are not mutually exclusive; instead, they can coexist as layers in an AI stack, with MCP providing a more AI-friendly interface on top of existing APIs.</p><p><strong>The Future of AI Integration</strong></p><p>As MCP continues to gain traction, we can expect to see a growing list of services integrated into AI agents using this standardized protocol. From file systems and Google Maps to Docker and Spotify, the possibilities for AI-powered applications are vast. By unlocking the power of MCP, developers can create more sophisticated AI models that interact seamlessly with external data sources and tools, paving the way for a new era of innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.</p><p>In conclusion, Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant leap forward in AI integration, offering a standardized and purpose-built solution for LLM applications. By understanding the similarities and differences between MCP and APIs, developers can harness the power of this emerging technology to create more intelligent, adaptive, and connected AI systems. As we embark on this exciting journey, one thing is clear: the future of AI has never looked brighter.</p>","contentLength":4569,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Understanding Content Security Policy (CSP) in JavaScript Apps","url":"https://dev.to/muhayminbinmehmood/understanding-content-security-policy-csp-in-javascript-apps-437l","date":1751366340,"author":"Muhaymin Bin Mehmood","guid":178862,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey folks, let’s dive into Content Security Policy (CSP) — a powerful yet often misunderstood tool that helps you lock down where your app can load resources from, protecting against XSS, click‑jacking, and more.</p><p>CSP is a browser‐enforced set of rules—sent via HTTP headers (or  tags)—that defines which sources your app can load scripts, stylesheets, images, frames, and other resources from</p><div><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' example.com;\n</code></pre></div><p>By default, only load assets from the same origin\nImages can also come from </p><ol><li>Block XSS attacks – Restrict script sources so injected code can’t run</li><li>Block click‑jacking – Prevent framing via frame-ancestors</li><li>Enforce HTTPS – Use upgrade-insecure-requests to force secure loads</li><li>Boost trust – Shows users you care about security</li></ol><ul><li>default-src – default fallback for everything</li><li>script-src, style-src, img-src, connect-src, etc. – control specific asset types </li><li>object-src 'none' – block Flash &amp; plugins</li><li>frame-ancestors 'none' – prevent embedding (stronger than X-Frame-Options)</li></ul><p>👉 Want to see the full breakdown with real‑world examples, error cases, and extra tips?

When your phone mirrors your motions so closely, it stops feeling like a tool and begins to feel like a well-tuned extension of your touch.\nThese changes affect every corner of the interface. Notification banners slide in with gentle expansiveness. Control Center panels collapse and expand smoothly. Even split view on an iPad or a Mac feels more integrated. This cohesion reinforces the sense that the iOS 26 user experience is more immersive and emotionally engaging.</p><p><strong>Everyday Interactions That Feel Natural</strong></p><p>Dig into Messages, Mail or Calendar and you will notice something familiar yet different. Transitions move more fluidly, replacing stuttery animations with something more responsive. Imagine opening a Message thread and seeing each bubble expand softly then return to its place. Widgets update at just the right moment. Schedules on the lock screen appear organically as your day changes rather than popping in suddenly.\nThese are not headline features. They are subtle refinements that align the system with human gestures. Each moment of interaction feels intentional and gentle. The result is that seemingly small changes have an outsized impact on how smooth your daily experience feels. Together, they create a more polished and intuitive iOS 26 user experience.</p><p><strong>Intelligence That Works with Your Rhythm</strong></p><p>This update is also about making your phone adapt to you rather than forcing you to adapt to the phone. With on-device intelligence built right into the system, capabilities like Smart Summaries in Safari and Mail now work instantly and privately. When you open a long email, a summary appears above it so you grasp the main point quickly. If you are reading an article you do not have time for, you can ask for a summary without sending anything to the cloud.\nLive translation within Messages and FaceTime feels nearly magical. Reply to a friend in another language and the suggestion appears instantly. All this happens offline. Apple trusts its on device models to deliver speed without compromising your privacy. This level of personal adaptation is central to the iOS 26 user experience and helps your phone feel like it knows you.</p><p><strong>Building Inclusivity Through Design</strong></p><p>Apple has long emphasized accessibility. With iOS 26, the company has raised the bar again. Voice Control responds faster when you speak, reducing the delay that might break your flow. Visual enhancements optimize contrast and font size based on screen conditions and app context. Live Speech captions spoken words across FaceTime and in meetings with improved clarity.\nThese upgrades make the system easier to use for more people. The keyboard gains smarter autocorrections. Text-to-speech reads messages in a more natural tone. Visual focus shifts intelligently when VoiceOver is on. Even on a visual level, the Liquid Glass design supports these improvements, helping elements stand out clearly without needing extra setup. This approach promotes inclusion not as a feature but as a core element of the latest iOS.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Apple provided developers with tools to bring these changes into third-party apps. In Xcode 26, developers find a new component set that embraces Liquid Glass visuals. SwiftUI now supports dynamically adaptive layouts and interactive translucency without writing complex rendering code. The system bridges the design between Apple’s apps and what users build on their own.\nImagine a photo editing app that animates button feedback as you scroll, or a finance app that smoothly updates balance figures as you swipe down. With these tools, developers can spotlight transitions in meaningful ways and match system-level polish. This alignment across apps builds consistency in the iOS 26 user experience.</p><p><strong>A Philosophical Shift in User Experience</strong></p><p>A feature-based update often lists what is new. iOS v26 is different. It is less about features and more about how everything feels. Apple has shifted toward experience being the hero. So rather than showcasing a dozen additions, the message to iPhone users is that their phone understands their rhythm, their intent, and their subtle touches.\nThe emphasis on emotional design echoes through every area of the system. From the lock screen to Safari, from translation to email summaries, the goal is the same: seamless interaction that feels human. That shift is why the iOS 26 user experience is poised to influence design across platforms and brands in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>How Qwegle Observes UX Evolution</strong></p><p>At <a href=\"http://qwegle.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Qwegle</a>, we follow changes like this not because they are exciting, but because they signal a shift in user expectations. Our experts study how small refinements like animation timing, gesture feedback, and micro interactions can improve engagement. We watch how developers adopt Apple’s tools to create consistent  experiences. These insights help our team guide clients in modern and intuitive designs.\nOur approach to UX is grounded in observing how real people use these design updates in daily life. We look at how updated UI elements affect user experience, reduce errors, and support accessibility. By keeping track of these factors, Qwegle can advise on product design that meets the new standard set by iOS 26's user experience.</p><p><strong>How to Explore It Yourself</strong></p><p>You do not need to wait until the public release to feel the change. The new iOS beta showcases responsive widgets, adaptive animations, translucent menus, and Smart Summaries in action. Play with the lock screen to see dynamic scheduling adaptation. Switch between apps to feel the fluidity in transitions.\nConsider installing a third-party app that uses translucent controls and motion. Watch how it aligns with system-level elements. If you are a designer or developer consider exploring Liquid Glass visuals in SwiftUI. You can learn how building consistent gestures, animations and visual depth can elevate your own app’s feel. The iOS 26 user experience sets a new bar not just for system apps but the apps people use every day.</p><p><strong>Looking Ahead to Broader Impact</strong></p><p>What starts with iOS 26 will likely ripple through software ecosystems. Android and cross-platform tools such as Flutter or React Native will feel pressure to increase the performance of animations and layer depth to match this level of emotional intelligence. Websites and web apps may adapt their scroll and hover effects to echo this same feel. In education, finance, retail, or healthcare apps, designers will begin to rethink how subtle animation and on‐device summarization can improve real tasks.\nThe result will be a more coherent user experience across digital products and platforms. Apple’s iOS 26 user experience update is just the beginning of a shift toward emotionally tuned design powered by on-device intelligence and fluid interfaces that feel alive.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Technology That Understands You</strong></p><p>With iOS 26 Apple has crafted an experience that feels personal and intuitive. Visual depth, smooth transitions, live intelligence, and improved accessibility transform everyday use into moments of connection. Your phone no longer feels like a machine. It becomes more like a trusted assistant that adapts to your touch and understands your needs.\nIn this new phase of digital interaction, design becomes an invisible partner. The latest iOS marks a step forward in making technology feel less technical. It offers not just tools but companionship in your day. And that nearly human quality could define the next decade of personal device interaction.</p>","contentLength":8269,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Instantly online AI agents","url":"https://dev.to/phillyharper/instantly-online-ai-agents-2glk","date":1751366261,"author":"Phil Harper","guid":178850,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>Skip the deployment headaches and get your AI agent chatting with real users instantly</em></p><p>Testing AI agents is hard because they need .

Not just “does it respond nicely,” but can it be tricked, misused, or pushed beyond its limits?</p><p>In 2025, red teaming has become a crucial part of building and deploying any system that generates responses, makes decisions, or interacts with users. It’s no longer just a checkbox for security teams. Developers, builders, and researchers now need to think like adversaries—because someone else eventually will.</p><p>That’s where red teaming tools come in. They help you test your system the way it will be tested in the wild—whether it’s a chatbot, a document assistant, a search tool, or an agent navigating multi-step workflows.</p><p>In this post, we’re breaking down four standout tools that do this job in different ways:\nPromptfoo, DeepTeam, PyRIT, and Garak.</p><p>This post isn’t a feature checklist or a sales pitch. It’s just a practical breakdown of what each tool does, who it’s built for, and where it makes sense to use it.</p><p>There’s no shortage of tools out there claiming to “test” your system. But these four have earned their spot by actually getting used—in real workflows, by real teams. Each takes a different route to the same goal: figuring out where your system might break when it matters most.</p><p>If you're building with constant iteration—pull requests, nightly tests, CI pipelines—Promptfoo fits right in. It doesn’t just throw canned prompts at your app. It digs into how your system works, then generates test cases tailored to your setup.</p><p>Whether it’s a chatbot, a RAG pipeline, or a multi-turn agent, Promptfoo builds prompts that make sense for what you built. Plus, it works cleanly with GitHub Actions, terminal scripts, or even a web-based dashboard if you want to see everything side-by-side.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa8nu2077iwy38v2obadc.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa8nu2077iwy38v2obadc.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\"></a></p><p>DeepTeam is what you grab when you want to throw a wide net—fast. It comes preloaded with a long list of common vulnerabilities and the tools to try and trigger them. The setup is quick, the results are readable, and it doesn’t ask much of you to get started.</p><p>It’s especially useful if you need a simple way to scan for known red flags across typical use cases. Think of it as a solid, out-of-the-box safety check.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F488ns61ass24xenwz6w6.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F488ns61ass24xenwz6w6.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\"></a></p><p>PyRIT is for people who go deep. Built to scale and designed for flexibility, it’s less of a “tool” and more of a full-on framework. You can write your own test logic, chain together attack steps, and run it across different types of models—even ones that handle vision or other input types. </p><p>It’s not plug-and-play, but that’s the point. It gives you full control to build custom red teaming flows that actually match the complex stuff you’re testing.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fq32jfd5b6kk4e8avu9et.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fq32jfd5b6kk4e8avu9et.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"553\"></a></p><p>Garak focuses on known problems—and hits them hard. It brings a giant library of prewritten attacks, tweaks them in subtle ways, and checks how your model holds up. You’re not customizing much here.</p><p>You’re letting Garak run through everything from jailbreaks to prompt injection tricks to training data leaks. It’s a go-to if you want to audit a system, export reports, or just see how your setup compares against established weak spots.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F41b4v76qmebadgjj4u7e.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F41b4v76qmebadgjj4u7e.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"443\"></a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How They Approach the Problem\n</h3><p>Still not sure which one fits? Here’s the no-nonsense breakdown:</p><ul><li>You’re building something real — RAG, agents, pipelines — and want to test it like a real app.</li><li>You care about CI/CD — testing on every pull request or nightly run.</li><li>You need visibility — the dashboard and side-by-side comparison make your life easier.</li><li>Your team has compliance or reporting requirements (OWASP, NIST, EU stuff).</li></ul><p>Promptfoo is the most application-aware tool in the lineup. If you want your tests to reflect what your actual users might try (or abuse), this is the one.</p><ul><li>You need something fast, clean, and ready to go — no config headaches.</li><li>You want broad coverage: 50+ vulnerability types tested automatically.</li><li>You’re not looking for deep customization — just solid safety signals across the board.</li></ul><p>DeepTeam is like a “grab-and-go” red teaming kit. It’s not going to adapt to your system logic, but it’ll hit the big, obvious vulnerabilities well.</p><ul><li>You have an actual red team or a security engineering team with cycles.</li><li>You want to build complex, multi-turn, even multimodal red teaming flows.</li><li>You’re in a Microsoft-heavy environment (Azure OpenAI, enterprise stack).</li></ul><p>PyRIT is a toolkit, not a tool. It’s flexible and powerful — but you’ll need time, code, and intent behind it.</p><ul><li>You want to run a big set of known exploits and see what breaks.</li><li>You’re doing periodic audits or pre-release compliance testing.</li><li>You like exporting to vulnerability trackers or NeMo Guardrails.</li></ul><p>Garak doesn’t learn or adapt — it hits you with everything it knows. If you survive the scan, you’re in a decent place.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Testing Styles and Automation\n</h3><p>Here’s how each tool plugs into your workflow:</p><p>: Built for automation. Run via CLI or GitHub Actions. Web dashboard for side-by-side comparisons. Supports multi-turn and app-contextual tests.</p><p>: Python CLI, one-off audits. Covers wide attack space, but no deep context. CLI style:python -m garak --model my-api --probes all</p><p>: Script-heavy, geared toward power users. Write scenarios, simulate stepwise attacks.</p><p>: Python-based, fast-start with predefined metrics. Not built for CI/CD but great for exploratory scans.</p><p>: Teams at Microsoft, Shopify, and Discord use it in day-to-day builds.</p><p>: Common in research labs and auditing teams, including work with NVIDIA NeMo.</p><p>: Popular with red teams inside Azure-based enterprises.</p><p>: Used by vision-language research projects and academic groups.</p><p>: Easy CLI. npm install -g promptfoo. YAML-driven configs. Smooth DevOps integration.</p><p>: Python, minimal setup. Requires endpoint or local model setup.</p><p>: Heavy Python scripting. Expect to code your flows.</p><p>: Script-based, requires knowledge of ML workflows. Minimal install, fast setup.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Four Paths to the Same Goal\n</h3><p>Every tool tests for safety, but their methods vary:</p><ul><li>Promptfoo: Generates contextual, real-time tests that evolve with your app.</li><li>DeepTeam: Scans through known weak spots with minimal friction.</li><li>PyRIT: Simulates risk scenarios, guided by policy.</li><li>Garak: Hits your system with a library of documented exploits.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Attack Generation: Dynamic vs. Curated\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  Promptfoo’s Dynamic Generation\n</h4><p>Promptfoo crafts prompts using your own app logic. It acts like a fuzz tester for natural language, generating:</p><ul><li>Policy-violating requests</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Garak’s Curated Attack Library\n</h4><ul><li>Buffs (translated, paraphrased variants)</li><li>Jailbreaks, leaks, filter bypasses</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  PyRIT’s Template-Based Generation\n</h3><ul><li>Write custom attack templates</li><li>Target specific compliance requirements</li><li>Chain together steps to simulate attacker behavior</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  DeepTeam’s Predefined Vulnerabilities\n</h3><ul><li>50+ built-in vulnerability types</li><li>Focused on metrics and quick feedback</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Security Coverage: Where Each Tool Excels\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  Core Vulnerability Testing\n</h4><p>Promptfoo and Garak both provide broad coverage. Promptfoo is more adaptable; Garak is wider in known issues. PyRIT offers structured attack paths based on policies. DeepTeam focuses on vision-text specific threats.</p><ul><li>Only Promptfoo deeply attacks RAG systems:</li></ul><p>Garak doesn’t go deep on RAG pipelines. PyRIT and DeepTeam are not designed for RAG contexts.</p><ul><li>Multi-step memory manipulation</li></ul><p>Garak focuses on one-shot prompts. PyRIT can simulate escalation sequences with manual design.

As reported by SportQuake, annual investments by crypto brands in sports sponsorship rose by 20%, now surpassing . This growth signals a deliberate strategy: the crypto industry is leveraging the global scale and cultural influence of sports to expand brand reach, build trust, and drive user acquisition.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Sports and Crypto Are Strategic Allies\n</h2><p>Sport is a global industry with an unparalleled ability to capture public attention and foster emotional engagement. For crypto companies aiming to expand internationally and onboard mainstream audiences, sports represent a powerful entry point. This synergy is based on several strategic advantages:</p><p><p>\nBillions of people follow sports events, making it an ideal vector to introduce crypto products to large and diverse user groups.</p></p><p><p>\nMatches, tournaments, and athletes drive ongoing media exposure—TV, streaming, and social platforms—keeping crypto brands consistently in the public eye.</p></p><p><p>\nSports evoke loyalty, emotion, and personal identification. Fans are more likely to engage with products endorsed by their favorite teams or athletes.</p></p><p>As a result, sports sponsorships are not just advertising—they are infrastructure for onboarding, education, and long-term brand integration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Formats of Crypto-Sports Collaboration\n</h2><p>Several crypto firms have pioneered partnerships that show how sports can increase platform visibility, token adoption, and ultimately, capitalization.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Crypto.com: Multi-League Expansion and Brand Recognition\n</h3><p>Crypto.com has invested aggressively in sports, partnering with the NBA, Formula 1, and AC Milan. A pivotal moment came in 2021 when it secured naming rights for the former Staples Center, now . The impact was immediate:</p><p><strong>• CRO active wallets jumped from 2,000 to 10,000.</strong><strong>• Sports-related investments totaled $213 million.</strong><strong>• Capitalization reached $78 billion.</strong></p><p>In August 2024, Crypto.com became the first global crypto sponsor of the , securing placement in broadcasts and in-stadium activations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  WhiteBIT: Long-Term Strategy with FC Barcelona and Juventus\n</h3><p>Since 2022, WhiteBIT has served as the official crypto partner of , integrating its brand into team events, sports platforms, and LED boards. Notable developments include:</p><p><strong>• Blockchain education initiatives with Barça Innovation Hub.</strong><strong>• $13 million total investment in sports.</strong><strong>• Capitalization of $38.9 billion.</strong></p><p>On , WhiteBIT signed a 3-year contract with . The result:</p><p><strong>• WBT token price surged 35% to an ATH of $52.27.</strong><strong>• Capitalization neared $40 billion.</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  OKX: Fan Engagement and Token Momentum\n</h3><p>OKX began its partnership with  in 2022, which rapidly boosted the OKB token’s value. Key achievements include:</p><p> A virtual fan engagement platform.<strong>• Sponsorship of men’s and women’s team sleeves in 2023.</strong><strong>• Co-launch of an NFT collection in April 2024.</strong><strong>• $71 million invested in sports, $45.9 billion capitalization.</strong></p><p>Strategic alignment with the sports industry enables crypto companies to scale rapidly, build trust, and generate long-term brand equity. With high visibility, passionate fan bases, and global distribution, sports serve as a scalable foundation for crypto growth and user adoption.</p><p>The data is clear: crypto companies that enter the sports ecosystem effectively are rewarded with increased capitalization, broader recognition, and stronger market positions.

React, with its component-based architecture, revolutionized UI development, but as applications scale, state management can become a labyrinth. Enter Redux — a predictable state container that complements React by providing a robust framework for managing application state. This blog explores how React and Redux work in tandem to create scalable, maintainable, and futuristic web applications.</p><h2>Understanding the Challenge: Why State Management Matters</h2><p>React's local state is powerful for isolated components, but as apps grow, passing state through props or using context can become cumbersome and error-prone. Complex interactions, asynchronous data fetching, and shared state across components demand a more structured approach.</p><h2>Redux: The Predictable State Container</h2><p>Redux introduces a unidirectional data flow and a single source of truth — the . This architecture simplifies debugging and testing, making state mutations explicit and traceable.</p><ul><li> Holds the entire state of the application.</li><li> Plain objects describing what happened.</li><li> Pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.</li><li> The method to send actions to the store.</li></ul><h2>Integrating Redux with React</h2><p>React-Redux is the official binding library that connects Redux with React components, providing hooks and higher-order components to access and manipulate the store.</p><h3>Setting Up a Basic Redux Store</h3><pre><code>import { createStore } from 'redux';\n\n// Initial state\nconst initialState = { count: 0 };\n\n// Reducer function\nfunction counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\n// Create store\nconst store = createStore(counterReducer);\n</code></pre><h3>Connecting React Components</h3><p>Using React-Redux hooks like  and  simplifies interaction with the store.</p><pre><code>import React from 'react';\nimport { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const count = useSelector(state =&gt; state.count);\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}&gt;Decrement&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Middleware for Async Operations</h3><p>Redux middleware like  or  enables handling asynchronous logic elegantly.</p><pre><code>import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk';\n\n// Async action creator\nconst fetchData = () =&gt; {\n  return async (dispatch) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n      const data = await response.json();\n      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });\n    } catch (error) {\n      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error });\n    }\n  };\n};\n\nconst store = createStore(counterReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));\n</code></pre><p>Redux Toolkit streamlines Redux development by reducing boilerplate and providing powerful utilities.</p><pre><code>import { configureStore, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: { count: 0 },\n  reducers: {\n    increment: state =&gt; { state.count += 1; },\n    decrement: state =&gt; { state.count -= 1; }\n  }\n});\n\nexport const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n});\n</code></pre><h2>Why React and Redux Are the Future</h2><p>The combination of React's declarative UI and Redux's predictable state management creates a powerful paradigm for building complex applications. As AI-driven interfaces and real-time data become ubiquitous, maintaining clear and manageable state logic is critical. Redux's architecture aligns perfectly with these futuristic demands, enabling developers to innovate without losing control.</p><p>Mastering React and Redux unlocks the potential to build next-generation web applications that are scalable, maintainable, and performant. By embracing their synergy, developers can navigate the complexities of state management with confidence and creativity, paving the way for a future where frontend development is both an art and a science.</p><p>Stay curious, keep experimenting, and let the React-Redux duo propel your projects into the future.</p>","contentLength":4410,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"📖 The Era of AI — A New Blog Series Begins","url":"https://dev.to/pjdeveloper896/the-era-of-ai-a-new-blog-series-begins-4epi","date":1751363245,"author":"Prasoon","guid":178807,"unread":true,"content":"<p> | Developer | Storyteller  </p><blockquote><p><em>\"Coding isn't just logic anymore — it's a vibe.\"</em><em>\"AI isn't just tech — it's a movement.\"</em><p>\nWelcome to my new poetic + dev-inspired blog series:</p></p></blockquote><p>This isn’t your regular AI blog. is a poetic + visionary journey — a 3-part series capturing the creative and emotional side of how Artificial Intelligence is transforming the developer world.</p><p>🧵 It’s not just about models and code.<p>\nIt’s about rhythm, revolution, and the future.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  📘 Volume 1: <em>Introduction to Vibe Coding</em></h3><p>A new wave of coding is here.<p>\nOne where artists become developers and developers become artists.</p><p>\nAI tools now turn thoughts into UI, ideas into code — and this changes everything.</p></p><blockquote><p><em>This volume is about how coding is becoming intuitive, emotional, and AI-assisted.</em></p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  📗 Volume 2: </h3><p>From ChatGPT to Stable Diffusion to generative design — AI has become a co-pilot, not a tool.<p>\nIn this part, we explore how it’s disrupting industries, workflows, and creative boundaries.</p></p><blockquote><p><em>This volume is about the power shift — from code-heavy work to AI-driven flow.</em></p></blockquote><p>What happens next?<p>\nWill AI replace devs?

Doing so reflects the data model into object counterparts, <strong>which leads to almost every concept in our “domain model” being coded as an Entity abounding with getter and setter methods.</strong></p></blockquote><p>here is the problem, we have entities we only getters and setters and no domain logic!</p><blockquote><p>We design a domain concept as an Entity when we care about its individuality, when distinguishing it from all other objects in a system is a mandatory constraint. <strong>An Entity is a unique thing and is capable of being changed continuously over a long period of time. Changes may be so extensive that the object might seem much different from what it once was. Yet, it is the same object by identity.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>It is the unique identity and mutability characteristics that set Entities apart from Value Objects</em></p><h2> 🙃\n</h2><blockquote><p>There are times when an Entity is not the appropriate modeling tool to\nreach for. Misappropriated use happens far more often than many are aware. Often a concept should be modeled as a Value. If this is a disagreeable notion, it might be that DDD doesn’t fit your business needs. It is quite possible that a CRUD-based system would be more fitting. <strong>When CRUD makes sense, languages and frameworks such as Groovy and Grails, Ruby on Rails, and the like make the most sense. If the choice is correct, it should save time and money.</strong></p></blockquote><h2>😉\n</h2><blockquote><p>When complexity grows, we experience the limitation of poor tool selection. CRUD systems can’t produce a refined business model by only capturing data. <strong>If DDD is a justifiable investment in the business’s bottom line, we use Entities as intended.</strong></p></blockquote><p>And if we talk about the fact to track changes of an entity, that entity has to have a unique identifier , and Eric Evans says : </p><p><em>When an object is distinguished by its identity, rather than its attributes, make this primary to its definition in the model. Keep the class definition simple and focused on life cycle continuity and identity. Define a means of distinguishing each object regardless of its form or history. The model must define what it means to be the same thing</em></p><h2><strong>E. Unique Identity for an Entity</strong></h2><blockquote><p>So that’s what we’ll do first. Having a range of available options for implementing identity is really important, as are those for ensuring that the uniqueness is preserved throughout time.</p></blockquote><p>We will go through each of the method for ensuring unique identity for an entity </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1️⃣ </h3><p>✅ : It appears to be a straightforward approach to have a user manually enter the details of unique identity. <strong>The user types a recognizable value or symbol into an input field or selects from a set of available characteristics, and the Entity is created.</strong></p><p>❌ : One complication is relying on users to produce quality identities. The identity may be unique but incorrect. Most times identities must be immutable, so users shouldn’t change them. <strong>Can users be relied upon to produce both unique and correct, long-lasting identities?</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2️⃣ <strong>Application generates identity</strong></h3><p>✅ : There are highly reliable ways to autogenerate unique identities, although care must be taken when the application is clustered or otherwise distributed across multiple computing nodes. There are identity creation patterns that can, to a much greater degree of certainty, produce a completely unique identity. The universally unique identifier (UUID), or globally unique identifier (GUID).</p><p>❌ : the identity is big and is not considered human-readable.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3️⃣ <strong>Persistence Mechanism Generates Identity</strong></h3><p>✅ : <strong>Delegating the generation of unique identity to a persistence mechanism has some unique advantages. If we call on the database for a sequence or incrementing value, it will always be unique.</strong> Depending on the range needed, the database can generate a unique 2-byte, 4-byte, or 8-byte value. In Java, a 2-byte short integer would allow for up to 32,767 unique identities; a 4-byte normal integer would afford 2,147,483,647 unique values; and an 8-byte long integer would provide up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 distinct identities. Even zero-filled text representations of these ranges are narrow, at five, ten, and 19 characters respectively.</p><p>❌ : <strong>One possible downside is performance. It can take significantly longer to go to the database to get each value than to generate identities in the application.</strong> Much depends on database load and application demand. <em>One way around this is to cache sequence/increment values in the application, such as in a Repository.</em></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4️⃣ <strong>Another Bounded Context assigns Identity</strong></h3><p>✅  : <strong>When another Bounded Context assigns identity, we need to integrate to find, match, and assign each identity.</strong> DDD integrations are explained in Context Maps and Integrating Bounded Contexts. Making an exact match is the most desirable. Users need to provide one or more attributes, such as an account number, username, e-mail address, or other unique symbol, to pinpoint the intended result.</p><p>❌ : <strong>This has synchronization implications.</strong> What happens if externally referenced objects transition in ways that affect local Entities? How will we know that the associated object changed?</p><p>💡 : This problem can be solved using an Event-Driven Architecture with Domain Events. Our local Bounded Context\nsubscribes to Domain Events published by external systems. When a relevant notification is received, our local system transitions its own Aggregate Entities to reflect the state of those in external systems.</p><p><em>Conclusion : An Entity is an object that  that runs through time and different states.  — its attributes may change, but it remains the same entity. <strong>Is distinguished by its ID</strong> rather than its attributes.</em></p>","contentLength":5870,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"North America IT Career Planning: How to Chart Your Path to Success","url":"https://dev.to/rac/north-america-it-career-planning-how-to-chart-your-path-to-success-3ea9","date":1751362990,"author":"Zack Rac","guid":178815,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Planning a <a href=\"https://www.drillinsight.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">career in North America’s IT industry</a> can be both exciting and overwhelming.

One of the most common pitfalls is over-promotion. </p><p>Reddit users dislike spammy, self-serving posts. If your content comes off as overly promotional, it can lead to downvotes or even account bans. Always ensure that your posts add value to the community and avoid pushing your products or services aggressively.</p><p>Ignoring subreddit rules is another major mistake. Each subreddit has its own set of guidelines, which may include restrictions on certain types of content or specific posting formats. </p><p>Violating these rules can lead to your post being removed or your account being banned. Before posting, familiarize yourself with the guidelines of each subreddit you engage with.</p><p>Furthermore, neglecting to engage authentically with the community can hurt your brand’s reputation. Reddit values genuine interactions and the sharing of knowledge. </p><p>Posting only to get backlinks or drive traffic will likely result in negative feedback. Instead, build relationships with users by offering insightful comments, answering questions, and contributing helpful content.</p><p>By avoiding these pitfalls and staying true to Reddit’s collaborative nature, startups can use the platform effectively to enhance their SEO strategy.</p><p>To make the most of Reddit marketing for SEO, startups should leverage various tools and analytics platforms to streamline their efforts. Reddit’s built-in analytics tools offer insights into the performance of your posts, such as upvotes, comments, and user engagement. </p><p>Tracking these metrics allows you to understand what content resonates with your audience and adjust your strategy accordingly.</p><p>Additionally, third-party tools like Google Analytics (or <a href=\"https://adplayer.pro/glossary/google-analytics-4/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GA4</a>) can track referral traffic from Reddit. By analyzing which subreddits and posts drive the most traffic, you can identify the most successful strategies and focus your efforts on those areas.</p><p>Keyword research tools, such as SEMrush or Ahrefs, can also be useful for identifying trending keywords and search queries within Reddit discussions. Consider using a <a href=\"https://www.spacebring.com/features/member-mobile-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coworking space app</a> to collaborate and analyze Reddit-driven campaigns more efficiently across distributed teams.</p><p>These tools provide valuable data on keyword search volume and competition, helping you craft content optimized for both Reddit and search engines.</p><p>Reddit ads can be another powerful tool for gaining visibility. While ads on Reddit are less intrusive than traditional advertising, they allow for targeted campaigns based on specific interests, demographics, and subreddits. </p><p>Using paid advertising alongside organic engagement can boost your SEO efforts and help you reach a wider audience. By utilizing these tools, startups can track performance, optimize content, and refine their Reddit marketing strategies for maximum SEO impact.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Case Studies and Examples\n</h2><p>Examining successful case studies of startups using Reddit marketing for SEO provides valuable insights and actionable takeaways.

Your team has worked countless hours building what you believe is a game-changing mobile app. The designs are slick. The features are solid. The marketing is ready to go.</p><p>Crashes on newer Android devices. Laggy performance on older iPhones. UI elements that look perfect in staging but fall apart in real-world use.</p><p>I’ve been there. And trust me, there’s no punch to the gut quite like watching user reviews plummet on launch week, all because your mobile app testing strategy didn’t keep up with the times.</p><p> If your team is still treating mobile app testing like it’s 2015, you’re going to miss critical issues- and user trust. Below are five red flags that your strategy is outdated, along with how to bring it into 2025, where it belongs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. You're Only Testing Manually- or Mostly Manually\n</h2><p>Manual testing still has its place, especially for exploratory testing or UX checks, but if it’s your primary method, that’s a red flag.</p><p>Think about it: modern mobile apps need to work across dozens of device combinations, OS versions, screen sizes, and network environments. Testing each scenario by hand is not just inefficient, it’s impossible.</p><ul><li>Introduce automated testing frameworks like Appium, Espresso, or XCUITest.</li><li>Set up CI/CD pipelines with integrated test automation to run tests every time code is pushed.</li><li>Use cloud-based testing services like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to scale across real devices.</li></ul><p>It’s not about replacing testers- it’s about freeing them up to focus on the kinds of testing automation can’t do well (yet), like emotional user flows or edge-case discovery.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. You’re Ignoring Real-World Network Conditions\n</h2><p>One of the most common complaints from users is performance. And yet, many teams still test their  on lightning-fast Wi-Fi networks with stable connections and minimal latency.</p><p>Real users aren’t in that world.</p><p>They’re on 3G in elevators. They’re switching between cell towers while driving. They’re tapping your app with 10% battery and two other apps running in the background.</p><p><strong>Modern app testing needs to simulate reality.</strong></p><ul><li>Test under various network conditions (3 G, 4G, 5G, low bandwidth, high latency).</li><li>Use tools like Charles Proxy or Network Link Conditioner to simulate weak signals.</li><li>Include scenarios like airplane mode toggles, network loss, or limited data plans.</li></ul><p>It’s not about perfection. It’s about preparedness.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Your Device Coverage Is Limited- or Nonexistent\n</h2><p>Let’s be honest: many teams only test on the devices they have lying around. Typically, the latest iPhone, possibly one Samsung Galaxy, and the emulator that comes built into Android Studio.</p><p>But fragmentation is a very real thing. According to fictional-but-plausible internal data from Global Mobile Metrics 2025, <strong>70% of app crashes on Android happen on devices not covered in standard emulator testing.</strong></p><p>Different screen sizes, chipsets, and memory capabilities introduce subtle (and sometimes show-stopping) bugs.</p><ul><li>Build a device matrix based on your actual user base.</li><li>Use real-device cloud platforms to test at scale.</li><li>Prioritize testing on top devices by market share, not just the ones in your drawer.</li></ul><p>And don’t forget the long-tail devices. Sometimes your most loyal users are the ones still using their four-year-old phones. Don’t leave them behind.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. You're Not Testing for Accessibility\n</h2><p>In 2025, accessibility is no longer a “nice-to-have.” It’s an expectation- and in some regions, a legal requirement. Still, many teams forget to check whether their apps work with screen readers or if color contrast meets WCAG standards.</p><p>Ignoring accessibility doesn’t just leave users out it limits your audience and invites avoidable backlash.</p><ul><li>Incorporate accessibility checks into your QA checklist.</li><li>Use tools like Accessibility Scanner (Android) or VoiceOver (iOS) during testing.</li><li>Train developers and designers on accessible UI/UX best practices.</li></ul><p>One test session with a screen reader will open your eyes. I've done it. It was humbling, but it made our app better for everyone.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Your Feedback Loop Is Too Slow—or Nonexistent\n</h2><p>If you’re waiting until a sprint ends to test… or if bugs get reported by customers before your team even sees them… your feedback loop is broken.</p><p>In the age of rapid releases and user expectations, delays in bug discovery are costly, not just in development time, but in brand trust.</p><ul><li>Integrate testing into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.</li><li>Use crash analytics tools like Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry to monitor real-time issues post-release.</li><li>Close the loop between QA, development, and customer support. Bug reports should never get lost in translation.</li></ul><p>Think of testing not as a gatekeeper, but as a guidepost- constantly pointing the team toward a better product.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Upgrading Your Strategy: It’s About Mindset, Not Just Tools\n</h2><p>At the core, fixing your outdated testing strategy isn’t about chasing shiny new tools. It’s about shifting the way your team thinks about testing.</p><p>It's no longer a “final phase” activity. It’s embedded from the first line of code. It’s part of every build, every release, every conversation.</p><p>When you make that shift- when you embrace continuous, automated, real-world, user-first testing- you don’t just prevent bugs. You create confidence.</p><p>And confidence is what powers great mobile products.</p><p>Let’s face it- users don’t care about how hard you worked. They care about whether your app works for them, in their world.</p><p>And if you want to meet that standard, it’s time to embrace  as part of your core development strategy. It’s faster. Smarter. And ultimately, the key to delivering mobile experiences that earn loyalty, not one-star reviews.</p><p>Because the best app isn’t the one with the most features- it’s the one that works flawlessly, every time, everywhere.</p>","contentLength":5907,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Optimizing Inter-Departmental Data Flows with Receiver-Driven Transformation","url":"https://dev.to/imran_rizvi_e6c91252ff79f/optimizing-inter-departmental-data-flows-with-receiver-driven-transformation-51mf","date":1751362682,"author":"Imran Rizvi","guid":178810,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In large-scale enterprises managing complex supply-demand dynamics—spanning domains like supply chain, finance, and operations—inter-departmental data transfers are critical yet fraught with inefficiencies. Departments such as Procurement, Planning, Sales, Order Management, and Factory Systems often rely on one another to deliver data preformatted to specific requirements. However, sending teams, not directly vested in the receiving team’s objectives, lack incentive to prioritize data transformation, resulting in delays. When requirements evolve—such as needing additional data fields—iterative alignment and communication further impede progress. A robust solution for these internal workflows is to have sending teams share raw, untransformed data, with receiving teams owning the transformation process to align with their needs.</p><p>This receiver-driven model empowers departments to independently process schema-agnostic raw data using high-performance tools like in-memory data processing frameworks or orchestrated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. Receivers can efficiently parse, reformat, or enrich data to extract actionable insights, such as demand forecasts or inventory metrics, without awaiting sender-side adjustments. Lightweight serialization formats like Avro or Parquet optimize data exchange over internal networks, minimizing bandwidth usage and latency. By decoupling transformation from the sender, this approach eliminates dependency on misaligned priorities and iterative coordination, enabling faster, more autonomous decision-making.</p><p>This strategy is tailored for internal, inter-departmental data flows, not customer-facing systems like ticket booking applications, e-commerce checkout platforms, online banking forms, or customer support chatbots, where structured data is essential for seamless user interactions.

Large, “God components” are hard to test and maintain. Split big components into smaller, reusable ones.</p><p>✅ 2) <strong>Use Functional Components and Hooks</strong></p><p>Class components are outdated for most use cases. Embrace functional components with hooks for state, side effects, and more — they’re simpler and less verbose.</p><div><pre><code>function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n\n</code></pre></div><p>✅ 3) <strong>Destructure Props and State</strong></p><p>Avoid using props.someValue everywhere. Instead, destructure props and state for cleaner, more readable code:</p><div><pre><code>function Welcome({ name }) {\n  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Long, deeply nested JSX is hard to read. Break it up with helper functions or subcomponents.\n✅ Before: deeply nested JSX.<p>\n✅ After: break into smaller, clear components.</p></p><p>✅ 5) <strong>Use PropTypes or TypeScript</strong></p><p>Always validate your component props with PropTypes, or better yet, migrate to TypeScript for safer, self-documenting code.</p><p>✅ 6) </p><p>Use React Developer Tools in your browser to inspect component trees, props, and state — it will save you hours debugging tricky issues.</p><p>✅ 7) <strong>Memoize Expensive Operations</strong></p><p>Avoid unnecessary re-renders with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to optimize performance, especially for large lists or intensive calculations.</p><p>✅ 8) </p><p>When using useEffect, always clean up subscriptions, timers, or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.</p><div><pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {\n  const id = setInterval(() =&gt; console.log('Tick'), 1000);\n  return () =&gt; clearInterval(id); // cleanup!\n}, []);\n</code></pre></div><p>✅ 9) <strong>Keep State Local When Possible</strong></p><p>Don’t lift state unnecessarily. Local state reduces complexity and re-renders, making your components faster and easier to maintain.</p><p>✅ 10) </p><p>Always use clear, descriptive names for components, props, and hooks. Names like Button, handleClick, or isLoading make your code self-explanatory and easier for others to understand.</p><p>💡: small, focused components + hooks + meaningful naming = happy developers and maintainable apps! 🎉</p><p><em>Which best practice is your go-to?

That includes onboarding, support, and product guidance. If those things have improved, that’s additional value.</p><p><strong>Customers Say It’s “Cheap”</strong>\nThis one surprises people. If customers call your pricing “cheap,” it’s often a signal you’re undervalued, not affordable. “Affordable” means fair. “Cheap” means underpriced and possibly under-trusted.</p><p><strong>Your Early Pricing Was Temporary</strong>\nMost SaaS startups launch with “starter pricing.” But if you’re still charging like it’s day 1 and the product has moved ahead... It’s time to recalibrate.</p><p><strong>You’re Attracting the Wrong Customers</strong>\nLow pricing can pull in high-churn users. Updating your pricing strategy can improve retention and signal that your product is made for serious, committed users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Pricing Is a Product Decision, Not Just a Revenue One\n</h2><p>If your product has matured, your pricing needs to reflect that. Otherwise, you risk signaling that your value hasn't kept up. That can hurt trust, not just profit.</p><p>You don’t need to double your price. But you do need a strategy.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Raise Prices Without Pushing Users Away\n</h2><p>Here’s what works, especially in SaaS:</p><p><strong>Reward Existing Customers</strong>\nLet loyal users keep their current plan—either permanently or for a set time. It builds goodwill and reduces friction.</p><p>\nDon’t guess. Use product usage data and customer feedback to shape new tiers or price points.</p><p><strong>Change Tiers, Not Just Numbers</strong>\nInstead of a flat increase, consider adjusting the plan structure. Add features to higher tiers. Give people options.</p><p><strong>Frame the Change Around Value</strong>\nWhen announcing, focus on what’s improved. Make it about product maturity, not revenue needs.</p><p>Thread This Into Product-Led Growth</p><ul><li>Build features → Raise value → Raise prices → Reinvest → Repeat</li><li>The loop only works if your pricing reflects your product</li><li>Pricing is part of product-market fit</li></ul><p><strong>What’s your approach to pricing?

You need to quickly provision servers for a flash sale, scale your database during peak hours, and automatically roll back deployments if something goes wrong. Manually clicking through the DigitalOcean control panel for each of these tasks is slow, error-prone, and simply doesn't scale. This is where the DigitalOcean API comes in.</p><p>Today, businesses are increasingly adopting cloud-native architectures, embracing zero-trust security models, and managing hybrid identities. Automation is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity.  According to a recent Flexera 2023 State of the Cloud Report, 77% of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy, and automation is key to managing complexity across these environments. DigitalOcean powers over 800,000 developers and businesses, and a significant portion of their success relies on the power and flexibility of their API.  Companies like Algolia, a search-as-a-service provider, leverage APIs like DigitalOcean’s to automate infrastructure management, allowing them to focus on their core product.  This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to the DigitalOcean API, empowering you to automate your cloud infrastructure and unlock the full potential of DigitalOcean.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is the DigitalOcean API?\n</h2><p>At its core, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and specifications that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant: you (the application) tell the waiter (the API) what you want (a request), and the waiter brings you back the result from the kitchen (the server). </p><p>The DigitalOcean API allows you to interact with all DigitalOcean resources – Droplets, Spaces, Databases, Load Balancers, and more – programmatically.  Instead of using the DigitalOcean control panel, you can use code to create, manage, and delete resources. </p><ul><li> The DigitalOcean API is built on the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), meaning it uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources.</li><li> Data is exchanged in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight and human-readable format.</li><li>  You authenticate with the API using a Personal Access Token (PAT), ensuring secure access to your DigitalOcean resources.</li><li> Specific URLs that represent different resources or actions. For example,  is the endpoint for managing Droplets.</li><li>  To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, the API has rate limits.  Understanding these limits is crucial for building robust applications.</li></ul><p>Companies like Zapier and IFTTT heavily rely on APIs like DigitalOcean’s to connect different services and automate workflows.  A developer building a CI/CD pipeline might use the API to automatically provision new Droplets for testing and deployment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Use the DigitalOcean API?\n</h2><p>Before the widespread adoption of APIs, managing cloud infrastructure was a largely manual process.  This led to inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and increased operational costs.  Imagine needing to manually create 50 Droplets with specific configurations – a tedious and error-prone task.</p><p><strong>Common Challenges Before Using the API:</strong></p><ul><li> Slow and prone to human error.</li><li>  Difficult to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand.</li><li><strong>Inconsistent Configurations:</strong>  Maintaining consistent configurations across multiple servers is challenging.</li><li>  Difficult to automate complex workflows.</li></ul><p><strong>Industry-Specific Motivations:</strong></p><ul><li> Automate the creation and management of web servers.</li><li>  Dynamically scale game servers based on player activity.</li><li>  Provision and manage compute resources for data analysis and machine learning.</li><li>  Integrate infrastructure management into CI/CD pipelines.</li></ul><ol><li> A monitoring system detects high CPU usage on a Droplet. The API is used to automatically create a new Droplet and add it to a load balancer.</li><li>  In the event of a Droplet failure, the API is used to automatically create a replacement Droplet from a snapshot.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</strong>  Using tools like Terraform, the API is used to define and manage infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency and repeatability.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features and Capabilities\n</h2><p>The DigitalOcean API offers a wide range of features and capabilities. Here are ten key ones:</p><ol><li> Create, delete, resize, power on/off, and manage Droplets.\n\n</li><li> Create, manage, and share custom images.\n\n<ul><li>  Create a golden image with pre-installed software.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Image Creation -&gt; Image Available</li></ul></li><li> Create, attach, and manage block storage volumes.\n\n<ul><li>  Add persistent storage to a Droplet.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Volume Creation -&gt; Volume Attached</li></ul></li><li> Manage VPCs, firewalls, and floating IPs.\n\n<ul><li>  Securely connect Droplets within a private network.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Network Configuration -&gt; Network Active</li></ul></li><li><strong>Load Balancer Management:</strong> Create and manage load balancers to distribute traffic.\n\n<ul><li>  Improve the availability and scalability of a web application.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Load Balancer Creation -&gt; Load Balancer Active</li></ul></li><li> Create, manage, and scale managed databases.\n\n<ul><li>  Provision a database for a new application.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Database Creation -&gt; Database Ready</li></ul></li><li> Create and manage object storage spaces.\n\n<ul><li>  Store static assets for a website.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Space Creation -&gt; Space Available</li></ul></li><li> Monitor and manage Droplet actions (e.g., backups, upgrades).\n\n<ul><li>  Track the progress of a Droplet backup.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Action Initiation -&gt; Action Status Updates</li></ul></li><li> Add and manage SSH keys for secure access to Droplets.\n\n<ul><li>  Automate SSH key distribution to new Droplets.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; SSH Key Addition -&gt; Key Available</li></ul></li><li> Retrieve performance metrics for Droplets and other resources.\n\n<ul><li>  Monitor CPU usage and memory consumption.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Metric Retrieval -&gt; Metric Data Returned</li></ul></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Detailed Practical Use Cases\n</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Automated Web Application Deployment (Web Hosting):</strong></p><ul><li> Manually deploying a web application is time-consuming and error-prone.</li><li> Use the API to automatically provision a Droplet, install the necessary software (e.g., Nginx, PHP), and deploy the application code.</li><li> Faster and more reliable deployments, reduced operational costs.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Game Server Scaling (Game Development):</strong></p><ul><li> Game servers need to scale dynamically based on player demand.</li><li> Use the API to automatically create and destroy Droplets based on player count.</li><li> Improved game performance and player experience.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Automated Backup and Disaster Recovery (Data Security):</strong></p><ul><li> Protecting data from loss or corruption.</li><li> Use the API to schedule regular backups of Droplets and databases.

If the dosage is confusing, the pharmacist may need to call the clinic.</p><p>Keeping up with handwritten notes, stock issues, and customer lines becomes exhausting. </p><p>The delays and errors could even affect health.</p><p>In short, the system is outdated. It slows things down, and it leaves too much room for mistakes. And in today’s fast-paced, tech-enabled world, that simply doesn’t work anymore.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  People expect better, and they should\n</h2><p>We’ve come to expect convenience in our everyday lives. If we can order a coffee with one tap, why should our prescriptions be stuck in the past?</p><p> want faster service, fewer errors, and better access to their medicines. They want updates, reminders, and the ability to store and access their prescriptions anytime. </p><p>No more slips of paper. No more pharmacy hopping.</p><p> want more clarity and less stress. They want prescriptions that are legible, tracked, and easier to manage. They want better insights into stock and real-time orders.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So, what is a digital prescription?\n</h2><p>A digital prescription, also known as an e-prescription, is simply a prescription created, shared, and stored electronically.</p><p>Let’s understand its workflow step-by-step:</p><p> Instead of physically visiting a pharmacy with the paper slip, the patients or their relatives can upload the prescription details in the app. </p><p> That prescription is sent directly to the pharmacy. </p><p> The pharmacist receives it, prepares the order.</p><p> The patient or their relative can collect it or get it delivered.</p><p>It removes the need for handwriting, scanning, faxing, or even phone calls. Everything is clear, secure, and fast.</p><ul><li>For the patient, it means fewer steps. </li><li>For the pharmacist, it means fewer errors. </li><li>For the doctor, it means better records. Everyone wins.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  From pain to promise: The real benefits of On-demand medicine ordering solution\n</h2><p>Let’s break it down with everyday situations. </p><p> A mother managing multiple prescriptions for her child.  An elderly person living alone, trying to remember the medicine names.  A busy working adult rushing to pick up medicines before closing time.</p><p>In all these cases, digital prescriptions make life easier.</p><p>Patients no longer have to carry papers or rely on memory. Their prescription is safe, stored, and always available on their phone. No guesswork, no delay.</p><p>Pharmacists don’t need to interpret messy handwriting or call doctors to confirm instructions. The digital system shows exactly what’s needed. Medicines are ready faster. That means happier customers and better service.</p><p>Doctors, on the other hand, can track patient history, spot refill gaps, and adjust medications quickly. Their job becomes more efficient and focused.</p><p>And in emergencies, speed matters. A digital prescription can be shared in seconds, something that paper cannot do.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example: To understand why the medicine ordering solution is a lifesaver\n</h2><p><strong>Example 1 (customer POV):</strong> Take Megan, for example. She’s a young mother juggling work and a toddler with asthma. Her child’s prescription needs refilling every month. Before, she had to visit the clinic and wait in line to get the medicine. </p><p>Now, she directly sends it to the pharmacy, and it’s delivered to her home. No stress, no delay.</p><p><strong>Example 2 (pharmacist POV):</strong> Think of Paul, a pharmacist who used to spend hours sorting through illegible prescriptions. With digital ones, he now serves more customers with better accuracy and fewer returns due to wrong medications.</p><p>These aren’t just small wins; they add up to big changes.</p><p>Of course, like with any tech, some people worry. Is it safe? The simple answer is yes. </p><p>Digital prescriptions are encrypted and follow strict healthcare standards. In many regions, they’re even more secure than paper because they can’t be tampered with.</p><p><strong>Will older patients struggle?</strong> Not if it’s done right.  Good systems are designed to be simple. Most patients just get a message or PDF, no tech skills needed.</p><p><strong>Is it only for big hospitals?</strong> Not at all. Small clinics, local pharmacies, and even solo practitioners can use easy, affordable digital tools.</p><p>The goal is not to make things complicated. It’s to make them smarter and smoother for everyone involved.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Where the era of digitalization in healthcare industry headed\n</h2><p>This is just the beginning. Digital prescriptions are opening the door to more connected healthcare. </p><p>Soon, you could have your prescriptions, reports, and appointments all in one app. Medicines could be delivered automatically when it's time to refill. </p><p>Pharmacies could restock based on real-time demand. Pharmacists could get alerts about interactions between different medications. And patients could get reminders so they never miss a dose.</p><p>This isn’t some far-off dream. It’s already happening in parts of the world and spreading fast.</p><p>You don’t need to make a giant leap overnight. Just take small steps. As a pharmacist, explore the best medicine ordering and delivery software that reduces your manual workload and offers your customers the ease of getting medicine online.</p><p>Start with one change and feel the difference. Because the future of prescriptions is not about paper. It’s about people. And making their lives easier, safer, and better.</p><p>From queue to click, the journey has begun.

Their slim design, snappy feel, and space-saving form factor have carved out a niche among gamers, coders, and digital nomads alike.</p><p>But here’s the catch: <em>not all keycaps fit all switches</em>, especially when you enter the low-profile domain.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll demystify the compatibility puzzle and help you confidently pair the <strong>right low profile keycaps</strong> with —without sacrificing performance, aesthetics, or typing experience.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Low Profile Matters (And Who Should Care)\n</h2><p>Low profile mechanical keyboards have exploded in popularity for good reason:</p><ul><li>: Reduced key height lowers wrist strain, especially during extended typing sessions.</li><li>: Ideal for travel setups and minimal desk aesthetics.</li><li>: Shorter actuation distance means faster key response—vital for gaming and real-time applications.</li></ul><p>Whether you're building a productivity-focused board for work or a lightning-fast setup for gaming, low profile switches offer a compelling balance between performance and design.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Core Challenge: Compatibility\n</h2><p>Let’s get straight to it—<strong>the majority of low profile switches are not MX-compatible</strong>, which means you can’t just grab any Cherry MX keycap and expect it to work.</p><p>Here’s what makes things tricky:</p><ul><li>: Cherry MX-style stems are cross-shaped. Low profile switches may use flatter, shorter, or completely different stems (e.g., Kailh Choc vs Gateron LP).</li><li>: Traditional profiles like SA, DSA, or OEM are too tall and won’t work ergonomically or physically.</li><li>: Plate vs PCB mount matters more when the switch dimensions vary widely.</li></ul><p>So what can you pair safely—and stylishly?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Popular Low Profile Switches and Their Keycap Pairings\n</h2><p>Here’s a breakdown of the most common low profile switches and what keycaps are compatible with them:</p><ul><li>: Flat, rectangular (non-MX)</li><li>: Only  work. These are typically produced by manufacturers like MBK, XDA-Profile Choc, and custom makers on platforms like P3D or KPrepublic.</li><li>: Ultra-slim DIY builds, ortho layouts (like the Planck or Corne), low-profile wireless keyboards.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 <strong>Gateron Low Profile (LP) Switches</strong></h3><ul><li>: MX-style cross-stem (✓)</li><li>: Supports <strong>low profile MX-compatible keycaps</strong> (like the ones from Keychron or Akko). Traditional MX caps  but look awkward and feel unbalanced.</li><li>: Compact gaming keyboards (Keychron K series, Logitech G915), general-purpose low-profile boards.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 <strong>Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile (ULP)</strong></h3><ul><li>: Proprietary (flat hinge)</li><li>: <em>Only compatible with Cherry ULP keycaps</em>—typically used in high-end laptops or ultra-slim boards like Corsair K100 Air.</li><li>: Industrial designs, embedded keyboards, ultra-thin wireless layouts.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 <strong>Outemu LP / TTC LP Switches</strong></h3><ul><li>: Varies—often MX-compatible</li><li>: Stick with <strong>manufacturer-approved keycaps</strong>; don’t mix and match unless you confirm fit.</li><li>: Some clones are not 1:1 with Cherry specs and may cause wobble.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What to Look for in Low Profile Keycaps\n</h2><p>Keycaps are more than just decorative covers—they influence sound, feel, and accuracy.</p><p>When shopping for low profile caps, consider:</p><ul><li>: PBT resists shine and wears better than ABS. Choose double-shot or dye-sub for legends that last.</li><li>: MBK, XDA Choc, and ChocCaps are ergonomically sculpted for low travel. Avoid taller profiles like SA or MT3.</li><li>: If backlighting matters, go with shine-through caps. Otherwise, clean blank caps give a sleek minimalist look.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Pro Tip: Avoid Mix-and-Match Mistakes\n</h2><p>One of the most common pitfalls is buying a beautiful set of low profile keycaps only to find they don’t fit your switch stems. Always double-check:</p><ul><li>Stem type: MX-compatible or not?</li><li>Cap height: Will the profile clash with your keyboard’s intended design?</li><li>Layout fit: 60% keyboards, split boards, and ortholinear layouts all have specific sizing needs.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  For Tinkerers: 3 Great Builds to Try\n</h2><p>If you're building from scratch or looking to mod an existing board, here are some battle-tested combinations:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>Keychron K7 + Gateron LP Red + Keychron LP ABS Caps</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Great for beginners wanting a slim typing experience with hot-swappable convenience.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. <strong>KBDfans KBD67LP + Gateron LP Brown + PBT LP Keycaps</strong></h3><blockquote><p>A premium, quiet build for developers who care about sound and feel.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. <strong>Corne LP + Kailh Choc V2 + MBK Legend Keycaps</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Ultimate ergonomic split setup for hardcore coders or typists.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts: Is It Worth the Extra Research?\n</h2><p>Absolutely. Matching the right <strong>low profile keycaps with compatible switches</strong> elevates your typing experience from just “okay” to “exceptional.” It’s not just about aesthetics—it’s about <strong>precision fit, feel, and function</strong>.</p><p>By understanding switch stem types, keycap profiles, and layout-specific needs, you save yourself the frustration (and return shipping) of poor pairings.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Resources &amp; Further Reading\n</h2><h2>\n  \n  \n  Want Help With Your Build?\n</h2><p>I’ve been building and modding keyboards for 6+ years—if you have a question, drop a comment below or connect with me on Mastodon @keebnerd.

But to make them work well, it’s not just about making smarter agents — it’s about getting them to share a common understanding of the world. That’s where the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> comes in: an emerging standard that acts as a universal connector, enabling agents to access tools and data in a consistent, scalable way.</p><p>When I started building with MCP for a work project, I hit a wall. Most tutorials focus on local MCP servers communicating over STDIN/STDOUT, which is great for prototyping. But I needed a , something robust and production-ready that could run on Kubernetes. Unfortunately, good resources were scarce.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Beyond APIs: Why MCP Matters in an Agentic World\n</h2><p>For decades, APIs have been the standard way systems talk to each other. Developers read docs, authenticate, and write custom code to integrate services. But that doesn’t scale when agents need to autonomously interact with dozens or hundreds of tools.</p><p>MCP offers a . It provides a standardized protocol—a common language—that lets tools present themselves to agents in a predictable way. Instead of agents learning how every API works, . This makes the integration layer simpler, smarter, and scalable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Code &amp; Deployment Blueprint\n</h2><p>Here’s a high-level overview of what goes into building and deploying a remote MCP server:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

Binding to  is Non-Negotiable\n</h3><p>Inside Docker or Kubernetes, binding to localhost means only the container can talk to itself. External traffic (even from other pods) won't reach it. Always bind your app to  to make it network-accessible.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Streamable HTTP is Not Plug-and-Play\n</h3><p>MCP relies on long-lived JSON-RPC-over-HTTP connections. Many HTTP servers and proxies aren't tuned for this. The Nginx Ingress Controller in particular <strong>buffers responses by default</strong>, breaking stream behavior. You have to explicitly disable buffering and increase timeouts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Debugging Ingress is Half the Battle\n</h3><p>Expect to spend a fair amount of time tweaking your Ingress config. Tools like  and  are invaluable here.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. FastMCP Just Works (Mostly)\n</h3><p>Despite the learning curve, FastMCP does a lot of heavy lifting for you.

It’s about creating a seamless workflow where issues are tracked efficiently, pull requests (PRs) are reviewed collaboratively, and the community feels empowered to contribute. If you want your project to thrive, you need to master these three key pillars: issues, PRs, and people.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Role of Issues in a Healthy Project</strong>\nIssues are the pulse of your project. They highlight what’s broken, what’s needed, and where improvements can happen. When managed well, they become a living roadmap that invites collaboration from both core contributors and newcomers.</p><p>To make issues work for you, it helps to provide structure. Templates ensure that bug reports and feature requests are submitted with the right details. Labels allow you to quickly sort and prioritize, whether you're identifying a critical fix or suggesting a feature for later. Milestones give contributors a sense of where the project is headed, while a simple encouragement to search existing issues before posting can reduce duplication and clutter.</p><p>But more than tools, it's the tone that counts. Responding with empathy, even when closing a suggestion, builds a welcoming space where people feel heard, not shut out.</p><p><strong>Pull Requests: Where Collaboration Meets Code</strong>\nPull requests are where ideas take shape and real development happens. A well-managed PR not only results in cleaner code but also brings your team closer together. Start by setting expectations with a PR template so contributors know what details to include, what the change does, why it matters, and any relevant screenshots or test results.</p><p>Automating checks with CI/CD tools helps catch issues early, but the real value comes from human review. This is where team culture shows. Reviews should be constructive and kind focused on clarity and shared learning, not criticism.</p><p>Keeping PRs small and focused also goes a long way. Large, monolithic changes are harder to review and more likely to break things. Encourage contributors to break work into manageable chunks that can be reviewed quickly and merged cleanly.</p><p>For teams managing multiple contributors, especially in active repositories, formalizing collaboration is essential. Structured learning like this <a href=\"https://www.edstellar.com/course/github-training\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Training Course</a> can help streamline workflows and build consistent review practices across your team.</p><p><strong>Cultivating a Community Around Your Code</strong>\nA successful GitHub project isn’t just functional, it’s alive. The README file sets the tone, explaining not just what your project does but why it matters. It should be written for people, not just machines. Follow this up with a CONTRIBUTING.md file to help new contributors understand how they can participate, and a Code of Conduct to ensure respectful interaction.</p><p>Beyond documentation, you also need conversation. GitHub Discussions or even issue threads can be powerful tools for open dialogue, feature brainstorming, or onboarding help. And don’t forget to celebrate your contributors, mention them in release notes, highlight their work in discussions, or simply thank them in comments. Recognition turns one-time contributors into long-term collaborators.</p><p>**Avoiding Common Mistakes That Hurt Projects\n**Despite the best intentions, many projects struggle due to poor communication or inconsistent maintenance. One of the biggest mistakes is going silent, leaving issues and PRs unanswered for too long. Contributors lose interest quickly when they feel ignored.</p><p>On the flip side, over-engineering the contribution process with too many rules can make your project feel inaccessible. The key is to strike a balance between structure and flexibility. Avoid hiding important decisions in private chats transparency builds trust.</p><p>And finally, remember to care for yourself as a maintainer. Burnout is real. Set boundaries, pace your involvement, and consider rotating responsibilities if your project grows large enough.</p><p>\nGitHub provides excellent tools to keep your project moving without chaos. GitHub Projects allows you to organize tasks visually, giving everyone clarity on what's being worked on and what's next. GitHub Actions can handle repetitive tasks like running tests or deploying code, freeing up your time for more meaningful collaboration.</p><p>Even small tools like saved replies, scheduled reviews, and linking PRs to issues can have a major impact when used consistently. The goal isn’t to do everything perfectly, but to build habits that support long-term momentum.</p><p>\nMastering issues, PRs, and community dynamics isn’t a one-time task, it’s an ongoing practice. But when done right, the rewards are huge: smoother workflows, higher-quality code, and a community that grows with your project, not apart from it.</p><p>Whether you're managing your first repository or scaling an active open-source ecosystem, investing in how you communicate and collaborate makes all the difference.</p>","contentLength":4971,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Advancements in Computational Linguistics: Exploring Themes and Innovations from Recent Research","url":"https://dev.to/khanali21/advancements-in-computational-linguistics-exploring-themes-and-innovations-from-recent-research-4akd","date":1751351845,"author":"Ali Khan","guid":178716,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This article is part of AI Frontiers, a series exploring groundbreaking computer science and artificial intelligence research from arXiv. We summarize key papers, demystify complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlight innovations shaping our technological future. The focus here is on sixteen research papers published between June 20 and June 30, 2025, which delve into the rapidly evolving field of computational linguistics. These studies collectively illuminate how machines interpret human language, address real-world challenges, and push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. The field of computational linguistics occupies a pivotal role at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. It seeks to enable machines to process, understand, and generate human language in ways that are both meaningful and contextually appropriate. This endeavor goes beyond simple word recognition, encompassing the subtleties of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. By teaching machines to decode not just explicit statements but also implicit meanings, computational linguistics facilitates advancements in applications such as automated translation, sentiment analysis, and conversational agents. Its significance lies in its potential to transform industries, from healthcare to education, by providing tools that enhance decision-making and communication. Among the major themes explored in the reviewed papers, fact-checking and information verification emerge as critical areas of interest. Researchers have developed systems aimed at discerning the veracity of claims across domains like medicine and finance. For instance, Joseph et al. (2025) introduced a framework for medical fact-checking that emphasizes the importance of interpretative reasoning over binary classifications. Another prominent theme is model safety, where efforts are directed toward mitigating biases and ensuring ethical behavior in large language models. Studies by Liu et al. (2025) revealed hidden demographic biases in how these models handle violent content, underscoring the need for rigorous testing and refinement. A third theme centers on multimodal processing, which integrates text, images, and other data types to create more holistic AI systems. Chen et al. (2025) demonstrated a prototype capable of analyzing medical imagery alongside textual records, offering insights that neither modality could provide independently. Methodological approaches vary widely across the papers, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of computational linguistics. Many studies employ deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based architectures, to process vast datasets efficiently. Others adopt hybrid methodologies, combining rule-based systems with neural networks to balance precision and flexibility. Experimental designs often involve controlled simulations or real-world case studies, allowing researchers to evaluate performance under diverse conditions. For example, Zhang et al. (2025) conducted experiments using fabricated social media posts to test the robustness of fact-checking algorithms against nuanced misinformation. Key findings from these works reveal both progress and persistent challenges. One notable discovery is the ideation-execution gap identified by Kumar et al. (2025), highlighting the disparity between theoretically promising AI-generated ideas and their practical implementation. Another significant finding comes from Wang et al. (2025), who demonstrated that collaborative human-machine systems outperform purely automated solutions in tasks requiring interpretive judgment. Comparisons across studies suggest that while technical capabilities continue to improve, contextual understanding remains a formidable hurdle. Influential works cited throughout this synthesis include Joseph et al. (2025), whose exploration of medical fact-checking provides a blueprint for future verification systems; Liu et al. (2025), whose analysis of bias in language models underscores the ethical dimensions of AI development; and Chen et al. (2025), whose multimodal framework exemplifies integrative approaches to complex problem-solving. Each of these contributions advances the field by addressing specific limitations and proposing innovative solutions. A critical assessment of recent progress reveals a field marked by rapid innovation yet constrained by certain fundamental challenges. While computational linguistics has made strides in automating routine tasks and enhancing user interactions, gaps remain in achieving true comprehension of human language. Future directions may involve refining interpretive algorithms, expanding training datasets to encompass broader linguistic diversity, and developing frameworks for continuous learning. Additionally, fostering collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and policymakers will be essential to ensure that advancements align with societal needs and ethical standards.

We summarize key papers, demystify complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlight innovations shaping our technological future. The research discussed spans June 25, 2025, showcasing cutting-edge developments in machine learning (cs.LG), with a focus on efficiency, robustness, fairness, and foundational upgrades. These advancements collectively push the boundaries of AI capabilities while addressing critical challenges in privacy, computational cost, and ethical considerations.  <strong>Field Definition and Significance</strong>  Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, involves the development of algorithms that enable systems to learn patterns from data autonomously. Unlike traditional programming, where rules are explicitly coded, machine learning models infer relationships through training on large datasets. The significance of recent advancements lies in their potential to make AI systems more efficient, secure, and equitable. For instance, innovations in GPU optimization and federated learning directly impact scalability and privacy, while fairness-aware algorithms address biases in recommender systems (Author et al., 2025).  <strong>Major Themes and Paper Examples</strong>  Three dominant themes emerge from the analyzed research: efficiency, robustness, and fairness. First, efficiency improvements are exemplified by <em>PLoP: Precise LoRA Placement</em>, which automates the placement of adapter modules in transformer models, significantly reducing computational overhead (Author et al., 2025). Second, robustness is highlighted in , a method for detecting gradient leaks in federated learning, thereby enhancing security against malicious actors. Third, fairness is addressed in <em>Producer-Fairness in Sequential Bundle Recommendation</em>, which ensures equitable exposure for lesser-known content creators in recommender systems.  <strong>Methodological Approaches</strong>  The methodologies employed across these studies vary but share a common emphasis on optimization and generalization. For instance, <em>RWFT (Reweighted Fine-Tuning)</em> introduces a novel approach to machine unlearning by reweighting output distributions rather than retraining models from scratch (Author et al., 2025). Similarly,  leverages evolutionary algorithms to auto-tune GPU code, eliminating the need for manual optimization. These approaches demonstrate a shift toward automation and scalability in AI development.  <strong>Key Findings and Comparisons</strong>  Among the most notable findings is the 50x speedup achieved by  in class unlearning tasks, alongside a 111% improvement in privacy preservation compared to prior methods (Author et al., 2025). Another breakthrough, , reduces federated learning time by 40% through encrypted hint-sharing among edge devices. When compared to traditional federated learning frameworks,  demonstrates superior efficiency without compromising data privacy. Additionally,  merges physics-based modeling with AI to accelerate simulations of 3D-printed metal heat flow by a factor of 10, showcasing the potential of hybrid methodologies.    Several papers stand out for their transformative contributions. <em>Omniwise: Predicting GPU Kernels Performance with LLMs</em> introduces a large language model capable of predicting GPU performance metrics with 90% accuracy (Author et al., 2025).  revises attention mechanisms for medical time-series data, achieving clinical-grade reliability in seizure detection. Lastly, <em>Leaner Training, Lower Leakage</em> demonstrates that fine-tuning with LoRA reduces data memorization by 30%, addressing critical privacy concerns in generative AI.  <strong>Critical Assessment and Future Directions</strong>  While these advancements mark significant progress, challenges remain. For instance, the scalability of machine unlearning techniques to larger models requires further validation. Future research should explore the integration of causal inference methods, as proposed in <em>Stochastic Parameter Decomposition</em>, to enhance model interpretability. Additionally, multimodal approaches like  for Earth observation highlight the growing importance of cross-domain AI applications. The trajectory of AI research points toward systems that are not only more capable but also more ethical and sustainable.    Author et al. (2025).

Không có gì khác! Khi bạn gán biến mới bằng một biến khác, nó chỉ lấy giá trị của biến mà bạn muốn gán, biến gốc này sẽ không có thay đổi hay ảnh hưởng gì khi bạn tác động lên biến mới.</p><p><strong>Kiểu tham chiếu: object, array, function</strong>\nObject, array, function là 3 kiểu tham chiếu trong Javascript, tức là, khi bạn khởi tạo 1 Object, V8 tạo ra một tham chiếu đến một vùng nhớ trên HEAP (vật lý là từ RAM) để lưu trữ giá trị. Mọi hành động của bạn tương tác với biến mà bạn lưu cái Object này là bạn tương tác với tham chiếu.</p><div><pre><code>let user_01 = {\n    name: 'me',\n    age: 23\n}\n\nlet user_02 = user_01\n\nuser_02.name='18 again'\nuser_01.age= 18\n\nconsole.log(user_01)\nconsole.log(user_02)\n</code></pre></div><p>Đoán xem chuyện quái gì sẽ xảy ra?\nCả 2 đều là <em>{name: '18 again', age: 18}</em>!\nĐúng rồi, vì chúng ta tạo 2 biến, nhưng gán biến 02 bằng biến 01, tức là tham chiếu biến 02 này đến vùng nhớ chứa giá trị của 01. Khi thay đổi 01 thì 02 sẽ thay đổi theo và ngược lại. Đó là lý do tại sao người ta gọi là tham chiếu.</p><p>\nScope hiểu đơn giản là \"vòng đời của một biến từ khi sinh ra đến khi biến mất\".<p>\nCó 3 loại Scope: Block, Function, Global</p>\nBlock thì có thể hiểu đơn giản là trong cặp ngoặc gần nhất mà biến được khai báo.</p><p>Funtion thì đơn giản là trong hàm.</p><p>Global tức là biến toàn cục, bạn định nghĩa ở đâu kệ bạn, đều dùng được ở tất cả mọi nơi.</p><p>OK, bây giờ bạn đã nắm được các kiến thức cần thiết. Chúng ta đi vào phần chính.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Sự khac biệt giữa let và var\n</h2><p><strong>let là block scope, var là function scope</strong></p><div><pre><code>function Test(){\n    if(1==1){\n        var v =100\n        let l = 200\n    }\n\n    console.log(v) //100\n    console.log(l) // not defined\n}\n\nTest()\n</code></pre></div><p>\nCả let và var đều được hoisting (kéo lên đầu khi chạy) nhưng sau đó thì lại khác nhau, biến khai báo bằng var được khai báo nhưng chưa gán giá trị, lúc này nó sẽ là undefined, còn let thì bạn không dùng được luôn.</p><div><pre><code>console.log(a)\nvar a = 10 //undefine\n\nconsole.log(b)\nlet b = 11 // b is not defined\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Khi khai báo biến toàn cục, var sẽ gán nó thành thuộc tính của trình duyệt (window) luôn, còn let thì không.</strong></p><div><pre><code>var a = 10\nconsole.log(window.a) //10\n\nlet b = 12\nconsole.log(window.b) // undefined\n</code></pre></div><p>Xét đoạn code này, kết quả sẽ là 3, 3, 3</p><div><pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000);\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Còn nếu thay thế var bằng let, kết quản lại là 0, 1, 2.</p><p>Tại sao lại vậy, vì mỗi vòng lặp với let, như đã nói ở trên, là block scope, nên EMCA sẽ tạo ra một block cho mỗi vòng lặp, ở đó sẽ định nghĩa một biến tạm lưu giá trị của i hiện tại:</p><div><pre><code>{\n  let i = 0;\n  {\n    const iCopy = i;\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(iCopy), 1000);\n  }\n  i++;\n\n  {\n    const iCopy = i;\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(iCopy), 1000);\n  }\n  i++;\n\n  {\n    const iCopy = i;\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(iCopy), 1000);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>còn với var, mọi thứ đơn giản hơn:</p><div><pre><code>var i = 0;\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000); // nhớ i (tham chiếu, không phải giá trị)\ni++;\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000); // vẫn nhớ biến i\ni++;\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000); // tiếp tục nhớ biến i\ni++; // i = 3\n</code></pre></div><p>Vì vòng lặp chạy xong rất nhanh, chỉ vài microsecond đã đếm i đến 3, mà đợi xong một giây (1000ms) mới log ra i (3 lần) nên kết quản sẽ đều là 3.</p><p>Nói về const, nó không khác gì let ngoại trừ việc bạn không thể thay đổi nó, tuy nhiên vẫn có thể thay đổi thuộc tính của đối tượng được khai báo với const. </p><p>Hết.

How DevOps Improves Developer Experience\n</h2><p>\nWith Continuous Integration (CI), developers get rapid feedback on their code. This reduces wait time and rework.</p><p>\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) and containerization let developers spin up environments on-demand, test code, and deploy without waiting on ops.</p><p><strong>Less Blame, More Collaboration</strong>\nDevOps encourages shared ownership of production systems. Developers become part of incident resolution—not scapegoats for failures.</p><p><strong>Automation of Repetitive Tasks</strong>\nCI/CD pipelines eliminate manual deployments, flaky scripts, and human error. Less repetition = more innovation.</p><p><strong>Visibility and Observability</strong>\nLogging, monitoring, and alerting tools like Prometheus and Grafana give developers insight into how their code behaves in production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. DevOps and Delivery Speed: A Perfect Match\n</h2><p>DevOps doesn't just make developers happier—it makes them faster. Here's how:</p><ul><li>Smaller, more frequent releases reduce risk and make shipping feel safe</li><li>Rollback mechanisms and canary deployments allow for safer experimentation</li><li>Pipeline automation accelerates the entire software delivery lifecycle</li><li>Collaboration between dev and ops leads to faster problem-solving and decision-making</li></ul><p>With the right practices in place, some companies push code to production hundreds of times a day.</p><ul><li>83% of developers say DevOps improves their job satisfaction (Puppet State of DevOps Report)Source: <a href=\"https://www.perforce.com/press-releases/puppets-2024-state-devops-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puppet State</a></li><li>High-performing DevOps teams deploy 973x more frequently (DORA 2023)Source: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/announcing-dora-2021-accelerate-state-of-devops-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps Teams</a></li></ul><p>Let’s say you're a developer on a team without DevOps:\nYou write your code, submit a pull request, wait two days for a         code review, another day for QA, and then someone from operations manually deploys it next week.<p>\nNow imagine the DevOps version:</p>\nYou push code to a Git repo → automated tests run → your code merges and deploys automatically to staging → canary tests pass → it rolls out to production in minutes. You get a Slack alert that your deployment succeeded.<p>\nWhich scenario do you think makes a developer feel more in control, productive, and satisfied</p></p><p><strong>Q: Isn’t DevOps just for big companies?</strong>\n A: Not at all. Startups benefit even more because DevOps helps them move faster with leaner teams.</p><p><strong>Q: Does DevOps mean developers have to do ops work?</strong>\n A: Not entirely. It means shared responsibility—developers understand and contribute to operations, but they’re not on call 24/7.</p><p><strong>Q: What if my team doesn't have automation yet?</strong>\n A: You can start small—CI tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI make it easy to begin automating builds and tests.</p><ul><li>DevOps improves developer experience through autonomy, collaboration, and automation</li><li>Happier developers ship better code, faster</li><li>DevOps enables safer, smaller, and more frequent deployments</li><li>It’s not just a toolset—it’s a culture shift that drives productivity and well-being</li></ul><p>DevOps is more than just a methodology—it's a mindset. One that values speed, safety, transparency, and most importantly: developer happiness.\nBy reducing bottlenecks, automating the boring stuff, and fostering real collaboration, DevOps transforms software development into a more joyful, sustainable, and high-performing process.<p>\nWhen developers are happy, software ships faster. And when software ships faster, developers are even happier. It’s a win-win loop—and DevOps is the engine behind it.</p></p><p>About the Author: <em>Nilesh is a Lead DevOps Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.addwebsolution.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AddWebSolution</a>, specializing in automation, CI/CD, and cloud scalability.

This isn't coming from an ego-driven perspective—it's based on real-world experience with teams struggling with build times exceeding an hour for simple React applications.</p><p>I've witnessed firsthand the consequences of poor monorepo implementations: teams of 20+ engineers waiting over an hour for builds on every push to the dev branch. The culprit? A React project with compressed Ant Design components being unzipped in the CI/CD pipeline, taking forever to compile. The solution was straightforward—use Ant Design's built-in theming or create a private npm package—but organizational resistance led to copy-pasting entire folders into source code just to reduce build times from 60+ minutes to 5 minutes.</p><p>This guide will teach you how to build monorepos the right way using Turborepo, taking you from complete beginner to proficient practitioner.</p><p>Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases designed specifically for monorepos. It solves the fundamental scaling problem that monorepos face: as your repository grows, build times become prohibitively slow.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Monorepo Scaling Problem\n</h3><p>Monorepos offer many advantages—shared code, consistent tooling, atomic commits across projects—but they struggle to scale efficiently. Each workspace has its own:</p><ul></ul><p>A single monorepo might need to execute thousands of tasks. Without proper tooling, this creates dramatic slowdowns that affect how teams build and ship software.</p><p><strong>Turborepo solves this through intelligent caching and task orchestration.</strong> Its Remote Cache stores the results of all tasks, meaning your CI never needs to do the same work twice.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Prerequisites and Platform Notes\n</h2><p> Turborepo works best on Unix-like systems. If you're on Windows 11, consider using WSL 2.0 as you may encounter platform-specific issues.

Imagine eliminating the headache of disconnected systems and manual data entry. This isn’t a far-off dream. It’s the power of integrating your IT inventory tracking software with your core business systems.</p><p>By syncing your inventory data with ERP, procurement, and finance, you unlock a smoother, more efficient workflow. No more delays. No more confusion. Just instant, accurate information that fuels smarter decisions and saves you time and money.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll show you why integrating your IT inventory software is a game-changer—and how it can help your business run like a well-oiled machine.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Understanding Your Current Systems and Requirements\n</h2><p>Before you dive into integrating your IT inventory tracking software, it's important to first take a good look at what you're working with. You might have different systems in place for inventory, procurement, and finance, but are they playing nicely together? Identifying the gaps now will save you headaches down the road.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Check How Well Your Systems Sync\n</h3><p>Start by seeing if your systems are talking to each other. Does your inventory data update automatically in your ERP or finance system, or are you still manually entering things? If your systems aren’t in sync, it’s time to figure out where the disconnect is. This will help you identify what needs to be fixed during integration.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Pinpoint What Data Really Matters\n</h3><p>Every department has its own priorities. Procurement might need real-time asset data to make fast decisions, while finance will care more about depreciation and value tracking. Understanding these needs will help you focus on the data that actually needs to flow between systems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Set Your Integration Goals\n</h3><p>Now that you know where things are going wrong, it’s time to think about what you want to achieve. Whether it’s cutting down on errors, speeding up reporting, or automating manual tasks, having clear goals will guide the whole integration process.</p><p>Getting a good grip on your existing systems and their requirements will set you up for a smoother, more effective integration, making everything work together seamlessly in the end.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Choosing the Right Integration Method\n</h2><p>Once you’ve got a clear understanding of your systems, it’s time to figure out how to connect them. The right integration method will depend on your specific needs, but don’t worry—it’s not as complicated as it might seem. Here’s how to make the right choice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  APIs: The Simple, Powerful Option\n</h3><p>Most modern IT inventory tracking software, ERP, and financial systems offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Think of APIs as bridges that allow systems to talk to each other and share data in real-time. If your software offers API support, this is usually the most efficient way to integrate. It’s fast, efficient, and reduces the risk of manual errors. If you’re looking for something quick and scalable, APIs are a great choice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Middleware: For the Complex Setups\n</h3><p>If your systems are a bit older or don’t support APIs, middleware could be your solution. Middleware is a software layer that sits between your systems, helping them communicate even if they weren’t built to work together. It’s a solid choice for more complex or legacy setups, though it might take a little extra time to set up. Still, it gets the job done.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cloud vs. On-Premise: Which Is Best for You?\n</h3><p>When it comes to integration, you’ll also need to decide whether to go with a cloud-based or on-premise solution. <a href=\"https://assetloom.com/blog/cloud-based-it-asset-management-software?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=it-inventory-tracking-software\">Cloud-based systems</a> are flexible and easy to scale, which makes them great for businesses that are growing or need to access their systems remotely. <a href=\"https://assetloom.com/blog/connect-on-premise-services-to-itam-software?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=it-inventory-tracking-software\">On-premise systems</a>, on the other hand, offer more control and security, though they can be a bit trickier to scale.</p><p>The key here is to match the method to your business needs. API is usually the most straightforward, but if you’re dealing with older systems or specific security concerns, middleware or on-premise might be a better fit.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Data Mapping and Synchronization\n</h2><p>With your integration method chosen, the next step is ensuring that your data flows smoothly between systems. This is where data mapping and synchronization come into play.</p><p>You need to make sure that the data from your IT inventory system matches the fields in your ERP, procurement, and finance systems. For example, the asset ID in your inventory system must align with the purchase order ID in your ERP. This mapping ensures that no data gets lost or mixed up.</p><p>Decide how often you want your systems to sync. Real-time syncing is ideal for fast-moving operations, like inventory updates or procurement, but it might be overkill for things like financial reporting, which could be done on a daily or weekly schedule.</p><p>Before going live, run tests to ensure that everything is syncing correctly. You’ll want to catch any issues before your systems are fully integrated. Do a dry run with sample data and check for errors—better to address them now than later.</p><p><a href=\"https://assetloom.com/blog/it-inventory-tracking?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=it-inventory-tracking-software\">IT inventory tracking strategies</a> are key here, as they help you establish clear rules for how data should flow between systems. This ensures everything stays aligned and running smoothly, making your processes more efficient.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Overcoming Integration Challenges\n</h2><p>Even the best integration plans face challenges, but with the right approach, these hurdles can be cleared quickly.</p><p>Different systems may use different data formats or communication protocols, which can create roadblocks. If you’re working with older systems, check compatibility early on. Make sure your integration tools support all the software versions you're using.</p><p>The integration process can get overwhelming if you try to tackle everything at once. Break it down into smaller phases. Start with integrating your IT inventory system with one other system (like procurement), and move on to the others once that’s running smoothly.</p><p>Testing each phase of the integration is crucial. Run multiple tests to make sure that everything is syncing as expected. The more testing you do, the fewer surprises you’ll have when it goes live.</p><p>By tackling potential challenges early on and testing thoroughly, you’ll be ready to handle any bumps in the road and ensure the integration is successful.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Training and Change Management\n</h2><p>Now that your systems are connected, it’s time to prepare your team for the change. Without proper training, even the best integration won’t yield its full benefits.</p><p>Make sure everyone knows how to use the integrated system. From procurement to finance, each department needs to understand how its role fits into the new process. Highlight the time-saving benefits and make sure they know where to find the information they need.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Communicate with Stakeholders\n</h3><p>Keep everyone in the loop. Regular updates about the integration process will reduce confusion and ensure smoother adoption. It’s also important to let team members know when they can expect the changes to take effect and what new features they can look forward to.</p><p>Change can be tough, especially when it involves new technology. Address any concerns your team might have and offer support during the transition. A little patience and guidance go a long way.</p><p>By focusing on effective training and managing change carefully, you can ensure a smooth transition and make the most of your new integrated system.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Continuous Monitoring and Optimization\n</h2><p>The integration doesn’t stop once everything’s up and running. Continuous monitoring ensures your systems stay in sync and continue to work efficiently.</p><p>Monitor the integration’s performance by setting up automated reports. Check for any discrepancies in data and track system downtime to make sure things are running smoothly. This will also help identify any areas for improvement.</p><p>As your business grows, your integration needs may evolve. Be ready to make adjustments as new systems, tools, or business needs arise. Regular maintenance is key to keeping everything running without hiccups.</p><p>Over time, you may need to scale the integration. This could mean adding new systems, expanding data sync rules, or adapting to new business units. Always plan for the future so your integration can grow with your company.</p><p>By continuously monitoring performance and optimizing the integration over time, you ensure that your systems stay aligned as your business evolves.</p><p>Integrating your IT inventory tracking software with ERP, procurement, and financial systems isn’t just about connecting the dots—it’s about creating a streamlined, efficient workflow that improves every aspect of your business. By following these practical steps and best practices, you’ll set up an integration that not only works well today but can evolve with your business tomorrow.</p><p>Ready to take your asset management to the next level? Start with a clear strategy and a well-planned approach to integration. The result? Seamless operations, better decision-making, and, ultimately, a stronger, more agile business.</p>","contentLength":9223,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SIMD Vectorized Computing（1751344674924200）","url":"https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/simd-vectorized-computing1751344674924200-51a4","date":1751344676,"author":"member_35db4d53","guid":178652,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications.

This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times.

Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions.

Canary deployments have emerged as a critical strategy for minimizing risk while maintaining continuous delivery. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to implement robust canary deployments using Flagger, a progressive delivery operator for Kubernetes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Canary Deployment?\n</h2><p>Canary deployment is a technique for rolling out new features or changes to a small subset of users before releasing the update to the entire system. Named after the \"canary in a coal mine\" practice, this approach allows you to detect issues early and rollback quickly if problems arise.</p><p>Instead of replacing your entire application at once, canary deployments gradually shift traffic from the stable version (primary) to the new version (canary), monitoring key metrics throughout the process. If the metrics indicate problems, the deployment automatically rolls back to the stable version.</p><p>Flagger is a progressive delivery operator that automates the promotion or rollback of canary deployments based on metrics analysis. Here's why it stands out:</p><ul><li><strong>Automated Traffic Management</strong>: Gradually shifts traffic between versions</li><li>: Uses Prometheus metrics to determine deployment success</li><li>: Works with NGINX, Istio, Linkerd, and more</li><li>: Supports custom testing and validation hooks</li><li>: Seamlessly works with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</li></ul><p>As shared above, Flagger provides multiple integration options but I used Nginx ingress controller and Prometheus for metrics. </p><ul><li> (v1.0.2 or newer)</li><li><strong>Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</strong> (HPA) enabled</li><li> for metrics collection and analysis</li><li> deployed in your cluster</li></ul><div><pre><code>\nkubectl get service  | nginx\n\n\nkubectl get hpa \nkubectl get all  flagger\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Installing Flagger\n</h2><p>Flagger can be deployed using Helm or ArgoCD.

By gradually shifting traffic while monitoring key metrics, it enables safe deployments with automatic rollback capabilities.</p><p>The combination of metrics-driven analysis, webhook integration, and seamless traffic management makes Flagger an excellent choice for teams looking to implement progressive delivery practices. Start with simple configurations and gradually add more sophisticated monitoring and testing as your confidence grows.</p><p>Remember that successful canary deployments depend not just on the tooling, but also on having appropriate metrics, sufficient traffic, and well-defined success criteria.

Buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory leaks not only affect program stability but can also become entry points for hacker attacks.</p><p>Traditional C/C++ languages, although excellent in performance, rely entirely on programmer experience and care for memory management.

Languages like Java and Python solve memory safety issues through garbage collection mechanisms, but the overhead of garbage collection becomes a performance bottleneck.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Power of Zero-Cost Abstractions\n</h2><p>One of Rust's most impressive features is zero-cost abstractions. This means we can use high-level abstract concepts without paying runtime performance costs. The compiler optimizes these abstractions into machine code equivalent to hand-written low-level code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Wisdom of Borrow Checker\n</h2><p>Rust's borrow checker is the core mechanism for achieving memory safety. It can detect most memory-related errors at compile time without requiring runtime checks. This allows us to write code that is both safe and efficient.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Through this deep exploration of the balance between memory safety and ultimate performance, I not only mastered the core technologies of safe programming, but more importantly, I developed a mindset for safe and efficient development.

Mastering these technologies will give me an advantage in future technological competition.</p><p><em>This article records my deep thinking as a junior student on the balance between memory safety and performance.

This chapter covers the theoretical foundations of vector search - the mathematical concepts, representation methods, and core techniques that power modern semantic search systems.</p></blockquote><ol><li>🔍 Introduction to Vector Search</li><li>🧮 Understanding Vectors and Embeddings</li><li>📊 Types of Vector Representations</li><li>⚡ Vector Search Techniques</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔍 Introduction to Vector Search\n</h2><p>Vector search is a modern approach to finding similar content by representing data as high-dimensional numerical vectors. Instead of searching for exact keyword matches like traditional search engines, vector search finds items that are semantically similar - meaning they have similar meanings or contexts.</p><p>: Imagine you're looking for movies similar to \"The Matrix.\" Traditional keyword search might only find movies with \"Matrix\" in the title. Vector search, however, would find sci-fi movies with similar themes like \"Inception\" or \"Blade Runner\" because they share semantic similarity in the vector space.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🌟 Why Vector Search Matters\n</h3><ol><li>: Captures the meaning behind words, not just exact matches</li><li>: Works with text, images, audio, and other data types</li><li>: Understands relationships and context between different pieces of information</li><li>: Enables natural language queries and similarity-based searches</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Real-World Applications\n</h3><ul><li>: Finding relevant documents based on meaning, not just keywords</li><li>: Suggesting products, movies, or content based on user preferences</li><li>: Retrieving relevant context for LLM-based chat systems</li><li>: Finding visually similar images</li><li>: Identifying similar or duplicate content</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧮 Understanding Vectors and Embeddings\n</h2><p>In the context of machine learning and search, a  is a list of numbers that represents data in a mathematical form that computers can understand and process. Think of a vector as coordinates in a multi-dimensional space.</p><ul><li>A 2D vector:  represents a point in 2D space</li><li>A 3D vector:  represents a point in 3D space</li><li>An embedding vector:  might have 768 dimensions representing a word or document</li></ul><p> are a special type of vector that represents the semantic meaning of data (like words, sentences, or images) in a continuous numerical space. They are created by machine learning models trained on large datasets.</p><p><strong>🎯 Key Properties of Good Embeddings</strong>:</p><ol><li>: Similar items have similar vectors</li><li>: The distance between vectors reflects semantic relationships</li><li>: Each dimension contributes to the meaning (unlike sparse representations)</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  🎭 How Embeddings Capture Meaning\n</h3><p>Consider these movie examples:</p><ul><li>\"Interstellar\" →  (high sci-fi, low drama, low comedy)</li><li>\"The Notebook\" →  (low sci-fi, high drama, low comedy)</li><li>\"Shrek\" →  (low sci-fi, low drama, high comedy)</li></ul><p>Movies with similar genres will have vectors that are close to each other in this space.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📊 Types of Vector Representations\n</h2><p>: The simplest way to represent categorical data as vectors. Each item gets a vector with a single 1 and the rest 0s.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>No semantic relationships (apple and banana don't appear similar)</li><li>Very high dimensionality for large vocabularies</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2️⃣ Dense Vectors (Embeddings)\n</h3><p>: Compact, dense numerical representations where each dimension captures some aspect of meaning.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Capture semantic relationships</li><li>Enable similarity calculations</li><li>Work well with machine learning models</li></ul><p><strong>🛠️ Creating Dense Vectors</strong>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3️⃣ Choosing the Right Dimensionality\n</h3><p><strong>🤔 How many dimensions do you need?</strong></p><ul><li>: 100-300 dimensions (Word2Vec, GloVe)</li><li>: 384-768 dimensions (BERT, MPNet)</li><li>: 512-1024+ dimensions</li><li>: 512-2048+ dimensions</li></ul><ul><li>: Better representation, more computational cost</li><li>: Faster processing, potential information loss</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚡ Vector Search Techniques\n</h2><p>Vector search relies on measuring how \"similar\" vectors are. Here are the most common metrics:</p><p>: The angle between two vectors (ignores magnitude): -1 to 1 (1 = identical, 0 = orthogonal, -1 = opposite): Text embeddings, normalized data</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Straight-line distance between points: 0 to infinity (0 = identical, larger = more different): Image embeddings, when magnitude matters</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Pure vector search sometimes misses exact matches or specific terms.</p><p>: Combine vector search (semantic) with keyword search (lexical).</p><ul><li>Query: \"18 U.S.C. § 1341\" (specific legal code)</li><li>Vector search might find semantically similar laws</li><li>Keyword search finds the exact code</li><li>Hybrid search combines both for better results</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  4️⃣ Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)\n</h3><p>For large datasets, exact search becomes too slow.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns\n</h2><p>Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:</p><p>Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Request/Response Compression\n</h3><p>Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.</p><p>API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication and Authorization\n</h3><p>Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h2><p>Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:</p><p>Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.</p><p>Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.</p><p>Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deployment and Scaling Strategies\n</h2><p>Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:</p><p>API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.</p><p>Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.</p><p>For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lessons Learned and Best Practices\n</h2><p>Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:</p><ol><li><p>: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.</p></li><li><p>: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.</p></li><li><p>: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.</p></li></ol><p>The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:</p><p>Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.</p><p>Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.</p><p>API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.</p><p>The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.</p><p>As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.</p><p><em>This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns\n</h2><p>Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:</p><p>Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Request/Response Compression\n</h3><p>Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.</p><p>API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication and Authorization\n</h3><p>Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h2><p>Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:</p><p>Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.</p><p>Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.</p><p>Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deployment and Scaling Strategies\n</h2><p>Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:</p><p>API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.</p><p>Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.</p><p>For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lessons Learned and Best Practices\n</h2><p>Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:</p><ol><li><p>: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.</p></li><li><p>: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.</p></li><li><p>: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.</p></li></ol><p>The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:</p><p>Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.</p><p>Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.</p><p>API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure.

Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.</p><p><strong>The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital Age</strong></p><p>Modern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.</p><p>I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.</p><p>Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.</p><p><strong>Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency Safety</strong></p><p>The framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.</p><p>This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.</p><p>Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.</p><p><strong>Framework Design: Layered and Resilient Defenses</strong></p><p>Beyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization</strong>\nThe principle of \"Never trust user input\" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.<p>\nIt also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.</p>\nMy tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This \"secure by default\" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Session Management and Authentication</strong>\nSecure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.<p>\nWhile it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).</p>\nI observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.</p></li><li><p>\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Dependency Management</strong>\nContemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.\nThe framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error Handling and Information Concealment</strong>\nExposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.</p></li><li><p>\nHTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).</p></li></ol><p><strong>Practical Security Considerations in Implementation</strong></p><p>When implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong>: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.</li><li><strong>Audits and Penetration Testing</strong>: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.</li><li>: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.</li><li><strong>Timely Dependency Updates</strong>: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Log Monitoring</strong>: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.</li></ul><p>This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.</p><p><strong>Comparative Analysis with Other Frameworks</strong></p><p>Compared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.</p><p>When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.</p><p>Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Security as a Continuous Endeavor</strong></p><p>In the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.</p><p>This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.</p><p>As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.</p>","contentLength":8578,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Single Core Hundred Thousand Concurrency（1751327856613900）","url":"https://dev.to/member_de57975b/single-core-hundred-thousand-concurrency1751327856613900-463o","date":1751327857,"author":"member_de57975b","guid":177012,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have been troubled by a question during my high-concurrency programming learning: how to achieve hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections on a single-core processor?

Let’s get started!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔧 1. PHPUnit – The Engine Behind Laravel Testing\n</h2><p>Laravel uses  under the hood as its testing engine. If you've never heard of PHPUnit before — no worries. It's a popular testing framework for PHP that lets you write automated tests to verify your application works as expected.</p><p>Laravel comes bundled with PHPUnit support, so you don’t need to install it separately. Just make sure your dependencies are up to date:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📂 2. The  Directory – Where Tests Live\n</h2><p>Laravel has a dedicated  directory at the root of your project. This folder is  when you create a new Laravel app.</p><p>Inside this folder, you'll find :</p><p>Used for testing  — routes, HTTP requests, controllers, etc.\nThink of it as: <em>“How does my app behave from the outside?”</em></p><p>Used for testing <strong>individual classes or methods</strong> — things like helpers, services, or business logic.\nThink of it as: <em>“Is this specific method doing what I expect?”</em></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧠 3. What Is SUT (Subject Under Test)?\n</h2><p>In testing terminology,  stands for . It refers to the <strong>actual function, class, or feature</strong> you're trying to test.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, the  is your SUT. You're checking if the behavior () works as intended.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧪 4. TDD – Test Driven Development (Laravel Makes It Easy!)\n</h2><p> stands for , a technique where you:</p><ol><li>Write a failing test first.</li><li>Write just enough code to pass the test.</li><li>Refactor your code while keeping the test green.</li></ol><p>Laravel supports TDD beautifully, especially when combined with tools like Pest or Laravel Dusk (for browser testing).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚙️ 5. Configuration File: </h2><p>Laravel includes a pre-configured file named , which lives in your project root. This file contains default settings like:</p><ul><li>The environment settings for testing ()</li></ul><p>Unless you're customizing deeply, you usually don’t need to touch this file.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🏃‍♂️ 6. How to Run Your Tests\n</h2><p>Laravel gives you a simple artisan command to run your tests:</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the raw PHPUnit command:</p><p>Laravel’s test runner adds extra polish, including a beautiful output and even error highlighting.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧱 7.

I'm writing this because I'm convinced that this was a great architecture choice and there aren't many examples of event sourcing and CQRS in the internet where it actually makes sense. You are very welcome to share your thoughts and whether you agree about this design choice or not :)</p><p>The client was a medium sized fintech company that has in-house developed a real time trading platform that was launched as a beta test version. The functionality included:</p><ul><li>Real time transaction tracking</li><li>Account with a little social media functionality (making posts, liking and commenting)</li><li>Mobile device notifications</li></ul><p>Their app was an MVP. It had a monolithic Spring boot backend and a simple React based web UI, everything hosted on Azure.</p><p>They hired us because of two main reasons: their MVP was not auditable and thus not compliant with financial regulations and also not scalable (high usage and fault tolerance).</p><p>We worked with the customer, not alone. Our team were about 10 people, experienced back end or full stack developers and me as a software architect. The client had about 20 developers, ranging from front end, back end to database experts and more. My role was to lead the architecture.</p><p>As said, the main issues to solve were auditability (compliance) and scalability (including performance and fault tolerance). I will start with an overview of the design including a super short repetition of what each technology is and later dive into detail in the next session, including discussing the trade offs and alternative solutions.</p><p>Our customer must by law always know past states. For example, customer A had exactly $901 on their account 2 months ago at 1:30 pm. This was not possible with the existing system so we needed to tackle it. I proposed to use event sourcing. Here is a very brief explanation of event sourcing.</p><blockquote><p>Event sourcing = Save events, not state</p></blockquote><p>So instead of having a state we update, we save events. We use these events to create the state when we need it. Consider this simple example:</p><div><pre><code>+--------------------------------------+\n| Table: Account_Balance               |\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Account_ID | Balance | Last_Updated  |\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Customer_A | $0      | 2025-04-29    | &lt;- Initial state\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Customer_A | $5      | 2025-04-29    | &lt;- After receiving $5 (overwrites $0)\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Customer_A | $12     | 2025-04-29    | &lt;- After receiving $7 (overwrites $5)\n+--------------------------------------+\n</code></pre></div><p>Problem: Past states (e.g., $5 at 1:30 PM) are lost unless separately logged.</p><div><pre><code>+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Table: Account_Events                                             |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Event_ID | Account_ID | Event_Type | Amount | Timestamp           |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 1        | Customer_A | Deposit    | $5     | 2025-04-29 13:30:00 | &lt;- Event: Received $5\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 2        | Customer_A | Deposit    | $7     | 2025-04-29 13:31:00 | &lt;- Event: Received $7\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n</code></pre></div><p>Reconstructing Balance at 2025-04-29 13:30:00:</p><ul><li>Sum events up to timestamp: $5 = $5</li></ul><p>Reconstructing Balance at 2025-04-29 13:31:00:</p><ul><li>Sum events up to timestamp: $5 + $7 = $12</li></ul><p>Reconstructing Balance 2 months ago:</p><ul><li>Sum all relevant events &lt;= timestamp</li></ul><p>This is event sourcing in a nutshell. For a more comprehensive explanation, please have a look <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> for example.</p><p>This is the right choice here because this gives us total control and transparency. When we want to know how much money a particular user had 2 months ago at 1:42 pm, we can just query the needed transactions and sum them up. We know everything with this approach. And this is required to be compliant. As a side note, accounting does the same thing but, of course, they don't call it event sourcing :)</p><p>But event sourcing comes with more advantages, including:</p><ul><li>Rebuild state: you can always just discard the app state completely and rebuild it. You have all info you need, all events that ever took place.</li><li>Event replay: if we want to adjust a past event, for example because it was incorrect, we can just do that and rebuild the app state.</li><li>Event replay again: if we have received events in the wrong sequence, which is a common problem with systems that communicate with asynchronous messaging, we can just replay them and get the correct state.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Alternatives to Event Sourcing\n</h4><p>Event sourcing definitely solves the auditability/compliance problem. But there are alternatives:</p><p>: Keep the current state tables but add comprehensive audit logs that track all changes. This is simpler to implement but doesn't provide the same level of detail as event sourcing. You track what changed, but not necessarily the business intent behind the change.</p><p><strong>2. Change Data Capture (CDC)</strong>: Use database-level tools to capture all changes automatically. Tools like Debezium can stream database changes, but this is more technical and less business-focused than event sourcing.</p><p>: Use database features (like SQL Server's temporal tables) to automatically version data. This provides history but lacks the rich business context that events provide.</p><p><strong>4. Transaction Log Mining</strong>: Extract historical data from database transaction logs. This is complex and database-specific, making it harder to maintain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)\n</h3><p>The second major architectural decision was implementing CQRS, though we didn't start with it immediately due to complexity. We kept it in mind during the initial design and tested it later through a proof of concept, then implemented it in production.</p><blockquote><p>CQRS = Separate your reads from your writes</p></blockquote><p>This is all. Often CQRS is presented as (among other things) having two separate DBs, one for writing and one for reading. But this is not true, you are doing CQRS already when you just separate read and write code, for example by putting them into separate classes.</p><p>However, the benefits we needed do indeed require separate DBs.</p><div><pre><code>Traditional Approach:\n┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐\n│   Client    │────│   Service    │────│   Database   │\n│             │    │              │    │              │\n│ Read/Write  │    │ Read/Write   │    │ Read/Write   │\n└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘\n\nCQRS Approach:\n┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐\n│   Client    │────│ Command Side │────│ Write Store  │\n│             │    │   (Writes)   │    │ (Event Store)│\n│             │    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘\n│             │           │                    │\n│             │           │ Events             │ Events\n│             │           ▼                    ▼\n│             │    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐\n│             │────│  Query Side  │────│  Read Store  │\n│             │    │   (Reads)    │    │ (Projections)│\n└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘\n</code></pre></div><p>The benefits of doing this are the following:</p><ul><li>Scale read and write resources differently\n\n<ul><li>By having two separate DBs, you can choose different technologies and scale them independently</li><li>If performance is critical in your app, this can definitely help, especially when reads and writes are not of a similar amount</li><li>In our case, we have a read heavy app</li></ul></li><li>You can have different models for reading and writing</li></ul><p>As hinted already, this was crucial for our trading platform because:</p><ul><li>Complex reports and dashboards need denormalized, optimized read models,</li><li>Read and write loads are completely different in trading systems, so we need independent scalability,</li><li>We can use different databases optimized for each purpose.</li></ul><p>However, CQRS with separate DBs comes at great cost again, for example, you need to deal with eventual consistency.</p><p>: We do NOT use CQRS on every service but only where it justifies the complexity.</p><p>You can try to get the benefits of CQRS in other ways, for example by using caching strategies and read replicas. I'll dive into the tradeoffs of these approaches in the detailed discussion section.</p><p>We also decided to break the monolith into microservices. The main reason for this decision was again independent scalability and higher fault tolerance. The existing monolith was often running on very high CPU usage due to report generation and real-time market data processing consuming most resources.</p><p>By separating these concerns into different services, even if our report generation service crashes due to heavy usage, other critical services like transaction processing are not impacted at all. This improves our overall system availability (MTBF - Mean Time Between Failures) and reduces recovery time (MTTR - Mean Time To Recovery).</p><p>An interesting part here was the migration from monolith to microservices using the strangler fig pattern, gradually replacing parts of the monolith.</p><p>Another decision was to use asynchronous messaging for inter-service communication instead of request-response communication.</p><div><pre><code>Synchronous (Traditional):\nService A ──HTTP Request──► Service B\n          ◄──Response─────\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Asynchronous (Our Approach):\nService A ──Event──► Message Queue ──Event──► Service B\n</code></pre></div><p>This event-driven approach has many benefits such as high decoupling. However, we were primarily interested in better fault tolerance:</p><p>Suppose Service A informs Service B to save data to its DB. If we use a traditional HTTP request and Service B is down, then the request is lost. Of course there are ways to combat this but if we use asynchronous messaging instead, then Service A just pushed that event to the message queue and if Service B is down, nothing happens. The event just stays on the queue. And as soon as Service B is up again, the event gets processed.</p><p>So using this approach gives us better fault tolerance in the case of network partitions.</p><p>Now asynchronous messaging has clear downsides too, mainly complexity, particularly when it comes to debugging, testing and things of that kind.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Detailed Discussion: Tradeoffs and Alternatives\n</h2><p>We identified services based on business capabilities as follows:</p><div><pre><code>Transaction-Portfolio Service:\n├── Owns: Account balances, transaction history, stock holdings\n├── Responsibilities: Money transfers, buy/sell orders, balance queries\n└── Database: PostgreSQL (ACID compliance critical)\n\nNotification Service:\n├── Owns: User preferences, notification history\n├── Responsibilities: Email, SMS, push notifications\n└── Database: MongoDB (flexible schema for different notification types)\n└── Event Sourcing: NOT used (simple CRUD operations)\n\nSocial Service:\n├── Owns: Posts, likes, comments\n├── Responsibilities: Social feed, user interactions\n└── Database: MongoDB\n└── Event Sourcing: NOT used (not critical for compliance)\n\nReport Service:\n├── Owns: Aggregated data, report templates\n├── Responsibilities: Generate complex reports\n└── Database: ClickHouse (optimized for analytics)\n└── CQRS: Read-only projections from other services\n\nUser Service:\n├── Owns: User profiles, authentication\n├── Responsibilities: Registration, login, profile management\n└── Database: PostgreSQL\n└── Event Sourcing: NOT used (user profiles change infrequently)\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Service Boundary Evolution</strong>: Initially, we considered separating Transaction Service and Portfolio Service. However, we discovered early in the design phase that this would be wrong. Due to very frequent boundary crossings and the need for distributed transactions when a trade affects both account balance and portfolio holdings, we decided to keep these as a single service. This eliminated the complexity of distributed transactions while maintaining other benefits.</p><p>In my opinion, the need of distributed transactions or sagas is always an indicator to check if your service boundaries are the right choice. Maybe you want to merge services instead. To quote Sam Newman in <em>Building Microservices (2nd edition)</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Distributed Transactions: Just Say No. For all the reasons outlined so far, I strongly suggest you avoid the use of distributed transactions like the two-phase commit to coordinate changes in state across your microservices. So what else can you do? Well, the first option could be to just not split the data apart in the first place. If you have pieces of state that you want to manage in a truly atomic and consistent way, and you cannot work out how to sensibly get these characteristics without an ACID-style transaction, then leave that state in a single database, and leave the functionality that manages that state in a single service (or in your monolith). If you're in the process of working out where to split your monolith and what decompositions might be easy (or hard), then you could well decide that splitting apart data that is currently managed in a transaction is just too difficult to handle right now. Work on some other area of the system, and come back to this later. But what happens if you really do need to break this data apart, but you don't want all the pain of managing distributed transactions? In cases like this, you may consider an alternative approach: sagas.</p></blockquote><p>So he also recommends to either merge the services or, if really needed, to use sagas. In our case we decided that this service boundary would be wrong since the scalibility needs to the transaction service and the portfolio service are not that different actually.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Where We Use Event Sourcing\n</h4><p>We used event sourcing only in the Transaction-Portfolio Service due to the strict compliance requirements for financial data. The other services used traditional CRUD patterns since they didn't require the same level of auditability.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of Event Sourcing\n</h4><p>Event sourcing has better performance when it comes to writing. Consider this example:</p><p>Traditional Update Pattern:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And it has even more advantages on the writing part:</p><ul><li>: Append-only writes are much faster than updates</li><li>: Multiple transactions can write simultaneously</li><li>: No need to lock rows for balance updates</li><li>: Sequential writes perform excellently on modern storage</li></ul><p>Although we talked about this already, here is a sample of how you could implement :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Performance Issue - Event Replay</strong></p><p>The main challenge we faced was performance degradation when reconstructing current state from thousands of events. For active trading accounts, we had up to 50,000 events per day.</p><p>Our solution was a hybrid approach:</p><ul><li>: Create snapshots after every 1,000 events per account</li><li>: Only replay events since the last snapshot</li></ul><p>This approach ensures that we never need to replay more than 1,000 events for any account, keeping reconstruction time predictable and fast.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This reduced our balance calculation time from 2-5 seconds to 50-200ms for active accounts.</p><p>Events accumulate rapidly. We implemented a tiered storage strategy:</p><ul><li> (Azure Premium SSD): Last 3 months ~ 2TB</li><li> (Azure Standard SSD): 3-12 months ~ 5TB</li><li> (Azure Archive): 1+ years ~ 50TB</li></ul><p>Total storage costs: $800/month vs $15,000/month if everything was on premium storage.</p><p>Event sourcing adds significant complexity. A part of the team needed training.</p><p>\nGetting current state requires aggregation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nEvents accumulate over time and require storage management strategies.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why We Rejected Alternatives\n</h4><p>Yes, we have decided to use event sourcing even though it comes with read performance issues - and performance was a main concern of our customer.</p><p>The reason is that event sourcing is simply much superior when it comes to audits. This was much more important to the customer than performance. Plus we managed to solve the performance issue.</p><p>: CQRS in the sense of having multiple DBs adds complexity and eventual consistency. This is why we decided  using it immediately but just kept it in mind. We later created a proof of concept to compare the performance benefits we would get in the Portfolio Service.</p><p>Our POC results showed for a test user account:</p><ul><li>: 30 seconds → 10 seconds</li><li>: 1 second → 400ms</li><li><strong>Complex query performance</strong>: about 2x improvement</li></ul><p>The result convinced us to implement it. We later added it to the Transaction Service for high-volume trading operations, but . Adding CQRS to all our services would have little benefits (we don't need the performance benefits or different read/write models at most services) but much complexity.</p><p>We implemented CQRS for the Transaction-Portfolio Service as follows. We had a Postgres DB for the write side (command side) and a MongoDB for the read side (query side). We chose a document store because we did not want a fixed schema plus we wanted very high read throughput.</p><p>So the service received a request and decided to write, it wrote to the Postgres DB and also emitted an event to our message broker (Azure Service Bus). This event was then processed by a different instance of the Transaction-Portfolio Service and we write to the MongoDB. Here we don't write the same data but a denormalized form, so that querying the data we need is faster.</p><p>Note we sacrifice ACID by doing this. This gave us eventual consistency between read and write sides, typically within 100-500ms.</p><p>The performance improvements came from:</p><ol><li>: Instead of complex JOINs across normalized tables, we had pre-computed aggregations</li><li>: Each MongoDB collection had indexes tailored for specific query patterns</li><li>: We could scale read replicas independently of the write database</li></ol><p>Consider this example of generating a user's portfolio performance report:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Major Challenges and How We Solved Them\n</h3><p><strong>1. Debugging Distributed Systems</strong></p><p>This was our biggest pain point initially. When a transaction failed, tracing the issue across multiple services and async message queues was a nightmare.</p><p>We solved this by implementing distributed tracing with correlation IDs that flow through every service call and message. Every log entry includes the correlation ID, making it possible to reconstruct the entire flow. We used Jaeger for distributed tracing and structured logging with consistent fields across all services.</p><p>Testing event sourcing and CQRS systems is fundamentally different. You can't just mock database calls - you need to verify that events are produced correctly and that projections are updated properly.</p><p>We created integration test environments that could replay production events against test instances. This allowed us to validate that code changes wouldn't break existing event processing. We also invested heavily in property-based testing to verify that event sequences always produce valid states.</p><p>I'm convinced this was the right architecture for our specific requirements. However, there are definitely things I would approach differently:</p><ul><li><p>We didn't have a clear strategy for evolving event schemas initially. When we needed to add fields to events or change event structure, it created compatibility issues with existing events.</p></li><li><p>Also our monitoring and logging was weak in the beginning and made everything even more complex to start.</p></li><li><p>I would consider using EventStore instead of Postgres for the Transaction-Portfolio Service. EventStore is purpose-built for event sourcing and provides features like built-in projections, event versioning, and optimized append-only storage. This would eliminate much of the custom event sourcing infrastructure we had to build on top of Postgres.</p></li></ul>","contentLength":20210,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Programming Entry Level: tutorial classes","url":"https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/programming-entry-level-tutorial-classes-2bnf","date":1751321717,"author":"DevOps Fundamental","guid":176963,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Tutorial Classes for Beginners\n</h2><p>So, you're starting your programming journey – awesome! You've probably heard about \"classes\" and maybe even \"tutorial classes.\" They can sound intimidating, but trust me, they're a fundamental building block of many programming languages and understanding them will unlock a lot of power.  This post will break down what tutorial classes are, why they're useful, and how to start using them.  Knowing this stuff is also super helpful in technical interviews, as it shows you understand core programming concepts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Understanding \"tutorial classes\"\n</h3><p>Imagine you're building with LEGOs. You could just pile bricks together randomly, but it's much more organized (and fun!) to follow instructions to build a specific model, like a car or a house.  </p><p>A \"class\" in programming is like those LEGO instructions. It's a blueprint for creating objects.  Think of an object as the finished LEGO model – a specific instance of the instructions. </p><p>Let's say you want to represent a dog in your program. A class called  would define what a dog  – it has a name, a breed, and can bark.  Each  dog (like your pet Fido or your neighbor's Spot) would be an  created from the  class. They all share the same characteristics (name, breed, bark), but each dog has its own  values for those characteristics.</p><p>Here's a simple way to visualize it using a diagram:</p><div><pre><code>classDiagram\n    class Dog {\n        - name : string\n        - breed : string\n        + bark() : void\n    }\n</code></pre></div><p>This diagram shows the  class has attributes (name and breed) and a method (bark).  Attributes are the data the object holds, and methods are the actions the object can perform.</p><p>Let's see how this looks in Python:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>: This line  a new class named .  It's like creating the blueprint.</li><li><code>def __init__(self, name, breed):</code>: This is a special method called the . It's automatically called when you create a new  object.   refers to the object being created.  and  are parameters you pass in when creating the dog.</li><li>: This line assigns the value of the  parameter to the  attribute of the  object.   does the same for the breed.</li><li>: This defines a method called .  Methods are functions that belong to the class.  Again,  refers to the specific  object that's barking.</li><li><code>print(\"Woof! My name is\", self.name)</code>: This line prints a message including the dog's name.</li></ol><p>Now, let's create some  objects:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code first creates two  objects,  and , using the  class.  Then, it calls the  method on each object.  You'll see the output:</p><div><pre><code>Woof! My name is Fido\nWoof! My name is Spot\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes or Misunderstandings\n</h3><p>Here are some common pitfalls beginners face when learning about classes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> For methods within a class, you  need to include  as the first parameter.   represents the instance of the class that the method is being called on.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>  The  method requires specific parameters (name and breed in our example). You need to provide those values when creating a new object.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> You can only access attributes that are defined within the class (either in the  method or added later).</p><p>Let's imagine you're building a simple game with different types of characters. You could use classes to represent each character type:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example shows how classes can be used to create reusable components for a larger project.  We have a base  class and then specialized classes like  and  that inherit from it.</p><p>Here are a few ideas to practice using classes:</p><ol><li>  It should have attributes for width and height and methods to calculate area and perimeter.</li><li>  Include attributes for account number and balance, and methods for deposit, withdraw, and check balance.</li><li>  Attributes could include make, model, and year. Methods could include start, stop, and accelerate.</li><li> Attributes: name, student ID, courses. Methods: add_course, remove_course, display_courses.</li><li><strong>Create a simple  class:</strong> Attributes: name, species. Methods: make_sound. Then create subclasses like  and  that override the  method.</li></ol><p>Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into the world of classes.  You've learned what classes are, how to define them, how to create objects from them, and how to use methods.  Remember, classes are blueprints for creating objects, and they're a powerful tool for organizing and structuring your code.</p><p>Don't be discouraged if it doesn't click immediately.

After running the command above, a  folder will automatically be created inside the  directory. This is where we’ll define the templates.\nInside , there will already be a sample file called , which we’ll remove since it won’t be used when running the generator.\nOnce the generator is created, it's time to define the templates that will serve as the base for autogenerating code.</p><p>For defining the templates, I will use the files from the Text component as a base.</p><ul><li>First template: the component itself</li></ul><p>For the first template, the  file will be used as the base:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From it, we can notice that what the components will have in common are the imports, the definition of the component’s types named , the styled-components types named <code>Styled{component name}Props</code>, the CSS properties defined with styled-components named , and finally, the component’s definition and its default export.\nWith these points in mind, inside the  folder, a file named  will be created, which will correspond to the creation of the component’s skeleton itself:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>&lt;%=name%&gt; and &lt;%=html%&gt; correspond to dynamic values that will be passed when running the generator, replacing those placeholders in the code above with, respectively, the component’s name and the html element it represents.\nThe  field defines where the autogenerated file based on this template will be created.

In this article, we’ll complete the answer to the question: “Why is the stack faster than the heap?”, and also touch on why the heap is typically larger, but slower than the stack.</p><p>A natural way to introduce heap memory is by showing a working example of how it’s used in programs.</p><p>Heap memory is a region that a program accesses by explicitly requesting a block of memory from the operating system. Unlike stack memory, data stored on the heap remains valid after a function exits.</p><p>For instance, when a function contains stack-allocated variables, those variables are automatically deallocated when the function returns. Attempting to access them afterward leads to undefined behavior, since the memory may have been overwritten.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Allocated memory at: 00000006C899F590\nAllocated memory at: 0000011A01D49540\nAllocated stack memory at: 00000006C899F590\nAllocated heap memory at: 0000011A01D49540\nStack memory value: -929434080\nHeap memory value: 0\n</code></pre></div><p> creates a zero-initialized array on the stack and returns a pointer to the array on the stack.  allocates a zero-initialized memory span on the heap and returns a pointer to the memory location.</p><p>In this case, the stack array we attempted to access contains corrupted values, not the zero we initialized it with. This is an example of stack corruption, where the memory was reused or overwritten after the function exited. This is due to the stack being a contiguous memory block which the program and functions use to perform operations they need. This is not how the stack is supposed to be used. Stack memory should not be accessed when it has left the scope, even though accessing it is still possible.</p><p>In contrast, the heap-allocated memory remains intact and returns the expected zero. This is because <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/calloc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calloc</a> initializes the allocated memory to zero, and the memory is allocated in an arbitrary location in the memory, making it much less susceptible to being randomly corrupted by other function calls or random memory access.</p><p>\nThe heap is also allowed to be much larger than the stack. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>(process 56272) exited with code -1073741571 (0xc00000fd). // Stack overflow\n</code></pre></div><p>Allocating  on the stack causes a stack overflow because it exceeds the default stack size (on Windows it's about ).</p><p>In contrast, the heap handles large allocations without crashing:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Allocated memory at: 0x1e2c1fd0070\n(process 53076) exited with code 0 (0x0).\n</code></pre></div><p>Heap memory is not subject to a strict size cap like the stack, and thus 800MB can be asked from the heap without much problem. It can also be allocated from arbitrary locations in virtual memory.</p><p>To understand heap allocation, it helps to know a few key terms:</p><ul><li>🍿Kernel: The core part of an operating system, responsible for managing CPU time, memory, and hardware interaction at the lowest level.</li><li>📄Page: A fixed-size memory block (typically 4096 bytes) used by the kernel to manage memory. Memory is allocated in pages rather than individual bytes for efficiency.</li></ul><p>\nHeap memory is allocated differently from the stack. The stack typically has a fixed size (e.g., 1MB on Windows), pre-allocated when a program starts. In contrast, the heap must be requested at runtime from the OS.</p><p>When you call malloc, the C standard library first tries to find space in memory pages already assigned to the process. If no space is available, it performs a system call to the kernel to request additional memory pages.</p><ul><li>    Return a pointer to the allocated memory,</li><li>    Or return MAP_FAILED to indicate allocation failure.</li></ul><p>This address is passed back through the system layers from the kernel to the C library to malloc, and finally to the caller.</p><p>This is much more complicated than the stack, where allocation is often just a pointer subtractions and pointer arithmetics.</p><p>The complexity of heap allocation — requiring coordination between:</p><ul><li>The operating system kernel,</li><li>Bookkeeping data structures for memory blocks and pages,</li></ul><p>…makes it significantly slower than stack allocation.</p><p>Additionally, heap memory must be manually managed with malloc and free, introducing more opportunities for bugs like memory leaks, double frees, and dangling pointers.</p><p>This means heap allocation is powerful but comes with cost:</p><ul><li>Slower due to system calls and metadata tracking,</li><li>Harder to manage due to manual deallocation,</li><li>Larger and more flexible than stack memory.</li></ul><p>Use heap memory only when necessary, such as when:</p><ul><li>The data must outlive a function,</li><li>The size is too large for the stack,</li><li>Or the lifetime is dynamic and unpredictable.</li></ul>","contentLength":4527,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"💥 That One Time globals.css Crashed My Next.js Build","url":"https://dev.to/jvicmaina/that-one-time-globalscss-crashed-my-nextjs-build-5e2m","date":1751319204,"author":"Victor Maina","guid":176950,"unread":true,"content":"<p>You ever update some colors in your tailwind.config.ts and suddenly your entire Next.js app refuses to compile?

It doesn't just blindly follow instructions one after another. It makes choices, repeats actions, and responds to different situations. That's where  comes in! Understanding control flow is absolutely fundamental to programming, and it's something you'll use . It's also a common topic in beginner programming interviews, so getting a good grasp of it now will really help you down the line.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Understanding \"Introduction Control Flow\"\n</h3><p>Imagine you're giving someone directions. You might say, \"If you see a red light, stop. Otherwise, keep going.\" Or, \"Walk down this street, then turn left, then walk straight until you see a park.\" These are examples of controlling the  of instructions.</p><p>In programming, control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program.  Instead of always running lines of code sequentially (one after the other), control flow statements allow us to change that order based on conditions or to repeat sections of code.</p><p>There are three main types of control flow we'll cover today:</p><ul><li> This is the default – code runs line by line, from top to bottom.</li><li>  This allows us to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false (like the red light example).  We use ,  (or ), and  statements for this.</li><li> This allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. We use  and  loops for this.</li></ul><p>Let's look at some examples!</p><p>Let's start with a simple conditional statement in JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> We declare a variable  and set it to 25.</li><li> The  statement checks if  is greater than 30.  It's not, so the code inside the first curly braces  is skipped.</li><li> The  statement checks if  is greater than 20. It  (25 &gt; 20), so the code inside  set of curly braces is executed, printing \"It's a pleasant day.\" to the console.</li><li> The  block is only executed if  of the previous conditions are true.  Since we already found a true condition, the  block is skipped.</li></ol><p>Now, let's look at a simple loop in Python:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> The  loop iterates (repeats) a block of code a specific number of times.</li><li> creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).</li><li> For each number  in the sequence, the code inside the loop (the  statement) is executed.</li><li><pre><code>Hello, world! 0\nHello, world! 1\nHello, world! 2\nHello, world! 3\nHello, world! 4\n</code></pre></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes or Misunderstandings\n</h3><p>Let's look at some common pitfalls:</p><p><strong>1. Forgetting Curly Braces (JavaScript)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> In JavaScript, curly braces  are used to define the blocks of code that belong to the  and  statements.  Without them, only the first line after the  or  will be considered part of the block.</p><p><strong>2. Incorrect Comparison Operator</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>  In most programming languages,  is used for assignment (setting a value to a variable), while  is used for comparison (checking if two values are equal).  Using  in an  condition will usually cause an error.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>  An infinite loop occurs when the condition in a  loop never becomes false. In the incorrect example,  is never incremented, so  will always be true.  Always make sure your loop has a way to eventually terminate!</p><p>Let's create a simple program to check if a number is even or odd.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This program uses a conditional statement () to determine if a number is even or odd. The  operator calculates the remainder of a division. If the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.  This is a very common pattern in programming!</p><p>Here are a few ideas to practice your control flow skills:</p><ol><li>  Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Use a  loop to keep asking until the user guesses correctly.</li><li>  Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the corresponding calculation. Use  to handle different operators.</li><li> Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, print \"Buzz\", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\".</li><li>  Write a program that takes a student's score as input and assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on predefined ranges.</li><li> Write a program that takes a number as input and counts down from that number to 0, printing each number along the way.</li></ol><p>Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into understanding control flow. You've learned about sequential execution, conditional statements (), and loops ( and ).  These are the building blocks of almost every program you'll ever write.</p><p>Don't be afraid to experiment and try different things. The best way to learn is by doing!  Next, you might want to explore more advanced loop techniques, nested control flow statements (putting one control flow statement inside another), and functions to organize your code. Keep practicing, and you'll become a confident programmer in no time!</p>","contentLength":4868,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Map, Filter and Reduce in JS","url":"https://dev.to/karo_io_/-493k","date":1751318073,"author":"Karo","guid":176946,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>I Finally Understood map, filter And reduce In JavaScript</h2>","contentLength":57,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/atwellpub/-22cp","date":1751318073,"author":"Hudson Atwell","guid":176947,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Introducing Perplexity AI Lookups for WordPress</h2><h3>GBTI Network for GBTI Network ・ Jun 30</h3>","contentLength":87,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Free Online Tools for Developers","url":"https://dev.to/hamzaashkar/free-online-tools-for-developers-1nen","date":1751318040,"author":"Hamza Ashkar","guid":176945,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I recently launched a personal project — <a href=\"https://toolskitpro.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ToolsKitPro.net</a> — a collection of 100+ free tools for developers, writers, and digital creators.</p><p>These are all  tools — no templates, no ads, no signup.</p><ul><li>Image Tools (SVG to PNG, etc)</li></ul><p>I’d love feedback, feature suggestions, or even collaborations!</p>","contentLength":292,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Crater Your Database, Part Five - Summary","url":"https://dev.to/aws-builders/how-to-crater-your-database-part-five-summary-37n7","date":1751317980,"author":"Seth Orell","guid":176944,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We are at the end of this whirlwind tutorial on turning your database into a smoking hole in the ground.

Please give it a hard look.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Pre-defined access patterns\n</h2><p>Before wrapping up, I want to address a common polemic when comparing DynamoDB to SQL: pre-defined access patterns. In DynamoDB's documentation, AWS encourages you to identify your data access patterns before building anything. This idea often receives pushback from SQLites, who argue that it is inflexible and impractical. Their anger is misguided. This has nothing to do with DynamoDB but with scalability more broadly.</p><p>Let's say you are using SQL in a scalable manner. You use no aggregations, foreign keys, or joins. I guarantee you that your indexes will follow your access patterns. This applies to any datastore, whether SQL, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch. It would be like DynamoDB, but without the guardrails.</p><p>And if a new access pattern were introduced, you'd have to do the work to incorporate it. You would figure out specific indexes and generate composite data keys for this new access pattern. You are optimizing for how your app works, not for flexible access patterns. This was hard for me to unlearn, but it's an essential distinction between OLTP and OLAP systems. Your app requires an OLTP database to scale, and you need to design it accordingly.</p><p>As Alex DeBrie wrote in The DynamoDB Book, \"[in DynamoDB,] You design your data to handle the specific access patterns you have, rather than designing for flexibility in the future.\" I want to expand this to say, \"In any scalable database system, you must design your data to handle the specific access patterns you have.\" If you have a problem with pre-defining your access patterns, you also have a problem with scalability.</p><p>Build for scalability. Consider using DynamoDB for its built-in guardrails and all the additional benefits it offers. Scale your business to new heights and profit from all your happy customers. And, after you do, I'd like to meet for coffee and hear all about it.</p>","contentLength":4297,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Part 2: Reading Smart Contract Data with web3.py - Your First Contract Interaction (No Faucets Needed!)","url":"https://dev.to/divine_igbinoba_fb6de7207/part-2-reading-smart-contract-data-with-web3py-your-first-contract-interaction-no-co7","date":1751317925,"author":"Divine Igbinoba","guid":176943,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome back to our web3.py series! In <a href=\"https://dev.to/divine_igbinoba_fb6de7207/part-1-your-python-gateway-to-blockchain-getting-started-with-web3py-3aok\">Part 1</a>, we got our development environment set up and learned how to connect to an Ethereum node to read basic blockchain data like block numbers and gas prices.</p><p>Now, it's time to interact with smart contracts. These are the self-executing programs stored on the blockchain that power decentralised applications (dApps). Just like you interact with a web API to get data from a traditional server, you'll use web3.py to \"talk\" to smart contracts on the blockchain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Smart Contracts: The Programmable Building Blocks of&nbsp;Web3\n</h3><p>A smart contract is essentially a piece of code that lives on the blockchain. Once deployed, it runs exactly as programmed, without any possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference.</p><p>To interact with a smart contract from web3.py, you primarily need two pieces of information:</p><ol><li><p>: This is its unique location on the blockchain (e.g., 0xDE893...).</p></li><li><p><strong>The Contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface)</strong>: This is a JSON description of the contract's public functions and events. Think of the ABI as the \"instruction manual\" for your web3.py client.</p></li><li><p>It tells web3.py what functions the contract has, what arguments they take, and what values they return. Without the ABI, web3.py wouldn't know how to correctly encode your function calls or decode the contract's responses.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Your First Smart Contract: The Simple&nbsp;Counter\n</h3><p>To make this hands-on, we're going to use a super simple Counter smart contract. This contract will store a single number (count) and allow us to read its current value.</p><p>Here's the Solidity code for our Counter contract:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>A  variable, initialised to 0. The  keyword automatically creates a  getter function for us.</p></li><li><p>A  function, which is explicitly declared as . Both  and  are view functions, meaning they only read the contract's state and do not modify it.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Hands-On: Deploying Your Contract to Ganache (Skip the Faucet Frustration!)\n</h3><p>When I first started learning blockchain development, I spent countless hours hunting for free testnet tokens from faucets. Every time I ran out, it was another delay, another break in my learning flow. It consumed so much of my valuable learning time.</p><p>This is exactly why local development with Ganache is crucial. You get instant transactions, unlimited \"test Ether,\" and complete control over your environment. No more waiting for faucets, no more empty wallets interrupting your flow, just pure, uninterrupted learning.</p><p>In Part 1, we learned about connecting web3.py to your local Ganache blockchain. Now, we'll deploy our Counter.sol contract directly to that Ganache blockchain using Remix IDE. This ensures your Python script can interact with the contract you've deployed!</p><p>For this project, we will be using <a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Remix IDE</a> for easy development and deployment. While we'll start with Remix's built-in deployment features, we may explore deploying through code later.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-step guide to deploy your Counter contract to Ganache with&nbsp;Remix:\n</h3><p>: First, ensure your Ganache Desktop application is open and running. You should see its \"Quickstart\" workspace active, showing accounts and current blocks.</p><ul><li><p>On the left sidebar, click on the \"File Explorer\" icon (looks like a folder).</p></li><li><p>Under \"contracts\", click the \"Create new file\" icon (a blank paper with a plus sign).</p></li><li><p>Name the file  and press Enter.</p></li></ul><p><strong>4. Paste the Contract Code</strong>: Copy the Counter.sol code from above and paste it into the Counter.sol file in Remix.</p><p><strong>5. Compile the Contract and Get the ABI</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Click on the \"Solidity Compiler\" icon on the left sidebar (looks like a Solidity logo).</p></li><li><p>Ensure the \"Compiler\" version matches our  (e.g., 0.8.20).</p></li><li><p>Click on \"Advanced configurations\" (it might be a dropdown or expandable section)</p></li><li><p>From the \"EVM version\" dropdown, select \"Paris\".</p></li></ul><ul><li>  Click on the light blue \"Compile Counter.sol\" button.</li></ul><ul><li><p>You should see a green checkmark on the compiler icon if compilation is successful (as in the image above).</p></li><li><p>Now, scroll down within the Solidity Compiler tab until you see the \"ABI\" section (it might be a button or a copy icon next to the ABI output). Click the copy ABI button.</p></li></ul><p><strong>6. Connect Remix to Ganache (Environment Setup)</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Click on the \"Deploy &amp; Run Transactions\" icon on the left sidebar (just below that \"Solidity Compiler\" icon).</p></li><li><p>In the \"Environment\" dropdown, select \"Customize this list...\"</p></li></ul><ul><li>  Scroll down in the \"Environment Customization\" list until you see \"DEV --- GANACHE PROVIDER\". Check its checkbox.</li></ul><ul><li>  Click the \"Environment\" dropdown again. Now you'll see \"DEV --- GANACHE PROVIDER\" on the list --- click it.</li></ul><ul><li>  Remix will likely pop up a small window asking for the Ganache RPC endpoint. Copy your Ganache RPC URL from your Ganache application's \"Accounts\" section (it's typically  by default) and paste it into the Remix prompt. Then click \"OK\".</li></ul><p><strong>7. Deploy the Contract to Ganache</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>In Remix, ensure \"Counter\" is selected in the \"Contract\" dropdown.</p></li><li><p>Click the orange \"Deploy\" button.</p></li></ul><ul><li>  You should see a new transaction appear in your Ganache Desktop application under the \"Transactions\" tab, confirming the deployment.</li></ul><ul><li><p>After successful deployment, expand the \"Deployed Contracts\" section below the Deploy button in Remix. You'll see your Counter contract listed with its address (e.g., COUNTER AT 0x...).</p></li><li><p>Click the copy icon next to the address to save it. This is your .</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  In case you're wondering why we changed the Remix EVM to 'Paris' for&nbsp;Ganache...\n</h3><p>The 'EVM version' in Remix and the 'Hardfork' setting in Ganache both refer to specific versions of the Ethereum protocol. These different versions incorporate various updates, bug fixes, and new features.</p><p>For successful interaction and deployment, it's crucial that your chosen EVM version in Remix (which determines how your contract's bytecode is compiled) is compatible with the hardfork setting of your local Ganache blockchain. This ensures that the environment where your contract is compiled and the environment where it's deployed understand and execute the same set of rules. Setting Remix to 'Paris' generally provides good compatibility with recent Ganache versions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Reading Your Contract's Data with&nbsp;web3.py\n</h3><p>Now that you have your  and  from your Ganache deployment, let's update our  script to interact with it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Make sure you replace  and the content of  with the exact values you copied from Remix after deploying to Ganache!</p><p>Now, run your  script again:</p><p>You should see output similar to this, showing the initial count of 0:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Troubleshooting Common&nbsp;Issues\n</h3><p>If you encounter errors, here are the most common causes and solutions:</p><p><strong>\"Error interacting with contract\"</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Double-check that your  is correct and matches what you copied from Remix</p></li><li><p>Ensure your  is valid JSON (no trailing commas, proper quotes)</p></li><li><p>Verify that Ganache is still running on the same port</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Make sure Ganache Desktop is running</p></li><li><p>Check that the RPC URL in your  matches Ganache's RPC server URL</p></li><li><p>Go back to <a href=\"https://dev.to/divine_igbinoba_fb6de7207/part-1-your-python-gateway-to-blockchain-getting-started-with-web3py-3aok\">Part 1</a> to double-check your RPC setup if you're still having connection issues</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Contract addresses should start with  and be 42 characters total</p></li><li><p>Make sure you copied the entire address from Remix</p></li></ul><p>Congratulations! You've successfully:</p><ul><li><p>Deployed your very own smart contract to your local Ganache blockchain</p></li><li><p>Used web3.py to read data directly from a smart contract</p></li><li><p>Set up a complete local development environment for blockchain applications</p></li></ul><p>This is a fundamental step in building any dApp that needs to display information from the blockchain. You now understand how to bridge the gap between your Python application and smart contracts running on Ethereum.</p><p>In the next post, things get even more exciting! We'll learn how to:</p><ul><li><p>Change the state of our smart contract (increment that counter!)</p></li><li><p>Send transactions that modify blockchain data</p></li></ul><p>Get ready to truly interact with the blockchain by writing data, not just reading it!</p>","contentLength":7799,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gemini CLI and I created our first project together.","url":"https://dev.to/argenkiwi/gemini-cli-and-i-created-our-first-project-together-7b6","date":1751316568,"author":"Leandro","guid":176925,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Sell VPN as a SaaS Using VMmanager — Setup in 3 Steps","url":"https://dev.to/mateor404/how-to-sell-vpn-as-a-saas-using-vmmanager-setup-in-3-steps-13je","date":1751316434,"author":"Mateo Rivera","guid":176924,"unread":true,"content":"<p>With VMmanager, you can quickly create a new service for your customers by selling VPN servers using the SaaS model.

Install your favorite browser\n</h2><p>First step is easy: just install your favorite browser—Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera, Brave—whatever you feel comfortable using and offers developer tools you like.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Use a better Windows terminal\n</h2><p>If you're on Windows, you might know CMD or Git Bash. They're okay, but I highly recommend <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windows Terminal</a>. In newer versions of Windows, it might already be installed, and if not, you can download it from the Microsoft Store.</p><blockquote><p>If you're using another terminal and everything else works fine, feel free to keep using it. If not, consider switching.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Enable and Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)\n</h2><p>Once you open Windows Terminal, it defaults to PowerShell. Use it to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">install WSL</a>:</p><p>This installs Ubuntu by default and will prompt you to create a username and password. When typing the password, nothing will appear (no ), but it's being typed. Use a secure password—you’ll need it later.</p><p>Once installation is complete, restart your computer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Configure the default terminal\n</h2><p>After restarting, Windows Terminal will still open in PowerShell. Let’s change the default profile.</p><p>And set  as your default profile:</p><p>You’re now ready to use the Ubuntu terminal!</p><p>To navigate easily to your current folder in the Windows file explorer, use:</p><p>You’ll also find your Linux files under this path:</p><p>Install zsh and <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oh-my-zsh</a> to improve your terminal experience:</p><div><pre><code>sudo apt update\nsudo apt install zsh\n</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>You'll be prompted to enter your Ubuntu user password and confirm with .</p></blockquote><div><pre><code>sh curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh</code></pre></div><p>With this, you'll get tab completion, Git status indicators, and an overall better UX:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Install NVM and Node.js\n</h2><p>There are many ways to install Node.js, but the most professional one is using a version manager like <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nvm</a>. Sometimes you’ll need to switch between Node versions for different projects.</p><div><pre><code>curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre></div><p>If  isn’t recognized, just .</p><p>Then install the latest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LTS</a> (Long-Term Support) version:</p><blockquote><p>Always use the LTS version unless a project requires something else. You can check <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Node.js releases</a> for more info.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Set Up SSH Keys for GitHub\n</h2><p>To clone, pull, and push code from your GitHub account securely, it's better to use SSH instead of HTTPS.</p><div><pre><code>ssh-keygen  ed25519 </code></pre></div><p>You'll be prompted to enter a path and passphrase. You can leave both blank if you prefer:</p><div><pre><code> Enter file which to save the key /home/your_user/.ssh/id_your_key:[Press enter]\n Enter passphrase empty no passphrase: Type a passphrase]\n Enter same passphrase again: Type passphrase again]\n</code></pre></div><p>Then, follow <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this guide</a> to add the public key (id_your_key.pub) to your GitHub account.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Test Your SSH Connection to GitHub\n</h2><p>Clone a test repository to make sure your SSH setup works:</p><div><pre><code>git clone git@github.com:kevinccbsg/react-router-tutorial-devto.git\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code> The authenticity of host  can</code></pre></div><p>If you get a <strong>“Permission denied (publickey)”</strong> error, run:</p><div><pre><code>ssh-agent\nssh-add /home/your_user/.ssh/id_your_key\n</code></pre></div><p>To avoid doing this every time, add these lines to your  file.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to set your Git user details globally:</p><div><pre><code>git config  user.name \ngit config  user.email </code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  9.

This means it comes with everything you need to build a production-ready web application — from  to , all built-in and ready to use.</p><p>Whether you want to build a , an , a , or a , Django provides the tools and structure to make it happen efficiently and securely.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Django's Architecture: The MVT Pattern\n</h2><p>Django follows the <strong>Model-View-Template (MVT)</strong> pattern, which is Django's interpretation of the popular <strong>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</strong> pattern. Understanding this architecture is crucial to becoming proficient with Django.</p><p>MVT separates your application into , each with specific responsibilities:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.  – Your Data Layer\n</h3><p>Models represent your  and . They define:</p><ul><li>Database tables and their relationships\n</li><li>Data validation rules and constraints\n</li><li>Business logic methods that operate on your data\n</li><li>How data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated\n</li></ul><p>Think of models as the <strong>blueprint for your database</strong>.</p><p>If you're building a blog, your models might include:</p><ul><li> (for authors and readers)\n</li><li> (for reader feedback)\n</li><li> (for organizing posts)\n</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.  – Your Logic Layer\n</h3><p>Views handle the  of your application. They:</p><ul><li>Process user requests (, , etc.)\n</li><li>Interact with models to retrieve or modify data\n</li><li>Apply business rules and validation\n</li><li>Prepare data for presentation\n</li><li>Return responses to users\n</li></ul><p>Views are where the  in your application.</p><ul><li>Receive a request to display a blog post\n</li><li>Fetch the post data from the database\n</li><li>Check if the user has permission to view it\n</li><li>Prepare the data for the template\n</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.  – Your Presentation Layer\n</h3><p>Templates define how your data is . They:</p><ul><li>Display data in a user-friendly format\n</li><li>Handle the visual presentation of your application\n</li><li>Include conditional logic for dynamic content\n</li><li>Manage the HTML structure and styling\n</li></ul><p>Templates are responsible for the  of your application.</p><ul><li>Display a blog post with proper formatting\n</li><li>Show different content for logged-in vs. anonymous users\n</li><li>Include navigation menus and footers\n</li><li>Handle responsive design for different screen sizes </li></ul><p>Here's the typical flow of a Django application:</p><ol><li><p><p>\n(e.g., visits a page or submits a form)</p></p></li><li><p> directs the request to the appropriate </p></li><li><p><strong>View processes the request</strong> and interacts with  as needed</p></li><li><p><strong>Models handle data operations</strong><p>\n(e.g., database queries, validation, etc.)</p></p></li><li><p> and selects a </p></li><li><p><strong>Template renders the response</strong> using the provided data</p></li><li><p><strong>Response is sent back to the user</strong></p></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of This Separation of Concerns\n</h2><p>This structure makes your Django code:</p><ul><li>: Changes to one layer don't necessarily affect others\n</li><li>: You can test each layer independently\n</li><li>: Components can be reused across different parts of your application\n</li><li>: You can optimize each layer separately as your application grows\n</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Your Django Development Environment\n</h2><p>Django requires Python .</p><p>To check your Python version, run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>python \npython3 </code></pre></div><p>If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org. Make sure to check \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation on Windows.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment\n</h3><p>Virtual environments are essential for Python development.\nThey keep your project dependencies isolated from other projects and your system Python installation.</p><div><pre><code>my_first_django_project\nmy_first_django_project\n\npython  venv venv\n\nvenvcriptsctivate\nvenv/bin/activate\n</code></pre></div><p>You'll know the virtual environment is active when you see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt.</p><p>With your virtual environment activated, install Django:</p><div><pre><code>pip django\n\n\npython  django </code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Create Your First Django Project\n</h3><div><pre><code>\ndjango-admin startproject myproject\nmyproject\n\n\npython manage.py runserver\n</code></pre></div><p>Visit <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:8000/</a> in your browser. You should see the Django welcome page - congratulations! You've successfully set up Django.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Creating Your First Django App\n</h2><p>Django projects are composed of multiple \"apps\" — each handling a specific feature or functionality. This modular approach makes your code organized and reusable.</p><p>Run the following command in your terminal:</p><div><pre><code>python manage.py startapp blog\n</code></pre></div><p>This creates a new directory structure:</p><div><pre><code>blog/\n├── __init__.py\n├── admin.py\n├── apps.py\n├── models.py\n├── tests.py\n├── urls.py\n└── views.py\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Register Your App\n</h3><p>Open myproject/settings.py and add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list:</p><div><pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,  </code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Django Development\n</h2><ul><li>Keep apps focused on specific functionality\n</li><li>Use meaningful names for models, views, and templates\n</li><li>Follow Django's naming conventions\n</li><li>Organize your project structure logically\n</li></ul><ul><li>Use database indexes for frequently queried fields\n</li><li>Optimize database queries using  and </li><li>Cache expensive operations\n</li><li>Use pagination for large datasets\n</li></ul><ul><li>Always validate user input\n</li><li>Use Django's built-in security features\n</li><li>Keep dependencies updated\n</li><li>Follow the principle of least privilege\n</li></ul><ul><li>Write tests for all your models, views, and forms\n</li><li>Use test-driven development (TDD) when possible\n</li><li>Test both happy paths and edge cases\n</li><li>Maintain good test coverage\n</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Your Django Journey Begins\n</h2><p>Django is a powerful, flexible framework that can handle projects of any size. From simple blogs to complex enterprise applications, Django provides the tools and structure you need to build robust web applications.</p><p>The key to mastering Django is understanding the MVT pattern and how the different components work together.

But a solid foundation is just the beginning. To build a truly <strong>scalable and maintainable</strong> automation suite, we need a strong architectural frame. That frame is an advanced, expressive type system.</p><p>This article is for the power user. We're moving beyond basic types to show you how to leverage TypeScript's advanced patterns to eliminate entire classes of bugs <strong>before you even run a single test</strong>.</p><p>You will learn five essential patterns for a world-class QA framework:</p><ul><li> To manage fixed sets of constants and prevent typos.</li><li> To write highly reusable, type-safe code like an API client.</li><li> To validate API responses at runtime and eliminate manual type definitions.</li><li> To create types directly from runtime objects.</li><li> To create flexible variations of existing types without duplicating code.</li></ul><p>Mastering these concepts will transform your framework from a simple collection of tests into a scalable, self-documenting, and resilient asset.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🤔 The Problem: The Hidden Costs of a \"Simple\" Framework\n</h3><p>When a framework is small, it's easy to keep it clean. But as it grows, \"simple\" solutions introduce hidden costs that make the codebase brittle and hard to maintain.</p><ul><li> Using raw strings like  or  for roles or request methods is a ticking time bomb. A single typo () creates a bug that TypeScript can't catch.</li><li> Writing a new fetch function for every API endpoint (, , ) creates a maintenance nightmare. A change to authentication logic requires updating dozens of files.</li><li> You manually write a TypeScript  for an API response. The API changes—a field is renamed or removed. Your tests still compile, but they fail at runtime because your types lied.</li><li> You use the same massive  type for both creating a new article and updating its title. This is confusing and inefficient.</li></ul><p>These small issues compound, leading to a framework that is difficult and scary to refactor.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ The Solution, Part 1: Enums for Rock-Solid Constants\n</h3><p>The fastest way to eliminate \"magic string\" bugs is with . An enum is a restricted set of named constants.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Brittle Way (Magic Strings)\n</h4><p>Imagine a function that assigns a role. A typo in the string will pass silently through TypeScript.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By defining a  enum, we force developers to choose from a valid list of options, giving us autocompletion and compile-time safety.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> If you have a fixed set of related strings, use an Enum.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 The Solution, Part 2: Generics for Maximum Reusability\n</h3><p> are arguably the most powerful feature for writing scalable code. They allow you to write functions that can work with any type, without sacrificing type safety. The perfect use case is a reusable API request function.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Repetitive Way (No Generics)\n</h4><p>Without generics, you'd end up writing nearly identical functions for every API endpoint.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Scalable Fix (A Generic Function)\n</h4><p>We can write one function, , that can fetch any resource and return a strongly-typed response. The magic is the  placeholder.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When we call this function, we specify what  should be.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛡️ The Solution, Part 3: Zod &amp; z.infer for End-to-End Safety\n</h3><p>We've solved code duplication. Now let's solve \"Type Drift.\" The ultimate source of truth for your data is the API itself.  is a TypeScript library which lets us create a schema that validates against the real API response at runtime, and  lets us create a compile-time TypeScript type from that same schema.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  One schema. Two benefits. Zero drift.\n</h4><p>First, define a schema for your API response. This is an actual JavaScript object that describes the shape of your data.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, use the magic of  to create a TypeScript type from the schema without any extra work.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, in your test, you use both. The Zod schema validates the live data, and the inferred type gives you autocomplete and static analysis.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ The Solution, Part 4: typeof &amp; Utility Types for Flexibility\n</h3><p>Sometimes you need types for simple, ad-hoc objects, or you need to create slight variations of existing types for things like API update payloads.</p><h4> Types from Runtime Objects\n</h4><p>If you have a constant object in your code, you can use  to create a type that perfectly matches its shape.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4> &amp; : Types from Other Types\n</h4><p>Using our  type from Zod, what if we want to update an article? We probably only need to send a few fields, not all of them.  let us create these variations on the fly.</p><ul><li>: Makes all fields in T optional.</li><li>: Creates a new type by picking a few keys K from T.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Your Mission: Build an Unbreakable Framework\n</h3><p>You are now equipped with the patterns used in the most robust, enterprise-grade test automation frameworks. Go back to your own project and look for opportunities to level up:</p><ol><li> Find any hardcoded strings (, , ) and replace them with .</li><li><strong>Schema-fy Your Endpoints:</strong> Choose your most critical API endpoint, write a  schema for it, and use  to generate the type. Apply it in a test.</li><li> Identify two or more repetitive functions (like API calls) and refactor them into a single, reusable generic function.</li><li> Look for  or  requests and use  like  or  to create precise, minimal payloads.</li></ol><p>Adopting these advanced patterns is the final step in turning your test framework from a simple tool into a powerful, scalable, and truly dependable engineering asset.</p>","contentLength":5318,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Core Attributes of Distributed Systems: Reliability, Availability, Scalability, and More","url":"https://dev.to/sachin_tolay_052a7e539e57/core-attributes-of-distributed-systems-reliability-availability-scalability-and-more-23p6","date":1751312488,"author":"Sachin Tolay","guid":176900,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Whether you’re building a simple web app or a large distributed system, users don’t just expect it to work → they want it to be fast, always available, secure, and to run smoothly without unexpected interruptions.</p><p>These expectations are captured in what we call <strong>system quality attributes</strong> or <strong>non-functional requirements</strong>.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore the most critical attributes that any serious system should aim to deliver, especially in distributed environments.

(perspective of pre-hooks React developer). La perspectiva presentada me pareció bastante intrigante. El autor comenta cómo los desarrolladores que comenzaron su viaje directamente con React tienden a depender en gran medida de custom hooks para diversas funcionalidades o .</p><p>Inicialmente, pensé que esta perspectiva podría ser subjetiva o limitada a los desarrolladores dentro del círculo del autor. Sin embargo, llegue a explorar esto más a fondo en Reddit, donde encontré otra publicación que planteaba <strong>\"Cuando es recomendable utilizar custom hooks\"</strong>. Para mi sorpresa, la mayoría de las opiniones fueron que siempre se debería utilizar.\nAsí que me pareció un tema muy interesante del que investigar, ademas de agregar ciertas opiniones personales y recomendaciones.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Primero que nada, ¿Cuál es la recomendación de&nbsp;React?\n</h2><p>Los Custom Hooks en React son funciones JavaScript que siguen una convención de nombre específica: deben comenzar con \"use\" (por ejemplo, useEffect, useState). Estas funciones permiten encapsular lógica compleja y reutilizable en componentes de React. Según la documentación oficial de React, los Custom Hooks están diseñados para compartir lógica entre componentes de React sin la necesidad de copiar y pegar código.\nCuando se trata de utilizar Custom Hooks, React sugiere seguir algunas prácticas recomendadas:</p><p>**1. Convención de Nombres: **Los Custom Hooks deben comenzar con la palabra \"use\" para que React pueda identificarlos y aplicar ciertas optimizaciones.</p><p><strong>2. Extraer Lógica Reutilizable:</strong> Utiliza Custom Hooks para extraer lógica que se repite en múltiples componentes. Esto ayuda a mantener un código más limpio y modular.</p><p>**3. No Introducir Estado Global: **Evita introducir estado global en Custom Hooks, ya que esto puede complicar la gestión del estado y llevar a efectos secundarios inesperados.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Entonces, ¿Cuando se recomienda utilizar Custom&nbsp;Hooks?\n</h2><p>Entonces una vez definido lo que es un custom hook podemos empezar a definir puntos claves y escenarios en los que podemos utilizarlos:</p><p> Cuando la lógica de un componente se vuelve demasiado compleja, extraerla en un custom hook puede mejorar la legibilidad y el mantenimiento. Al abstraer los detalles de implementación, los custom hooks permiten que los componentes se centren en sus responsabilidades principales, promoviendo una separación más clara de las preocupaciones. Por otro lado, no siempre es necesario o beneficioso utilizarlos.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando usar custom hooks: ✅</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos un componente UserList que muestra una lista de usuarios y realiza una llamada a una API para obtener los datos. La lógica de obtener los datos y manejar posibles errores se ha vuelto demasiado compleja y queremos abstraerla en un Custom Hook llamado useFetchUsers.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando no es necesario usar un custom hook: ❌</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos un componente LoginForm que maneja la autenticación de usuarios. La lógica de validación de datos y el manejo del estado del formulario se manejan fácilmente dentro del propio componente, y no hay necesidad de extraerla en un Custom Hook.</p><p>En este caso, la lógica del formulario de inicio de sesión es lo suficientemente simple como para ser manejada dentro del componente LoginForm sin la necesidad de utilizar un Custom Hook. La abstracción adicional podría introducir complejidad innecesaria y hacer que el código sea menos claro y mantenible.</p><p> Debería de considerarse el uso de custom hooks cuando se observe que la lógica se repite en varios componentes. Esta es una oportunidad perfecta para escribir un custom hook que encapsule esa lógica, haciendo que su código sea DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) y más fácil de mantener.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando usar custom hooks: ✅</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos dos componentes CounterA y CounterB que comparten la lógica para manejar el estado de un contador. La lógica de incremento, decremento y reinicio del contador se repite en ambos componentes. Es una oportunidad perfecta para crear un Custom Hook llamado useCounter que encapsule esta lógica.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando no es necesario usar un custom hook: ❌</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos dos componentes ProductList y Cart que muestran una lista de productos y un carrito de compras, respectivamente. Cada componente tiene una función fetchData que realiza una llamada a la API para obtener datos. Aunque la lógica de llamada a la API es similar en ambos componentes, no es necesario encapsularla en un Custom Hook, ya que la implementación de cada llamada puede diferir según el contexto.</p><p><strong>3. Compartir lógica entre componentes:</strong> Los custom hooks facilitan el intercambio de lógica entre componentes no relacionados. Esto es particularmente útil para implementar cuestiones transversales como la autenticación, la tematización o la internacionalización, asegurando la coherencia en toda la aplicación.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando usar custom hooks: ✅</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos un componente Header que muestra un botón de inicio de sesión y un componente Sidebar que muestra el nombre de usuario una vez que el usuario ha iniciado sesión. Ambos componentes necesitan acceder al estado de autenticación y a las funciones para iniciar y cerrar sesión.</p><p>En este ejemplo, el Custom Hook useAuth encapsula la lógica de autenticación, permitiendo que los componentes Header y Sidebar compartan fácilmente la misma lógica sin acoplamiento directo.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando no es necesario usar un custom hook: ❌</strong></p><p>Supongamos que tenemos un componente Form que maneja la lógica de un formulario de registro de usuarios. La lógica específica del formulario, como la validación de campos y el envío de datos, es única para este componente y no se comparte con otros componentes en la aplicación.</p><p>En este caso, la lógica específica del formulario está completamente contenida dentro del componente Form. No hay necesidad de extraer esta lógica en un Custom Hook ya que no se comparte con otros componentes y no se beneficiaría de su reutilización. Mantener la lógica dentro del componente hace que el código sea más claro y mantenible en este contexto.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚠️ Usar custom hooks con cautela ⚠️ Recomendaciones Personales\n</h2><p>Ciertos puntos que recomiendo a tener en cuenta cuando se este trabajando con custom hooks:</p><p><strong>1. Optimización prematura:</strong> Importante resistir la tentación de crear custom hooks para cada pieza de lógica. La optimización prematura puede generar complejidad y abstracción innecesarias, lo que dificulta la comprensión y el mantenimiento del código. En lugar de ello, hay que favorecer a la simplicidad y la claridad hasta que los patrones de repetición surjan orgánicamente.</p><p>**2. Lógica específica del componente: **No toda la lógica garantiza la extracción en un custom hook. Si una parte de la lógica está estrechamente relacionada con un componente específico y es poco probable que se reutilice en otro lugar, puede ser más apropiado mantenerla dentro del propio componente, evitando abstracciones innecesarias.</p><p><strong>3. Custom hooks demasiado abstractos:</strong> Los custom hooks demasiado abstractos con demasiadas responsabilidades pueden volverse difíciles de manejar y de entender. Habrá que a apuntar a logica de responsabilidad única que encapsule inquietudes específicas, promoviendo la claridad y la Componentización.</p><p>Ahora que hemos revisado todos estos ejemplos, espero que esta vez si puedas elegir entre si es un caso valido para poder usar custom hooks o no, centrándonos en su propósito inicial de abstracción y reutilización de código.\nNo podemos quitar que los Custom Hooks han demostrado mucha importancia en el desarrollo actual de React, porque ofrecen una manera elegante y eficiente de compartir lógica entre componentes. Ya sea para abstraer lógica compleja, eliminar la repetición de código o facilitar el intercambio de funcionalidades entre componentes no relacionados.<p>\nPersonalmente, creo que es importante saber entender estos conceptos para saber cuándo mantener nuestra lógica en nuestros servicios y cuándo utilizarlos como Custom Hooks. Me considero muy fan de manejar la mayoría de la lógica como un servicio y solo utilizar Custom Hooks para casos específicos muy comunes, hooks comunes como:** useFocus, useWindowSize, useFormUpdate**. Estos son ejemplos de hooks que suelo usar con frecuencia en mis proyectos y que me ayudan a manejar cierta lógica compartida entre componentes.</p></p><p>En otro blog podríamos profundizar en cómo implementar estos hooks si te parece interesante 🎯</p>","contentLength":8663,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Set Up a Cloudflared Tunnel on Your Homelab","url":"https://dev.to/tan1193/how-to-set-up-a-cloudflared-tunnel-on-your-homelab-27ao","date":1751310744,"author":"Tan","guid":176894,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Want to expose your private service to the world without revealing your real IP?

Consider a financial institution needing to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time from a stream of billions of events, while simultaneously performing complex risk analysis on historical data. Traditional batch processing falls short, and naive streaming solutions often struggle with state management and fault tolerance. This is where Apache Spark, and its ecosystem, become indispensable. </p><p>Spark isn’t a replacement for all other Big Data tools; it’s a crucial component within a broader architecture. Modern data platforms often integrate Spark with data lakes (S3, ADLS, GCS), stream processing engines (Kafka, Kinesis), data warehousing solutions (Snowflake, BigQuery), and metadata management tools (Hive Metastore, AWS Glue Data Catalog). The key drivers for adopting Spark are its ability to handle large-scale data processing with reasonable latency, its support for diverse workloads (batch, streaming, ML), and its relatively mature ecosystem.  Data volumes routinely exceed petabytes, velocity demands near-real-time insights, and schema evolution is constant.  Query latency requirements range from seconds for interactive dashboards to minutes for complex reporting. Cost-efficiency is paramount, demanding optimized resource utilization.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Spark in Big Data Systems?\n</h2><p>From a data architecture perspective, Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides a distributed computing framework that allows for parallel processing of data across a cluster of machines.  Unlike Hadoop MapReduce, Spark performs in-memory computation, significantly accelerating iterative algorithms and interactive queries. </p><p>Spark’s role varies depending on the use case. It can be used for data ingestion (reading from various sources), storage (through its resilient distributed datasets - RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets), processing (transforming and enriching data), querying (using Spark SQL), and even governance (integrating with metadata catalogs). </p><p>Key technologies underpinning Spark include:</p><ul><li> Parquet and ORC are the dominant columnar storage formats due to their efficient compression and schema evolution capabilities. Avro is often used for schema-on-read scenarios.</li><li> Kryo serialization is preferred over Java serialization for its performance and compact representation.</li><li> Spark uses a custom RPC protocol for communication between nodes, optimized for high throughput and low latency.</li><li> Spark’s DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) scheduler optimizes job execution by breaking down tasks into stages and scheduling them across the cluster.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Change Data Capture (CDC) Ingestion:</strong>  Spark Streaming (or Structured Streaming) is used to consume change events from databases (using Debezium or similar tools) and incrementally update a data lake. This enables near-real-time data synchronization.</li><li>  Processing a continuous stream of clickstream data from a website, enriching it with user profile information, and aggregating it into hourly dashboards.</li><li> Joining massive datasets (e.g., customer transactions with product catalogs) to generate personalized recommendations.  This often requires careful partitioning and broadcast joins.</li><li><strong>Schema Validation &amp; Data Quality:</strong>  Using Spark to validate data against predefined schemas and data quality rules, flagging anomalies and ensuring data integrity.</li><li>  Building and executing feature engineering pipelines for machine learning models, transforming raw data into features suitable for training and prediction.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  System Design &amp; Architecture\n</h2><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Data Sources (Kafka, S3, DBs)] --&gt; B(Spark Streaming/Batch);\n    B --&gt; C{Data Lake (S3, ADLS, GCS)};\n    C --&gt; D[Metadata Catalog (Hive, Glue)];\n    D --&gt; E[Query Engines (Spark SQL, Presto, Athena)];\n    E --&gt; F[BI Tools &amp; Applications];\n    B --&gt; G[ML Feature Store];\n    G --&gt; H[ML Models];\n</code></pre></div><p>This diagram illustrates a common architecture.

When shoppers arrive at your store facing hundreds or thousands of products, they expect one thing above all: to find what they want quickly. If your site navigation or filters frustrate them, they will abandon their cart without hesitation.</p><p>Navigation isn’t just about menus and links. It is a carefully planned structure that guides users to their target products while also encouraging them to explore related or trending items. In the fast-paced world of fashion, where new styles emerge each season, this challenge becomes even more critical.</p><p>Let’s explore how to design user-centric filters and navigation for large-scale fashion catalogs, covering UX best practices, frontend frameworks to support dynamic updates, and the power of search and recommendations. Along the way, I’ll highlight a real-world example of a  page that demonstrates these principles in practice.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Smart Navigation Drives Conversions\n</h2><p>Your site’s navigation structure directly affects your bottom line. According to the Baymard Institute, 21% of users will abandon their purchase if site navigation is too complicated. In fashion, where choice overload is common, this risk is even higher.</p><ul><li>: The faster customers find something they like, the more likely they’ll complete their purchase.\n</li><li>: Good navigation introduces shoppers to complementary or trending products.\n</li><li>: A seamless journey signals professionalism and reliability.</li></ul><p>When filters like size, color, price, or style are missing or hard to use, shoppers will bounce. A thoughtful, tested filter design can dramatically boost your conversion rates.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  UX Best Practices for Fashion Filters\n</h2><p>Let’s break down the components of an effective, user-centered filter system:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Prioritize Relevant Filters\n</h3><p>Fashion shoppers almost always look for:</p><ul><li>Category (dresses, suits, kurtas, etc.)</li></ul><p>Show these prominently above less essential attributes like pattern or embellishment. Especially on mobile, putting key filters first makes a big difference in usability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Support Multi-Select and Easy Deselect\n</h3><p>Users frequently want to explore multiple options at once — for example, “red” and “blue” dresses in size M within a ₹2000–₹4000 budget. Your filters should:</p><ul><li>Support multi-select within a facet\n</li><li>Show active filter chips so customers know what’s applied\n</li><li>Allow deselecting individual filters without starting over</li></ul><p>Modern frontend libraries like Redux (React) or Pinia (Vue) are great for managing this state efficiently.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Visual Elements Where Helpful\n</h3><p>Colors are best shown as swatches, not text labels. Likewise, thumbnails for patterns or materials help shoppers scan faster and with fewer mistakes.</p><p>A single “Clear all filters” button is essential. Many users will change their minds during exploration, and this gives them a quick fresh start.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Maintain Filter Persistence\n</h3><p>Filters shouldn’t disappear if a user goes back or reloads the page. You can persist their choices via URL query parameters or local storage, depending on your framework, to reduce frustration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Category Navigation\n</h2><p>Beyond filters, your main navigation needs to guide customers clearly and logically:</p><p>Broad top-level groups work best:</p><ul><li>Women\n\n<ul></ul></li></ul><p>Avoid too many deep subcategories at the top. Mega-menus on desktop and collapsible accordions on mobile usually deliver a smoother experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Highlight Seasonal or Trend-Based Sections\n</h3><p>Since fashion changes constantly, you should create clear entry points for shoppers to discover the newest products. Labels like , , or  immediately orient customers.  </p><p>If you call it “Kurtas” today, don’t rename it “Tunic Dresses” tomorrow. Consistent labels build trust and make return visits easier for customers to navigate.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Add Breadcrumbs and Quick Back\n</h3><p>Breadcrumbs are crucial in large catalogs. Combined with a “Back to Results” button on product pages, they give shoppers an easy way to retrace their steps without losing filter selections.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Frontend Frameworks to Power Dynamic Navigation\n</h2><p>A powerful, user-friendly filter and navigation system needs a robust frontend foundation. Here’s what developers typically lean on:</p><ul><li>: Excellent for component-driven product lists, with a mature ecosystem.\n</li><li>: Lightweight and flexible, good for faster experimentation.\n</li><li>: Optimized for server-side rendering and SEO, perfect for large catalogs.\n</li><li>: Vue’s answer to Next.js, also great for server-side performance.\n</li><li>: Works best in larger enterprise projects, though less common for fashion.</li></ul><p>State management is also vital for filters:</p><ul><li>Zustand or Jotai (React lightweight)\n</li></ul><p>Headless CMS solutions like Strapi, Sanity, or Contentful help merchants update seasonal categories and filters without a developer’s constant intervention.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Optimizing Search and Recommendations\n</h2><p>Search is the highest-converting navigation feature you have. Shoppers who search generally convert 2–3 times more than those who only browse.</p><p>Here’s what to prioritize:</p><p>Handle typos and partial matches gracefully. Algolia or Elasticsearch do this well even for massive product databases.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Semantic Understanding\n</h3><p>Search should interpret “blue suit set” as color + category, not just a keyword string. That means indexing metadata (color, pattern, style) separately.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Autocomplete Suggestions\n</h3><p>Show trending or recent terms in autocomplete results to guide discovery faster.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Personal Recommendations\n</h3><p>Add blocks like “You may also like” based on:</p><ul><li>Trending or seasonal products\n</li></ul><p>You can build this with collaborative filtering or simpler rule-based systems depending on your resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Engineering for Performance\n</h2><p>Large catalogs put a lot of strain on the frontend. Here’s how to keep things fast:</p><ul><li>Use infinite scroll or pagination wisely\n</li><li>Serve critical CSS upfront\n</li><li>Use modern image CDNs with WebP/AVIF</li></ul><p>Next.js with incremental static regeneration is a great way to update “New Arrivals” pages without a full rebuild, which is especially important during seasonal product drops.</p><p>Fashion is a fast-changing vertical. That means your navigation and filters should be flexible and open to change. Keep track of:</p><ul><li>Usability test results (every few months)\n</li><li>Analytics on which filters are most used\n</li><li>New categories based on current trends</li></ul><p>Personalizing filter orders or category placements for returning shoppers is a great next-level investment if you have the data to support it.</p><p>Designing user-focused filters and intuitive navigation is essential for large, ever-changing fashion catalogs. From logical hierarchies and persistent filters to well-built search and fast-loading pages, each piece supports the customer’s mission: finding their style, with confidence, in less time.</p><p>If you want a practical inspiration for a well-designed, seasonal  section with thoughtful categories and filters, you can check out <a href=\"https://www.juniperwholesale.com/categories/new-arrivals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this real-world implementation</a>.</p><p>Keep testing, keep listening to your shoppers, and keep evolving — because in fashion, great UX never goes out of style.</p>","contentLength":7195,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"让Cloud code更加自动化的执行任务，减少授权请求","url":"https://dev.to/dragon72463399/rang-cloud-codegeng-jia-zi-dong-hua-de-zhi-xing-ren-wu-jian-shao-shou-quan-qing-qiu-5h2","date":1751305718,"author":"drake","guid":176842,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tune LLM(Groq Model Tune Technique's)","url":"https://dev.to/sujeet_saxena_60b0b6a01e2/tune-llmgroq-model-tune-techniques-4ma9","date":1751305703,"author":"Sujeet Saxena","guid":176841,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Tune of Groq LLM, Its important to first understand:</p><p>.

At a glance looking at all of the APIs in React, it's a lot to grok in:-</p><ul><li>Server components &amp; Client components</li><li>Higher Order Component/Component Composition</li><li>Concurrent Rendering (React Fibre)  - UI updates are interruptable</li></ul><p>Those who has been doing React for years they know about how painful it was before even  was a thing. Just look at below image and see the difference. 😱😱</p><p>From creating the  to adding and updating the  via  syntax within the component, it was just too much boilerplate to write and maintain for the developers. On top of it the UI rendering was synchronous(means UI updates were blocking).</p><p>Enough of the introduction, let's focus on the topic that we are here for.</p><p>Before , we were used to create states within our  in Class component. And for modifying it, we needed to understand about  keyword. </p><p>And to solve all of the issues in existing eco-system of React, React Team from Meta(formerly know as Facebook) introduced the  in  release and which was a banger. It took away all of the boiler-plate code and made our component much simpler to write and maintain.</p><p> release was a shift toward the new  for writing React. Now we did not have to use , no  syntax anymore and we could use just simple javascript function and directly return our  as value. Pretty neet huh!!!  </p><p>But wait there's a catch,  can only recieve  and return , no state, no UI update, no interaction in our application. Just static UI!!</p><p>Basically  are stateless, they don't have any kind of state creation functionality within them.</p><p>So to make our component stateful or to add state within them, we have !!!. Yes you read it right.</p><p>Basically  are simple  which may return some values, which can be used within our Functional component and add make our component stateful. </p><p>So now we have understanding about hooks.

As readers, we’re drawn to experiences that feel intuitive, seamless, and, above all, human. That’s where a design-first content strategy comes in, and why UX writing is more than just a buzzword—it’s the secret sauce behind truly engaging digital experiences.\nWhat Does “Design-First” Really Mean?<p>\nWhen we talk about a design-first approach, we’re not just referring to how things look. It’s about how content and design work together to guide, inform, and delight users. It’s the difference between a website that feels like a maze and one that feels like a well-lit path.</p>\nA design-first content strategy means thinking about the user’s journey from the very beginning. It’s about asking:<p>\nWhat does the reader need at this moment?</p>\nHow can we make information clear, accessible, and actionable?<p>\nWhere might confusion or friction arise, and how can we smooth it out?</p>\nThe Role of UX Writing in Reader Engagement<p>\nUX writing is the connective tissue between design and content. It’s the microcopy on buttons, the helpful error messages, the onboarding flows that make new tools feel familiar. But it’s also the tone, the clarity, and the empathy that make users feel understood.</p>\nWhen UX writing is done well, readers don’t notice it—they just feel guided and empowered. When it’s done poorly, frustration creeps in, and engagement drops.\nThink about the last time you signed up for a new app. Did the instructions make sense? Did you know what to do next? If so, you probably have a UX writer to thank. If not, you might have abandoned the process altogether.<p>\nPractical Tips for a Design-First Content Strategy</p>\nCollaborate Early and Often<p>\nBring writers, designers, and developers together from the start. Content shouldn’t be an afterthought—it should shape the design.</p>\nPrioritize Clarity Over Cleverness<p>\nIt’s tempting to be witty, but clarity always wins. Make sure every word serves a purpose.</p>\nTest with Real Users<p>\nWatch how people interact with your content. Where do they hesitate? What questions do they have? Use these insights to refine your approach.</p>\nEmbrace Iteration<p>\nGreat UX writing is never finished. Keep refining based on feedback and analytics.</p>\nThe Takeaway<p>\nA design-first content strategy isn’t just about making things look good—it’s about making them work for real people. By weaving UX writing into every stage of the process, we can create experiences that don’t just inform, but truly engage.</p>\nLet’s put the user at the heart of our content—and watch engagement soar.</p>","contentLength":2618,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Your CRM is Holding Your Data Hostage.

Most modern CRMs are designed to keep your data siloed, not to serve you better, but to make the thought of leaving a logistical nightmare.</p><p><strong>It's time to challenge that model.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A New Philosophy: Powerful, Open, and Truly&nbsp;Yours\n</h2><p>What if your CRM wasn't a recurring bill you had to fight, but a permanent asset you controlled? Imagine a platform built on a different philosophy.</p><p>This is <a href=\"https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, a robust, modern CRM that rewrites the rules. It's built on four key principles:</p><ul><li>👑 : You can self-host it on your own servers, giving you complete control and sovereignty over your data. It's yours. Really.</li><li>💸 : The open-source software license is free. Your only costs are for the server you run it on and any maintenance. This means no arbitrary price hikes or paying extra just to export your own information via an API.</li><li>🔗 : A system should connect seamlessly with your existing tools and workflows, not force you into its closed ecosystem. Because it's open-source, Twenty can be integrated with anything.</li><li>❤️ : It's backed by a growing open-source community dedicated to building a better, more transparent future for business software.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Your New Superpowers: What You Can Actually&nbsp;Do\n</h2><p>Okay, so you own the platform. But is it powerful? Absolutely. Twenty is designed for modern business needs, allowing you to:</p><ul><li>🎨 : Create the exact views you need with advanced filters, sorting, grouping, and dynamic kanban and table views.\n</li></ul><ul><li><p>🔧 : Don't let your CRM dictate your process. Customize objects and fields to perfectly match how your business operates.</p></li><li><p>🔐 <strong>Manage Permissions with Ease</strong>: Create and manage custom roles to control precisely who can see and do what across the platform.</p></li><li><p>🤖 : Put repetitive tasks on autopilot with powerful triggers and actions, freeing up your team to focus on what matters.</p></li><li><p>✉️ : Seamlessly manage emails, calendar events, files, notes, and more — all linked to your customer records.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Easy Button: Get Started Without the&nbsp;Headache\n</h2><p>The idea of \"self-hosting\" might sound technical, but it doesn't have to be a barrier. You don't need to be a developer to unlock this freedom.</p><p>An expert team at  can do it all for you. Teknuro specializes in seamless integrations. They can install your Twenty CRM, migrate your data from your old system, and connect it to other essential tools like your ERP, ensuring a smooth transition.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Your Data, Your Rules.&nbsp;Period.\n</h2><p>Stop renting your customer relationships.

While I haven’t focused much on tools like PySpark or Hadoop, I’ve been deeply involved in handling large-scale data using Parquet files, performing data cleaning, designing robust pipelines, and deploying data workflows in a modular and scalable way.</p><p>Though my core expertise lies in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I’ve also taken on the role of a Data Engineer for several years, working across backend systems and real-time pipelines.</p><p>I'm happy to be part of this community, and I look forward to sharing more technical insights and learning from all of you.</p><p>Let’s dive into the world of Data Engineering!</p><h3><strong>What is Data Engineering?</strong></h3><p>Data Engineering is a critical discipline within the broader data ecosystem that focuses on building and maintaining the architecture, pipelines, and systems necessary for the collection, storage, and processing of large volumes of data. It is the foundation that supports data science, analytics, and machine learning operations. At its core, data engineering deals with designing robust and scalable systems that move data from various sources into forms that are usable by downstream applications.</p><p>A data engineer is responsible for ensuring that data is not only collected but also cleaned, structured, and made available in a timely manner. This involves a strong understanding of databases, distributed systems, scripting, and workflow orchestration tools. It is not a one-size-fits-all role; depending on the scale and nature of the organization, a data engineer might wear many hats—ranging from data ingestion and transformation to cloud infrastructure setup and pipeline optimization.</p><p>A central task in data engineering is the implementation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines.</p><p>ETL is the traditional method where data is first extracted from source systems such as transactional databases, APIs, or flat files. It is then transformed—cleaned, aggregated, and reshaped—before being loaded into a destination system, often a data warehouse. This approach works well when transformation is done outside the warehouse, especially when transformation logic is complex or the warehouse is compute-constrained.</p><p>On the other hand, ELT has gained popularity with the rise of cloud-native data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. In ELT, raw data is loaded directly into the warehouse, and all transformations are performed post-load. This method benefits from the massive parallelism and compute power of modern data warehouses and keeps raw data accessible for reprocessing.</p><h3><strong>Working with Data Lakes (IBM Cloud Object Storage)</strong></h3><p>A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store all structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale. Unlike a data warehouse that requires predefined schemas, data lakes support schema-on-read, allowing more flexibility for exploration and modeling. Schema definitions are more important to maintain the folder structure, it is even more important in Parquet files to define schema in a proficient way.</p><p>IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) is a popular choice for building data lakes, especially in hybrid cloud environments. It offers durability, scalability, and support for open data formats like Parquet and ORC. Engineers often use IBM COS as a staging ground for raw and processed data before it is ingested into analytics or machine learning workflows.</p><p>In practice, data engineers use services like IBM COS to store logs, streaming data, and backup files. The stored data is accessed using Python libraries such as  or .</p><p><strong>Accesssing COS Bucket technically:</strong></p><div><pre><code>import ibm_boto3\nfrom ibm_botocore.client import Config\n\ncos = ibm_boto3.client(\"s3\",\n    ibm_api_key_id=\"API_KEY\",\n    ibm_service_instance_id=\"SERVICE_ID\",\n    config=Config(signature_version=\"oauth\"),\n    endpoint_url=\"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud\"\n)\n\n# List files in a bucket\ncos.list_objects_v2(Bucket=\"my-bucket\")['Contents']\n</code></pre></div><h3><strong>Pandas, SQL, Parquet, DuckDB, and PyArrow</strong></h3><p>Data engineering often involves working with various tools and formats for transformation and storage. Here’s how these technologies fit into a typical stack:</p><ul><li><p>: A go-to Python library for data manipulation, ideal for small to medium datasets. While not optimal for big data, it is excellent for rapid prototyping and local transformations.</p></li><li><p>: Structured Query Language remains a cornerstone of data transformations. Whether running in PostgreSQL, Snowflake, or embedded systems like DuckDB, SQL is used to clean, join, filter, and aggregate data.</p></li><li><p>: A columnar storage format that supports efficient querying and compression. It is widely used for storing processed datasets in data lakes due to its performance benefits in analytics.</p></li><li><p>: An in-process SQL OLAP database that can query Parquet files directly without loading them into memory. It allows data engineers to write complex SQL queries on large datasets stored in files, making it excellent for fast, local experimentation.</p></li><li><p>: A Python binding for Apache Arrow, enabling efficient serialization of data between systems. PyArrow is used under the hood by many libraries (including Pandas and DuckDB) to enable zero-copy reads and writes, boosting performance.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these tools form a powerful suite for local and scalable data processing. A typical use case might involve reading a Parquet file from IBM COS using PyArrow, manipulating it with Pandas or DuckDB, and exporting it to a data warehouse via an ELT pipeline.</p><p><strong>Why DuckDB is a Better Fit Than Modin or Vaex for Large-Scale Data Processing</strong></p><p>Using DuckDB over Modin or Vaex is often a more robust and scalable approach when working with large datasets—particularly in Parquet format. DuckDB is highly efficient at processing queries directly on disk without loading the full dataset into memory. Attempting to perform complex operations like correlation or aggregations directly on massive in-memory dataframes is not only memory-intensive but can also be error-prone or slow. A better pattern is to convert the DataFrame to Parquet and use DuckDB to query and process the data efficiently. This offers both speed and scalability in a single-node environment.</p><p>Moreover, complex operations like <strong>joins, filters, aggregations</strong>, and  are optimized inside DuckDB’s vectorized execution engine. It handles query planning and execution more efficiently than the implicit operations in Modin or Vaex, which often delegate tasks to backends like Dask or rely on caching in RAM.</p><h3><strong>Some basic code level Implementations</strong></h3><p>Certainly! Here's a concise yet informative overview of the <strong>NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data</strong> dataset you're using:</p><h3><strong>Dataset Overview: NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records (2023)</strong></h3><p>The <strong>NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Dataset</strong> is a public dataset provided by the <strong>New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC)</strong>. It contains detailed records of individual taxi trips taken in NYC, collected directly from the taxi meters and GPS systems.</p><p>For this example, we're using data from:</p><blockquote><p>\nParquet File URL:<code>https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2023-01.parquet</code></p></blockquote><div><table><tbody><tr><td>ID of the taxi provider (1 or 2)</td></tr><tr><td>Timestamp when the trip started</td></tr><tr><td>Timestamp when the trip ended</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Distance of the trip in miles</td></tr><tr><td>Rate type (standard, JFK, Newark, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>If trip record was stored and forwarded due to loss of signal</td></tr><tr><td>Type of payment (credit card, cash, etc.)</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Additional charges (e.g., peak hour)</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Tolls charged during trip</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Total charged to the passenger</td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul><li><strong>~7 to 10 million rows per month</strong></li><li>File size ranges from  in  format</li><li>Data is stored in a , making it efficient for analytics</li></ul><ol><li>Trip duration calculation</li><li>Average fare per distance bucket</li></ol><div><pre><code>import duckdb\n\n# Connect DuckDB\ncon = duckdb.connect()\n\nparquet_url = \"https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2023-01.parquet\"\n</code></pre></div><p><strong><em>1.

Apache Airflow solves this by allowing engineers to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using Python.</p><p>Airflow supports task dependencies, scheduling, retries, logging, and alerting out-of-the-box. Each task in Airflow is executed by an operator. For instance, a  might run a transformation script, while a  could trigger a shell script to ingest data.</p><p>A typical Airflow pipeline might look like this:</p><ol><li>Pull data from an API using a Python script.</li><li>Load the raw data into IBM Cloud Object Storage.</li><li>Run a DuckDB transformation on the stored Parquet files.</li><li>Export the clean data into a data warehouse.</li><li>Trigger a Slack or email notification on completion.</li></ol><p>Airflow's extensibility, combined with its scheduling and monitoring features, makes it the default choice for modern data engineering teams.</p><p>Data Engineering is both a foundation and a force multiplier for modern analytics and AI systems. From building reliable ETL/ELT pipelines to managing petabytes of data in cloud storage, the role demands a mix of software engineering, data modeling, and system design skills.</p><p>As the data landscape evolves, so do the tools and techniques. Technologies like DuckDB and PyArrow are transforming how we process data locally, while orchestrators like Airflow and cloud platforms like IBM COS make it easier to scale and automate data workflows. A successful data engineer needs to stay deeply technical, understand the underlying principles, and always design systems with scalability, reliability, and maintainability in mind.</p>","contentLength":11568,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Entity Framework ou Dapper ?","url":"https://dev.to/daniloopinheiro/entity-framework-ou-dapper--4a2m","date":1751298103,"author":"Danilo O.

It turns out I’m not alone, studies show static analysis tools alone can detect up to 70% of potential code defects. Even more impressively, advanced AI code-review systems claim to catch around 90% of common issues. Intriguing, right?</p><p>By combining the right tools, from AI-driven code review to automated tests and monitoring, I managed to boost the number of bugs we catch before release by roughly 70%.</p><p>I started embedding Entelligence’s real-time AI reviewer directly in my IDE and immediately saw results. It’s like having a savvy teammate checking my code as I type. In fact, the makers of <a href=\"https://dub.sh/L1Iq9Jv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Entelligence</a> boast that this IDE integration “helps you catch bugs and improve code quality instantly”. The AI flags issues and even suggests fixes before I commit to GitHub. Because it supports dozens of languages, I could use it across our whole stack (<a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JavaScript</a>, Java, etc.). Using Entelligence, I routinely caught subtle logic and design flaws early, massively cutting down the number of defects slipping into code reviews or production.</p><p>Next, I set up SonarQube scans as part of our build. SonarQube is a static analysis tool that “detects bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells” across 29+ languages. Whenever new code is pushed, SonarQube’s automated quality gate kicks in, highlighting issues immediately. This makes clean-up proactive: developers fix unsafe patterns or unused variables before merging. In practice, we found this was powerful – it turns out static analysis can catch roughly 70% of defects before runtime. By addressing these flagged issues in SonarQube early, our team drastically reduced the trivial bugs that used to blow up later, improving overall code reliability and maintainability.</p><p>I also overhauled our CI/CD pipelines (using Jenkins/GitHub Actions) to run thorough test suites on every commit. Now, each pull request triggers automated unit and integration tests (JUnit, Jest, etc.) along with the static scans. This meant catching bugs the moment they appear. Tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions “trigger automated unit tests after each code commit,” effectively catching software bugs at the early stages of development. </p><p>In my experience, this CI-driven testing caught countless edge cases and regressions right away – issues that otherwise would have reached QA or production. Automating tests in the pipeline has not only stopped obvious bugs (like broken API responses) from merging, but also given me quick feedback so my team can fix defects immediately.</p><p>Despite all the up-front checks, some bugs inevitably slipped through – that’s where Sentry came in. Sentry is an application monitoring and error-tracking tool that automatically captures exceptions, crashes, and slowdowns in real time. In practice it was a lifesaver: once Sentry was integrated, I began seeing every production and staging error with full context. </p><p>As one summary puts it, “Sentry helps engineering teams identify and fix bugs faster by automatically capturing exceptions, crashes, and … performance transactions”. Using Sentry, whenever an error popped up in our distributed services, I got notified immediately with stack traces. This meant catching user-impacting bugs instantly (often before customers even noticed) and reducing downtime. Today Sentry is used by 100,000+ organizations, and it’s been a huge help in making sure no runtime bug goes unnoticed.</p><p>Finally, I wouldn’t ignore the basics: linting and type-checking tools. Linters like ESLint (for JavaScript) or Pylint (for Python) automatically scan code for common mistakes or style issues as you write. These tools “automate checking of source code for programmatic errors”. In fact, using lint tools can “reduce errors and improve overall quality” by forcing developers to fix mistakes earlier. We also gradually converted key modules to TypeScript and enabled strict mode. The result was that trivial bugs (like undefined variables or wrong function calls) were caught by the compiler or linter before testing even began. By treating linter warnings as errors in CI, I eliminated a huge number of small bugs and inconsistencies up-front.</p><p>Each of these tools tackles bugs at different stages – from writing code to shipping it – and together they formed a safety net across our entire stack. The combined effect was clear: our bug count dropped dramatically.</p><p><em>In the enterprise world, delivering quality code is non-negotiable, and skipping any of these tools leaves gaps.</em></p><p>Don’t miss out on Entelligence for instant AI feedback, SonarQube for deep static scans, CI pipelines with automated tests for early regression checks, Sentry for runtime visibility, or good old linters/type checking for first-line defense. Adopting all of them means catching issues at every step. I’ve seen it personally. Ready to up your quality game? Start integrating these tools today and watch those elusive bugs vanish.</p><p><em>Let me know if you use any tool in the same space in the comment section below!!!</em></p>","contentLength":5105,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tricky javascript codes part 3","url":"https://dev.to/md_ashraf_dev_to/tricky-javascript-codes-part-3-1mkh","date":1751293800,"author":"MD ASHRAF","guid":176728,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>We have 3 nested boxes (box1, box2, box3).

Often split into ITLB and DTLB.</li><li> To provide the fastest possible address translation for frequently accessed pages, minimizing latency for the most critical memory operations.</li><li> Very low (e.g., 0.5-1 clock cycle).</li></ul></li><li><strong>L2 TLB (Level 2 TLB) / Last-Level TLB (LLTLB or STLB - Second-Level TLB):</strong><ul><li> Larger and slower than L1 TLBs, but still much faster than accessing page tables in main memory. It might be unified or shared among multiple cores.</li><li> To handle TLB misses from the L1 TLB, providing a larger capacity to store translations for a wider range of pages, thus reducing the number of times the system needs to walk the page tables in main memory.</li><li> When an L1 TLB miss occurs, the L2 TLB is checked. If found, it's still a TLB hit, but with slightly higher latency than an L1 hit.</li><li> The L2 TLB aims to have a very high hit rate to prevent page table walks.</li></ul></li></ul><ol><li>When the CPU generates a virtual address, it first checks the L1 TLB.</li><li>If there's an L1 TLB hit, the physical address is returned quickly, and the memory access proceeds.</li><li>If there's an L1 TLB miss, the request is forwarded to the L2 TLB.</li><li>If there's an L2 TLB hit, the physical address is retrieved from the L2 TLB, and the L1 TLB is updated with this translation (often, the newly accessed entry is brought into L1).</li><li>If there's an L2 TLB miss (a \"full TLB miss\"), then the MMU (Memory Management Unit) or the operating system (depending on whether it's hardware-managed or software-managed) must walk the page tables in main memory to find the translation. This is the slowest scenario, incurring a significant \"miss penalty\" (10-100 clock cycles or more). Once the translation is found, it's typically loaded into both the L1 and L2 TLBs for faster future access.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  10.

It involves a combination of skills, mindset, and strategies to build strong relationships, contribute effectively, and grow professionally. Whether you're a new employee or a seasoned professional, these tips will help you succeed in any workplace environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>Understand the Company Culture</strong></h2><p>Every company has its own unique culture, values, and way of doing things. Take the time to observe and learn the unwritten rules. Are meetings formal or casual? Is collaboration encouraged, or is independent work valued more? Aligning yourself with the company culture shows that you’re adaptable and committed to fitting in while still bringing your unique perspective.</p><ul><li>: Ask questions during onboarding and pay attention to how colleagues interact. If your company has a mission statement or core values, familiarize yourself with them and reflect those in your work.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. </h2><p>Clear and concise communication is key to building trust and avoiding misunderstandings. Whether you're sending an email, presenting in a meeting, or chatting with a coworker, ensure your message is well-articulated and respectful.</p><ul><li>: Practice active listening. When someone speaks, focus on understanding their point of view before responding. This builds stronger connections and shows that you value others’ input.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. <strong>Set Clear Goals and Prioritize Tasks</strong></h2><p>Success in a company often comes down to managing your time and workload effectively. Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to stay focused on what matters most. Break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p><ul><li>: Use tools like Trello, Asana, or even a simple to-do list to keep track of deadlines and priorities. Review your progress regularly to stay on course.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. <strong>Build Relationships with Colleagues</strong></h2><p>Networking within your company is just as important as external networking. Building positive relationships with your coworkers and supervisors creates a supportive work environment and opens doors for collaboration and mentorship.</p><ul><li>: Take initiative by joining team activities, offering help when needed, or simply engaging in casual conversations during breaks. A friendly demeanor goes a long way in fostering camaraderie.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. <strong>Be Proactive and Take Initiative</strong></h2><p>Don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do. Look for opportunities to solve problems, suggest improvements, or take on additional responsibilities. Being proactive demonstrates your commitment and can set you apart as a valuable team member.</p><ul><li>: If you notice an area for improvement, propose a solution rather than just pointing out the problem. This shows leadership potential and a willingness to contribute.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. <strong>Seek Feedback and Act on It</strong></h2><p>Constructive feedback is a powerful tool for growth. Don’t shy away from asking for input on your performance from your manager or peers. More importantly, act on the feedback you receive to show that you’re dedicated to self-improvement.</p><ul><li>: Schedule regular check-ins with your supervisor to discuss your progress and areas for development. Approach feedback with an open mind, even if it’s critical.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. <strong>Stay Organized and Punctual</strong></h2><p>Organization and punctuality reflect professionalism and reliability. Keep your workspace tidy, manage your calendar effectively, and always meet deadlines. Showing up on time for meetings and delivering work as promised builds trust with your team.</p><ul><li>: Set reminders for important tasks and meetings. If you anticipate a delay, communicate it early and provide a realistic timeline for completion.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. <strong>Invest in Continuous Learning</strong></h2><p>The workplace is constantly evolving, and staying relevant means keeping your skills up to date. Take advantage of training programs, workshops, or online courses offered by your company or available externally. Learning new skills not only benefits you but also adds value to your team.</p><ul><li>: Identify skills that are in demand in your industry and set a goal to master them. Share your learning with your team to position yourself as a resource.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  9. <strong>Maintain a Positive Attitude</strong></h2><p>A positive mindset can make a huge difference in how you’re perceived at work. Challenges and setbacks are inevitable, but approaching them with optimism and resilience will inspire confidence in your abilities.</p><ul><li>: Focus on solutions rather than dwelling on problems. Celebrate small wins and acknowledge the efforts of your colleagues to create a motivating atmosphere.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  10. <strong>Respect Work-Life Balance</strong></h2><p>While dedication to your job is important, overworking can lead to burnout and decreased productivity. Respect your personal time and encourage a healthy balance between work and life. A well-rested and balanced employee is more effective and engaged.</p><ul><li>: Set boundaries by avoiding work-related tasks during personal time, unless absolutely necessary. Communicate your availability to your team to manage expectations.</li></ul><p>Thriving in a company is a journey that requires intentional effort, adaptability, and a commitment to growth. By following these tips, you can build a strong reputation, foster meaningful relationships, and achieve long-term success in your career. Remember, every workplace is different, so tailor these strategies to fit your unique environment and personal goals. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your professional life flourish!</p>","contentLength":5501,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Debugging Techniques and Problem Location Strategies Methodology for Rapid Problem Location in Complex Systems（1751293119637400）","url":"https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/debugging-techniques-and-problem-location-strategies-methodology-for-rapid-problem-location-in-5d02","date":1751293120,"author":"member_35db4d53","guid":176723,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

The Invisible Post Office Powering Modern Software</em></strong></p><p>Imagine a busy day at the local post office. You drop your letter into the mailbox and leave, trusting it will be delivered. Behind the scenes, postal workers collect mail from boxes, sort it at central facilities, and deliver it to recipients, all without needing you to wait. This system allows senders to move on with their day, postal workers to handle delivery at their own pace, and the entire operation to run efficiently without direct handoffs or delays. </p><p><strong><code>This is exactly how a Message Queue works in software.</code></strong></p><p><strong><em>Why Do We Need Message Queues in Distributed Systems?</em></strong></p><p>In modern software, applications are often composed of multiple independent components i.e. payment processors, inventory services, email dispatchers, etc. These components <strong>need to communicate asynchronously</strong> so that one system can pass information to another without waiting for an immediate response.\nThis is where  works, they serve as a buffer, enabling smooth communication between services.</p><p><strong><em>Understanding the Core Components of a Message Queue System</em></strong></p><p>Let’s visualize it as a digital post office:</p><ul><li>\nThis is the part of the system that creates and sends the message.</li></ul><p>📌 Example: A user uploads a video.

It encompasses the ability of individuals to control who can access, use, and share their digital information. In today's data-driven society, digital privacy is paramount because a vast amount of sensitive personal data, from financial records to health information, is generated and stored on digital platforms. Misuse of this data can lead to significant issues, making it essential for individuals to maintain control over their online presence and personal information.</p><p>While often used interchangeably, #DigitalPrivacy and #DataSecurity are distinct, though related, concepts. Data security focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft through technical safeguards like encryption and firewalls. It's about the  – how data is protected. Digital privacy, on the other hand, is concerned with the  and  – what data is collected, for what purpose, and who has access to it. It ensures that data collection, usage, and storage comply with an individual's rights and applicable regulations.</p><p>Digital privacy encompasses several key facets:</p><ul><li> Control over the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, such as browsing history, purchase records, and health data.</li><li> The secrecy and integrity of personal communications (emails, messages, calls) from unauthorized interception.</li><li> Control over one's physical whereabouts and movements as tracked by digital devices and services.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Digital Minefield: Common Privacy Threats\n</h2><p>The digital landscape is rife with threats designed to compromise personal privacy. Understanding these common types is the first step towards protection:</p><p>Digital #Surveillance involves the monitoring of online activities, often without explicit consent. This ranges from government agencies tracking communications for national security to corporations collecting vast amounts of user data for targeted advertising, a concept known as #SurveillanceCapitalism. While some surveillance serves legitimate purposes, it raises significant concerns about the erosion of individual freedoms and the potential for data misuse.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Impact of Digital Privacy Threats\n</h3><p>The consequences of #DigitalPrivacyThreats extend far beyond mere inconvenience, affecting individuals and society on multiple levels:</p><ul><li> Direct financial losses through unauthorized transactions, fraudulent accounts, or the costs associated with identity recovery services.</li><li><strong>Reputational and Psychological Impacts:</strong> Severe reputational damage and deep psychological distress, leading to anxiety, stress, and a pervasive sense of vulnerability.</li><li> Repeated privacy violations erode trust in digital platforms, institutions, and governments, impacting willingness to engage in online activities.</li><li> Mass surveillance can lead to self-censorship, while data exploitation can influence public opinion and democratic processes, undermining personal autonomy and a secure digital society.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Corporate Data Collection: Practices, Ethics, and Responsibilities\n</h2><p>In the modern enterprise landscape, #DataCollection is the systematic process of gathering information from various sources to gain insights, identify trends, and make informed decisions. Data is no longer just a byproduct; it is a critical asset that fuels growth, innovation, and competitive advantage.</p><p>By meticulously collecting and analyzing data, companies can enhance decision-making, personalize customer experiences, forecast market trends, and mitigate risks. This allows businesses to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs, fostering long-term success.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Corporate Data Collection Practices\n</h3><p>Corporations employ diverse methods to collect data from internal and external sources:</p><ul><li><strong>Internal Data Collection:</strong> Generated within the company's operations.\n\n<ul><li> From sales, purchases, and billing records (POS, e-commerce, ERP).</li><li><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems:</strong> Store customer interactions, preferences, and history.</li><li><strong>Website and Application Analytics:</strong> Track user behavior (Google Analytics, mobile apps).</li><li> Supply chain, inventory, production, and employee performance.</li><li><strong>Surveys and Feedback Forms:</strong> Direct collection from customers, employees, or stakeholders.</li></ul></li><li><strong>External Data Collection:</strong> Sourced from outside the company for broader market insights.\n\n<ul><li> Data on market size, trends, competitors, and consumer demographics.</li><li> Analyzing public conversations and sentiment.</li><li> Government statistics, economic indicators, industry reports.</li><li><strong>Third-Party Data Providers:</strong> Purchasing aggregated and anonymized demographic or behavioral data.</li><li> Programmatically extracting information from public websites (with ethical/legal considerations).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Ethical Considerations in Data Collection\n</h3><p>The pervasive nature of data collection brings #DataEthics to the forefront, demanding a commitment to ethical principles that prioritize individual rights and societal well-being:</p><ul><li> Respecting individuals' right to control personal information.

It was... okay, but often felt clunky. Now, Jetpack Compose is changing the game. It's a new way to build UIs, focusing on  code. Instead of telling the system  to build the UI step-by-step, you describe  you want, and Compose takes care of the rest. It's a pretty big shift, and honestly, it makes things a lot easier.</p><h3>Describing Your UI, Not Instructing It</h3><p><strong>The core idea behind Jetpack Compose is to describe your UI's desired state, and let the framework handle the actual rendering.</strong> This is different from the old way, where you'd manually update UI elements. Think of it like this: instead of giving someone instructions on how to draw a circle, you just tell them, \"Draw a circle.\" Compose figures out the best way to do it. This approach leads to cleaner code and fewer bugs. It's also easier to reason about your UI, because you're working with a clear, high-level description.</p><h3>The Power of the prompt to compose ui Paradigm</h3><p>With Jetpack Compose, you're essentially writing code that describes the UI based on its current state. When the state changes, Compose automatically updates the UI to reflect those changes. This is called , and it's a key part of how Compose works. It's also pretty efficient; Compose only updates the parts of the UI that need to be changed. This <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ramadan123sayed/understanding-imperative-vs-declarative-programming-in-kotlin-and-jetpack-compose-vs-xml-2271650fc3d2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">declarative approach</a> makes it easier to build dynamic and responsive UIs.</p><ul><li>Easier to test UI components.</li><li>More predictable UI behavior.</li></ul><blockquote>Jetpack Compose really shines when you start building complex UIs. The declarative approach makes it easier to manage state and keep your UI consistent. It's a bit of a learning curve at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll never want to go back to XML.</blockquote><h2>Streamlining Development with Jetpack Compose</h2><p>Jetpack Compose isn't just about a new way to describe your UI; it's about making the whole development process smoother and faster. I remember the days of wrestling with XML layouts, and honestly, Compose feels like a breath of fresh air. It's like they actually listened to developers' pain points and built a tool to address them. Let's look at some ways Compose streamlines development.</p><h3>Efficient State Management for Dynamic UIs</h3><p><strong>State management is a big deal in any UI framework, and Compose handles it beautifully.</strong> Instead of manually updating views when data changes, Compose automatically recomposes the UI based on the current state. This means less boilerplate code and fewer opportunities for bugs. It's a game changer.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of how Compose simplifies state management:</p><ul><li> makes components more reusable and testable.</li><li> and  are your best friends for managing local state.</li><li>ViewModel integration makes it easy to handle complex state logic and survive configuration changes.</li></ul><blockquote>Managing state used to be a headache, but Compose makes it almost enjoyable. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to reason about how your UI behaves, and the built-in state management tools are incredibly powerful.</blockquote><h3>Visualizing Your Design with UI Previews</h3><p>One of my favorite features of Compose is the ability to create UI previews directly in the IDE. No more deploying to a device or emulator just to see if your layout looks right! You can quickly iterate on your design and see the results in real-time. This saves a ton of time and frustration. The <a href=\"https://codifysol.com/swiftui-vs-jetpack-compose-who-wins-in-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UI previews</a> are a huge win for productivity.</p><p>Here's why UI previews are so awesome:</p><ul><li>Instant feedback on your UI changes.</li><li>Support for multiple devices and themes.</li><li>Easy to create and customize previews.</li></ul><p>With UI previews, you can catch design issues early and often, leading to a more polished and professional-looking app. It's like having a visual debugger for your UI, and it's something I can't imagine developing without anymore.</p><p>Making apps is way easier with Jetpack Compose. It helps you build cool stuff faster and with less hassle.

In the realm of multimodal AI, a significant contender has recently made its mark: the latest  vision model. This compact yet powerful model recently debuted at number two on the OCRBench leaderboard, making it the most performant multimodal model under 7B parameters. This remarkable achievement highlights its capabilities in document understanding and sets a new benchmark for smaller, more efficient AI models in this critical domain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  TL;DR: What are vision model LLMs?\n</h3><p>Vision Model Large Language Models (LLMs), often referred to as Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence by bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. Unlike traditional LLMs that exclusively process text, VLMs are designed to understand and interact with both visual data (like images and videos) and textual data simultaneously. At their core, these models integrate a vision encoder, which extracts meaningful features and representations from visual inputs (e.g., recognizing objects, textures, and spatial relationships), with a language model, which excels at understanding and generating human-like text. These two components work in conjunction, often through sophisticated alignment and fusion mechanisms, to map visual and textual information into a shared embedding space. This allows VLMs to perform a variety of complex tasks, such as generating descriptive captions for images, answering questions about visual content, and even enabling visual search. By unifying perception and expression, VLMs enable AI systems to interpret and communicate about the world in a more holistic and intuitive manner, much closer to how humans perceive information.</p><p>To practically test the capabilities of the granite-vision-3.3-2b model, I've leveraged the provided code to run it locally on my machine. A key enhancement to this local setup is the implementation of a conversational interface. Instead of static queries, this allows for dynamic interaction, where I can pose questions or prompts to the model about a given image in a continuous chat format. This interactive mode offers a more flexible and insightful way to explore the model's understanding of visual content and its ability to respond to natural language queries, simulating a real-world application scenario.</p><p>Here we go with the test ⬇️</p><div><pre><code>python3  venv venv\nvenv/bin/activate\n\npip  pip\n</code></pre></div><p>And install the requirements ⬇️</p><div><pre><code>pip  Pillow torch huggingface_hub\n</code></pre></div><p>And then the sample application 👨‍💻</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>The sample image will be downloaded with rest of necessary files in the huggingface cache directory.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code>/Users/xxxxxx/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--ibm-granite--granite-vision-3.3-2b/snapshots/7fe917fdafb006f53aedf9589f148a83ec3cd8eb\n</code></pre></div><p>Results and outputs of the sample code are provided below;</p><div><pre><code>--- Model Output ---\n\nA chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Even on a CPU-only laptop, the inference process completes within a reasonable timeframe. This efficiency is particularly noteworthy given that such models often benefit greatly from GPU acceleration, underscoring the model's optimization for more accessible hardware environments.</p><p>In summary, the IBM Granite 3.3 2B vision model represents a significant leap forward in multimodal AI, notably securing a top position on the OCRBench leaderboard as the most performant model under 7B parameters. This achievement underscores the growing power of Vision Model LLMs, which seamlessly integrate visual and textual understanding to process complex information. Our practical exploration demonstrated this model’s capabilities in a local, interactive chat environment, allowing for dynamic engagement with visual content. Critically, the granite-vision-3.3-2b model exhibited commendable and reasonable execution times even on a CPU-only laptop, highlighting its efficiency and potential for broader accessibility beyond high-end, GPU-accelerated systems. This combination of strong performance and efficient local execution positions IBM Granite Vision as a compelling solution for various document understanding and multimodal AI applications.</p>","contentLength":5154,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ForwardMX alternative: Email Forwarding with Kubernetes & LDAP","url":"https://dev.to/oursinet/forwardmx-alternative-email-forwarding-with-kubernetes-ldap-1326","date":1751286659,"author":"Benoît Vannesson","guid":176635,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>TL;DR: I replaced my $10/month forwardmx subscription with a self-hosted forwarding-only mail server setup, using OpenLDAP and docker-mailserver on my Kubernetes cluster.

This article explains the step-by-step process to develop a digital twin that focuses on forecasting equipment failures before they happen. By integrating sensor data, real-time analytics, and machine learning, organizations can shift from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies—maximizing productivity while minimizing risk.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Predictive Maintenance Needs Digital Twins\n</h2><p>Traditional maintenance is often reactive (fix it when it breaks) or preventive (fix it on a schedule). Predictive maintenance, however, relies on data-driven insights that show  a machine is likely to fail. Digital twins make this possible by replicating equipment behavior and comparing live sensor data with expected norms.</p><p>With this virtual model constantly running in parallel with your physical asset, you can catch early warning signs—like temperature drifts or vibration changes—long before the equipment actually fails.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Use Cases for Predictive Maintenance Twins\n</h2><ul><li> Detect motor misalignments, worn bearings, or hydraulic issues before breakdowns occur.</li><li> Monitor engine vibration, oil quality, and structural fatigue in real time.</li><li> Track turbine conditions and optimize servicing schedules.</li><li> Predict elevator maintenance, HVAC component wear, or lighting system faults.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set Clear Maintenance Objectives\n</h2><p>Before building your twin, define what success looks like. Examples include:</p><ul><li>Reducing machine downtime by 30% over 6 months\n</li><li>Lowering maintenance costs by 20% annually\n</li><li>Predicting 90% of failures at least one week in advance\n</li></ul><p>Start with a pilot project focused on one high-impact machine or system. This helps prove value without stretching your resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Identify Key Equipment and Failure Modes\n</h2><p>List the assets you want to monitor—motors, compressors, pumps, or CNC machines. Then identify the most common failure types. For example, a pump might fail due to impeller wear, bearing friction, or overheating.</p><p>Determine which sensor data can reveal early indicators of these failures, such as:</p><ul></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Build a Data Collection Framework\n</h2><p>Use IoT sensors or industrial monitoring systems (like SCADA or PLCs) to feed data into your system. Make sure your data pipeline supports:</p><ul><li>Real-time streaming (using MQTT, OPC-UA, or Kafka)\n</li><li>Historical logging (with time-series databases like InfluxDB)\n</li><li>Data validation and cleaning\n</li></ul><p>Implement edge computing near the machines when low-latency processing is needed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Model Machine Behavior and Anomalies\n</h2><p>The digital twin should simulate normal behavior using physics-based or data-driven models. Start by analyzing historical data from healthy equipment to create baselines.</p><p>Use machine learning algorithms—like anomaly detection, clustering, or regression—to learn what \"normal\" looks like and to flag deviations.</p><p>Popular ML models include:</p><ul><li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n</li><li>Neural networks (especially for complex patterns)\n</li></ul><p>Validate the model by testing it against known failure events. Fine-tune until predictions are consistently accurate.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Deploy Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts\n</h2><p>Once your model is trained, connect it to live data feeds and create alert mechanisms. Define thresholds for different severity levels:</p><ul><li> = Deviation detected, monitor closely\n</li><li> = High-risk of failure, trigger maintenance\n</li></ul><p>Set up automatic notifications via email, SMS, or your maintenance management system.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Dashboard Design and Visualization\n</h2><p>Your twin needs to present insights clearly to operators, engineers, and managers. Effective dashboards should include:</p><ul><li>Trend charts showing equipment performance over time\n</li><li>Failure probability forecasts\n</li><li>Maintenance recommendations\n</li></ul><p>Use platforms like Grafana, Power BI, or Hopara for dynamic, real-time interfaces.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Maintenance and ERP Systems\n</h2><p>A predictive maintenance digital twin gains value when integrated with your existing tools. Link it with:</p><ul><li> (Computerized Maintenance Management Systems)\n</li><li> for scheduling and resource planning\n</li><li> for spare part availability\n</li></ul><p>This integration allows automatic work order generation and better alignment between predictive insights and action.</p><p>Ensure your team includes:</p><ul><li> to define failure behavior\n</li><li> to develop ML models\n</li><li> for device integration\n</li><li> for dashboard and backend logic\n</li></ul><p>If your internal resources are limited, consider partnering with an IoT or analytics provider for early development.</p><p>Knowing <strong>how to build a digital twin</strong> for predictive maintenance enables you to extend the life of critical assets and make smarter operational decisions. Start with a focused goal, build a reliable data foundation, and use machine learning models to predict failure before it occurs. Visualization and integration are equally important—insights must be actionable and accessible to drive real-world improvements.</p><p>Start small, iterate fast, and scale once you've demonstrated real value. Predictive maintenance powered by digital twins is not just a tech trend—it’s a competitive advantage.</p>","contentLength":5121,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Digital Thread vs Digital Twin in Smart Factories: Why IIoT Needs Both","url":"https://dev.to/kapusto/digital-thread-vs-digital-twin-in-smart-factories-why-iiot-needs-both-2950","date":1751283143,"author":"Mikuz","guid":176592,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The rise of industrial IoT (IIoT) is transforming how manufacturers design, operate, and maintain complex systems. With smart factories becoming the new standard in Industry 4.0, leaders are revisiting the value of  frameworks to enable real-time insights, automation, and predictive operations. While often used interchangeably, these technologies solve very different problems—and combining them may be the key to unlocking full operational intelligence.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes a Factory “Smart”?\n</h2><p>A smart factory uses IIoT sensors, connected devices, edge computing, and cloud analytics to optimize every process across the value chain. These factories continuously collect, analyze, and act on data from physical assets, leading to faster decisions and more efficient resource use.</p><p>Common features of smart factories include:</p><ul><li>Real-time machine monitoring</li><li>Digital work instructions</li><li>Autonomous production adjustments</li><li>Closed-loop quality control</li></ul><p>These improvements hinge on robust data infrastructure, where digital thread and digital twin technologies play foundational roles.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Role of IIoT in Manufacturing Optimization\n</h2><p>IIoT connects industrial machines, robots, and systems to collect telemetry data—temperature, vibration, speed, and output. This information is analyzed locally at the edge or streamed to the cloud, allowing for instant feedback loops and performance dashboards.</p><ul><li>Reduced downtime via predictive alerts</li><li>Better asset utilization through live diagnostics</li><li>Remote visibility into production status</li><li>Safer operating conditions by detecting anomalies early</li></ul><p>But data alone isn’t useful unless it’s structured and contextualized. That’s where the digital thread and digital twin concepts add value.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Digital Thread and Digital Twin in Smart Factory Architecture\n</h2><p>A digital thread is a connected data backbone that links information across a product’s lifecycle—from design and prototyping to production and servicing. In a smart factory, digital thread architecture ensures all systems “speak the same language,” connecting CAD files, ERP orders, shop floor instructions, and quality logs in one integrated view.</p><p>A digital twin is a real-time virtual replica of a physical asset. In smart factories, these models simulate the behavior of machines, production lines, or even entire plants. They allow teams to:</p><ul><li>Test configuration changes without downtime</li><li>Run “what-if” scenarios for throughput</li><li>Forecast wear based on stress data</li><li>Synchronize operations with real-time input</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Combining Both Technologies Matters\n</h2><p>It’s not a question of <strong>digital thread vs digital twin</strong>—smart factories require both. The digital thread makes sure the right data is available from every system and process. The digital twin interprets that data dynamically to model behavior, simulate future states, and make recommendations.</p><p>: A packaging robot shows irregular torque behavior.  </p><ul><li>The  logs prior maintenance, part replacements, and operator notes.\n</li><li>The  simulates motor failure probability based on current conditions.\nTogether, they guide timely replacement and avoid a breakdown.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Implementation Roadmap\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Deploy Foundational IIoT Infrastructure\n</h3><p>Install sensors on key assets to collect energy, cycle time, environmental, and operational metrics. Use edge devices for local filtering.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Build a Digital Thread\n</h3><p>Map out data sources across systems—MES, PLM, ERP, SCADA—and unify them into a single metadata model. Ensure version control and traceability of product and process data.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Develop Digital Twin Models\n</h3><p>Start small. Build digital twins for high-impact assets (e.g., CNC machines or conveyor belts). Include real-time sensor feeds and historical failure modes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Integrate Visualization and Alerts\n</h3><p>Use dashboards to track both live and historical data. Visual overlays on CAD models can show temperature gradients, motor load, or vibration anomalies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Enable Predictive Workflows\n</h3><p>Combine machine learning models with digital twin data to forecast part failure, optimize shift schedules, or reduce scrap rates.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Visualization Tools That Power Smart Factories\n</h2><p>Smart factories rely on intuitive data visualization to support decision-making.</p><ul><li> show asset KPIs, energy usage, and process alerts.</li><li> (e.g., AR headsets or tablet apps) visualize live performance against the digital twin.</li><li> pull from the digital thread to uncover systemic process issues.</li></ul><p>Tools like Siemens MindSphere, PTC ThingWorx, and GE Predix provide flexible IIoT platforms that integrate digital twins with digital thread data.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Measurable Benefits of Integration\n</h2><p>Companies that implement smart factory solutions with a combined digital thread/twin approach report:</p><ul><li> in unplanned downtime\n</li><li> in asset utilization\n</li><li> in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)\n</li><li><strong>Faster new product introduction</strong> due to better design-feedback loops\n</li></ul><p>These improvements are driven not by sensors alone, but by structured data pipelines and real-time simulation.</p><p>Smart factories require more than connected machines—they need intelligent systems that interpret data in meaningful ways. The <strong>digital thread vs digital twin</strong> conversation should not be a binary choice. They are complementary tools in the IIoT ecosystem, with the thread providing context and the twin enabling action. As manufacturers face greater complexity and demand for agility, integrating both technologies offers a scalable, future-proof path toward operational excellence.</p>","contentLength":5484,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Trends in the frontend tech stack in 2025: What you need to know for long-term growth","url":"https://dev.to/smriti_webdev/trends-in-the-frontend-tech-stack-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know-for-long-term-growth-4fgd","date":1751280595,"author":"Smriti Singh","guid":176561,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The frontend world is continuously changing, and as developers, we must stay up to date on not only what is popular, but also what is sustainable.

The hard part isn't building  database—it's building one that's scalable, easy to use, and actually solves real problems in production.</p><p>This June, we reached a new milestone: Milvus hit <a href=\"https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">35,000 stars on GitHub</a> (now it has 35.5K+ stars at the time of writing). We're not going to pretend this is just another number—it means a lot to us.</p><p>Each star represents a developer who took the time to look at what we've built, found it useful enough to bookmark, and in many cases, decided to use it. Some of you have gone further: filing issues, contributing code, answering questions in our forums, and helping other developers when they get stuck.</p><p>We wanted to take a moment to share our story—the real one, with all the messy parts included.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  We Started Building Milvus Because Nothing Else Worked\n</h2><p>Back in 2017, we started with a simple question: As AI applications were starting to emerge and unstructured data was exploding, how do you efficiently store and search the vector embeddings that power semantic understanding?</p><p>Traditional databases weren't built for this. They're optimized for rows and columns, not high-dimensional vectors. The existing technologies and tools were either impossible or painfully slow for what we needed.</p><p>We tried everything available. Hacked together solutions with Elasticsearch. Built custom indexes on top of MySQL. Even experimented with FAISS, but it was designed as a research library, not a production database infrastructure. Nothing provided the complete solution we envisioned for enterprise AI workloads.</p><p><strong>So we started building our own.</strong> Not because we thought it would be easy—databases are notoriously hard to get right—but because we could see where AI was heading and knew it needed purpose-built infrastructure to get there.</p><p>By 2018, we were deep into developing what would become <a href=\"https://milvus.io/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milvus</a>. The term \"\" didn't even exist yet. We were essentially creating a new category of infrastructure software, which was both exciting and terrifying.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Open-Sourcing Milvus: Building in Public\n</h2><p>In November 2019, we decided to open-source Milvus version 0.10.</p><p>Open-sourcing means exposing all your flaws to the world. Every hack, every TODO comment, every design decision you're not entirely sure about. But we believed that if vector databases were going to become critical infrastructure for AI, they needed to be open and accessible to everyone.</p><p>The response was overwhelming. Developers didn't just use Milvus—they improved it. They found bugs we'd missed, suggested features we hadn't considered, and asked questions that made us think harder about our design choices.</p><p>In 2020, we joined the <a href=\"https://lfaidata.foundation/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LF AI &amp; Data Foundation</a>. This wasn't just for credibility—it taught us how to maintain a sustainable open-source project. How to handle governance, backward compatibility, and building software that lasts years, not months.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Hardest Decision: Starting Over\n</h2><p>Here's where things get complicated. By 2021, Milvus 1.0 was working well for many use cases, but enterprise customers kept asking for the same things: better cloud-native architecture, easier horizontal scaling, more operational simplicity.</p><p>We had a choice: patch our way forward or rebuild from the ground up. We chose to rebuild.</p><p>Milvus 2.0 was essentially a complete rewrite. We introduced a fully decoupled storage-compute architecture with dynamic scalability. It took us two years and was honestly one of the most stressful periods in our company's history. We were throwing away a working system that thousands of people were using to build something unproven.</p><p><strong>But when we released Milvus 2.0 in 2022, it transformed Milvus from a powerful vector database into production-ready infrastructure that could scale to enterprise workloads.</strong> That same year, we also completed a <a href=\"https://zilliz.com/news/vector-database-company-zilliz-series-b-extension?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Series B+ funding round</a>—not to burn money, but to double down on product quality and support for global customers. We knew this path would take time, but every step had to be built on a solid foundation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When Everything Accelerated with AI\n</h2><p>2023 was the year of <a href=\"https://zilliz.com/learn/Retrieval-Augmented-Generation?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RAG</a> (retrieval-augmented generation). Suddenly, semantic search went from an interesting AI technique to essential infrastructure for chatbots, document Q&amp;A systems, and AI agents.</p><p>The GitHub stars of Milvus spiked. Support requests multiplied. Developers who had never heard of vector databases were suddenly asking sophisticated questions about indexing strategies and query optimization.</p><p>This growth was exciting but also overwhelming. We realized we needed to scale not just our technology, but our entire approach to community support. We hired more developer advocates, completely rewrote our documentation, and started creating educational content for developers new to vector databases.</p><p>We also launched <a href=\"https://zilliz.com/cloud?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zilliz Cloud</a>—our fully managed version of Milvus. Some people asked why we were \"commercializing\" our open-source project. The honest answer is that maintaining enterprise-grade infrastructure is expensive and complex. Zilliz Cloud allows us to sustain and accelerate Milvus development while keeping the core project completely open source.</p><p>Then came 2024. <a href=\"https://zilliz.com/blog/zilliz-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-vector-database-report?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Forrester named us a leader</strong></a><strong>in the vector database category.</strong> Milvus passed 30,000 GitHub stars. <strong>And we realized: the road we'd been paving for seven years had finally become the highway.</strong> As more enterprises adopted vector databases as critical infrastructure, our business growth accelerated rapidly—validating that the foundation we'd built could scale both technically and commercially.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Team Behind Milvus: Zilliz\n</h2><p>Here's something interesting: many people know Milvus but not Zilliz. We're actually fine with that. <a href=\"https://zilliz.com/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a><strong>is the team behind Milvus—we build it, maintain it, and support it.</strong></p><p>What we care about most are the unglamorous things that make the difference between a cool demo and production-ready infrastructure: performance optimizations, security patches, documentation that actually helps beginners, and responding thoughtfully to GitHub issues.</p><p>We've built a 24/7 global support team across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, because developers need help in their time zones, not ours. We have community contributors we call \"<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkVTYObayOaND8M1ci9eF_YWvoKDb-xQjLJYZ-LhbCdLAt2Q/viewform?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milvus Ambassadors</a>\" who organize events, answer forum questions, and often explain concepts better than we do.</p><p>We've also welcomed integrations with AWS, GCP, and other cloud providers—even when they offer their own managed versions of Milvus. More deployment options are good for users. Though we've noticed that when teams hit complex technical challenges, they often end up reaching out to us directly because we understand the system at the deepest level.</p><p>Many people think open source is just a \"toolbox,\" but it's actually an \"evolutionary process\"—a collective effort by countless people who love and believe in it. Only those who truly understand the architecture can provide the \"why\" behind bug fixes, performance bottleneck analysis, data system integration, and architectural adjustments.</p><p><strong>So if you're using open-source Milvus, or considering vector databases as a core component of your AI system, we encourage you to reach out to us directly for the most professional and timely support.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real Impact in Production: The Trust from Users\n</h2><p>The use cases for Milvus have grown beyond what we initially imagined. We're powering AI infrastructure for some of the world's most demanding enterprises across every industry.</p><p><a href=\"https://zilliz.com/customers/bosch?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, the global automotive technology leader and pioneer in autonomous driving, revolutionized their data analysis with Milvus achieving 80% reduction in data collection costs and $1.4M annual savings while searching billions of driving scenarios in milliseconds for critical edge cases.</p><p><a href=\"https://zilliz.com/customers/read-ai?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, one of the fastest-growing productivity AI companies serving millions of monthly active users, uses Milvus to achieve sub-20-50ms retrieval latency across billions of records and 5× speedup in agentic search. Their CTO says, \"Milvus serves as the central repository and powers our information retrieval among billions of records.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://zilliz.com/customers/global-fintech-leader?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, one of the world's largest digital payment platforms processing tens of billions of transactions across 200+ countries and 25+ currencies, chose Milvus for 5-10× faster batch ingestion than competitors, completing jobs in under 1 hour that took others 8+ hours.</p><p><a href=\"https://zilliz.com/customers/filevine?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, the leading legal work platform trusted by thousands of law firms across the United States, manages 3 billion vectors across millions of legal documents, saving attorneys 60-80% of time in document analysis and achieving \"true consciousness of data\" for legal case management.</p><p>We're also supporting <strong>NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, Salesforce, Walmart,</strong> and many others in almost every industry. Over 10,000 organizations have made Milvus or Zilliz Cloud their vector database of choice.</p><p>These aren't just technical success stories—they're examples of how vector databases are quietly becoming critical infrastructure that powers the AI applications people use every day.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why We Built Zilliz Cloud: Enterprise-Grade Vector Database as a Service\n</h2><p>Milvus is open-source and free to use. But running Milvus well at enterprise scale requires deep expertise and significant resources. Index selection, memory management, scaling strategies, security configurations—these aren't trivial decisions. Many teams want the power of Milvus without the operational complexity and with enterprise support, SLA guarantees, etc.</p><p>That's why we built <a href=\"https://zilliz.com/cloud?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zilliz Cloud</a>—a fully managed version of Milvus deployed across 25 global regions and 5 major clouds, including AWS, GCP, and Azure, designed specifically for enterprise-scale AI workloads that demand performance, security, and reliability.</p><p>Here's what makes Zilliz Cloud different:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Massive Scale with High Performance:</strong> Our proprietary AI-powered AutoIndex engine delivers 3-5× faster query speeds than open-source Milvus, with zero index tuning required. The cloud-native architecture supports billions of vectors and tens of thousands of concurrent queries while maintaining sub-second response times.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://zilliz.com/trust-center?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Built-in Security &amp; Compliance</strong></a> Encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained RBAC, comprehensive audit logging, SAML/OAuth2.0 integration, and <a href=\"https://zilliz.com/bring-your-own-cloud?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BYOC</a> (bring your own cloud) deployments. We're compliant with GDPR, HIPAA, and other global standards that enterprises actually need.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimized for Cost-Efficiency:</strong> Tiered hot/cold data storage, elastic scaling that responds to real workloads, and pay-as-you-go pricing can reduce total cost of ownership by 50% or more compared to self-managed deployments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Truly Cloud-Agnostic without vendor lock-in:</strong> Deploy on AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent Cloud without vendor lock-in. We ensure global consistency and scalability regardless of where you run.</p></li></ul><p>These capabilities might not sound flashy, but they solve real, daily problems that enterprise teams face when building AI applications at scale. And most importantly: it's still Milvus under the hood, so there's no proprietary lock-in or compatibility issues.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What's Next: Vector Data Lake\n</h2><p>We coined the term \"<a href=\"https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-vector-database?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vector database</a>\" and were the first to build one, but we're not stopping there. We're now building the next evolution: </p><p><strong>Here's the problem we're solving: not every vector search needs millisecond latency.</strong> Many enterprises have massive datasets that are queried occasionally, including historical document analysis, batch similarity computations, and long-term trend analysis. For these use cases, a traditional real-time vector database is both overkill and expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Vector Data Lake uses a storage-compute separated architecture specifically optimized for massive-scale, infrequently accessed vectors while keeping costs dramatically lower than real-time systems.</p><p><strong>Core capabilities include:</strong></p><ul><li><p> Seamlessly connects online and offline data layers with consistent formats and efficient storage, so you can move data between hot and cold tiers without reformatting or complex migrations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compatible Compute Ecosystem:</strong> Works natively with frameworks like Spark and Ray, supporting everything from vector search to traditional ETL and analytics. This means your existing data teams can work with vector data using tools they already know.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cost-Optimized Architecture:</strong> Hot data stays on SSD or NVMe for fast access; cold data automatically moves to object storage like S3. Smart indexing and storage strategies keep I/O fast when you need it while making storage costs predictable and affordable.</p></li></ul><p>This isn't about replacing vector databases—it's about giving enterprises the right tool for each workload. Real-time search for user-facing applications, cost-effective vector data lakes for analytics and historical processing.</p><p>We still believe in the logic behind Moore's Law and Jevons Paradox: as the unit cost of computing drops, adoption scales. The same applies to vector infrastructure.</p><p>By improving indexes, storage structures, caching, and deployment models—day in, day out—we hope to make AI infrastructure more accessible and affordable for everyone, and to help bring unstructured data into the AI-native future.</p><p>Those 35K+ stars represent something we're genuinely proud of: a community of developers who find Milvus useful enough to recommend and contribute to.</p><p>But we're not done. Milvus has bugs to fix, performance improvements to make, and features our community has been asking for. Our roadmap is public, and we genuinely want your input on what to prioritize.</p><p>The number itself isn't what matters—it's the trust those stars represent. Trust that we'll keep building in the open, keep listening to feedback, and keep making Milvus better.</p><ul><li><p> your PRs, bug reports, and documentation improvements make Milvus better every day. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p> thank you for trusting us with your production workloads and for the feedback that keeps us honest.</p></li><li><p> thank you for answering questions, organizing events, and helping newcomers get started.</p></li></ul><p>If you're new to vector databases, we'd love to help you get started.

If you’ve ever wanted to automate your file management tasks with the power of AI, you’re in for a treat. Today, I’m diving into how you can use the <strong>Claude File System MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong> to organize your computer’s files effortlessly. Trust me, this is a game-changer, and you’re gonna  it! This blog will walk you through the setup, usage, and some practical examples to get you started. Plus, I’ll include code snippets to make it super clear. Let’s get started!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is the Claude File System MCP?\n</h2><p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> is a protocol introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to enable seamless integration between large language models (LLMs) like Claude and external data sources, such as your computer’s file system. With the Claude File System MCP, you can give Claude access to your files and directories, allowing it to read, write, move, or organize them based on your instructions. Imagine telling Claude, “Hey, sort my Downloads folder by file type,” and watching it create folders for images, text files, audio, and more, moving everything automatically. That’s the superpower we’re talking about!</p><p>This is perfect for developers, content creators, or anyone who wants to automate repetitive file management tasks without writing complex scripts from scratch. And the best part? It’s completely free to set up on your own computer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Use the Claude File System MCP?\n</h2><ul><li>Automation: Organize files, create directories, and move files with simple prompts.</li><li>Integration: Connect Claude with your file system, Google Drive, or even third-party services like Amazon S3 or Gmail.</li><li>Flexibility: Works on Windows, macOS, or Linux with minimal setup.</li><li>Free and Open: The MCP server is open-source under the MIT License, so you can tweak it to your needs.</li></ul><p>Before we dive into the setup, you’ll need:</p><ol><li>Node.js: The MCP server requires Node.js to run. Download it from nodejs.org and install it.</li><li>Claude Desktop: Download the Claude Desktop app from Anthropic’s website (free plan works fine).</li><li>Basic Terminal Knowledge: You’ll run a few commands to set up the MCP server.</li><li>VS Code (Optional): For easier configuration and integration.</li></ol><p>Let’s set up the Claude File System MCP on your computer. I’ll use a Windows example, but the process is similar for macOS and Linux.</p><ul><li>Go to nodejs.org and download the latest LTS version.</li><li>Run the installer and follow the prompts (Next, Next, Install).</li><li>Verify the installation by opening a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and typing:\n</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2: Install Claude Desktop</strong></p><ul><li>Download the Claude Desktop app from Anthropic’s website.</li><li>Install it and sign in with your Google account (or create a free Anthropic account).</li><li>Once installed, open Claude Desktop and ensure it’s running.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Configure the File System MCP</strong></p><p>To connect Claude to your file system, you need to configure the MCP server. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>1. Open Claude Desktop Settings:</strong></p><ul><li>Click the three-dot menu in Claude Desktop.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config</strong>.</li><li>This opens the <strong>claude_desktop_config.json</strong> file in your default editor (e.g., Notepad++ or VS Code).</li></ul><p><strong>2.  Add the File System MCP Server Configuration:</strong>\nReplace the existing config with the following JSON, updating the paths to match your system. For example, I’ll use the Downloads folder for a user named “John” on Windows.</p><div><pre><code>{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\",\n        \"C:\\\\Users\\\\John\\\\Downloads\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>command: \"\": Uses NPX to run the MCP server.</li><li>: Specifies the MCP server package (@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem) and the directory to access ().</li><li>Replace  with the path to your desired folder (e.g., <strong>/Users/username/Downloads on macOS</strong>).</li></ul><ul><li>Save the <strong>claude_desktop_config.json</strong> file (Ctrl+S).</li><li>Close Claude Desktop completely (right-click the tray icon and select Quit).</li><li>Reopen Claude Desktop. It may take a moment to start the MCP server.</li></ul><p><strong>4.  Verify the MCP Server:</strong></p><p>Go back to  in Claude Desktop.</p><p>You should see a new File System MCP server listed. If it says “,” double-check your config file paths or restart Claude.</p><p>Let’s test the MCP server by asking Claude to list the files in your Downloads folder.</p><div><pre><code>List all files in my Downloads folder.\n</code></pre></div><p>Claude will execute a command via the MCP server and return a list of files, like:</p><p><em>[FILE] image.jpg\n[FILE] document.txt</em></p><p>If you see this, ! Your MCP server is working.</p><p>*<em>Practical Example: Organize Your Downloads Folder\n*</em>\nNow, let’s use the MCP server to organize your Downloads folder by file type, just like I described earlier. Here’s a sample prompt and what happens behind the scenes.</p><div><pre><code>Analyze all files in my Downloads folder. Create separate folders for each file type (e.g., Images, Text, Audio, System) and move the files into their respective folders.\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Analyzes Files: Claude scans the Downloads folder and identifies file types based on extensions (e.g., .jpg for images, .txt for text, .mp3 for audio).</li><li>Creates Folders: It creates directories like Images, Text, Audio, and System using the create_directory tool.</li><li>Moves Files: It uses the move_file tool to relocate each file to its corresponding folder.</li><li>Confirms Success: Claude notifies you when the task is complete.</li></ul><p>After running the prompt, your Downloads folder might look like this:</p><div><pre><code>Downloads/\n├── Images/\n│   └── image.jpg\n├── Text/\n│   └── document.txt\n├── Audio/\n│   └── song.mp3\n├── System/\n│   └── setup.exe\n\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Advanced Example: Create a Summary File</strong></p><p>Let’s try something more advanced. Suppose you want Claude to research AI news from May 2025 and create a text file with links and descriptions.</p><div><pre><code>Collect all AI news from May 2025, including links and a few lines of description for each. Create a text file in my Downloads folder named \"AI_News_May_2025.txt\" with the results.\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>1. Claude searches the web for AI news from May 2025 (using its DeepSearch mode, if enabled).</li><li>2. It compiles a list of articles with links and summaries.</li><li>3. It uses the write_file tool to create AI_News_May_2025.txt in your Downloads folder.</li></ul><div><pre><code>AI News - May 2025\n\n1. NotebookLM by Google\n   - Link: https://example.com/notebooklm\n   - Description: Google released an updated NotebookLM with enhanced AI capabilities for research and note-taking.\n\n2. Veo by xAI\n   - Link: https://example.com/veo\n   - Description: xAI's Veo video generator now supports real-time video creation with improved quality.\n\n3. Alpha Evolve by Google\n   - Link: https://example.com/alpha-evolve\n   - Description: Google’s new AI subscription model, Alpha Evolve, offers advanced features for developers.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>You’ll see _ _pop up in your Downloads folder, ready to use.</p><ul><li> When using the edit_file tool, enable dryRun: true to preview changes before applying them.</li><li> Only grant Claude access to specific folders (e.g., Downloads) to avoid accidental changes to critical files.</li><li> If Claude prompts for access, select “Allow Always” for seamless operation, but be cautious with sensitive directories.</li></ul><p>Explore Other MCP Servers: The File System MCP is just one option. Check out servers for Amazon S3, Gmail, or Stripe for more integrations.</p><ul><li> Ensure your claude_desktop_config.json paths are correct and Node.js is installed.</li><li> Check if Claude has access to the specified directory. On Windows, run Claude Desktop as an administrator if needed.</li><li> Verify Node.js installation with node --version. Reinstall if necessary.</li></ul><p>The Claude File System MCP is a powerful tool for automating file management with AI. Whether you’re organizing your Downloads folder, creating summary files, or integrating with other services, MCP makes it incredibly easy. Plus, it’s free and open-source, so you can experiment and build your own integrations.</p><p>Want to dive deeper?

As someone who has been following its development closely, I can attest to the remarkable improvements in this version. The system's microkernel architecture not only enhances security but also provides unprecedented flexibility in cross-device collaboration. What excites me most about HarmonyOS 5 is its focus on developer experience - the new ArkTS language, enhanced UI components, and improved debugging tools have made development much more efficient. The distributed capabilities allow us to create truly seamless experiences across different devices, from smartphones to tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices.</p><p>I am a dedicated HarmonyOS developer based in China, with over three years of experience in the ecosystem. My journey with HarmonyOS began with its early versions, and I've witnessed its remarkable evolution. As a developer who has contributed to several open-source HarmonyOS projects, I've gained valuable insights into its architecture and best practices. I'm particularly passionate about real-time communication and distributed applications, which led me to explore WebSocket implementations in HarmonyOS 5. Through my blog and GitHub repositories, I've been sharing my experiences and helping other developers navigate the exciting world of HarmonyOS development.</p><p>PDFs are everywhere in dev work. My first time dealing with PDF features was when a colleague asked me to help with a contract preview. I was totally lost and hit a bunch of snags. But after using HarmonyOS PDF Kit for a while, I found it pretty handy—editing, previewing, adding annotations, you name it. Most dev needs are covered.</p><p>This note is meant as a \"pitfall guide\" for those who come after me, and a record of the little traps and lessons I picked up. If you use PDF Kit, I hope you'll take fewer detours and have a bit more fun.</p><p>HarmonyOS PDF Kit gives you a bunch of PDF document handling features, with two main modules:  and .</p><ul><li>: For loading, saving, and editing PDFs—add text, images, annotations, headers/footers, watermarks, backgrounds, bookmarks, encryption/decryption, and more.</li><li>: For previewing PDFs, page navigation, zooming, keyword search, highlighting, annotations, etc.</li></ul><p>Sometimes, all it takes is a product manager saying, \"Can we add PDF annotations?\" and you have to dig through the API from scratch. Don't panic—these examples and stories are all from my real-world experience.</p><p>For more examples, check out the official CodeLab and SampleCode (or just poke around and see what breaks).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Can Each Module Do? (A Not-So-Official Comparison)\n</h2><p>Let's be honest: pdfService and PdfView each have their own superpowers. Here's my not-so-official, developer-style rundown:</p><ul><li>Opening and saving documents? Both can do it, no sweat.</li><li>Releasing documents? Both handle it, so no memory leaks to worry about.</li><li>PDF to image? Both can, though I rarely use it.</li><li>Annotations? Both can add and remove them—whatever the product wants.</li><li>Bookmarks? pdfService can manage them, PdfView can't.</li><li>Adding/removing PDF pages, text, images, watermarks, headers/footers? pdfService does it all; PdfView just sticks to previewing.</li><li>Checking if a PDF is encrypted or decrypting? pdfService can do it, PdfView just watches.</li><li>Preview, search, event callbacks? That's PdfView's turf—pdfService doesn't get involved.</li></ul><p>Bottom line: pdfService is the \"hands-on\" type—edit, add, delete, whatever. PdfView is more of a \"viewer\"—great for previewing, flipping pages, searching, and annotating. In real development, just use whichever feels right. Don't get stuck in the API docs—try, fail, and you'll get it.</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes I wish pdfService and PdfView could merge, so I wouldn't have to switch back and forth. But for now, they each do their own thing—just roll with it.</p></blockquote><ul><li>: Mainland China only (not including Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan).</li><li>: Real devices only (Phone, Tablet, PC/2in1). Emulators are not supported.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Opening and Saving PDF Documents (How I Usually Do It)\n</h2><ul><li>For editing PDF content, use .</li><li>For preview, search, or event listening, use .</li></ul><ul><li><code>loadDocument(path: string, password?: string, onProgress?: Callback&lt;number&gt;): ParseResult</code> — Load a PDF.</li><li><code>saveDocument(path: string, onProgress?: Callback&lt;number&gt;): boolean</code> — Save a PDF.</li></ul><p>A little story:\nThe first time I did a \"Save As\" feature, I got nothing when I clicked the button. Turns out, I mixed up the sandbox and resource paths—don't try to write a PDF to a read-only directory!</p><p>Here's how I did it (and it finally worked):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Adding and Deleting PDF Pages (Yes, You'll Need This)\n</h2><ul><li>Supports inserting blank pages, merging pages from other PDFs, and deleting specific pages.</li></ul><ul><li><code>insertBlankPage(index, width, height)</code> — Insert a blank page.</li><li> — Get a page object.</li><li><code>insertPageFromDocument(document, fromIndex, pageCount, index)</code> — Merge pages from another document.</li><li> — Delete pages.</li></ul><p>A quick anecdote:\nA tester once asked, \"Why are all the inserted pages at the end?\" Turns out, I misunderstood the index parameter. Get the insert position right, or the user experience will be weird.</p><p>Here's a code snippet (don't copy-paste blindly, tweak as needed):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Previewing PDF Documents (Don't Skip This)\n</h2><ul><li>Supports page navigation, zoom, single/double-page display, fit modes, scrolling, search, annotations, and more.</li><li>Make sure the PDF file is in the sandbox directory.</li></ul><p>Dev thoughts:\nWhen previewing PDFs, the worst is \"slow loading\" or \"laggy page turns.\" I recommend using event callbacks and adding a loading animation for users—it makes a big difference.</p><p>Here's what worked for me:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced PdfView Usage (A Few More Tricks)\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Asynchronous Opening and Saving (Promise Style)\n</h3><p>A little story:\nOnce, I had a huge file and the UI just froze when saving.

Projetos e mais projetos são desenvolvidos baseados nesse estilo arquitetural, mas será que realmente entendemos o que Roy Fielding estava pensando quando o definiu? Neste post, vamos revisar o artigo original e entender o real papel do REST dentro da web e como ele se conecta com as aplicações que desenvolvemos.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  O Escopo da Arquitetura REST\n</h2><p>O primeiro ponto importante é entender que REST foi pensado para arquiteturas em nível de aplicação, não apenas de rede. Isso significa que REST se preocupa com o contexto de cada requisição: Por que ela está sendo feita? Devemos fazer cache? Qual o melhor formato de resposta? É diferente de arquiteturas focadas apenas em rede, cujo único objetivo é levar bits de um ponto a outro.</p><p>Roy Fielding utilizou insights de diversas outras arquiteturas de rede para compor o REST. Ele nunca poderia ter criado o REST se não fosse um especialista em arquiteturas de sistemas distribuídos e protocolos de rede, conhecendo profundamente a web e seus desafios naquela época.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Escalabilidade Anárquica: O Desafio da Web\n</h2><p>Um conceito fundamental introduzido é o de \"escalabilidade anárquica\". Fielding percebeu que uma arquitetura pensada para a web não poderia prever qual seria a carga de requisições em determinado momento. A web crescia exponencialmente e qualquer arquitetura proposta precisava suportar essa imprevisibilidade.</p><p>A web foi vítima do seu próprio sucesso. As primeiras versões do HTTP não imaginavam que uma página precisaria de múltiplas requisições para ser exibida - pensava-se em documentos de texto simples. Mas rapidamente as páginas passaram a incluir imagens, scripts e outros recursos, exigindo uma evolução dos protocolos.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Definição Formal de REST\n</h2><p>REST (Representational State Transfer) foi desenvolvido pensando na web moderna e no futuro. A definição formal é clara: \"REST é um estilo híbrido derivado de várias arquiteturas de rede combinado com restrições adicionais que definem um conector de interface uniforme\".</p><p>É importante notar que o protocolo HTTP foi inspirado pelo estilo arquitetural REST, não o contrário. A versão 1.1 do HTTP foi criada usando REST como base arquitetural.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  As Restrições Fundamentais do REST\n</h2><p>A primeira restrição é suportar o modelo cliente-servidor. O cliente é responsável pela interface do usuário, enquanto o servidor mantém os dados. Isso permite que ambos evoluam independentemente.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Stateless (Sem Estado)\n</h3><p>Toda requisição deve levar todas as informações necessárias para ser processada. Isso é crucial para escalabilidade, pois elimina estado compartilhado entre servidores e facilita o monitoramento (visibility) das requisições.</p><p>O cache é fundamental para performance. Servidores devem informar nas respostas se e por quanto tempo elas podem ser cacheadas. Clientes podem então decidir se usam essas informações para evitar requisições desnecessárias.</p><p>Esta é a característica que diferencia REST de outros estilos arquiteturais. REST define uma forma uniforme de comunicação que suporta diversos tipos de dados (JSON, XML, HTML, imagens, etc.) com seus respectivos metadados.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Sistema em Camadas (Layered System)\n</h3><p>A arquitetura deve suportar múltiplas camadas intermediárias entre cliente e servidor. Cada camada só conhece a camada adjacente, criando proteção contra mudanças e possibilitando cache compartilhado.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. Código sob Demanda (Code on Demand)\n</h3><p>O cliente deve ser capaz de executar código que não foi escrito por ele. O navegador é o exemplo perfeito: executa JavaScript recebido dos servidores, com infraestrutura para detectar código malicioso e proteger o usuário.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  O Navegador: A Única Aplicação Verdadeiramente REST\n</h2><p>Ao analisar as aplicações modernas, percebemos que apenas o navegador implementa completamente os conceitos REST:</p><ul><li>Executa código sob demanda</li><li>Evolui independentemente dos servidores</li><li>Adapta-se a mudanças de contrato automaticamente</li><li>Implementa cache baseado em headers HTTP</li><li>Detecta código malicioso e protege o usuário</li><li>Gerencia redirecionamentos automaticamente</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Especificamente sobre Cache\n</h2><p>A estratégia de cache descrita no artigo é um recurso que poderia ser bem mais utilizado. A minha observação me diz que a maioria das aplicações usam os recursos de cache dentro apenas do próprio serviço de backend e através de CDN's e afins para facilitarem o consumo do navegador. </p><p>Por exemplo, pensando em serviços distribuídos do lado do backend, quase nunca vemos um serviço B definindo um header de cache e o serviço A respeitar o cache a partir do consumo dessa informação, que é justamente o que o navegador faz. </p><p>Esta é uma ideia que está lá escrita faz tempo e fornece o caminho para implementarmos uma ideia básica: A melhor requisição é aquela que nunca é feita. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Realidade das Aplicações Modernas\n</h2><p>O ano é 2025 e várias das aplicações ainda ficam ultra focadas na interface uniforme, se preocupando com verbos e content-types. </p><p>Para mim as principais inspirações são: Seja stateless o máximo que conseguir, faça com que seus endpoints utilizem headers que possam guiar o comportamento do cliente e, por fim, faça clientes inspirados no navegador. </p><p>REST é um estilo arquitetural que considero excepcional e foi pensado para resolver problemas de escala planetária. Entender seus princípios é importante e pode ser bem inspirador. </p><p>Se você gostou deste conteúdo, conheça a Jornada Dev + Eficiente, nosso treinamento focado em fazer com que você se torne uma pessoa cada vez mais capaz de entregar software que gera valor na ponta final, com máximo de qualidade e eficiência.</p>","contentLength":5800,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bridged Networking on Fedora Workstation for Virtual Machines","url":"https://dev.to/kubenetic/bridged-networking-on-fedora-workstation-for-virtual-machines-5d51","date":1751276537,"author":"Miklos Halasz","guid":176499,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When running virtual machines on Fedora Workstation, one common requirement is allowing them to communicate directly with your local network (LAN)—as if they were physical machines. The default NAT-based networking isolates them, which is fine for outbound traffic, but insufficient when inbound access or LAN integration is needed.</p><p>This post walks through setting up a  using , explains what’s going on behind the scenes, and introduces key networking concepts like bridge slaves and virtual routing bridges (VRBs). If you're using KVM, QEMU, or libvirt for virtualization, this is essential knowledge.</p><p>I had VMs running on Fedora 42, and I wanted them to:</p><ul><li>Get an IP address from my home DHCP server (like other devices on the LAN)</li><li>Be accessible via their own IP addresses from any other machine on the network</li><li>Act like any other physical device in the network</li></ul><p>To achieve this, I needed , which effectively connects the VM to the same Layer 2 network as the host’s physical Ethernet.</p><p>Here’s what I ran to set up the bridge using :</p><div><pre><code>nmcli connection delete localan\nnmcli con add ifname br0 bridge autoconnect con-name br0 ipv4.method auto\nnmcli con add bridge-slave autoconnect con-name br-slave-eno1 ifname eno1 master br0\nnmcli connection up br0\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>Delete the old connection managing the physical interface (eno1)</li><li>Create a new bridge interface named br0</li><li>Attach eno1 to the bridge as a slave</li></ol><p>Once complete, I configured my virtual machines to use br0 as their network interface.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Was the Existing Connection Deleted?\n</h3><p>The default profile () was already managing eno1. NetworkManager does not allow a device to be controlled by multiple profiles simultaneously. Before you can enslave a physical interface to a bridge, it must be released from any existing configuration.</p><p>This is a critical step. Without removing the existing connection, adding  to the bridge would fail.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is a Bridge Interface?\n</h2><p>A bridge interface acts like a virtual switch at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer). It connects multiple network interfaces and forwards Ethernet frames between them.</p><ul><li> acts like a virtual switch.</li><li>The physical NIC () is a port on that switch.</li><li>Virtual machines are plugged into the same switch, gaining full LAN access.</li></ul><p>The bridge itself is the only interface that receives an IP address. The physical NIC becomes a passive conduit—passing traffic between the bridge and the network.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Does \"Controller Waiting for Ports\" Mean?\n</h3><p>When activating the bridge, NetworkManager returned:</p><div><pre><code>nmcli connection up br0\nConnection successfully activated controller waiting portsD-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/25</code></pre></div><p>This message means that  is active but waiting for its slave interfaces (like ) to become fully ready—i.e., for link negotiation to complete. It’s typically harmless and resolves within seconds.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Are Bridge Slaves and Why Are They Needed?\n</h3><p>Any device added to a bridge is called a slave. Slaves pass data to and from the bridge but no longer operate independently.</p><p>In our case,  became a bridge slave of br0. This means:</p><ul><li>It no longer gets its own IP address.</li><li>It merely passes packets between the bridge and the physical network.</li><li>All IP configuration is now handled by the bridge (br0).</li></ul><p>This setup allows your virtual machines, which are also connected to the bridge, to be treated like independent physical devices on the network.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why a Bridge Is Needed for VM LAN Access\n</h3><p>By default, virtualization platforms like  configure VMs with NAT-based networking. This allows VMs to access the internet but keeps them isolated from the LAN.</p><p>To make a VM accessible from other devices on your network—via ping, SSH, or services—you need a bridge. It gives the VM a direct Layer 2 path to the LAN, enabling:</p><ul><li>IP address assignment from the LAN’s DHCP server</li><li>Direct access to and from any device on the LAN</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?\n</h3><p>Here’s a high-level overview:</p><ol><li>Bridge creation (br0) defines a virtual switch.</li><li>Physical NIC (eno1) is enslaved to br0, losing its own IP.</li><li>Bridge gets an IP address and becomes the primary network device.</li><li>VMs are connected to br0, making them peers on the LAN.</li></ol><p>Linux handles the bridging logic via kernel modules. NetworkManager coordinates the configuration, making  a powerful and reliable tool for managing this setup.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Quick Word on Virtual Routing Bridges (VRB)\n</h2><p>A Virtual Routing Bridge (VRB) is a more advanced networking concept used in cloud or SDN environments. Unlike a standard bridge that only operates at Layer 2, a VRB combines Layer 2 bridging with Layer 3 routing.</p><ul><li>Route between VLANs or subnets</li><li>Apply policies and firewall rules</li><li>Act as both a switch and a router</li></ul><p>VRBs are used in complex setups like OpenStack or Kubernetes CNI plugins. For most homelab or desktop VM scenarios, a standard Linux bridge is simpler, faster, and entirely sufficient.</p><p>Setting up bridged networking on Fedora using  is a clean and efficient way to allow VMs to function as full citizens of your LAN. Once configured, it just works—and avoids the limitations of NAT-based networking.</p><p>Whether you're running development servers, containers, or full VM stacks, understanding Linux bridges is essential knowledge for any modern Linux user managing a virtualized environment.</p>","contentLength":5270,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/hadil/-36j9","date":1751276398,"author":"Hadil Ben Abdallah","guid":176498,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>💻 10 Genius Technical Projects That Can 10x Your Resume in 2025 💼</h2><h3>Hadil Ben Abdallah for Final Round AI ・ Jun 27</h3>","contentLength":119,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Lightning-Fast, Minimal AI/API Serverless Deployment: The Essence and Practice of Mastra Lambda Docker Deploy","url":"https://dev.to/hayata_yamamoto/lightning-fast-minimal-aiapi-serverless-deployment-the-essence-and-practice-of-mastra-lambda-kjk","date":1751274000,"author":"hayata-yamamoto","guid":176464,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The need to “take machine learning and AI to production” or to rapidly prototype and roll out new API services is growing stronger, not just in startups but also across established enterprises.

The Hidden Pitfalls of Conventional Serverless &amp; AI Deployments\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Typical Existing Patterns\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Lambda Native Runtimes (Node.js/Python):</strong> Deployment is simple, but you’re boxed in by runtime/library/version limitations and native dependencies.</li><li><strong>Serverless Frameworks, SAM:</strong> Powerful but potentially overwhelming, especially with YML files, complex settings, and operational overhead.</li><li> Extend runtimes flexibly, but managing API Gateway, IAM, and layers can be arcane and difficult to automate.</li><li> Flexible, but requires significant effort to “make it Lambda-ready” and can still miss vital optimizations.</li></ul><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Mastra Lambda Docker Deploy</td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul><li>Most methods require you to refactor your core app for “serverless compatibility”—API routing, handlers, and execution semantics.</li><li>Infrastructure settings (API Gateway rules, timeouts, IAM roles) become a manual, tribal process—hard to reproduce, risky to maintain.</li><li>Managing secrets (API keys), third-party integrations (OpenAI, weather APIs), and runtime environments safely is cumbersome.</li><li>Even in the “Kubernetes era,” you still end up missing DevOps/SRE leverage for Lambda and similar platforms.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. How Mastra Lambda Docker Deploy Solves It\n</h2><ul><li>Write your app as a standard HTTP server (Node.js Express, Python FastAPI... anything HTTP).</li><li>Add a single line with “Lambda Web Adapter” in your Dockerfile—now your code is instantly serverless, with no app changes.</li><li>Configure everything via , including OpenAI keys and database URLs, making credentials management simple and secure.</li><li>Multi-stage Docker builds create small, production-grade images with zero root privileges.</li><li>All Lambda operational quirks—security, ports, execution roles—are handled for you.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Lambda Web Adapter (How It Works)\n</h3><div><pre><code>  COPY --from=public.ecr.aws/awsguru/aws-lambda-adapter:0.9.0 /lambda-adapter /opt/extensions/lambda-adapter\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>With this, every Lambda event/API Gateway request is automatically converted into HTTP and proxied to your app.</li><li>Your application runs identically both locally and on Lambda. “Lift and shift” without headaches.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Maximum Freedom—Any Tech Stack\n</h3><ul><li>Not just Node.js/TypeScript: Python, Go, Rust… any language/framework that can act as an HTTP server can run on Lambda.</li><li>Out-of-the-box OpenAI and weather API integration, with patterns you can adapt for other AI workloads.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  5.

Why Roles &amp; Permissions Matter\n</h2><ol><li>Better User Experience: Show only what’s relevant. Users aren’t overwhelmed with irrelevant features.</li><li>Security &amp; Compliance: Minimize accidental or malicious access.</li><li>Cleaner Code: Centralize permission checks; no more copy-paste checks scattered everywhere.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Frontend Implementation: Hiding UI Elements\n</h2><p>Imagine a React app where certain features (like “Delete User” or “Edit Billing”) are visible only to specific roles. We can use the Strategy Pattern to decide at runtime which set of permissions apply:</p><div><pre><code>// strategy/permissionStrategies.js\n\n// [Strategy Pattern] Each strategy defines a permission set for a specific role.\nexport const adminPermissions = {\n  canDeleteUser: true,\n  canEditBilling: true,\n  canViewAnalytics: true\n};\n\nexport const managerPermissions = {\n  canDeleteUser: false,\n  canEditBilling: true,\n  canViewAnalytics: true\n};\n\nexport const userPermissions = {\n  canDeleteUser: false,\n  canEditBilling: false,\n  canViewAnalytics: true\n};\n\n// A helper to get the right strategy object for the current user role\nexport const getPermissions = (role) =&gt; {\n  switch (role) {\n    case \"admin\":\n      return adminPermissions;\n    case \"manager\":\n      return managerPermissions;\n    default:\n      return userPermissions;\n  }\n};\n\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>// components/FeatureButton.jsx\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { getPermissions } from \"../strategy/permissionStrategies\";\n\nfunction FeatureButton({ role, feature, onClick, children }) {\n  const perms = getPermissions(role);\n\n  // Only render button if user has the correct permission\n  if (!perms[feature]) return null;\n\n  return (\n    &lt;button\n      onClick={onClick}\n      className=\"p-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-600\"\n    &gt;\n      {children}\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nexport default FeatureButton;\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Strategy Objects (adminPermissions, managerPermissions, userPermissions) define capabilities per role.</li><li>In the component, we lookup permissions based on the user role at runtime.</li><li>If the user cannot perform the feature, we simply don’t render the button.</li></ul><ul><li>Keeps UI logic simple—no big if-else blocks in every component.</li><li>Centralizes permission definitions for easy future updates.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Backend Implementation: Enforcing Access\n</h2><p>Hiding UI elements is good, but server-side checks are crucial. Otherwise, a savvy user could still call APIs directly. Let’s implement a Strategy Pattern in Node.js (Express):</p><div><pre><code>\n// controllers/permissionStrategyController.js\n\n// [Strategy Pattern] Each strategy defines backend logic for handling roles differently.\nconst adminStrategy = {\n  canDeleteUser: () =&gt; true,\n  canEditBilling: () =&gt; true,\n  canViewAnalytics: () =&gt; true,\n};\n\nconst managerStrategy = {\n  canDeleteUser: () =&gt; false,\n  canEditBilling: () =&gt; true,\n  canViewAnalytics: () =&gt; true,\n};\n\nconst userStrategy = {\n  canDeleteUser: () =&gt; false,\n  canEditBilling: () =&gt; false,\n  canViewAnalytics: () =&gt; true,\n};\n\nfunction getBackendStrategy(role) {\n  switch (role) {\n    case \"admin\":\n      return adminStrategy;\n    case \"manager\":\n      return managerStrategy;\n    default:\n      return userStrategy;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example: Deleting a user in the backend\nexports.deleteUser = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const { userRole } = req.body; // e.g., 'admin', 'manager', 'user'\n  const strategy = getBackendStrategy(userRole);\n\n  if (!strategy.canDeleteUser()) {\n    return res.status(403).json({ error: \"Unauthorized action\" });\n  }\n\n  // Proceed with deletion...\n  // ...\n  return res.json({ message: \"User deleted successfully\" });\n};\n\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Strategy Pattern: Each role has an object that encapsulates its capabilities.</li><li>Centralized logic: All permissions are in one place, preventing accidental oversights.</li><li>Consistent with Frontend: If the UI hides a feature, the backend also rejects it if requested directly.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Why This Makes a Great Product Feature\n</h2><ul><li>User-Centric: Restricting the UI to relevant features improves usability.</li><li>Security: Minimizes potential abuse or accidental misuse by ensuring checks at both the frontend and backend.</li><li>Extensibility: Adding a new role (e.g., supervisor) is as simple as adding another strategy. No rewriting everywhere else.</li><li>Maintainability: Developers quickly find and update permission rules without wading through scattered checks.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Areas for Improvement &amp; Best Practices\n</h2><ul><li>Database Storage: Instead of hardcoding, store roles &amp; permissions in a database.</li><li>JWT / Session Management: Ensure user roles in requests are validated (e.g., via tokens).</li><li>Caching: Caching permission sets for frequent lookups can boost performance.</li><li>Logging &amp; Auditing: Keep track of role changes or permission overrides for compliance.</li><li>Test Coverage: Unit tests for each strategy ensure no accidental changes break permissions.</li></ul><p>\nRoles and permissions might seem trivial until your product hits scale or faces security issues. By aligning frontend UI checks with backend server enforcement, using a Strategy Pattern, you keep your code organized, your product safe, and your users happy.</p><p>Feel free to adapt this approach to suit your stack—just don’t forget that a well-thought-out permissions system is a massive competitive advantage in any tech product.</p><p>\nIf you found this helpful, share your own roles/permissions tips in the comments and let’s learn together.</p>","contentLength":5770,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How To Integrate A Distributed Cache For Payment Lookups","url":"https://dev.to/flutterwaveeng/how-to-integrate-a-distributed-cache-for-payment-lookups-3g3d","date":1751273676,"author":"uma victor","guid":176461,"unread":true,"content":"<p>You know that moment when customers start hammering your \"Check Payment Status\" button during a flash sale?

Using <a href=\"https://redis.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Redis</a> and real-world examples with <a href=\"https://www.flutterwave.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flutterwave</a> integration, you'll gain the knowledge to handle peak transaction loads without breaking a sweat.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is Distributed Caching?\n</h2><p>A distributed data cache works by spreading your data across multiple servers, or multiple nodes, instead of being constrained by the memory limits of a single machine. This in-memory storage approach is like having checkout lanes at every entrance of a store, helping to reduce network traffic and latency by serving frequently accessed data from a location closer to the user.</p><p>In a payment system, this means your transaction data, user session data, and API responses are stored across several cache servers. When one server goes down or gets overloaded, the others keep serving requests. More importantly, you can scale your cache capacity by adding more servers. </p><p>While traditional single-server caching can be scaled vertically (adding more RAM/CPU to the existing server), it has capacity limits that distributed caching overcomes.</p><p>Here is an example of a single server cache (all data on one Redis instance):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Distributed vs. Single-Server Caching: Why It Matters for Payments\n</h2><p>Regular caching works fine for small applications, but payment systems have different requirements:</p><p><strong>Normal Caching Limitations</strong></p><ul><li>: If your cache server crashes, all cached data disappears.</li><li>: You're stuck with whatever RAM one server has.</li><li>: Users far from your cache server get slower responses.</li><li>: All cache requests hit one server.</li></ul><p><strong>Distributed Caching Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>: With data distributed across multiple servers, the system remains operational and accessible even if one or more servers experience issues. </li><li>: Add more servers when you need more capacity.</li><li>: Cache servers are closer to users.</li><li>: Requests are spread across multiple servers.</li></ul><p>These differences are critical for payment systems processing thousands of transactions per minute. A single cache server might handle 10,000 requests per second, but a distributed cache can handle 100,000+ by spreading the load.</p><p>For example, all data is directed to a single cache in a standard caching setup. In contrast, with distributed caching, the data is automatically spread across multiple nodes by the caching system (like Redis Cluster). This distribution also means that if one cache server in the cluster (e.g., ) becomes unavailable, the data remains accessible from the other active servers (e.g.,  and ).</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Architecting Your Redis Cache for Payment Lookups\n</h2><p>Your distributed Redis cache sits as an application-level layer between your business logic and your source database. This distributed architecture is designed to intercept data requests before they hit your primary data stores.</p><p><strong>Where Does the Cache Fit?</strong>\nYour distributed cache sits as an application-level layer between your business logic and your data sources. In payment systems, you typically have one of two scenarios.</p><p><strong>Caching Database Queries:</strong> When you store payment data locally (for example, when you save data from the payment gateway into your own database for record-keeping or analysis). The cache intercepts requests before they hit Flutterwave's API, reducing external calls and improving response times. This is important for your Flutterwave integration because you're working within our <a href=\"https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/rate-limit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rate limits</a> and you want to minimize network dependencies.</p><p><strong>Caching External API Responses:</strong> When your payment service is your primary source of truth:</p><p>Here's how this looks in a typical payment verification flow for :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Caching Patterns and Advanced Data Structures in Redis\n</h2><p>Different caching patterns work better for different types of payment data. Let's look at the patterns that matter most for payment integration.</p><p><strong>Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)</strong><strong>Best for payment API Calls</strong>\nThe Cache-Aside or Lazy Loading pattern is a common caching strategy where the application code manages the cache. When data is requested, the application first checks if it's available in the cache. If it's a  it's returned directly. If it's a  the application retrieves the data from the primary data source (e.g., a database or an external API like Flutterwave), stores a copy in the cache for future requests, and then returns it to the requester.</p><p>This is your go-to pattern for caching your payment service responses. Your application controls the cache completely.</p><p>Here's how to implement the three-step cache-aside flow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This implementation is ideal for <a href=\"https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference/introduction-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flutterwave API</a> responses, transaction lookups, customer data, and any other external API call.</p><p>\nIn the Read-Through caching pattern, the cache fetches data from the underlying data source when a cache miss occurs. The application interacts with the cache as if it were the main data source. If the requested data is in the cache, it's returned. If not, the cache provider or a library abstracting it retrieves the data from the database, stores it in the cache, and then returns it to the application.</p><p>The read-through pattern is useful when you have local payment data. This pattern encapsulates the cache logic within your data access layer. Below is an example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This implementation is ideal when you have frequently accessed local payment data that's expensive to query.</p><p><strong>For Critical Payment State</strong>\nThe Write-Through caching pattern ensures data consistency by writing data to both the cache and the underlying data source simultaneously (or in very close succession as part of a single logical operation). When the application writes data, the operation is considered complete only after the data has been successfully written to both the cache and the database.</p><p>Use this when you need absolute consistency between the cache and the database. Both operations happen synchronously to prevent data inconsistency:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is mostly used for internal payment state, which must stay consistent, like order fulfillment status.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Do You Identify What Payment Data To Cache?\n</h2><p>Not all data is worth caching. An effective caching solution prioritizes frequently accessed data that is expensive to fetch from its source and is acceptable to be slightly stale. These are often your most frequently accessed data sets. Let’s look at some places you should add a cache during payment integrations.</p><p><strong>Transaction Verification Responses</strong>\nTransaction verification is likely your most expensive operation, as it involves communicating with the payment gateway API, and customers frequently check these transactions. </p><p>Below is an example code that caches the essential data from the Flutterwave verify response:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Caching the transaction verification responses helps because customers refresh payment pages constantly. A single transaction might be verified 50+ times. Caching saves those API calls and improves response time from 200ms to 5ms.</p><p><strong>2. Terminal Payment Statuses (</strong>\nOnce a payment is complete, its status rarely changes. These are perfect for long-term caching. </p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>80% of transactions end up in terminal states. By caching these long-term, you eliminate recurring API calls for completed payments.</p><p><strong>3. Customer Payment Profiles</strong>\nInformation such as customer profiles from Flutterwave is often used during checkout for personalization, but the data itself doesn't change significantly. Here is an example code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Customer checkout flows access this data multiple times. Caching eliminates redundant API calls during the payment process.</p><p>Let's get into the practical details of implementing your cache layer. This includes designing cache keys, handling serialization, and setting the right TTL values for different types of payment data.</p><p><strong>Designing Effective Cache Keys</strong>\nCache keys are like file paths; they need to be unique, organized, and meaningful. Poor key design can lead to collisions, debugging nightmares, and inefficient cache usage.</p><p>Here are some cache key design principles to follow for good cache usage:</p><ul><li>Use a hierarchical structure with prefixes.</li><li>Include all necessary identifiers.</li><li>Keep keys readable and debuggable.</li><li>Handle multi-tenancy properly.</li></ul><p>Here is an example of how to do this when you use Flutterwave as your payment provider. The cache key should follow the pattern of  <code>{service}:{version}:{entity}:{id}:{attribute}</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Data Serialization and Storage</strong>\nRedis stores everything as strings, so you need to serialize your JavaScript objects. The choice of serialization format affects performance, storage size, and compatibility.</p><p>Here is an example using JSON:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here is an example using Redis Hash for complex Objects:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nTTL (Time To Live) determines how long data stays in cache. For payment data, TTL should reflect how likely the data is to change.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Using a smart TTL strategy ensures that volatile data is refreshed quickly, while stable data remains in the cache for longer, thereby optimizing performance and data consistency.</p><p>Distributed caching transforms payment systems from database-bound bottlenecks into lightning-fast APIs that can handle serious traffic. Start by caching your most frequently accessed lookups (such as transaction status and customer validation), measuring the impact, and then expanding to other operations. Your database will thank you, your customers will notice faster responses, and you'll sleep better during traffic spikes.</p><p>Want to dive deeper into payment system optimization?

In my ecommerce role, I frequently edited HTML email templates, adjusted landing pages, and troubleshooted user and website/app issues - which made me realise how much I enjoyed those technical moments. However, like many people juggling a full-time job, it was difficult to dedicate consistent, meaningful time to learning development when I was exhausted from work.</p><p>It wasn’t until my role shifted to being 100% marketing-focused that I truly noticed what was missing. I found myself getting unusually excited when asked to help troubleshoot a Zoom issue or contribute to a technical problem. Those small moments reminded me how much I enjoyed working with technology and solving problems.</p><p>I took part in a Code First Girls Kickstarter Web Development course to jog my memory on the coding I had already learned. I eventually presented my solo project, Dish Diaries, which was met with lovely feedback from other students and recognition as a Highly Commended Candidate. This was a big confidence boost and encouraged me to pursue learning more frontend development.</p><p>After my marketing role was made redundant, I decided it was time to focus on my long-term goal of becoming a frontend developer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Some key things I've learned this year\n</h2><p>I’m fortunate to have been in a position where I could take a step back and dedicate focused time to learning frontend development. Over the past year, I’ve built projects, learned new tools, languages, and frameworks, and spent countless hours navigating the frustrations and wins that come with learning web development.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Consistency beats intensity.</strong> Short, regular learning sessions have done more for my progress than occasional long marathons. I found Scrimba’s Frontend Career Path especially helpful because each lesson is brief, and the instructors often encourage breaks to help soak in new information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build your own solo projects.</strong> Tutorials are a great starting point, but I’ve found working on solo projects forces you to problem-solve, apply what you’ve learned, and figure things out without step-by-step instructions. You can check out a few of my projects here or on my GitHub.</p></li><li><p><strong>The frontend ecosystem moves quickly.</strong> It can be overwhelming at times, but I focused on the core skills at first - HTML, CSS, JavaScript - before diving into frameworks such as React and more complicated topics like TypeScript. Having a solid foundation made it much easier to understand how frameworks work and why they’re so widely used.</p></li><li><p> I used to work in marketing at charity AbilityNet, which is where I first learned about the importance of creating inclusive, usable digital experiences. Since then, it’s something I’ve cared about deeply. There’s always more to learn, but I’m committed to making sure the websites and applications I build are accessible to everyone, and to continue growing my skills in this area.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI is great, but it’s not a replacement for doing the work yourself.</strong> I’ve always learned best by doing, and sometimes AI feels a bit like someone fixing a problem for you instead of showing you how to solve it. Simply copying and pasting an AI-generated solution into your project might get the job done, but it won’t help you build lasting skills. However, it’s incredibly helpful when used thoughtfully - like explaining a concept or providing tailored, interactive examples.</p></li></ul><p>I’m proud of the progress I’ve made, even though at times it feels like I’m standing still. Looking back at my first few projects is a good reminder of how far I’ve actually come. Over the next year, I plan to continue honing my skills, build more solo projects, delve into backend, contribute to open source projects, and hopefully land my first professional frontend development role.</p><p>If you’re reading this and also learning to code or considering a career switch, I hope this encourages you to keep going.

Commercial tools are eating up most of that growth, but open-source options are still in the game, especially for smaller businesses or those who love to tinker. So, are they doomed to stay niche, or can they step up?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Paid CMDB Discovery Tools Dominate the Market?\n</h2><p>Let’s be honest: Users are always looking for what’s best for their business, which means the CMDB discovery tools they choose should meet their exact needs, even more than users realize. Paid CMDB discovery tools must offer exceptional value to maintain such a stronghold in the market.</p><ul><li>: ServiceNow or BMC Helix aren’t just CMDBs, they’re full-blown ITSM platforms with automated discovery, AI analytics, and integrations for everything from cloud platforms to DevOps tools.</li><li>: Got a global company with thousands of servers across AWS, Azure, and on-prem data centers? Commercial tools handle that without breaking a sweat.</li><li>: Paid tools come with dedicated support teams, detailed guides, and training programs. If something goes wrong, you’ve got a lifeline. That’s a big deal for businesses that can’t afford downtime.</li><li>: Commercial vendors pour money into security patches, compliance certifications, and robust access controls. For industries like banking or healthcare, that’s non-negotiable.</li></ul><p>With all this going for them, it’s no wonder commercial tools dominate. They’re the safe bet for enterprises that need reliability and don’t mind paying for it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Where Open-Source CMDB Tools Fall Short\n</h2><p>Well, CMDB discovery tools open source have their limits, and those limits make it tough to compete. Here’s where they’re hitting roadblocks:</p><ul><li>: CMDB discovery tools open source are solid but don’t have the fancy AI or real-time analytics you’d find in commercial tools. They’re more basic, which can feel like a downgrade.</li><li>: If you’re a small or medium business, open-source tools like iTop or Ralph work fine. But for huge enterprises with sprawling IT environments? They often can’t keep up.</li><li>: Open-source code is out there for anyone to see, which is great for transparency but not so great if hackers find a vulnerability before the community patches it.</li><li>: Setting up something like CMDBuild takes serious know-how. You need to configure data models, tweak workflows, and maybe even write some code. Compare that to commercial tools, which are practically plug-and-play.</li><li><strong>Lack of Dedicated Support</strong>: No 24/7 hotline here. Open-source tools rely on community forums or third-party consultants. If you’re stuck, you might be digging through outdated wikis or begging for help on Reddit.</li><li>: Development depends on volunteers or small teams. DataGerry, for example, has slowed down lately, leaving users waiting for new features.</li></ul><p>Okay, so commercial tools are killing, but are CMDB discovery tools out of the game? There’s room for them to grow, especially if they play their cards right.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Rooms for CMDB Discovery Tools Open Source\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Winning Over Small Businesses\n</h3><p>Not every company has the budget for a ServiceNow subscription. Small and medium businesses, startups, or non-profits often need affordable options. Tools like Snipe-IT or DataGerry are perfect for these SMEs. They’re free, flexible, and good enough for smaller setups. If these tools focus on making setup easier (think pre-built templates or one-click installs), they could grab a bigger chunk of this market.</p><p>Open-source tools shine when it comes to customization. Got a weird workflow that ServiceNow doesn’t cover? CMDBuild lets you build custom data models to fit your exact needs. Schools, research labs, or small industries could use these tools to create tailored solutions without breaking the bank. Adding industry-specific plugins, say, for healthcare or education, could draw in more users.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Riding the AI and Cloud Wave\n</h3><p>Commercial tools may lead in AI and cloud integration, but open-source projects can catch up. Using open-source AI frameworks like TensorFlow, tools like iTop could add predictive analytics or automated dependency mapping. Plus, as more companies move to hybrid or multi-cloud setups, open-source tools that play nice with AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes (like Ralph’s multi-data-center support) could gain traction.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Building Stronger Communities\n</h3><p>The open-source edge is its community. If projects like CMDBuild or DataGerry ramp up engagement, think hackathons, better forums, or clear development roadmaps, they could speed up updates and add features faster. A thriving community means more contributors fixing bugs and building better add-ons.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Making It User-Friendly\n</h3><p>Let’s be real: open-source tools can be clunky. If they invest in slicker interfaces, better documentation, or Docker-based installs, they’d appeal to a broader crowd.&nbsp;</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. Targeting Budget-Conscious Markets\n</h3><p>In places where money’s tight, like developing countries or public sectors, open-source tools are a no-brainer. CMDB discovery tools open source could market themselves to these regions, emphasizing zero licensing costs and community-driven flexibility.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  CMDB Discovery Tools Open Source Future Trends\n</h2><p>The IT world is changing, and these shifts could give open-source CMDB discovery tools a leg up:</p><ul><li>: DevOps teams love automation and open-source tools like Ansible. CMDB tools that integrate with these workflows could win over DevOps fans.</li><li>: As AI tools become more accessible, open-source CMDBs could add smart features like auto-detecting configuration issues, leveling the playing field.</li></ul><p>To wrap it up, open-source CMDB discovery tools do have room to grow, but their future success will depend on their ability to overcome the challenges that currently limit them. While commercial solutions are likely to remain the top choice for large enterprises due to their scalability, comprehensive features, and support, open-source tools can still thrive in smaller, more niche environments.</p><p>The key to the growth of open-source CMDB discovery tools lies in continuous innovation. As the demand for more flexible, cloud-native, and customizable solutions grows, open-source tools will have the opportunity to evolve and cater to businesses that require a lower-cost alternative to paid solutions. However, for larger organizations with complex IT environments, the limits of open-source tools will likely continue to make commercial solutions the preferred option.</p><p>In the end, the growth of open-source CMDB discovery tools will depend on how well they can adapt to changing technologies and how effectively they can bridge the gap between simplicity and the enterprise-grade functionality that many businesses need. So, while commercial tools dominate today, open-source tools will always have a place, especially for those willing to put in the time and effort to make them work.</p>","contentLength":8210,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Comparison between bare-metal programming and using an RTOS on STM32 microcontrollers","url":"https://dev.to/carolineee/comparison-between-bare-metal-programming-and-using-an-rtos-on-stm32-microcontrollers-285a","date":1751273427,"author":"Hedy","guid":176455,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Comparison: Bare-Metal vs. RTOS on STM32</strong></p><p><strong>Example – STM32 without RTOS (Bare-Metal):</strong></p><div><pre><code>c\n\nint main(void) {\n    HAL_Init();\n    SystemClock_Config();\n    MX_GPIO_Init();\n\n    while (1) {\n        if (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(B1_GPIO_Port, B1_Pin) == GPIO_PIN_SET) {\n            HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD2_GPIO_Port, LD2_Pin);\n            HAL_Delay(500);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Example – STM32 with FreeRTOS:</strong></p><div><pre><code>c\n\nvoid LEDTask(void *argument) {\n    for (;;) {\n        HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD2_GPIO_Port, LD2_Pin);\n        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(500));\n    }\n}\n\nint main(void) {\n    HAL_Init();\n    SystemClock_Config();\n    MX_GPIO_Init();\n\n    xTaskCreate(LEDTask, \"LED\", 128, NULL, 1, NULL);\n    vTaskStartScheduler();\n\n    while (1) {} // Never reached\n}\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>When Should You Use Bare-Metal or RTOS on STM32?</strong></p><ul><li>You need maximum control and minimum latency</li><li>Flash and RAM are limited (<a href=\"https://www.ampheo.com/search/STM32F0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">STM32F0</a>, L0)</li><li>You're developing a low-power device and want to manage power manually</li></ul><ul><li>You need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.ampheoelec.de/c/sensors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sensors</a> + communication + display)</li><li>Your project is growing and requires modularity</li><li>You depend on timing precision, synchronization, and task priorities</li><li>You're working with middleware like USB, TCP/IP, BLE (many ST libraries are RTOS-friendly)</li></ul><p>\nST’s STM32CubeMX allows you to generate projects with or without an RTOS:</p><ul><li>Choose “RTOS: CMSIS-RTOS2 (FreeRTOS)” in the middleware section</li><li>Tasks can be configured conveniently (stack size, priority, etc.)</li></ul>","contentLength":1438,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Block HTTP Flood DDoS Attacks with a WAF","url":"https://dev.to/sharon_42e16b8da44dabde6d/how-to-block-http-flood-ddos-attacks-with-a-waf-1766","date":1751270420,"author":"Sharon","guid":176425,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Not all DDoS attacks are noisy.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system. Historically, the Singleton pattern has roots in the Gang of Four's \"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.\" Although originally articulated in the context of statically typed languages like Java and C++, the pattern has found a special niche in the dynamic landscape of JavaScript.</p><p>In JavaScript, understanding and implementing the Singleton pattern requires a nuanced appreciation of the language’s prototypal inheritance, closures, and module patterns. This comprehensive guide aims to investigate advanced techniques for implementing the Singleton Pattern in JavaScript, examining edge cases, performance considerations, potential pitfalls, and real-world use cases.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Historical and Technical Context\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Singleton Pattern: Definition and Purpose\n</h3><p>Since its introduction, the Singleton pattern has been a staple in architectural design, appealing to developers seeking to encapsulate shared resources like configuration settings, logging facilities, or service orchestrators. The primary goals include:</p><ul><li>Ensuring a single instance of a class exists.</li><li>Providing a global point of access to that instance.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Historical Evolution in JavaScript\n</h3><p>As JavaScript has evolved, so have the complexities of the Singleton pattern’s implementation. From early ES5 object literals to modern ES6 classes, JavaScript's self-contained patterns have provided various ways to implement singletons, adapting to the changing paradigms introduced by ES modules, promises, and the async/await syntax.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing the Singleton Pattern: Basic Example\n</h2><p>We begin with a simple implementation of the Singleton pattern in JavaScript using an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Breakdown of the Basic Example\n</h3><ol><li>: The variable  is private and encapsulated within the IIFE, thereby enforcing the principle of single instance.</li><li>:  generates a new instance upon the first invocation of .</li><li>: The returned object provides public access to the  method, allowing controlled access to the singleton.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Enhancing Singleton Using Proxies\n</h3><p>A powerful technique to enforce singleton properties dynamically is the use of Proxies. Consider the situation where we want to restrict direct instantiation of a class and provide dynamic validations.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Explanation of Proxy Enhanced Singleton:\n</h3><ol><li>: Using the  trap ensures that any attempt to create a new instance throws an error.</li><li>: Proxies allow us to modify instance behaviors at runtime, adding more flexibility compared to traditional methods.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Edge Cases and Complex Scenarios\n</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Multi-threaded Environments</strong>: In environments like Node.js that support multi-threading, how do we prevent multiple instances from existing across threads? Consider using a shared memory model or an external store (like Redis).</p></li><li><p>: Singletons may carry state, complicating testing. The singleton state should be resettable, either through a public reset method or during dependency injection in your testing framework.</p></li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Alternative Approaches and Comparisons\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Module Pattern vs. Singleton\n</h3><p>The module pattern encapsulates functionality within a single module, exposing methods and properties as necessary. Although closely aligned with the Singleton pattern, the module pattern provides a different scope of application. For example, you can achieve a private state without enforcing only one instance:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Compare the singleton approach with modules; you have state encapsulation in both, but with the singleton, you are guaranteed a single instance and point of access.</p><ol><li><p>:\nApplications like web servers leverage singletons for configuration options to ensure that all components access consistent state variables.</p></li><li><p>:\nAvoid redundant logging services which create new objects, causing complexity in log management. A Logger class typically benefits from the Singleton pattern as all parts of the application can log to the same instance.</p></li><li><p>:\nDatabases often implement connection pool managers as singletons to control concurrency, manage resources effectively, and ensure performance consistency.</p></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Considerations and Optimization Strategies\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Leverage Lazy Initialization\n</h3><p>For performance optimization, consider lazy initialization, where the instance is only created when needed. This is crucial in applications where the cost of instance creation is high.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Be cautious of possible memory leaks. Ensure that your singleton does not retain references to objects that could be garbage-collected. Using weak references or cleanup methods can mitigate this issue.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Debugging Techniques\n</h2><p>Debugging singletons can be challenging due to their global state. Advanced techniques include:</p><ol><li>: For monitoring access patterns and instance lifetime.</li><li>: Implement toggles to monitor singleton access during development.</li><li>: Track calls to instance creation and access methods to trace the state.</li></ol><p>The Singleton pattern in JavaScript is multifaceted, allowing for a wide variety of advanced implementations and considerations that go beyond simply ensuring a single instance. Mastering this pattern entails understanding not just initialization and state management but also potential pitfalls and real-world applicability.</p><p>For those interested in diving deeper, reviewing resources such as the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> and the standard library documentation can provide additional context and exploration avenues. In essence, the art of crafting sophisticated, efficient, and debuggable singletons directly influences performance and maintainability in JavaScript applications, particularly at an enterprise scale.</p><p>In conclusion, mastering the Singleton pattern and its advanced techniques is crucial for any senior developer looking to build scalable and efficient JavaScript applications that can handle a rich set of operational complexities while maintaining clarity and control over single instances.</p>","contentLength":6127,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"10 React UI/UX Practices Every Senior Developer Should Use in 2025","url":"https://dev.to/madhavkabra/10-react-uiux-practices-every-senior-developer-should-use-in-2025-3hho","date":1751269454,"author":"Madhav Kabra","guid":176423,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  10 React UI/UX Practices Every Senior Developer Should Use in 2025\n</h2><p>In 2025, building great frontend experiences with React isn’t just about writing functional components—it's about creating <strong>seamless, accessible, and intuitive</strong> interfaces.</p><p>Whether you're working solo or in a team, these <strong>battle-tested UI/UX best practices</strong> will help you stand out as a senior React developer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1.

These AI models are trained on massive datasets, enabling them to learn patterns, structures, and nuances of human communication, design, or art. As a result, they can produce outputs like text, images, music, or even code that mimic human creativity. </p><p>Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on analyzing data and providing predictive insights or classifications, Generative AI goes a step further. It creates completely new outputs that did not exist before. This innovation is revolutionizing industries that rely heavily on creativity, such as marketing, design, content writing, and software development. </p><p>For example, popular Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Jasper AI, and Writesonic are extensively used for: </p><p>Generating social media captions </p><p>Composing emails and ad copies </p><p>These AI models, trained on billions of data points, understand the context, tone, style, and purpose behind content. This enables them to produce outputs aligned with the specific requirements of a business or target audience. </p><p><strong>How Is Generative AI Changing Content Creation?</strong>\nGenerative AI is transforming the way businesses and marketers approach content creation. Here’s how: </p><ol><li>Faster Content Production </li></ol><p>Traditional content writing involves brainstorming, researching, drafting, editing, and formatting – a process that can take hours or days for each piece. Generative AI reduces this time drastically. AI-assisted writing tools can create first drafts in minutes, enabling businesses to maintain consistent posting schedules across blogs, websites, and social media channels without compromising productivity. </p><ol><li>Enhanced Creativity and Idea Generation </li></ol><p>Writer’s block is a common hurdle for content teams. Generative AI tools overcome this by suggesting content outlines, headline variations, caption options, or even fresh topic ideas based on trends and keywords. This ensures a continuous flow of creativity, allowing marketers and writers to focus on refining content rather than struggling to initiate it. </p><p>Personalized content drives higher engagement and conversions. Generative AI analyses user behavior, preferences, and interaction patterns to create tailored content that resonates with each segment of your audience. For instance, AI-generated email subject lines and body texts can vary based on the recipient’s interests, improving open and click-through rates. </p><p>Hiring multiple writers or agencies to scale content production is expensive. Generative AI allows businesses to produce content affordably at scale. Human writers can then focus on strategy, editing, and storytelling refinement, while AI handles bulk drafting. This blended approach optimizes resources without sacrificing quality. </p><ol><li>Multilingual Content Creation </li></ol><p>Reaching a global audience requires multilingual content teams, which is resource-intensive. Generative AI models trained in multiple languages make it easier to create accurate and culturally relevant content in different languages, expanding brand reach efficiently. </p><p>*<em>What Are the Limitations of Generative AI? *</em></p><p>Despite its potential, Generative AI has limitations that businesses must acknowledge: </p><p>Lacks emotional nuance: AI-generated content may not fully capture complex human emotions, sarcasm, or deep cultural references without guided inputs. </p><p>Generic outputs if prompts are weak: Vague prompts often lead to generic or irrelevant content. Structured, detailed instructions are needed for optimal results. </p><p>Requires expert editing: AI cannot replace human editing for brand tone, storytelling finesse, and factual accuracy. Manual verification remains critical, especially for sensitive or technical topics. </p><p>Therefore, while Generative AI accelerates the process, integration with human expertise is essential to maintain brand authenticity and avoid potential errors. </p><p>*<em>The Future of Generative AI in Content Creation *</em></p><p>The journey of Generative AI has just begun. By 2025 and beyond, we will see rapid advancements such as: </p><p>*\nAI developers are continuously working on improving the factual correctness of outputs by integrating real-time data verification capabilities, reducing the risk of misinformation in generated content. </p><p>*<em>Integration into CMS and Marketing Tools *</em></p><p>Generative AI will seamlessly integrate with content management systems (CMS), email marketing platforms, and design tools, enabling content teams to generate, edit, and publish directly within their workflows. </p><p>*<em>Industry-Specific AI Training *</em></p><p>Specialized AI models trained for fields like law, finance, and medicine will produce highly relevant, compliant, and technically accurate content, enhancing the trust factor for professional firms. </p><p><strong>AI-Human Co-Creation Workflows</strong></p><p>The future will focus on co-creation – AI drafts the initial content, while human writers refine narratives, inject brand voice, and align it with strategic goals. This approach will enhance storytelling capabilities while maintaining authenticity. </p><p>Generative AI is redefining how businesses create content.

This write-up provides an comprehensive discussion on how AI-based generative and predictive approaches are being applied in the application security domain, crafted for cybersecurity experts and decision-makers as well. We’ll examine the development of AI for security testing, its current capabilities, limitations, the rise of “agentic” AI, and forthcoming directions. Let’s start our analysis through the past, current landscape, and future of AI-driven application security. </p><p>Origin and Growth of AI-Enhanced AppSec </p><p>Foundations of Automated Vulnerability Discovery \nLong before AI became a trendy topic, infosec experts sought to streamline bug detection. In the late 1980s, Dr. Barton Miller’s groundbreaking work on fuzz testing proved the power of automation. His 1988 class project randomly generated inputs to crash UNIX programs — “fuzzing” revealed that roughly a quarter to a third of utility programs could be crashed with random data. This straightforward black-box approach paved the groundwork for future security testing strategies. By the 1990s and early 2000s, developers employed scripts and scanners to find widespread flaws. Early static analysis tools behaved like advanced grep, searching code for risky functions or fixed login data. Even though these pattern-matching approaches were beneficial, they often yielded many incorrect flags, because any code resembling a pattern was labeled without considering context. </p><p>Evolution of AI-Driven Security Models \nOver the next decade, academic research and commercial platforms advanced, transitioning from static rules to sophisticated analysis. ML gradually made its way into the application security realm. Early adoptions included neural networks for anomaly detection in system traffic, and probabilistic models for spam or phishing — not strictly AppSec, but predictive of the trend. Meanwhile, code scanning tools got better with flow-based examination and control flow graphs to monitor how information moved through an application. </p><p>A key concept that arose was the Code Property Graph (CPG), merging structural, control flow, and information flow into a unified graph. This approach enabled more meaningful vulnerability detection and later won an IEEE “Test of Time” award. By representing code as nodes and edges, security tools could pinpoint intricate flaws beyond simple keyword matches. </p><p>In 2016, DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge proved fully automated hacking systems — capable to find, prove, and patch software flaws in real time, lacking human intervention. The winning system, “Mayhem,” combined advanced analysis, symbolic execution, and some AI planning to go head to head against human hackers. This event was a notable moment in self-governing cyber security. </p><p>Major Breakthroughs in AI for Vulnerability Detection \nWith the growth of better ML techniques and more labeled examples, AI security solutions has taken off. Large tech firms and startups together have achieved landmarks. One notable leap involves machine learning models predicting software vulnerabilities and exploits. An example is the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), which uses thousands of data points to forecast which vulnerabilities will face exploitation in the wild. This approach enables security teams focus on the most critical weaknesses. </p><p>In detecting code flaws, deep learning models have been fed with huge codebases to spot insecure structures. Microsoft, Google, and additional organizations have indicated that generative LLMs (Large Language Models) enhance security tasks by creating new test cases. For one case, Google’s security team applied LLMs to develop randomized input sets for OSS libraries, increasing coverage and uncovering additional vulnerabilities with less human intervention. </p><p>Current AI Capabilities in AppSec </p><p>Today’s software defense leverages AI in two major categories: generative AI, producing new elements (like tests, code, or exploits), and predictive AI, scanning data to highlight or anticipate vulnerabilities. These capabilities span every aspect of AppSec activities, from code review to dynamic testing. </p><p>AI-Generated Tests and Attacks \nGenerative AI outputs new data, such as test cases or code segments that uncover vulnerabilities. This is evident in machine learning-based fuzzers. Traditional fuzzing relies on random or mutational inputs, in contrast generative models can create more targeted tests. Google’s OSS-Fuzz team tried LLMs to auto-generate fuzz coverage for open-source repositories, boosting bug detection. </p><p>Likewise, generative AI can aid in constructing exploit PoC payloads. Researchers carefully demonstrate that AI empower the creation of PoC code once a vulnerability is disclosed. On the adversarial side, penetration testers may leverage generative AI to automate malicious tasks. Defensively, teams use machine learning exploit building to better test defenses and develop mitigations. </p><p>AI-Driven Forecasting in AppSec \nPredictive AI sifts through information to locate likely exploitable flaws. Rather than fixed rules or signatures, a model can infer from thousands of vulnerable vs. safe code examples, recognizing patterns that a rule-based system could miss. This approach helps label suspicious constructs and predict the risk of newly found issues. </p><p>Vulnerability prioritization is a second predictive AI use case. The exploit forecasting approach is one example where a machine learning model scores known vulnerabilities by the probability they’ll be exploited in the wild. This allows security programs concentrate on the top 5% of vulnerabilities that carry the highest risk. Some modern AppSec platforms feed source code changes and historical bug data into ML models, estimating which areas of an application are especially vulnerable to new flaws. </p><p>AI-Driven Automation in SAST, DAST, and IAST \nClassic SAST tools, DAST tools, and instrumented testing are now empowering with AI to enhance speed and effectiveness. </p><p>SAST analyzes source files for security vulnerabilities in a non-runtime context, but often triggers a flood of spurious warnings if it cannot interpret usage. AI assists by sorting findings and dismissing those that aren’t truly exploitable, through smart data flow analysis. Tools such as Qwiet AI and others integrate a Code Property Graph plus ML to evaluate reachability, drastically cutting the noise. </p><p>DAST scans the live application, sending malicious requests and observing the responses. AI advances DAST by allowing autonomous crawling and evolving test sets. The autonomous module can figure out multi-step workflows, modern app flows, and RESTful calls more accurately, increasing coverage and lowering false negatives. </p><p>IAST, which instruments the application at runtime to record function calls and data flows, can produce volumes of telemetry. An AI model can interpret that telemetry, finding vulnerable flows where user input reaches a critical function unfiltered. By mixing IAST with ML, unimportant findings get removed, and only genuine risks are shown. </p><p>Methods of Program Inspection: Grep, Signatures, and CPG \nToday’s code scanning tools often mix several methodologies, each with its pros/cons: </p><p>Grepping (Pattern Matching): The most basic method, searching for tokens or known patterns (e.g., suspicious functions). Simple but highly prone to false positives and missed issues due to no semantic understanding. </p><p>Signatures (Rules/Heuristics): Heuristic scanning where security professionals encode known vulnerabilities. It’s effective for established bug classes but less capable for new or unusual bug types. </p><p>Code Property Graphs (CPG): A contemporary context-aware approach, unifying AST, control flow graph, and DFG into one graphical model. Tools analyze the graph for critical data paths. Combined with ML, it can discover zero-day patterns and eliminate noise via reachability analysis. </p><p>In actual implementation, vendors combine these approaches. They still rely on signatures for known issues, but they supplement them with CPG-based analysis for context and machine learning for ranking results. </p><p>AI in Cloud-Native and Dependency Security \nAs enterprises shifted to containerized architectures, container and dependency security gained priority. AI helps here, too: </p><p>Container Security: AI-driven container analysis tools scrutinize container images for known security holes, misconfigurations, or secrets. Some solutions determine whether vulnerabilities are active at execution, diminishing the excess alerts. Meanwhile, adaptive threat detection at runtime can detect unusual container actions (e.g., unexpected network calls), catching break-ins that signature-based tools might miss. </p><p>ai in application security Supply Chain Risks: With millions of open-source libraries in various repositories, manual vetting is unrealistic. AI can analyze package documentation for malicious indicators, spotting typosquatting. Machine learning models can also rate the likelihood a certain component might be compromised, factoring in vulnerability history. This allows teams to pinpoint the dangerous supply chain elements. In parallel, AI can watch for anomalies in build pipelines, confirming that only authorized code and dependencies enter production. </p><p>While AI offers powerful capabilities to software defense, it’s no silver bullet. Teams must understand the shortcomings, such as misclassifications, exploitability analysis, bias in models, and handling undisclosed threats. </p><p>autonomous agents for appsec Accuracy Issues in AI Detection \nAll automated security testing faces false positives (flagging benign code) and false negatives (missing dangerous vulnerabilities). AI can alleviate the former by adding reachability checks, yet it introduces new sources of error. A model might “hallucinate” issues or, if not trained properly, miss a serious bug. Hence, human supervision often remains essential to ensure accurate diagnoses. </p><p>Measuring Whether Flaws Are Truly Dangerous \nEven if AI flags a insecure code path, that doesn’t guarantee malicious actors can actually access it. Assessing real-world exploitability is challenging. Some frameworks attempt constraint solving to prove or disprove exploit feasibility. However, full-blown exploitability checks remain less widespread in commercial solutions. Consequently, many AI-driven findings still demand expert judgment to deem them low severity. </p><p>Inherent Training Biases in Security AI \nAI systems adapt from collected data. If that data is dominated by certain vulnerability types, or lacks examples of emerging threats, the AI could fail to recognize them. autonomous AI Additionally, a system might disregard certain platforms if the training set concluded those are less apt to be exploited. Frequent data refreshes, inclusive data sets, and bias monitoring are critical to address this issue. </p><p>Handling Zero-Day Vulnerabilities and Evolving Threats \nMachine learning excels with patterns it has processed before. A entirely new vulnerability type can evade AI if it doesn’t match existing knowledge. Malicious parties also use adversarial AI to trick defensive mechanisms. Hence, AI-based solutions must evolve constantly. Some developers adopt anomaly detection or unsupervised learning to catch abnormal behavior that signature-based approaches might miss. Yet, even these heuristic methods can miss cleverly disguised zero-days or produce red herrings. </p><p>Agentic Systems and Their Impact on AppSec </p><p>A modern-day term in the AI domain is agentic AI — intelligent systems that don’t merely generate answers, but can take tasks autonomously. ai in application security In security, this means AI that can control multi-step operations, adapt to real-time conditions, and act with minimal human oversight. </p><p>Understanding Agentic Intelligence \nAgentic AI programs are assigned broad tasks like “find weak points in this software,” and then they determine how to do so: collecting data, running tools, and adjusting strategies based on findings. Consequences are substantial: we move from AI as a helper to AI as an autonomous entity. </p><p>Offensive vs. Defensive AI Agents \nOffensive (Red Team) Usage: Agentic AI can launch penetration tests autonomously. Security firms like FireCompass market an AI that enumerates vulnerabilities, crafts penetration routes, and demonstrates compromise — all on its own. Likewise, open-source “PentestGPT” or similar solutions use LLM-driven logic to chain attack steps for multi-stage exploits. </p><p>Defensive (Blue Team) Usage: On the defense side, AI agents can oversee networks and automatically respond to suspicious events (e.g., isolating a compromised host, updating firewall rules, or analyzing logs). Some security orchestration platforms are integrating “agentic playbooks” where the AI executes tasks dynamically, instead of just using static workflows. </p><p>Self-Directed Security Assessments \nFully agentic penetration testing is the ultimate aim for many in the AppSec field. Tools that comprehensively detect vulnerabilities, craft intrusion paths, and demonstrate them without human oversight are emerging as a reality. Victories from DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge and new agentic AI signal that multi-step attacks can be chained by machines. </p><p>Challenges of Agentic AI \nWith great autonomy comes responsibility. An autonomous system might inadvertently cause damage in a live system, or an attacker might manipulate the agent to execute destructive actions. Robust guardrails, sandboxing, and manual gating for risky tasks are unavoidable. Nonetheless, agentic AI represents the future direction in AppSec orchestration. </p><p>Upcoming Directions for AI-Enhanced Security </p><p>AI’s role in AppSec will only accelerate. We expect major transformations in the near term and longer horizon, with emerging regulatory concerns and ethical considerations. </p><p>Short-Range Projections \nOver the next handful of years, enterprises will integrate AI-assisted coding and security more commonly. Developer IDEs will include AppSec evaluations driven by AI models to highlight potential issues in real time. AI application security Intelligent test generation will become standard. Regular ML-driven scanning with autonomous testing will supplement annual or quarterly pen tests. Expect improvements in false positive reduction as feedback loops refine machine intelligence models. </p><p>Attackers will also leverage generative AI for malware mutation, so defensive countermeasures must learn. We’ll see malicious messages that are nearly perfect, demanding new ML filters to fight machine-written lures. </p><p>Regulators and governance bodies may lay down frameworks for responsible AI usage in cybersecurity. For example, rules might mandate that companies log AI outputs to ensure accountability. </p><p>Futuristic Vision of AppSec \nIn the decade-scale range, AI may overhaul the SDLC entirely, possibly leading to: </p><p>AI-augmented development: Humans co-author with AI that produces the majority of code, inherently embedding safe coding as it goes. </p><p>Automated vulnerability remediation: Tools that don’t just detect flaws but also resolve them autonomously, verifying the viability of each solution. </p><p>Proactive, continuous defense: AI agents scanning systems around the clock, predicting attacks, deploying security controls on-the-fly, and battling adversarial AI in real-time. </p><p>Secure-by-design architectures: AI-driven architectural scanning ensuring systems are built with minimal exploitation vectors from the foundation. </p><p>We also foresee that AI itself will be strictly overseen, with compliance rules for AI usage in safety-sensitive industries. This might dictate transparent AI and regular checks of ML models. </p><p>Regulatory Dimensions of AI Security \nAs AI becomes integral in application security, compliance frameworks will expand. We may see: </p><p>AI-powered compliance checks: Automated auditing to ensure controls (e.g., PCI DSS, SOC 2) are met in real time. </p><p>Governance of AI models: Requirements that organizations track training data, show model fairness, and document AI-driven decisions for auditors. </p><p>Incident response oversight: If an autonomous system initiates a containment measure, which party is accountable? Defining liability for AI actions is a complex issue that policymakers will tackle. </p><p>Ethics and Adversarial AI Risks \nIn addition to compliance, there are social questions. Using AI for insider threat detection might cause privacy invasions. Relying solely on AI for life-or-death decisions can be dangerous if the AI is manipulated. Meanwhile, adversaries employ AI to mask malicious code. Data poisoning and AI exploitation can mislead defensive AI systems. </p><p>Adversarial AI represents a growing threat, where threat actors specifically target ML pipelines or use machine intelligence to evade detection. Ensuring the security of ML code will be an essential facet of AppSec in the coming years. </p><p>Generative and predictive AI are fundamentally altering AppSec. We’ve reviewed the historical context, modern solutions, hurdles, agentic AI implications, and long-term vision. The main point is that AI acts as a formidable ally for security teams, helping accelerate flaw discovery, rank the biggest threats, and automate complex tasks. </p><p>Yet, it’s not infallible. Spurious flags, biases, and novel exploit types call for expert scrutiny. The constant battle between attackers and security teams continues; AI is merely the newest arena for that conflict. Organizations that adopt AI responsibly — integrating it with human insight, regulatory adherence, and continuous updates — are positioned to prevail in the evolving world of application security. </p><p>Ultimately, the promise of AI is a better defended application environment, where security flaws are detected early and remediated swiftly, and where defenders can combat the agility of cyber criminals head-on. With ongoing research, collaboration, and evolution in AI capabilities, that future could arrive sooner than expected.<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/howtouseaiinapplicationsd8e/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI application security</a></p>","contentLength":18230,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hey devs, we're Kinde","url":"https://dev.to/kinde/hey-devs-were-kinde-56pe","date":1751269242,"author":"Claire Mahoney","guid":176421,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We're a fully integrated developer platform offering modern auth, user access management, feature flags, and billing solutions for engineers. </p><p>Use us to secure and monetize your product from day one.

As security threats grow more sophisticated, companies are turning increasingly towards AI. While AI has been a part of the cybersecurity toolkit for some time, the emergence of agentic AI will usher in a new age of active, adaptable, and connected security products. The article focuses on the potential of agentic AI to transform security, and focuses on uses of AppSec and AI-powered automated vulnerability fix. </p><p>Cybersecurity A rise in Agentic AI </p><p>Agentic AI refers to intelligent, goal-oriented and autonomous systems that recognize their environment to make decisions and make decisions to accomplish particular goals. Agentic AI differs in comparison to traditional reactive or rule-based AI in that it can change and adapt to changes in its environment and also operate on its own. This independence is evident in AI agents in cybersecurity that are capable of continuously monitoring systems and identify abnormalities. Additionally, they can react in with speed and accuracy to attacks without human interference. </p><p>Agentic AI holds enormous potential in the area of cybersecurity. Through the use of machine learning algorithms as well as vast quantities of information, these smart agents are able to identify patterns and relationships that human analysts might miss. They can sort through the multitude of security incidents, focusing on the most critical incidents and providing a measurable insight for rapid reaction. Furthermore, agentsic AI systems can be taught from each interactions, developing their detection of threats and adapting to ever-changing techniques employed by cybercriminals. </p><p>Agentic AI (Agentic AI) and Application Security </p><p>Agentic AI is a powerful instrument that is used in a wide range of areas related to cyber security. However, the impact it can have on the security of applications is notable. Since organizations are increasingly dependent on interconnected, complex software systems, securing their applications is an essential concern. AppSec methods like periodic vulnerability testing as well as manual code reviews are often unable to keep current with the latest application developments. </p><p>In the realm of agentic AI, you can enter. By integrating intelligent agents into the lifecycle of software development (SDLC), organizations can change their AppSec methods from reactive to proactive. Artificial Intelligence-powered agents continuously monitor code repositories, analyzing every code change for vulnerability as well as security vulnerabilities. They employ sophisticated methods like static code analysis, testing dynamically, and machine learning to identify various issues including common mistakes in coding as well as subtle vulnerability to injection. </p><p>Intelligent AI is unique to AppSec because it can adapt to the specific context of each and every application. Through the creation of a complete data property graph (CPG) - a rich diagram of the codebase which is able to identify the connections between different components of code - agentsic AI can develop a deep understanding of the application's structure as well as data flow patterns and possible attacks. The AI can prioritize the vulnerabilities according to their impact in real life and the ways they can be exploited in lieu of basing its decision on a generic severity rating. </p><p>AI-powered Automated Fixing: The Power of AI </p><p>The idea of automating the fix for flaws is probably one of the greatest applications for AI agent in AppSec. Human programmers have been traditionally accountable for reviewing manually the code to identify the vulnerability, understand it and then apply the fix. This is a lengthy process in addition to error-prone and frequently leads to delays in deploying crucial security patches. </p><p>It's a new game with agentic AI. With the help of a deep understanding of the codebase provided by the CPG, AI agents can not only identify vulnerabilities as well as generate context-aware not-breaking solutions automatically. They will analyze all the relevant code to understand its intended function before implementing a solution that fixes the flaw while creating no new problems. </p><p>The consequences of AI-powered automated fix are significant. The period between identifying a security vulnerability before addressing the issue will be significantly reduced, closing the possibility of criminals. This relieves the development group of having to invest a lot of time finding security vulnerabilities. In their place, the team could be able to concentrate on the development of fresh features. Automating the process for fixing vulnerabilities will allow organizations to be sure that they're following a consistent method that is consistent, which reduces the chance to human errors and oversight. </p><p>Challenges and Considerations </p><p>The potential for agentic AI in cybersecurity and AppSec is huge It is crucial to be aware of the risks as well as the considerations associated with its use. Accountability and trust is a key one. Organisations need to establish clear guidelines for ensuring that AI is acting within the acceptable parameters in the event that AI agents become autonomous and become capable of taking decision on their own. It is essential to establish robust testing and validating processes in order to ensure the quality and security of AI created corrections. </p><p>Another issue is the potential for adversarial attack against AI. Hackers could attempt to modify data or make use of AI model weaknesses as agentic AI techniques are more widespread for cyber security. It is crucial to implement safe AI practices such as adversarial learning and model hardening. </p><p>The effectiveness of the agentic AI for agentic AI in AppSec depends on the completeness and accuracy of the graph for property code. To construct and maintain an exact CPG, you will need to purchase techniques like static analysis, testing frameworks and integration pipelines. Organisations also need to ensure their CPGs correspond to the modifications occurring in the codebases and the changing security environment. </p><p>The future of Agentic AI in Cybersecurity </p><p>The potential of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity is extremely optimistic, despite its many issues. As this link continue to advance and become more advanced, we could get even more sophisticated and powerful autonomous systems that can detect, respond to, and reduce cyber threats with unprecedented speed and precision. With regards to AppSec, agentic AI has the potential to transform the process of creating and secure software, enabling businesses to build more durable reliable, secure, and resilient applications. </p><p>Moreover, the integration in the wider cybersecurity ecosystem can open up new possibilities in collaboration and coordination among the various tools and procedures used in security. Imagine a world where autonomous agents work seamlessly in the areas of network monitoring, incident response, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management. They share insights and taking coordinated actions in order to offer an integrated, proactive defence against cyber threats. </p><p>As agentic predictive security ai move forward we must encourage companies to recognize the benefits of artificial intelligence while cognizant of the ethical and societal implications of autonomous technology. The power of AI agentics in order to construct an incredibly secure, robust and secure digital future by creating a responsible and ethical culture to support AI advancement. </p><p>In the rapidly evolving world of cybersecurity, agentsic AI represents a paradigm shift in how we approach the identification, prevention and elimination of cyber risks. By leveraging the power of autonomous agents, specifically when it comes to app security, and automated fix for vulnerabilities, companies can change their security strategy by shifting from reactive to proactive, from manual to automated, and from generic to contextually aware. </p><p>Agentic AI presents many issues, yet the rewards are more than we can ignore. While we push AI's boundaries when it comes to cybersecurity, it's important to keep a mind-set that is constantly learning, adapting as well as responsible innovation. If we do this we can unleash the full power of agentic AI to safeguard our digital assets, protect our companies, and create a more secure future for everyone.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMRpNaavElg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">agentic predictive security ai</a></p>","contentLength":8497,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tick by Tick: How Unreal Engine Simulates Real-World Physics","url":"https://dev.to/fgrenoville/tick-by-tick-how-unreal-engine-simulates-real-world-physics-5mg","date":1751268837,"author":"Federico Grenoville","guid":176416,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you’ve ever wondered what powers the physics engine in Unreal Engine, and what terms like integration, substepping, or async transform really mean, you’re in the right place!</p><p>In this article, I will explore Unreal Engine’s physics system — from numerical integration and substepping, to the new asynchronous physics tick.

As Gödel proved, such a system will always contain statements that are true but can never be proven by the system's own rules.</p><p>We see numerous examples of such systems, e.g., mathematics, any computer program or anything digital in general is such Gödel's formal system. Any digital artifact can be reduced to a natural number () making it a valid formal system.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore how to simulate this concept using TypeScript. This language fulfills all theorem requirements: it is capable of general-purpose computation and non-contradictory. While the full proof requires deep mathematical machinery, we’ll create a simplified model to explain Prof. Gödel's way of thinking.</p><p>First, we want to define the basic building blocks of our formal system. Gödel's proof started with basic operators assigned unique numbers, the same approach as  during the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process. Then he compiled basic axioms using these tokens, then more complex formulas and so on. Each of them is expected to have their own unique Gödel's number.</p><p>In our system we will operate with more complex  which are Typescript variadic functions accepting numbers as parameters. The original approach would require using something like Abstract Syntax tree parsing.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For the brevity reasons, we'll take derivation and combination of these statements out of the picture and assign these numbers using just a string hash of statement function. Though, this problem is also Turing complete and can be resolved algorithmically.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each statement in our system can return a Boolean value or something else.</p><p>First, we define basic logical properties that define equivalence relations and operations.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The operation of converting Gödel number to statement should also be possible in our system. We are going to use ECMAScript  to achieve this.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each statement in our system is considered  when it returns a Boolean value (basically something we can agree or disagree with) or something else, which indicates it's not provable.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here is the code to check provability of our system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Create unprovable statement\n</h2><p>To prove this theorem, Gödel complied a true statement using these rules, which cannot be proven or disproven in this system at the same time. Here is how we do this.</p><p>We will write a statement which attempts to assert that it is not provable. If the system proves it, then it must be  (a contradiction). If it does not prove it, then it is  but . Due to the lack of  package in NPM, we have to use recursion.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The existence of such statements reveals a fundamental limitation on formal systems: the fact that there are mathematical and development truths beyond our capacity to fully capture through logical deduction alone.</p>","contentLength":3123,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Restaurant Website Builder","url":"https://dev.to/floratobydev/restaurant-website-builder-5702","date":1751266461,"author":"Michael","guid":176387,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The goal of this project is to <strong>build a restaurant website builder using Storyblok</strong>.

It's mostly lauded for its flexibility, scalability, and relaxed document schema. Nonetheless, as with any advanced system, performance has to be carefully tuned.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://www.datapatroltech.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data Patrol Technologies</a>, we've encountered numerous clients who experienced performance issues with MongoDB due to common mistakes. In this blog, we will demystify the top 5 errors to avoid when tuning MongoDB for enhanced performance and provide guidance on how to approach them effectively.</p><ol><li>Ignoring Indexing Strategy</li></ol><p>One of the most common errors we encounter is failing to use the appropriate indexes or simply failing to use them altogether. MongoDB relies on indexes to locate documents efficiently. Without indexes, queries scan all documents in a collection — a full collection scan that drags down performance.</p><p>Indexes play a crucial role in limiting the data MongoDB must scan. One missing index can make a millisecond query take seconds or even minutes to accomplish.</p><p>In Data Patrol Technologies, an e-commerce client experienced slow checkout speeds. Their order history queries had no index on user_id when inspected. Creating a compound index on order_date and user_id decreased query time by more than 95%.</p><p>Utilise the explanation to learn how queries are run.\nDeploy compound indexes judiciously based on your query patterns.<p>\nCheck slow query logs regularly.</p>\nRemove unused indexes — they take up space and slow down writes.</p><ol><li>Uncontrolled Document Growth</li></ol><p>You can store large documents using MongoDB, but you shouldn't. Uncontrolled growing documents, particularly arrays, cause page splits and fragmentation, which slow performance.</p><p>When a document goes over its assigned memory page, MongoDB relocates it, which means fragmentation. This causes disk I/O and degrades read/write performance.</p><p>A Data Patrol client used for media management was inserting too many logs into one document. Performance declined severely as logs increased. Segmenting logs into smaller documents with references enhanced performance considerably.</p><p>Don't embed large or expanding arrays.\nUse references when data expands uncontrollably.<p>\nWatch document size with $bsonSize.</p>\nKeep the padding factor on only when necessary.</p><ol><li>Excessive Use of Aggregation Pipelines</li></ol><p>The aggregation framework in MongoDB is strong, but exploiting it without knowing the implications for performance can be detrimental. Certain pipelines do too many things or make costly stages, such as $lookup and $group, inefficiently</p><p>Complex aggregation pipelines take up more CPU and memory. Badly written pipelines will leave resources drained and slow down the database as a whole.</p><p>One of our logistics customers had a pipeline with several $lookup operations between large datasets. Join optimization and leveraging $merge decreased runtime from minutes to seconds.</p><p>Simplify pipelines where possible.\nAvoid unnecessary $lookup, $group, and $unwind operations.<p>\nApply materialized views for repeated heavy aggregations.</p>\nSupervise pipelines with Atlas Performance Advisor or the explain function.</p><ol><li>Underestimating Hardware and Configuration Requirements</li></ol><p>MongoDB performance is not only about quality code. It is also about hardware and configurations that enable it. Executing MongoDB on slow disks, with default options, or without properly configuring connection pools can bog down performance.</p><p>Even an optimally written query will fail if the server has inadequate RAM or is using slow HDDs rather than SSDs. Disk I/O bottlenecks and network latency are prevalent but preventable problems.</p><p>A hosting client with a data analytics solution had MongoDB deployed on under-specified virtual machines. Switching to SSDs and optimizing wiredTiger cache improved performance by 70%.</p><p>Utilize SSDs and have adequate RAM.\nProperly set wiredTiger cache size.<p>\nExpand vertically and horizontally as appropriate.</p>\nUtilize replica sets for read scalability.</p><ol><li>Not Monitoring and Profiling Ongoing</li></ol><p>After deploying a MongoDB application, most teams quit monitoring. Without ongoing profiling, bottlenecks are not discovered until users complain or systems crash.</p><p>MongoDB performance is dynamic — it varies based on data volume, access patterns, and usage behavior. Monitoring is required to scale and adapt continuously.</p><p>A finance customer experienced a mid-day slowdown each Friday. Profiling indicated large weekly reports were the source of contention. Off-peak scheduling of jobs fixed the problem.</p><p>Utilize MongoDB Atlas monitoring tools.\nConfigure custom alerts and thresholds.<p>\nPeriodically check slow query logs and server status.</p>\nAutomate performance reports.</p><p>Final Remarks by Data Patrol Technologies\nFor us at Data Patrol Technologies, we see the flexibility of MongoDB as its greatest strength and its biggest risk. Performance tuning is not a one-shot operation; it's a long-term strategy that requires intelligent design, optimal configuration, round-the-clock monitoring, and most importantly, staying away from these common pitfalls.</p><p>Whether you're scaling a startup app or running an enterprise system, this information will ensure that you maximize the value of MongoDB, securely and effectively.</p><p>Need help with <a href=\"https://www.datapatroltech.com/mongodb-dba-support-service.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MongoDB</a> optimization?

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns\n</h2><p>Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:</p><p>Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Request/Response Compression\n</h3><p>Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.</p><p>API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication and Authorization\n</h3><p>Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions.

I personally would go to the most extreme and use a Docker container for better separation and to make the development, testing, and production environments as similar as possible. With that said I am not 100% sold on the idea. I do understand the value in using the perl that comes with the OS and the perl modules that can be installed with the package-management system of the operating system. (e.g. apt/yum).

Anyone else? Treat as suspicious.”</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. <strong>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</strong></h3><p><em>“Can we verify the email content hasn’t been altered, and it’s really from this domain?”</em></p><p>DKIM adds a cryptographic signature to your emails. Mail servers check your public key (in your DNS records) to verify the signature.</p><p>✅ If it matches, it’s authentic.\n🚨 If it fails, the email may be forged or tampered.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. <strong>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance)</strong></h3><p><em>“What should happen if SPF or DKIM fails?”</em></p><p>With DMARC, you set a policy:</p><ul><li>: just monitor and report</li><li>: send failed mail to spam</li><li>: block failed mail completely</li></ul><div><pre><code>v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@yourdomain.com\n</code></pre></div><p>You also get  that show who’s sending mail from your domain — helping you catch abuse.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ “Is this domain ready to send email?” - Test It All\n</h2><p>By now you might be wondering:\n“Okay, but how do I know if my domain has these things set up correctly?”</p><p>That was the exact problem I kept running into while building my own projects. My team would launch something, email about it — and then... users wouldn’t see them.

Both are awesome tools for creating layouts, but they’re best suited for different situations. In this article, I’ll explain in simple English when to choose CSS Grid over Flexbox, with examples that feel like a friend walking you through it. By the end, you’ll know exactly when Grid is your go-to tool!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Are CSS Grid and Flexbox?\n</h2><ul><li><p> Think of Grid as a blueprint for your entire page. It’s a two-dimensional system, meaning it controls both rows and columns at the same time. It’s perfect for complex layouts where you need precise control over where everything goes.</p></li><li><p> Flexbox is a one-dimensional system, meaning it’s great for arranging items in either a row or a column. It’s awesome for simpler layouts, like a navigation bar or aligning items within a single direction.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s dive into when CSS Grid is the better choice, with examples to make it clear.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When to Choose CSS Grid Over Flexbox\n</h2><p>Here are the key situations where CSS Grid shines, along with examples to show you how it works.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. You Need a Two-Dimensional Layout\n</h3><p>If your design involves both rows and columns, CSS Grid is the way to go. It lets you define a grid structure and place items exactly where you want them in both directions. Flexbox, on the other hand, is better for layouts that flow in just one direction (like a single row or column).</p><p>Example: A Dashboard Layout</p><p>Imagine you’re building a dashboard with a header, sidebar, main content area, and footer. CSS Grid makes this super easy by letting you define the entire layout at once.</p><div><pre><code>&lt;!-- In index.html --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"grid-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;header class=\"header\"&gt;Header&lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;aside class=\"sidebar\"&gt;Sidebar&lt;/aside&gt;\n  &lt;main class=\"main\"&gt;Main Content&lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;footer class=\"footer\"&gt;Footer&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>/* In styles.css */\n.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr; /* Sidebar is 200px, main content takes the rest */\n  grid-template-rows: 80px 1fr 60px; /* Header, main, footer */\n  grid-template-areas:\n    \"header header\"\n    \"sidebar main\"\n    \"footer footer\";\n  height: 100vh; /* Full viewport height */\n  gap: 10px;\n}\n\n.header { grid-area: header; background-color: #3498db; color: white; padding: 10px; }\n.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; background-color: #2ecc71; color: white; padding: 10px; }\n.main { grid-area: main; background-color: #ecf0f1; padding: 10px; }\n.footer { grid-area: footer; background-color: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 10px; }\n</code></pre></div><p>Why Grid? This creates a full-page layout with a header and footer spanning the entire width, a fixed-width sidebar, and a flexible main content area. With Flexbox, you’d need multiple containers and more complex CSS to achieve this, as it’s not designed for two-dimensional control.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. You Want Precise Control Over Item Placement\n</h3><p>CSS Grid lets you place items exactly where you want them using grid lines or named areas. This is great for layouts where items need to span multiple rows or columns or sit in specific spots.</p><p>Example: A Photo Gallery with a Featured Item</p><p>Let’s say you’re building a photo gallery where one image is larger and spans two columns.</p><div><pre><code>&lt;!-- In index.html --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"grid-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"item featured\"&gt;Featured Photo&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"item\"&gt;Photo 2&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"item\"&gt;Photo 3&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"item\"&gt;Photo 4&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>/* In styles.css */\n.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Three equal columns */\n  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px; /* Two rows */\n  gap: 10px;\n}\n\n.item {\n  background-color: #3498db;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.featured {\n  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Span from column line 1 to 3 (two columns) */\n  grid-row: 1 / 2; /* Stay in the first row */\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Why Grid? The featured item spans two columns, and the other items automatically fill the remaining spaces. With Flexbox, you’d struggle to control the row and column placement without extra wrappers or hacky solutions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. You Need Overlapping Elements\n</h3><p>CSS Grid makes it easy to overlap items by placing them in the same grid cells. This is tricky to do cleanly with Flexbox.</p><p>Example: Overlapping Text on an Image</p><p>Let’s create a card where text overlaps an image.</p><div><pre><code>&lt;!-- In index.html --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"grid-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" class=\"image\" alt=\"A cool image\"&gt;\n  &lt;h2 class=\"title\"&gt;Cool Title&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>/* In styles.css */\n.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n  grid-template-rows: 200px; /* Single row for simplicity */\n  place-items: center; /* Center items */\n}\n\n.image {\n  grid-column: 1;\n  grid-row: 1;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n.title {\n  grid-column: 1;\n  grid-row: 1;\n  color: white;\n  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Why Grid? Both the image and title are in the same grid cell (grid-column: 1 and grid-row: 1), so they overlap. Grid’s precise placement makes this a breeze, while Flexbox would require absolute positioning or other workarounds.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. You Want Easy Responsive Layouts\n</h3><p>CSS Grid’s auto-fit and minmax() functions make responsive layouts a snap, letting the grid adapt to the screen size without tons of media queries. Flexbox can do responsive layouts, but it often requires more CSS or restructuring for complex grids.</p><p>Example: A Responsive Card Layout</p><p>Let’s create a card layout that adjusts the number of columns based on screen size.</p><div><pre><code>&lt;!-- In index.html --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"grid-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;Card 1&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;Card 2&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;Card 3&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;Card 4&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>/* In styles.css */\n.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr));\n  gap: 10px;\n}\n\n.card {\n  background-color: #2ecc71;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Why Grid? The repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr)) creates as many columns as will fit, with each column at least 150px wide but stretching to fill space. On a wide screen, you might get four columns; on a phone, it might drop to one or two. Flexbox could wrap items with flex-wrap, but you’d have less control over column sizes and spacing without extra CSS.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. You’re Building a Full-Page Layout\n</h3><p>For full-page layouts with multiple sections (like a header, sidebar, main area, and footer), CSS Grid’s grid-template-areas makes it easy to visualize and manage the structure.</p><p>Let’s revisit the dashboard example, but this time for a blog with a sticky sidebar.</p><div><pre><code>&lt;!-- In index.html --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"grid-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;header class=\"header\"&gt;Blog Header&lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;aside class=\"sidebar\"&gt;Blog Sidebar&lt;/aside&gt;\n  &lt;main class=\"main\"&gt;Blog Posts&lt;/main&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>/* In styles.css */\n.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr; /* Sidebar and main content */\n  grid-template-rows: 80px 1fr; /* Header and content */\n  grid-template-areas:\n    \"header header\"\n    \"sidebar main\";\n  min-height: 100vh;\n  gap: 10px;\n}\n\n.header { grid-area: header; background-color: #3498db; color: white; padding: 10px; }\n.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; background-color: #2ecc71; color: white; padding: 10px; position: sticky; top: 0; }\n.main { grid-area: main; background-color: #ecf0f1; padding: 10px; }\n</code></pre></div><p>Why Grid? The grid-template-areas property lets you map out the layout visually, and Grid handles the two-dimensional structure effortlessly. Flexbox could work for parts of this (like aligning items in the header), but it’s less intuitive for the full layout.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When to Use Flexbox Instead\n</h2><ul><li>You’re aligning items in a single row or column, like a navigation bar or a list of buttons:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>.nav {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n</code></pre></div><ul><li><p>You need flexible sizes for items that grow or shrink based on content, like a form where inputs stretch to fill space.</p></li><li><p>You’re working inside a grid cell. Grid and Flexbox play well together—use Grid for the big picture and Flexbox for aligning items within a section.</p></li></ul><p>Example: Flexbox for a Navigation Bar</p><div><pre><code>&lt;!-- In index.html --&gt;\n&lt;nav class=\"nav\"&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>/* In styles.css */\n.nav {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-around;\n  background-color: #3498db;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.nav a {\n  color: white;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Why Flexbox? This is a simple, one-dimensional row of links. Flexbox’s justify-content makes spacing them out a breeze, and Grid would be overkill here.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Combining Grid and Flexbox\n</h2><p>You don’t always have to choose! Use Grid for the overall page structure and Flexbox for smaller components within grid cells. For example, in the blog layout above, you could use Flexbox inside the .main area to align blog post cards in a row.</p><div><pre><code>.main {\n  grid-area: main;\n  display: flex; /* Flexbox inside a Grid area */\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 10px;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Choose CSS Grid when you need a two-dimensional layout, precise item placement, overlapping elements, responsive grids with minimal effort, or full-page layouts. It’s like a master architect for your webpage. Go for Flexbox when you’re working with one-dimensional layouts or need flexible alignment within a single row or column.</p>","contentLength":9352,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Error Handling in JavaScript: try-catch, Throwing, and Real-World Practices","url":"https://dev.to/sadanandgadwal/the-ultimate-guide-to-error-handling-in-javascript-try-catch-throwing-and-real-world-practices-2kca","date":1751262065,"author":"Sadanand gadwal","guid":176344,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Errors are inevitable.

If you're nodding along, you're not alone. Poor documentation is the silent productivity killer plaguing development teams worldwide.</p><p>But what if I told you that Netflix has cracked the code for creating documentation that developers want to read? Their approach has revolutionised how they onboard engineers, maintain consistency across teams, and scale their engineering culture. </p><p><strong>Today, we'll dive deep into their methodology and explore how you can apply these principles</strong> to transform your documentation strategy.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Most Developer Documentation Falls Flat\n</h2><p>Before diving into Netflix's approach, let's acknowledge the elephant in the room. Traditional developer documentation fails because it treats information transfer like a data dump rather than a conversation. Here are the usual suspects:</p><ul><li>: Dense paragraphs that make developers feel like they're reading legal documents rather than helpful guides.</li><li>: Documentation written by experts who've forgotten what it's like to be new to a system, library, or framework.</li><li><strong>The Maintenance Nightmare</strong>: Outdated examples, broken links, and deprecated methods that make developers question everything they read.</li><li>: Code snippets floating in space without real-world context or explanation of why specific approaches work better than others.</li></ul><blockquote><p> If you've ever copy-pasted code from documentation only to spend three hours debugging why it doesn't work in your specific environment, you've experienced these pain points firsthand.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Netflix Documentation Philosophy: Code as Storytelling\n</h2><p>Netflix approached documentation with the same mindset it uses for content creation -understanding its audience and delivering value that keeps people engaged. <strong>Their developer documentation isn't just functional; it's compelling.</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Start with the Problem, Not the Solution\n</h3><p>Netflix documentation begins by acknowledging the developer's pain point. Instead of jumping straight into implementation details, they frame the problem context first. This approach mirrors how developers think – we start with a problem to solve, not a feature to implement.</p><p>For example, rather than starting with \"Here's how to use our caching library,\" Netflix documentation begins with \"Dealing with latency issues in microservices? Here's how our caching approach solved similar challenges at scale.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Progressive Disclosure for Different Skill Levels\n</h3><p>Netflix structures its documentation with multiple entry points. New developers get quick-start guides with working examples they can run immediately. Experienced developers can delve into advanced configurations and edge cases. This layered approach ensures everyone finds value without overwhelming beginners or boring experts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Real Production Examples\n</h3><p>Netflix doesn't rely on toy examples. Their documentation showcases real code patterns used in production systems handling millions of users. This builds trust and provides developers with battle-tested solutions rather than theoretical concepts.</p><h2><strong>The Netflix Documentation Framework: Breaking Down the Strategy</strong></h2><h2><strong>1. Start with the Developer Journey</strong></h2><p>Netflix maps out typical developer workflows and designs documentation to support each stage:</p><ul><li>Environment setup (with one-click scripts)</li><li>\"Hello World\" examples that work</li><li>Common gotchas and troubleshooting</li></ul><ul><li>Code examples with full context</li><li>Best practices with reasoning</li></ul><ul></ul><h2><strong>The \"Story-Code-Context\" Pattern</strong></h2><p><strong>Every significant piece of Netflix documentation follows this structure:</strong></p><ol><li>: Why does this exist? What problem does it solve?</li><li>: Working examples that can be copy-pasted</li><li>: When to use it, when not to use it, alternatives</li></ol><p><strong>For example, instead of just documenting an API endpoint, they explain:</strong></p><ul><li>The business scenario that led to its creation</li><li>Complete request/response examples</li><li>Performance considerations</li></ul><h2><strong>Integrated Tooling and Workflow</strong></h2><p>Netflix doesn't treat documentation as a separate entity from the development workflow. They integrate it directly into their development process using tools and practices that make documentation maintenance seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Manage documents alongside project files</strong> in a unified workspace</li><li><strong>Organise documentation in folders</strong> that mirror the project structure</li><li> on documentation updates</li><li><strong>Integrate files from multiple sources</strong> (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) for comprehensive resource management</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Technical Writing Strategy That Works\n</h2><p>Developers don't read documentation linearly – they scan for relevant information. Netflix structures content with:</p><ul><li> that answer specific questions</li><li> highlighted with proper syntax highlighting</li><li> for important warnings or tips</li><li> that explain complex system interactions</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Write for Humans, Not Compilers\n</h3><p>Netflix documentation uses conversational language without sacrificing technical accuracy. They explain not just what to do but why certain approaches work better in specific contexts. This helps developers make informed decisions rather than unthinkingly following instructions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Include Failure Scenarios\n</h3><p>One of Netflix's most innovative documentation strategies is explicitly covering what can go wrong. They include common error messages, troubleshooting steps, and debugging tips. This proactive approach saves developers hours of frustration and builds confidence in the reliability of the documentation.</p><h2><strong>Practical Implementation: Tools and Techniques That Work</strong></h2><h2><strong>1. Documentation Toolchain</strong></h2><p>The right tools can make or break your documentation strategy. Here's what successful teams use:</p><ul><li>: Excellent for collaborative writing and knowledge bases</li><li>: Perfect for API documentation and technical guides</li><li>: Strong for enterprise teams with complex workflows</li></ul><ul><li>: For API documentation</li><li>: For inline code documentation</li><li>: For component documentation</li></ul><ul><li>: Automate documentation builds and deployments</li><li>: Connect documentation updates to team notifications</li><li>: Create quick video walkthroughs for complex processes</li></ul><p>Start every section with a working code example. Developers scan for code first and explanation second.</p><h3><strong>2. Use Progressive Enhancement</strong></h3><p>Structure content in layers:</p><ul></ul><h3><strong>3. Maintain a Consistent Voice</strong></h3><p>Establish style guidelines that align with your team's culture and values. Netflix uses a conversational, confident tone that reflects its engineering culture.</p><h3><strong>4. Implement Feedback Loops</strong></h3><p>Add simple feedback mechanisms:</p><ul><li>\"Was this helpful?\" buttons</li><li>Easy ways to suggest improvements</li><li>Regular documentation retrospectives</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing the Netflix Approach in Your Team\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Start with User Stories for Documentation\n</h3><p>Before writing a single line of documentation, ask: \"What is the developer trying to accomplish?\" Create user stories for your documentation:</p><ul><li>\"As a new team member, I want to set up the development environment in under 30 minutes.\"</li><li>\"As an API consumer, I want to understand rate limiting before I hit production issues.\"</li><li>\"As a debugging developer, I want to identify what went wrong with my integration quickly\"</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Create Documentation Templates\n</h3><p>Establish consistent patterns for different types of documentation:</p><h3><strong>API Documentation Template</strong>:\n</h3><ul><li>Rate limiting information</li></ul><ul><li>Step-by-step instructions</li><li>Common issues and solutions</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Implement Feedback Loops\n</h3><p>Netflix regularly surveys developers about the effectiveness of their documentation. Implement similar feedback mechanisms:</p><ul><li>Add \"Was this helpful?\" buttons to documentation pages</li><li>Monitor which sections have the highest bounce rates</li><li>Create dedicated Slack channels for documentation questions</li><li>Regular documentation review sessions with your team</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Make Documentation Part of the Development Process\n</h3><p>Documentation shouldn't be an afterthought. Integrate it into your development workflow:</p><ul><li>Include documentation updates in pull request templates</li><li>Make documentation review part of your code review process</li><li>Set up automated checks for broken links or outdated examples</li><li>Celebrate exemplary documentation contributions alongside code contributions</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Measuring Documentation Success\n</h2><p>Netflix measures the effectiveness of documentation through developer productivity metrics. Track similar indicators:</p><p>: How quickly can a new developer get a working example running?</p><p>: Are fewer developers asking questions that documentation should answer?</p><p>: How quickly do new team members become productive?</p><p><strong>Documentation Usage Analytics</strong>: Which sections get the most traffic? Where do people drop off?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The ROI of Better Documentation\n</h2><p>Investing time in better documentation pays dividends through:</p><p>: New developers become productive faster when they can find answers independently.</p><p>: Senior developers spend less time answering questions that good documentation could address.</p><p>: When developers understand best practices and common coding patterns, they write more consistent and maintainable code.</p><p>: Nothing frustrates developers more than being stuck on problems that should have easy solutions.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: Transform Your Documentation, Transform Your Team</strong></h2><p>Netflix's approach to documentation isn't just about writing better docs—it's about building a culture where knowledge sharing is valued, maintained, and continuously improved. By treating documentation as a product, focusing on developer journeys, and integrating documentation into your development workflow, you can create resources that your team wants to use.</p><p>The key is starting with the proper foundation.

Therefore, we need to extract templates.&nbsp;</p><p>The following simple posted two templates, this template must be used on the basis of a unified routing Library.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>@Entry\n  @Component\n  struct Index {\n    private pageStack: NavPathStack = new NavPathStack()\n\n    aboutToAppear() {\n      RouterModule.createRouter(RouterNameConstants.ENTRY_HAP, this.pageStack);\n    }\n\n    @Builder\n    routerMap(builderName: string, param: object) {\n      RouterModule.getBuilder(builderName).builder(param);\n    }\n\n    build() {\n      Navigation(this.pageStack) {\n        RelativeContainer() {\n\n        }\n        .width('100%')\n          .height('100%')\n      }.width('100%')\n        .height('100%')\n        .hideTitleBar(true)\n        .navDestination(this.routerMap);\n\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>@Component\n  struct TestPage {\n    build() {\n      Column() {\n        Text(\"chaild\")\n      }\n      .width('100%')\n        .height('100%')\n    }\n  }\n\n@Builder\n  export function TestBuilder(value: object) {\n    NavDestination() {\n      TestPage()\n    }\n    .hideTitleBar(true)\n  }\n\nconst builderName = BuilderNameConstants.Test;\nif (!RouterModule.getBuilder(builderName)) {\n  const builder: WrappedBuilder&lt;[object]&gt; = wrapBuilder(TestBuilder);\n  RouterModule.registerBuilder(builderName, builder);\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>the above two templates, especially sub-pages, we can't write so many redundant codes every time we create a page, which is obviously unreasonable.<strong>Routing library and plug-in dependencies</strong> item, for which extraction is performed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Second, encapsulate the unified routing static library.</strong></h2><p>in order to realize the interaction of various dynamic components, such as jumping between the main module and the dynamic shared package, the dynamic shared package and the dynamic shared package, the dynamic shared package and the static shared package, etc., a unified routing component library must be used as a bridge. This library can be directly placed in the business layer. Its main function is to configure the relevant functions of routing. For specific relevant tools, see the previous article.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Third, analyze which need plug-ins to complete automatically</strong></h2><p>in normal development, we can write the page normally without any other additional configuration. The routing operation should be consistent with the routing operation of the mobile terminal. Only a simple annotation is required. Based on this logic, one of the sub-page registration configuration, NavDestination configuration, etc. can be extracted.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal subpages should be clean and flawless, that is, simple UI components, and the rest should be generated by the plug-in itself and configured by itself.</p><div><pre><code>@RouterPath(\"entry_test\")\n  @Component\n  export struct TestPage {\n    build() {\n\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre></div><p>The second is the dynamic import of each sub-page. In the previous article, it was manually configured in Initialization. For this complicated program, it should also be configured by plug-ins.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>routing library and plug-in dependencies</strong></h2><p>the above three points are just a simple understanding of which templates are used as generation and which codes need to be extracted. These steps have been encapsulated. Let's take a brief look at the implementation of the encapsulated routing function.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>First step, configure dependencies</strong></h3><p>Method 1: Set the three-party package dependency in the oh-package.json5 that needs the Module. The configuration example is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>\"dependencies\": { \"@abner/router\": \"^1.0.2\"}\n</code></pre></div><p>method 2: in the Terminal window, run the following command to install the third-party package. DevEco Studio automatically adds the third-party package dependency to the project oh-package.json5. Suggestion: Execute the command under the module path used.</p><div><pre><code>ohpm install @abner/router\n</code></pre></div><h3><strong>The second step, configure the plug-in</strong></h3><p>before configuring the plug-in, be sure to protect your&nbsp;<strong>all modules used for routing</strong> all depend on @ abner/router, of course you can also use middleware to rely on.&nbsp;</p><p>locate the hvigor directory in the project and configure the plug-in in the dependencies hvigor-config.json5 file.&nbsp;</p><p>The code is as follows: the current version is: 1.0.8</p><div><pre><code>\"dependencies\": {\n  \"ohos-router\": \"1.0.8\"\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>execute the plug-in method, open the hvigorfile.ts file in the root directory, and import the method in the plugins array:</p><div><pre><code>plugins:[\n  abnerRouter()\n]\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>import { abnerRouter } from 'ohos-router/router-plugin';\n</code></pre></div><p>after the plug-in is completed, compile the project, and you will find that in each Module, a routing configuration file will be generated, named after the Module name + RouterConfig.&nbsp;</p><p>This routing configuration file is automatically generated and does not need to be changed under special circumstances. Of course, you can make manual corrections under special circumstances.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>@Entry\n  @Component\n  struct Index {\n    private navPathStack: NavPathStack = new NavPathStack()\n\n    aboutToAppear() {\n      routerInitNavPathStack(this.navPathStack)\n    }\n\n    @Builder\n    routerMap(builderName: string, param: Object) {\n      routerReturnBuilder(builderName).builder(param)\n    }\n\n    build() {\n      Navigation(this.navPathStack) {\n        RelativeContainer() {\n\n        }\n        .height('100%')\n          .width('100%')\n      }.navDestination(this.routerMap)\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre></div><p>The subpage does not have a template. You can write UI normally. You need to configure an annotation @ RouterPath to set an alias. This alias requires the module name + alias.</p><div><pre><code>@RouterPath(\"entry_test\")\n  @Component\n  export struct TestPage {\n    build() {\n\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre></div><h2></h2><p>startPage supports jumping under its own Module and cross-component mode.</p><div><pre><code>startPage(\"entry_main\") //\n</code></pre></div><p>supports common data passing, such as objects, strings, arrays, etc.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>startPage(\"shared_show_params\", { param: \"string\" })\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>startPage(\"shared_show_params\", { param: 100 })\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>startPage(\"shared_show_params\", { param: true })\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>startPage(\"shared_show_params\", { param: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] })\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>startPage(\"shared_show_params\", { param: new SharedBean() })\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>startPage(\"shared_show_params\", { param: { \"name\": \"AbnerMing\", \"age\": 20 } })\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>let map = new HashMap&lt;string, Object&gt;()\nmap.set(\"name\", \"AbnerMing\")\nmap.set(\"age\", 18)\nstartPage(\"shared_show_params\", { param: map })\n</code></pre></div><p>get the data passed by the previous page through the getRouterParams() method.</p><div><pre><code>aboutToAppear(): void {\n  let params = routerGetParams()\n  // let map = params as number//number\n  // let map = params?.toString() //string\n  // let map = params as boolean //boolean\n  // let map = params as string[] //array\n  // let map = params as SharedBean //obj\n  // let map = params as HashMap&lt;string, Object&gt;//map\n\n}\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>Return to the previous page\n\n&nbsp;</li></ol><ol><li>Return to the specified page&nbsp;</li></ol><div><pre><code>finishPageToName(\"entry_back_01\")\n</code></pre></div><p>6, directly return to the home page</p><p>when jumping, use result to listen for the returned parameters.</p><div><pre><code>startPage(\"static_return_params\", {\n  result: (params) =&gt; {\n\n    console.log(\"==========\" + params?.toString())\n  }\n})\n</code></pre></div><p>When destroying the page, you can carry the return data.</p><div><pre><code>finishPage({ param: \"data\" })\n</code></pre></div><p>When a subcomponent uses NavDestination, it conflicts with the component lifecycle.

Let's take a common example.&nbsp;</p><p>Example A simple outline to facilitate our intuitive understanding:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Understand the life cycle of Navigation.</strong></p><p><strong>2, Navigation common property methods.</strong></p><p><strong>3, NavPathStack common attribute methods.</strong></p><p><strong>4. How to use code to dynamically configure routing tables.</strong></p><h2><strong>First, understand the life cycle of Navigation.</strong></h2><p>You can verify a problem. When the Navigation component is used, there will be a common problem, that is, the onPageShow and onPageHide declaration cycle of subpages will not go.</p><div><pre><code>aboutToAppear(): void {\n  console.log(\"===：aboutToAppear\")\n}\n\nonPageShow(): void {\n  console.log(\"===：onPageShow\")\n}\n\nonPageHide(): void {\n  console.log(\"===：onPageHide\")\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>When jumping to the target page, the console only prints the aboutToAppear:&nbsp;</p><p>the main reason is that,&nbsp;as a routing container, the Navigation lifecycle is hosted on the NavDestination component and opened in the form of component events.&nbsp;</p><p>How to know the display or hiding of the page, or switch the foreground and background, need to pass&nbsp;the life cycle method of NavDestination is obtained:</p><div><pre><code>OnWillShow: The NavDestination component is executed before the layout is displayed, and the page is not visible at this time (switching the application to the foreground will not trigger it).\nOnShown: Execute after the layout of the NavDestination component is displayed, and the page layout is now complete.\nOnWillHide: Execute before the NavDestination component triggers hiding (application switching to the background will not trigger it).\nOnHidden: Execute after the NavDestination component triggers hiding (push the non stack top page to the stack, pop the stack top page to the stack, or switch the application to the background)\n</code></pre></div><h2><strong>II. Navigation Common Attribute Methods</strong></h2><p>it should be noted that although Navigation provides many methods, in actual development, only a handful of them are used, because in general, we don't need any Navigation bar or title bar. After all, the system does not conform to our UI design and only needs to be hidden.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the title bar provided is shown below, which can match the actual UI, which can be said to be very low. Of course, if your design is similar, you can use the system completely.</p><p>1, title, set the page title&nbsp;</p><p>that is, the main title in the above figure is directly set as follows:</p><p>due&nbsp; the subtitle is obsolete, and the official alternative is to use title instead:</p><div><pre><code>.title(this.NavigationTitle)\n</code></pre></div><p>customize the layout via @ Builder.</p><div><pre><code>@Builder NavigationTitle() {\n  Column() {\n    Text('Title')\n      .fontColor('#182431')\n      .fontSize(30)\n      .lineHeight(41)\n      .fontWeight(700)\n    Text('subtitle')\n      .fontColor('#182431')\n      .fontSize(14)\n      .lineHeight(19)\n      .opacity(0.4)\n      .margin({ top: 2, bottom: 20 })\n  }.alignItems(HorizontalAlign.Start)\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>2,&nbsp;menus&nbsp;,&nbsp;settings page upper right corner menu</p><div><pre><code>.menus(this.NavigationMenus)\n</code></pre></div><p>customize the layout via @ Builder.</p><div><pre><code>@Builder\n  NavigationMenus() {\n    Row() {\n      Image($r(\"app.media.app_icon\"))\n        .width(24)\n        .height(24)\n      Image($r(\"app.media.app_icon\"))\n        .width(24)\n        .height(24)\n        .margin({ left: 24 })\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre></div><p>3,&nbsp;titleMode&nbsp;,&nbsp;set Page Title Bar Display Mode&nbsp;</p><p>currently, there are three official models,&nbsp;full: fixed to large title mode,&nbsp;Mini&nbsp;:&nbsp;fixed to subtitle mode,&nbsp;free: When the content is a scrollable component with a full screen, the title shrinks as the content scrolls up (the size of the subtitle does not change and fades out). Scroll the content down to the top and return to the original.&nbsp;</p><p>4,&nbsp;backButtonIcon&nbsp;,&nbsp;set the return key icon in the title bar</p><div><pre><code>.backButtonIcon(new SymbolGlyphModifier($r('app.media.app_icon')))\n</code></pre></div><p>5,&nbsp;mode&nbsp;,&nbsp;display mode of the navigation bar&nbsp;</p><p>set the display mode of the navigation bar. Supports Stack, Split, and Auto modes.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, there are many attributes. If you use the title bar provided by the system, try to get familiar with the government. In actual development, these are actually unnecessary and can be hidden directly.&nbsp;</p><p>When we do not set anything, we will find that the content area cannot be covered completely. This is due to the title bar. We only need to hide it.&nbsp;</p><p>of course, NavDestination also has the hideTitleBar attribute. If you use your own UI title bar, you also need to set it to true.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>III. Common Attribute Methods of NavPathStack</strong></h2><p>NavPathStack is&nbsp;the Navigation routing stack is used to manage routes, such as jump, removal, etc. It is very important. For several common attributes, let's briefly talk about them.&nbsp;</p><p>the page redirects the information of the NavDestination page specified by info to the stack.</p><div><pre><code>this.pageStack.pushPath({ name: \"TestPage\" })\n</code></pre></div><p>Two parameters, one is NavPathInfo and the other is NavigationOptions. This is the version of api12 +. If it is the following version, the second parameter is boolean type, which means&nbsp;whether to support transition animation.</p><p>NavPathInfo&nbsp;object, name refers to the name of the NavDestination page, param is the parameter passed, and onPop is the callback returned when the NavDestination page triggers pop.&nbsp;</p><p>Such as passing parameters</p><div><pre><code>this.pageStack.pushPath({ name: \"TestPage\",param:\"params\"})\n</code></pre></div><p>the second parameter, NavigationOptions, can be set&nbsp;the operation mode and Transition animation of the page stack, such as setting&nbsp;find from the bottom of the stack to the top of the stack&nbsp;support Transition animation:</p><div><pre><code>this.pageStack.pushPath({ name: \"TestPage\",param:\"params\"},{\n  launchMode:LaunchMode.POP_TO_SINGLETON,\n  animated:true\n})\n</code></pre></div><p>the NavDestination page information specified by name is added to the stack.</p><div><pre><code>this.pageStack.pushPathByName(\"TestPage\",\"params\")\n</code></pre></div><p>Three parameters, the first refers to the NavDestination page name, the second is the passed parameter, and the last is&nbsp;boolean type,&nbsp;whether to support transition animation.&nbsp;</p><p>and&nbsp;consistent pushPath,&nbsp;add the information of the NavDestination page specified by info to the stack, and use the Promise asynchronous callback to return the interface call result.&nbsp;</p><p>and&nbsp;pushPathByName is consistent,Add the NavDestination page information specified by name to the stack, and use the Promise asynchronous callback to return the interface call result.&nbsp;</p><p>the parameter is the same as that of pushPath, which is mainly used to replace page stack operations.&nbsp;</p><p>and&nbsp;the parameters of pushPathByName are the same,&nbsp;exit the top of the current page stack and push the page specified by name into the stack.</p><div><pre><code>this.pageStack.replacePathByName(\"TestPage\",\"params\",true)\n</code></pre></div><p>The top element of the routing stack pops up, that is, the current page is destroyed, and the onPop callback is triggered to pass in the page processing result.</p><div><pre><code>this.pageStack.pop(\"result\")\n</code></pre></div><p>roll back the routing stack to the first NavDestination page named name from the bottom of the stack.&nbsp;, and&nbsp;pop&nbsp;, used in the same way, but the first parameter is.&nbsp;The NavDestination page name.&nbsp;</p><p>roll back the routing stack to the NavDestination page specified by index&nbsp;, and&nbsp;pop&nbsp;, used in the same way, but the first parameter is.&nbsp;The index of the page stack.&nbsp;</p><p>Move the first NavDestination page named name from the bottom of the stack to the top of the stack.&nbsp;</p><p>moves the NavDestination page specified by index to the top of the stack.&nbsp;</p><p>clears all pages in the stack.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Fourth, how to use code to dynamically configure the routing table.</strong></h2><p>At the beginning, we used the statically configured route to realize the jump.

On the main page, we declare Navigation and pass NavPathStack. Then the subpage does not have NavPathStack object. How to jump?

Let's talk about the difference between activity and impact, and why it's crucial for your team's health and performance.\n</h2><p>My frustration as a manager hit its peak when I faced a harsh reality: my project board was a fantasy.</p><p>I saw tickets in the \"Done\" column, but when it came to validation, the deliverables were broken, incomplete, or far from reality. My team was active, but they weren't effective.</p><p>Without realizing it, I was the director of a full-blown \"Productivity Theater,\" and the script was being written by a set of deeply flawed metrics. This is a trap many leaders and teams are falling into in the remote era.</p><p>The Rise of \"Productivity Theater\"\n\"Productivity Theater\" is the phenomenon where employees, feeling the pressure to appear busy, dedicate significant time and energy to simulating activity rather than producing effective work.</p><p>And it's not a minor issue. A startling report from Visier (2023) found that 43% of employees spend more than 10 hours per week on this kind of performative work.</p><p>Why does this happen? The social psychologist Dr. Devon Price, in his book \"Laziness Does Not Exist,\" argues that our culture has ingrained in us a \"Laziness Lie\"—a belief system that equates our self-worth with our productivity. This pushes developers and knowledge workers to work until they're sick and feel immense guilt for not \"doing enough,\" making it essential to look busy at all times.</p><p>Vanity Metrics: The Fuel for the Fire\nThis \"theater\" is fueled by a leader's obsession with Vanity Metrics. These are metrics that are easy to measure but offer little to no real insight into performance or impact.</p><p>In a dev team, this looks like:</p><p>Frequency of Slack messages</p><p>This approach is fundamentally at odds with the nature of deep, valuable work. As Cal Newport explains in his book \"Deep Work,\" knowledge work is divided into two types:</p><p>Deep Work: \"Activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\" </p><p>Shallow Work: \"Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.\" </p><p>When you measure 'keystrokes' instead of quality, you are actively encouraging and rewarding Shallow Work, leading directly to burnout and poor outcomes.</p><p>The Solution: Shift from Activity to Impact\nThe change begins when we start asking different questions and measuring what truly matters. We need to shift our focus from Input (activity) to Output (results) and Outcome (impact).</p><p>Here's a simple framework contrasting these approaches:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Why It's Dangerous / Useful</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Fosters digital presenteeism, doesn't reflect real focus, leads to burnout.</td><td>Trust your team with flexibility.</td></tr><tr><td> Promotes quantity over quality. A single, well-thought-out commit is worth more than 10 minor ones.</td><td>Encourage effective, asynchronous communication and meaningful code contributions.</td></tr><tr><td>Sprint Velocity / Cycle Time</td><td> Measures the actual pace of delivery and helps identify process bottlenecks.</td><td>Set clear goals (SMART), realistic deadlines, and track progress.</td></tr><tr><td>Code Quality (e.g., bug rate, test coverage)</td><td> Reflects the effectiveness and craftsmanship of the work, directly impacting user satisfaction and maintainability.</td><td>Define quality standards, implement code reviews, and offer constructive feedback.</td></tr><tr><td> Directly links the team's technical work to strategic business results.</td><td>Ensure team goals are aligned with company OKRs.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>What's Your Experience?\nThis isn't just a management theory; it's a reality in our terminals and IDEs every day. The push for performative work is one of the biggest drains on developer morale and a direct path to burnout.</p><p>So, I'm asking you, the developers and tech leads in the trenches:</p><p>What's the most absurd vanity metric you've been judged by? Lines of code? Number of PRs?</p><p>Or, on the flip side, what's the most effective impact-based metric your team uses that you actually find valuable?</p><p>Share your stories (the good, the bad, and the ugly) in the comments below!</p><p>Closing Thought\nFighting against vanity metrics isn't about working less; it's about reclaiming our ability to work on what matters.

Initially, synchronous processing caused the app to freeze with big inputs. I switched to asynchronous processing and added a loading state to improve performance.</p><p>The copy-to-clipboard feature also needed refinement.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through a well-structured Jupyter notebook designed for fine-tuning Mistral-7B using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and 4-bit quantization on a GPU-enabled environment. This notebook, optimized for platforms like Kaggle or Colab, ensures reproducibility and efficiency. Whether you're a machine learning practitioner or a researcher, this tutorial will help you understand the process and adapt it for your own projects.</p><p><strong>Why Fine-Tune Mistral-7B?</strong>\nMistral-7B, developed by Mistral AI, is a 7-billion-parameter model known for its efficiency and performance in natural language processing tasks. Fine-tuning it for scientific research allows you to tailor its responses to domain-specific jargon, hypotheses, and datasets, improving accuracy and relevance. By using techniques like LoRA and quantization, we can make this process computationally feasible on consumer-grade GPUs like the NVIDIA Tesla T4.</p><p>\nThe notebook is structured for clarity and efficiency, following a clear workflow:</p><ul><li>Imports: All dependencies are listed upfront.</li><li>Functions: Modular functions handle specific tasks like model loading, dataset preparation, and training.</li><li>Main Execution: The main() function orchestrates the workflow.</li><li>CPU/GPU Division: Data preparation runs on the CPU, while model training leverages the GPU.</li><li>Token Batching: The notebook uses a batch size and sequence length to manage memory, with notes on implementing a custom 100M/30M token strategy for large datasets.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive into the key components and how they work together.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Setting Up the Environment</strong>\nThe notebook begins by installing and importing essential libraries, ensuring compatibility with GPU acceleration. Key dependencies include:</p><p>Transformers: For model and tokenizer handling.\nBitsAndBytes: For 4-bit quantization to reduce memory usage.<p>\nPEFT: For LoRA implementation.</p>\nTRL: For supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with the SFTTrainer.<p>\nDatasets: For loading and processing datasets.</p>\nPyTorch: For GPU computations.</p><p>Here’s a snippet of the import section:</p><div><pre><code>import os\nimport torch\nimport json\nimport gc\nfrom huggingface_hub import login\nfrom transformers import (\n    AutoModelForCausalLM,\n    AutoTokenizer,\n    BitsAndBytesConfig,\n    TrainingArguments,\n    DataCollatorForLanguageModeling\n)\nfrom peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom trl import SFTTrainer\n</code></pre></div><p>The notebook also checks library versions and GPU availability, ensuring the environment is correctly configured:\nprint(f\"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}\")<p>\nprint(f\"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}\")</p>\n!nvidia-smi</p><p>To authenticate with Hugging Face for model and dataset access, the notebook uses a token stored in Kaggle Secrets:</p><div><pre><code>def hf_login():\n    try:\n        client = UserSecretsClient()\n        token = client.get_secret(\"HF_TOKEN\")\n        login(token=token)\n        print(\"Hugging Face login complete.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to access HF_TOKEN: {e}\")\n        raise\n</code></pre></div><p>\nA Config class centralizes all hyperparameters and paths, making it easy to modify settings without digging through the code. Key parameters include:</p><p>Model Name: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\nDataset Name: Allanatrix/Scientific_Research_Tokenized<p>\nSequence Length: 1024 tokens</p>\nBatch Size: 1 (with gradient accumulation to simulate larger batches)\nEpochs: 2<p>\nOutput Directories: For saving results and artifacts</p></p><div><pre><code>class Config:\n    MODEL_NAME = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\"\n    DATASET_NAME = \"Allanatrix/Scientific_Research_Tokenized\"\n    NEW_MODEL_NAME = \"nexa-mistral-sci7b\"\n    MAX_SEQ_LENGTH = 1024\n    BATCH_SIZE = 1\n    GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS = 64\n    LEARNING_RATE = 2e-5\n    NUM_TRAIN_EPOCHS = 2\n    OUTPUT_DIR = \"/kaggle/working/results\"\n    ARTIFACTS_DIR = \"/kaggle/working/artifacts\"\n</code></pre></div><p>This configuration is also exportable as JSON for reproducibility:</p><div><pre><code>def to_dict(self):\n    return {k: v for k, v in vars(self).items() if not k.startswith('__') and not callable(getattr(self, k))}\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 3: Loading the Model and Tokenizer</strong>\nThe get_model_and_tokenizer function loads Mistral-7B with 4-bit quantization to reduce memory usage, enabling it to run on a single Tesla T4 GPU. The BitsAndBytesConfig specifies:</p><p>4-bit Quantization: Using the nf4 type.\nCompute Data Type: bfloat16 for faster GPU computations.<p>\nDevice Map: Loads the model onto GPU 0.</p></p><p>The tokenizer is configured with the end-of-sequence token as the padding token and right-side padding for causal language modeling.</p><div><pre><code>def get_model_and_tokenizer(model_name: str):\n    bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n        load_in_4bit=True,\n        bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n        bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n        bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=False,\n    )\n    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n        model_name,\n        quantization_config=bnb_config,\n        trust_remote_code=True,\n        device_map={\"\": 0}\n    )\n    model.config.use_cache = False\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)\n    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token\n    tokenizer.padding_side = \"right\"\n    return model, tokenizer\n</code></pre></div><p>Memory management is critical, so the function includes calls to torch.cuda.empty_cache() and gc.collect() to free up GPU and CPU memory.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Preparing the Dataset</strong>\nThe load_and_prepare_dataset function handles dataset loading and tokenization on the CPU to avoid GPU memory bottlenecks. It loads the Allanatrix/Scientific_Research_Tokenized dataset from Hugging Face and tokenizes the input_text column with a maximum sequence length of 1024 tokens. Empty sequences are filtered out to ensure data quality.</p><div><pre><code>def load_and_prepare_dataset(dataset_name: str, tokenizer: AutoTokenizer, max_seq_length: int):\n    dataset = load_dataset(dataset_name)\n    def tokenize_function(examples):\n        return tokenizer(\n            examples[\"input_text\"],\n            truncation=True,\n            max_length=max_seq_length\n        )\n    tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(\n        tokenize_function,\n        batched=True,\n        remove_columns=[col for col in dataset[\"train\"].column_names if col != \"input_ids\"],\n        desc=\"Tokenizing dataset\"\n    )\n    tokenized_dataset = tokenized_dataset.filter(lambda x: len(x[\"input_ids\"]) &gt; 0, desc=\"Filtering empty sequences\")\n    return tokenized_dataset\n</code></pre></div><p>The notebook mentions a \"100M token pool, feed 30M until 100M\" strategy, which would require a custom IterableDataset for streaming large datasets. While not fully implemented here, the MAX_SEQ_LENGTH and BATCH_SIZE settings control token batching, and group_by_length in the training arguments optimizes padding efficiency.</p><p>\nLoRA is used to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, reducing memory and compute requirements. The get_lora_config function sets up LoRA with:</p><p>Rank (r): 64\nAlpha: 16\nTask Type: Causal language modeling</p><div><pre><code>def get_lora_config():\n    lora_config = LoraConfig(\n        lora_alpha=16,\n        lora_dropout=0.1,\n        r=64,\n        bias=\"none\",\n        task_type=\"CAUSAL_LM\",\n    )\n    return lora_config\n</code></pre></div><p>The model is prepared for LoRA fine-tuning with gradient checkpointing and quantization-aware training:</p><div><pre><code>model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()\nmodel = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)\nmodel = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)\nmodel.print_trainable_parameters()\n</code></pre></div><p>This reduces trainable parameters to approximately 0.375% of the total (27M out of 7.2B), significantly lowering memory usage.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Training Arguments</strong>\nThe get_training_arguments function configures the TrainingArguments for the SFTTrainer. Key settings include:</p><p>Batch Size: 1 per device, with 64 gradient accumulation steps to simulate a larger batch size.\nLearning Rate: 2e-5 with a cosine scheduler.<p>\nOptimizer: Paged AdamW in 8-bit precision.</p>\nPrecision: bf16 for faster training.<p>\nLogging and Saving: Every 25 steps, with TensorBoard reporting.</p>\nGroup by Length: To minimize padding and optimize GPU utilization.</p><div><pre><code>def get_training_arguments(config: Config):\n    training_args = TrainingArguments(\n        output_dir=config.OUTPUT_DIR,\n        num_train_epochs=config.NUM_TRAIN_EPOCHS,\n        per_device_train_batch_size=config.BATCH_SIZE,\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=config.GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS,\n        optim=\"paged_adamw_8bit\",\n        save_steps=25,\n        logging_steps=25,\n        learning_rate=config.LEARNING_RATE,\n        weight_decay=0.001,\n        bf16=True,\n        max_grad_norm=0.3,\n        warmup_ratio=0.03,\n        group_by_length=True,\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"cosine\",\n        report_to=\"tensorboard\"\n    )\n    return training_args\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 7: Fine-Tuning the Model</strong>\nThe fine_tune_model function uses the SFTTrainer from the TRL library to perform supervised fine-tuning. It combines the model, dataset, tokenizer, LoRA configuration, and training arguments. The DataCollatorForLanguageModeling handles batch preparation, moving data to the GPU asynchronously during training.</p><div><pre><code>def fine_tune_model(model, dataset, tokenizer, lora_config, training_args, max_seq_length):\n    data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)\n    trainer = SFTTrainer(\n        model=model,\n        train_dataset=dataset[\"train\"],\n        peft_config=lora_config,\n        dataset_text_field=\"input_ids\",\n        max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n        tokenizer=tokenizer,\n        args=training_args\n    )\n    trainer.train()\n    return trainer\n</code></pre></div><p>The training process runs for 2 epochs, with progress logged to TensorBoard.</p><p>\nAfter training, the save_model_artifacts function saves the fine-tuned model, tokenizer, training configuration, and arguments to the artifacts directory. These files ensure the model can be reloaded or shared later.</p><div><pre><code>def save_model_artifacts(trainer: SFTTrainer, config: Config, training_args: TrainingArguments):\n    final_model_path = os.path.join(config.ARTIFACTS_DIR, config.NEW_MODEL_NAME)\n    trainer.save_model(final_model_path)\n    trainer.tokenizer.save_pretrained(final_model_path)\n    config_filename = os.path.join(config.ARTIFACTS_DIR, \"training_config.json\")\n    with open(config_filename, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(config.to_dict(), f, indent=4)\n    training_args_filename = os.path.join(config.ARTIFACTS_DIR, \"training_arguments.json\")\n    with open(training_args_filename, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(training_args.to_dict(), f, indent=4)\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 9: Running the Workflow</strong>\nThe main()function ties everything together, executing the workflow in a try-except block for robust error handling. It initializes the configuration, sets up directories, logs into Hugging Face, loads the model and dataset, configures LoRA and training arguments, fine-tunes the model, and saves the artifacts.</p><div><pre><code>def main():\n    config = Config()\n    os.makedirs(config.ARTIFACTS_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n    hf_login()\n    model, tokenizer = get_model_and_tokenizer(config.MODEL_NAME)\n    dataset = load_and_prepare_dataset(config.DATASET_NAME, tokenizer, config.MAX_SEQ_LENGTH)\n    lora_config = get_lora_config()\n    model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()\n    model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)\n    model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)\n    training_args = get_training_arguments(config)\n    trainer = fine_tune_model(model, dataset, tokenizer, lora_config, training_args, config.MAX_SEQ_LENGTH)\n    save_model_artifacts(trainer, config, training_args)\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Key Features and Optimizations</strong></p><ul><li>4-bit quantization reduces the model’s memory footprint.</li><li>Gradient checkpointing trades compute for memory.</li><li>Frequent calls to torch.cuda.empty_cache() and gc.collect() prevent memory leaks.</li></ul><ul><li>The notebook is designed for a single GPU but can be adapted for multi-GPU setups using accelerate.</li><li>The group_by_length option minimizes padding, improving training speed.</li></ul><ul><li>All configurations are saved as JSON files.</li><li>Library versions and GPU details are logged for debugging.</li><li>While not fully implemented, the notebook outlines a strategy for handling large datasets with a 100M/30M token approach, which could be extended with a custom IterableDataset.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges and Future Improvements</strong></p><ul><li>Dataset Size: The Allanatrix/Scientific_Research_Tokenized dataset may be small, as evidenced by the quick training (2 steps in the output). For real-world applications, you’d need a larger dataset or a custom streaming loader.</li><li>Custom Batching: Implementing the 100M/30M token strategy requires a custom data loader, which could be added using PyTorch’s IterableDataset.</li><li>Warnings: The notebook includes deprecated arguments (dataset_text_field, max_seq_length) in SFTTrainer. Future versions should use SFTConfig to avoid warnings.</li><li>Evaluation: The notebook focuses on training but lacks an evaluation step. Adding a validation dataset and metrics like perplexity would improve model assessment.</li></ul><ul><li>Use a Kaggle notebook with a Tesla T4 GPU or a Colab instance with a similar GPU.</li><li>Add your Hugging Face token to Kaggle Secrets as HF_TOKEN.</li><li>The notebook installs all required libraries. Ensure you restart the kernel if prompted.</li><li>Run the cells sequentially. The main() function handles the entire workflow.</li><li>Artifacts (model weights, tokenizer, configs) are saved to /kaggle/working/artifacts.</li><li>Training logs are available in TensorBoard.</li></ul><p>\nThis notebook provides a robust and reproducible framework for fine-tuning Mistral-7B on a scientific research dataset.

Microsoft.Visualstudio isn’t just about code; it’s about accelerating innovation and empowering developers to build the future.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"Microsoft.Visualstudio\"?\n</h3><p>\"Microsoft.Visualstudio\" in the context of Azure refers to a collection of services that provide a comprehensive suite of developer tools and capabilities within the Azure cloud. It's not a single service, but rather a resource provider encompassing Azure DevOps, and related services that facilitate the entire software development lifecycle – from source code management to continuous integration, continuous delivery, and testing. </p><p>Essentially, it solves the problems of managing complex development environments, automating build and release processes, and ensuring code quality and security.  Before Azure DevOps, many teams relied on self-hosted build servers, manual deployments, and disparate tools, leading to inefficiencies and increased risk.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the major components:</p><ul><li> Provides Git repositories for version control, collaboration, and code management.</li><li> Automates build, test, and deployment processes for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).</li><li> Offers agile planning tools for work item tracking, sprint planning, and Kanban boards.</li><li> Enables manual and automated testing, including test case management and exploratory testing.</li><li>  Manages package dependencies, including NuGet, npm, Maven, and Python packages.</li><li> Allows integration with a vast ecosystem of third-party tools and services.</li></ul><p>Real-world companies like GE Healthcare use Azure DevOps to manage the development of complex medical imaging software, ensuring regulatory compliance and rapid iteration.  Financial institutions leverage it for secure and auditable CI/CD pipelines for critical trading applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Use \"Microsoft.Visualstudio\"?\n</h3><p>Before adopting Azure DevOps, many organizations faced significant challenges:</p><ul><li> Teams used a patchwork of disconnected tools for version control, build automation, and testing, leading to integration headaches and data inconsistencies.</li><li> Manual deployment processes were time-consuming and error-prone, hindering the ability to deliver new features quickly.</li><li>  Managing and scaling on-premises build servers was expensive and complex.</li><li>  Lack of centralized control over code repositories and build agents increased the risk of security vulnerabilities.</li></ul><p>Industry-specific motivations are also strong.  For example:</p><ul><li>  Strict regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR) demand auditable and secure development processes.</li><li>  High-frequency trading applications require ultra-low latency and reliable deployments.</li><li>  Rapidly changing customer demands necessitate agile development and frequent releases.</li></ul><p>Let's look at a few user cases:</p><ul><li> A small team needs a simple, scalable CI/CD pipeline to deploy updates to their online store multiple times a day. Azure DevOps provides a cost-effective solution without the overhead of managing infrastructure.</li><li> A large organization needs to modernize its legacy applications and adopt a DevOps culture. Azure DevOps helps them automate their release processes, improve collaboration, and reduce risk.</li><li><strong>Research Institution (genomics):</strong> A team of scientists needs to manage large datasets and complex codebases.

Just like poorly written JIRA tickets lead to misaligned outcomes, <strong>vague or underspecified prompts</strong> yield irrelevant or suboptimal responses — wasting time, compute, and context windows.</p><p>This post distills the key elements of writing <strong>accurate, context-rich prompts</strong> that maximize the precision and utility of AI-generated outputs, especially for <strong>software engineering use cases</strong> like backend development, microservice design, and domain modeling.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Why Prompt Quality Matters\n</h2><p>AI models don’t \"understand\" your intent — they  it based on how clearly you communicate it. Unlike human teammates who can clarify ambiguity, AI will proceed with <strong>the most statistically likely interpretation</strong> of your words — which might not be what you meant.</p><ul><li>Incorrect assumptions (e.g., wrong frameworks)</li><li>Unscalable or anti-pattern-ridden code</li><li>Time wasted on post-generation correction</li></ul><p>Good prompts, on the other hand:</p><ul><li>Align with your tech stack and architectural patterns</li><li>Respect boundaries like DDD, Clean Architecture, etc.</li><li>Save hours by returning production-grade results, fast</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧠 The Anatomy of a High-Signal Prompt\n</h2><p>Here’s the framework I use to engineer precise prompts for LLMs — structured like a well-scoped engineering task.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 1. <strong>Clear Objective (What You Want)</strong></h3><p>Start by stating exactly what you need the AI to generate.</p><blockquote><p> “Write code for user stuff.” “Generate a Java Spring Boot REST controller for user registration with validation and exception handling.”</p></blockquote><p>Be direct. Imagine you’re giving a task to a senior engineer. Avoid vague nouns like “thing” or “stuff.”</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 2. <strong>Relevant Context (Where It Fits)</strong></h3><p>Briefly describe the system, architecture, or business domain. This reduces hallucinations and ensures the response fits your stack.</p><blockquote><p><em>“This is part of a DDD-based microservice responsible for user onboarding in a multi-tenant SaaS platform.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Don’t overload this section — the goal is to provide just enough scaffolding to guide model behavior.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 3. <strong>Constraints &amp; Preferences (How It Should Be Done)</strong></h3><ul><li>Frameworks (Spring Boot 3, Quarkus, etc.)</li><li>Design paradigms (Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.)</li><li>Libraries (MapStruct, Lombok, etc.)</li></ul><blockquote><p><em>“Follow Clean Architecture. Use Spring Boot 3, Jakarta Validation, and expose only DTOs through the controller layer.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Constraints reduce guesswork and lead to more tailored output.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 4. <strong>Expected Format (What It Should Look Like)</strong></h3><p>Tell the AI what format to return the result in — especially important if integrating it into a toolchain or documentation.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Respond with the full Java class using markdown code blocks, and no additional explanation.”</em></p></blockquote><ul><li>“Return as a markdown table”</li><li>“Code block with no imports”</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 5. <strong>Avoid Ambiguity (Precision in Language)</strong></h3><p>Use precise terminology. Instead of:</p><ul><li>“Do something with data” ➜ say “Transform persistence model into domain aggregate.”</li><li>“Make this easier” ➜ say “Refactor for separation of concerns between service and repository.”</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 6. <strong>Role Framing (Optional but Powerful)</strong></h3><p>Sometimes it helps to frame the AI’s mindset.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Act as a senior backend engineer with deep Spring Boot and DDD expertise. Help me refactor this service to align with tactical DDD.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Framing increases alignment with engineering tone and standards.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 7. <strong>Seed Example (Optional for Precision)</strong></h3><p>If you're expecting consistency (e.g., naming, structure, annotations), share a small example.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Here’s a sample DTO I use elsewhere. Maintain the same naming conventions and validation annotations.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This anchors the AI in your existing codebase structure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📌 Prompt Template for Engineers\n</h2><p>Here's a battle-tested template you can use and adapt across contexts:</p><div><pre><code>Act as a [role, e.g. senior software engineer].  \nI’m building [describe system/component].  \nGenerate [type of output] using [technologies/patterns].  \nThis [output] will be used for [brief purpose].  \nConstraints: [design rules, patterns, coding guidelines].  \nFormat: [e.g. code only, markdown, bullet points].  \n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧪 Example: Real Prompt for Spring Boot + DDD\n</h2><blockquote><p><em>Act as a senior Java engineer. I’m building a DDD-compliant user service in a Spring Boot 3 microservice architecture. Generate a REST controller for user registration. It should accept a , validate fields, and forward to the application layer. Include basic exception handling for validation errors. Use Jakarta Validation and Spring Web. Output Java code only.</em></p></blockquote><p>A highly contextual, ready-to-use Spring Boot controller that aligns with DDD principles, follows validation best practices, and avoids bloated boilerplate.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚙️ Bonus: Tips for Advanced Prompting\n</h2><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Break complex requests into multi-step prompts — e.g., first model, then controller, then tests.</td></tr><tr><td>Prompt the AI to review and suggest improvements to your own code.</td></tr><tr><td>Say “You are a performance tuning expert” or “You are a security-focused architect” for specialized help.</td></tr><tr><td>Store and reuse successful prompts like you would scripts or CLI commands.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As AI becomes a mainstay in software engineering workflows, your ability to <strong>communicate clearly and precisely with it</strong> will define your productivity. By mastering the anatomy of a high-signal prompt, you can turn AI into a reliable engineering partner — not just a glorified autocomplete.</p><blockquote><p> Write prompts like you’re writing a PR description for a critical production change. Context, clarity, and intent matter.</p></blockquote><p>To get the most accurate result from AI:</p><ul><li>Be explicit: What do you want, in what form, for what purpose?</li><li>Provide context: How does it fit in the system?</li><li>Specify constraints: Frameworks, patterns, naming, formatting</li><li>Reduce ambiguity: Use precise terminology</li><li>Optionally frame the AI as a domain expert</li></ul><p>Start building a  for your most common dev tasks — API scaffolding, DTO modeling, test generation, and more. Treat it like reusable infrastructure for your AI workflows.</p><p>Want to automate prompt generation based on project metadata?

CI/CD pipelines break. Logs become unreadable. Cross-environment lookups get fragile. And the next engineer wastes hours trying to guess what \"rg-prod-east-xyz\" is supposed to be.</p><p>In this post, I'll share a pattern I've used to solve this at scale.</p><p>I was working on a project with a customer that had a mature IT department with well-defined naming conventions — not just for VMs and switches, but for every on-prem resource you could imagine. To their credit, they'd already updated those standards to cover cloud resources, too, even though, at the time, they didn't have anything in Azure yet.</p><p>I'll admit I didn't love the naming convention. It was a bit… ugly. But the customer's always right. As we set up their new Azure environment using Terraform, we did our best to follow their guidelines.</p><p>But then the mistakes started.</p><p>Sometimes, someone forgets the correct order of the tokens in a resource name. Other times, a token would be left out. Or worse — someone would invent their own \"extension\" to the standard, tossing in an extra token to suit a team-specific use case.</p><p>Most of these mistakes were unintentional. But they caused real pain.</p><p>You might think, \"No big deal — just fix the name and redeploy.\"</p><p>Except we didn't always catch the problem early. In some cases, the resource was already in service, with data or downstream dependencies. Changing the name meant replacing the resource. Which, in practice, meant  with an incorrectly named, non-compliant resource. Forever.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: The  Property Is Too Flexible\n</h3><p>Every Azure resource has a  property, and that property accepts a plain string. Any string. No rules. No structure. It's just a blob of characters — valid as long as Azure doesn't reject it. But Azure's naming rules are based on technical constraints, not your company's naming conventions.</p><p>When building our Terraform modules, we followed the same pattern as the encapsulated resources. We created an input variable called , typed it as a string, and left it up to the individual developer calling the module to follow the documented naming convention.</p><p>Outside the module, we tried to help with local variables like  or  to build partial names more consistently. But at the end of the day, we were still pasting together fragments of strings. It was entirely up to each developer to get it right.</p><p>And inevitably, someone didn't.</p><p>Not because they didn't care — but because strings are easy to get wrong. Forget a token, change the order, add an extra piece \"just this once,\" and suddenly, you've got a non-compliant name. Terraform doesn't care. Azure doesn't care. But your platform team does.</p><p>The result? We ended up with a mix of:</p><ul><li>Partially named resources that didn't include environment or region</li><li>Overloaded names that stuffed in too much information</li><li>Resources that looked similar but didn't follow the real pattern</li></ul><p>Even with good intentions, we couldn't enforce naming consistency — because the system provided no guardrails.</p><p>Imagine every resource name is consistent. Compliant. Predictable.\nYou don't have to remember the order of tokens — or whether it's \"prod-east\" or \"east-prod.\" about naming — because it's generated for you, automatically, and always correct.</p><ul><li>Alerts and logs make sense, because the names they reference follow a known pattern.</li><li>Terraform can locate resources by convention — using  blocks and naming rules — instead of relying on remote outputs or hardcoded names.</li><li>You never have to choose between a painful resource migration or living with a non-compliant name.</li></ul><p>And best of all? <strong>Developers can't easily get it wrong.</strong></p><p>They don't pass in arbitrary strings anymore. Instead, they provide structured inputs — like environment, location, and service name — and let the naming logic handle the rest.</p><p>Before you can codify your naming convention, you need to have one.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, many of my clients already had naming standards in place. But if you're starting from scratch, Microsoft's <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloud Adoption Framework</a> is a great source of inspiration.</p><p>We adapted ideas from the CAF structure to match how the team actually thought about their infrastructure. For example:</p><div><pre><code>rg-dev-centralus-svc-identity-0\n</code></pre></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Resource type ()</td></tr><tr><td>Environment ()</td></tr><tr><td>Workload grouping ()</td></tr><tr><td>Application or service name</td></tr><tr><td>Instance identifier (ordinal)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>We ordered tokens  to support predictable sorting, filtering, and scanning.</p><p>But the important part isn't the order — it's .</p><blockquote><p>Ask yourself: What matters most when scanning names?\nIf it's resource type, put it first.<p>\nIf it's app name, lead with that.</p><strong>Pick an order that makes sense for your team and stick to it.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Once your structure is defined, the next step is to .</p><p>We created a lightweight  module with this interface:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The implementation is simple but purposeful:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> (, ) are placed last.</li><li> are always present.</li><li> strips out  values, so unused fields don't leave gaps.</li></ul><p>Here's how we typically use the  module inside a resource module — like one that provisions a resource group:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And in the higher-level calling module:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The caller doesn't have to build the name manually or remember the token order — they just pass structured values, and the module takes care of the rest.</p><blockquote><p>💡 Notice in the resource module that the  only supplies the , not the full name. The resource module itself provides the prefix (). This separation of concerns keeps the  module reusable — it can be embedded in  resource module.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Even Microsoft Built a Namer\n</h2><p>We're not the only ones to notice the need for codified naming.</p><p>Around the same time I wrote my first , Microsoft released an official <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/naming/azurerm/latest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terraform module for naming Azure resources</a>. Their module constructs names using inputs such as prefix, suffix. It's flexible by design, which makes it broadly applicable across thousands of organizations.</p><p>And while we share the same goal (consistency), our approaches reflect different audiences:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft has to serve everyone. I just need to serve my clients — and get it right for them.</p></blockquote><p>My  module is . It expects structured inputs such as , , , , and . It handles optional tokens predictably, and the output is consistent.</p><p>This approach allows me to codify domain-specific structures. For example, one of my customers organizes infrastructure by program, grouped into solutions, each with multiple applications. That's easy to reflect in a structured . For Microsoft, building a module that covers all such variations would be nearly impossible.</p><p>So while both modules solve the naming problem, they serve different needs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Answering Common Objections\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Developers Can Still Pass Garbage Into the Namer\n</h3><p>Absolutely — and that's a valid concern.</p><p>Just because we've wrapped naming in a module doesn't mean the problem goes away. Developers can still pass invalid strings into , , , or any of the other tokens. It's entirely possible to write:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>…and end up with a name that breaks consistency or violates Azure constraints.</p><p>The problem isn't the module — .</p><p>Terraform gives us tools to fix this, using  blocks on input variables:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These constraints eliminate \"almost right\" values like , , or  — small inconsistencies that erode standardization over time.</p><p>And this is <strong>another reason the module matters</strong>: it centralizes validation logic.</p><p>Even if a downstream resource module forgets to validate  or , the  module ensures only known-good values are accepted. That makes it easier to scale across teams and repositories without trusting everyone to remember every rule, every time.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  HashiCorp Says to Avoid Nested Modules\n</h3><p>HashiCorp's guidance recommends being cautious with module composition. Specifically, they warn that deeply nested modules can make Terraform harder to reuse, test, and understand. And they're right — in general.</p><p>But let's unpack what that guidance actually means.</p><blockquote><p>⚠️ The problem isn't  — it's , , or  nesting.</p></blockquote><p>In our case, we're embedding a small, single-purpose utility module — the  — inside a resource-specific module (like one that provisions a resource group or app service). That's not deep or complex. It's .</p><p>Here's why this pattern works well in practice:</p><ul><li> — The  has no dependencies, branching, or side effects. It just returns a string.</li><li><strong>Improved DRY and correctness</strong> — Without it, every resource module would need to duplicate the naming logic — and probably do it inconsistently.</li><li> — The  can be unit-tested separately or used directly outside nested contexts.</li><li> — Callers only provide structured context. They don't need to understand or maintain the naming format.</li></ul><p>At scale, where consistency is crucial and modules are reused across teams and environments, this lightweight composition pattern has paid off again and again.</p><h3><strong>A Lot of Work Just to Build a String</strong></h3><p>At first glance, the  module might look like overkill. It just produces a formatted string, right?</p><p>But in practice, we've extended the  to cover a variety of real-world scenarios — especially the inconsistent naming requirements across Azure services.</p><p>Different Azure resources have :</p><ul><li>Some require lowercase alphanumeric only</li><li>Some have character limits as low as 24</li><li>Some allow longer, more expressive names</li></ul><p>Besides the full resource suffix, here's what the module provides:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By centralizing the logic, we:</p><ul><li> — One implementation, many consumers</li><li> — Developers can't \"almost follow\" the pattern</li><li> — Compact and short formats are pre-baked</li></ul><p>We also generate standardized :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With just a few more input variables, the same  module can output tagging dictionaries that:</p><ul><li>Drive cost management and showback</li><li>Enforce platform tagging policy</li><li>Improve search and grouping in the Azure Portal</li><li>Make incident response and ownership tracking easier</li></ul><blockquote><p>💡 The  isn't about abstraction for abstraction's sake.\nIt's about <strong>operational predictability and platform integrity</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Make the Right Thing the Easy Thing\n</h2><p>Naming might seem like a minor detail — until it's not. When naming breaks down, platforms become harder to navigate, automation becomes brittle, and developers waste time chasing avoidable errors.</p><p>The Terraform namer pattern isn't magic. It's a small, opinionated module that codifies your naming strategy, gives teams a consistent interface, and reduces the surface area for human error.</p><p>By investing a little upfront effort to centralize and automate naming (and tagging), you gain:</p><ul><li>Predictable infrastructure that's easier to support</li><li>A shared language for your team and your tools</li><li>Guardrails that catch problems before they land in production</li><li>A stronger foundation for growth and reuse</li></ul><p>If you're tired of fixing naming issues after the fact — or if you're scaling a Terraform-based platform across teams — this pattern can save you headaches later.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Need Help Putting This Pattern to Work?\n</h3><p>I've seen this pattern save teams from endless frustration — and I've helped organizations of all sizes implement it across their platforms.</p><p>If you're wrestling with naming drift, Terraform sprawl, or platform inconsistencies, let's talk.</p><p><em>This post was originally published on <a href=\"https://jamesrcounts.com/2025/06/29/terraform-namer-pattern.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jamesrcounts.com</a>.

We need a special command to do that.</p><p>Cypress allows you to create custom commands for your project. Unsurprisingly, these are stored in the  file (<code>cypress/e2e/support/commands.js</code>).</p><p>Our login custom command should simply do the following:</p><ol><li>Take a username and password as arguments</li><li>Navigate to the login page</li><li>Fill out and submit the login form (username, password fields) - just usual Cypress cy.() stuff.</li><li>Register a new 'session' (eg new cookies) with Cypress and cache it</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> the  function and the  setting.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2 (optional): Setting your username and password\n</h2><p>Next we want to set our username and password somewhere for our new custom command to use. Now, you could just hard code them into the custom command above, but that's not entirely advisable if you're saving them on a shared git repo or something like that. But if you want to do that or just set them some other way you can skip this step.</p><p>For myself, I opted to create a  (<code>cypress/e2e/support/users.js</code>) file to save them on and used  to exclude from being pushed up to Github.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In : <code>cypress/e2e/support/users.js</code></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Setting environment variables\n</h2><p>We need to make our username and password available to all our test spec files. We also need a way to tell Cypress if we want to run the test as a logged in user or not.</p><p>The way we do that is with Cypress' Environment Variables. These are simply variables that are available to Cypress across all tests.</p><p>First, we need know if we want to run the test as a logged in user or not. I did this using an npm Environment Config (not to be confused with Cypress' own Environment Variables). These are simply values taken from the command line input, eg: <code>process.env.npm_config_hello</code> is set by adding  to your command.</p><p>For example, to create a variable to tell Cypress we are going to run something as a logged in user we make a new constant:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And in our command line we'd run: <code>node ./cypress/e2e/myTests.js --loggedIn-yes</code> to set it.</p><p>There are many ways to set Environment Variables in Cypress, but as I run my tests via the Module API  function I just include them as such:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this way, we are making our environment, username and password available to all our tests.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Logging-in before each test is run\n</h2><p>Now, we need to ensure that our user is logged in before each test runs. You might thing we need to call our  Custom Command before each test starts. And you'd be right. But, lucky for us we don't actually need to update each of our test specs with the code to do this.</p><p>Instead, we can simply add the follow to our  file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As you can guess, the  function runs before each test starts. It's the same as adding it to each test's spec.js file, but a lot less work.</p><p>, we are passing it the loggedIn, username and password values we set in our Cypress environment variables (obviously, we're not going to login if the  value isn't ).</p><p>Now, just to clear something up: When I first was looking into this <strong>I was concerned that the above code meant that Cypress would have to login before every, single, test. This is not so.</strong> Remember when we added  above? That allows Cypress to cache to the user session and so only run the login process once per set of tests.</p><p>And that should be it!

Every single technology choice was carefully evaluated based on real-world performance, developer experience, and long-term sustainability. Here's what changed and why.</p><ul><li>Material-UI for components</li><li>Firebase/Firestore database</li></ul><ul><li>ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS v4</li><li>Bun runtime and package manager</li><li>Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle ORM</li></ul><p>Everyone talks about Bun being fast, but that's only part of the story. What sold me was the unified toolchain experience. Instead of juggling npm/yarn + node + various build tools, Bun handles everything from package management to running TypeScript files directly.</p><p>The real game-changer? No more  conflicts during team development. Bun's lockfile is actually readable, and installation is consistently fast across different machines and CI environments.</p><div><pre><code>\nnpm node  tsx src/server.ts\nnpx tsx build.ts\n\n\nbun bun run src/server.ts\nbun run build.ts\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  ShadCN UI: Own Your Components\n</h3><p>Material-UI served us well, but I grew tired of fighting with component customization. Need a button that looks slightly different? Good luck overriding those nested CSS classes.</p><p>ShadCN UI flips this model. Instead of installing a massive component library, you copy the exact components you need into your codebase. Want to modify the Button component? Just edit the file. No more wrestling with theme overrides or CSS specificity wars.</p><p>The components are built on Radix UI primitives, so you still get accessibility and behavior handled correctly, but the styling is completely under your control.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  TanStack Router: Type Safety Meets Simplicity\n</h3><p>React Router has been the standard for years, but TanStack Router brings something revolutionary: complete type safety for your entire routing system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>File-based routing means your route structure matches your folder structure. No more maintaining separate route configurations that drift out of sync with your actual pages.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle: Edge-Native Database\n</h3><p>Firebase was fine for prototyping, but the vendor lock-in and pricing model became problematic for serious applications. D1 gives you a real SQL database that runs at Cloudflare's edge locations worldwide.</p><p>Drizzle ORM deserves special mention here. Unlike Prisma, which generates a massive client that can't run at the edge, Drizzle is lightweight and edge-compatible. The query syntax feels natural if you know SQL, but you get full TypeScript safety.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Tailwind CSS v4: Zero Runtime, Maximum Performance\n</h3><p>I'll admit, I was skeptical of Tailwind for years. It looked like inline styles with extra steps. But after building several projects with it, the productivity gains are undeniable.</p><p>Version 4 addresses my biggest concern: runtime performance. The new CSS-in-JS engine has zero runtime overhead while still giving you dynamic styling capabilities.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The best part? You stop context-switching between CSS files and components. The styles are co-located with the markup, making components easier to understand and maintain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Hono + tRPC: The Perfect API Stack\n</h3><p>Express has been around forever, but it wasn't built for modern deployment targets like Cloudflare Workers. Hono is designed from the ground up for edge runtimes while maintaining familiar patterns.</p><p>Combined with tRPC, you get end-to-end type safety without code generation. Change your API schema, and TypeScript immediately tells you everywhere in your frontend that needs updating.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The numbers speak for themselves:</p><ul><li>: 3x faster with Bun + Vite</li><li>: 40% smaller with tree-shaking and ShadCN components</li><li>: Sub-100ms with Cloudflare Workers</li><li>: 60% faster with edge-located D1</li></ul><p>But beyond raw performance, the developer experience improvements are where this stack really shines.</p><p>This is essentially a v2.0 release. If you're using the old stack, you don't need to migrate immediately. But for new projects, I'd recommend starting with this modern foundation.</p><p>The learning curve isn't steep if you're already familiar with React.

They are independent and have no association.</p><p>If you only want to learn the syntax of the Cangjie programming language, you only need the pure Cangjie environment. Chapter 4, \"Intelligent AI Assistant - Quickly Get You Started with Cangjie Programming Language,\" of the course provides a complete learning path from scratch, allowing you to systematically master the Cangjie programming language. Through this chapter, you can learn to develop an animal sound simulator, understand Cangjie collection classes, exception handling, package management, master large-scale program code organization and management, become familiar with I/O operations, file reading and writing operations, and network programming. You can even create TCP servers, UDP servers, and build HTTP services using the Cangjie programming language.</p><p>If you want to develop HarmonyOS applications using the Cangjie programming language, you need to install the Cangjie-HarmonyOS environment. As we all know, DevEco Studio is an essential IDE for developing HarmonyOS applications. Since the Cangjie programming language has not been officially released yet, it is necessary to support developing HarmonyOS applications based on the Cangjie programming language in DevEco Studio through a plugin (DevEco Studio Cangjie Plugin). Chapters 5-11 of the course also include corresponding practical training.</p><p>Currently, having multiple environments and multiple plugins has indeed caused many difficulties for HarmonyOS application developers, but this is only temporary. As I mentioned in the article \"Huawei's Self-Developed Cangjie Programming Language Will Be Open-Sourced and Have the Same Status as ArkTS in the Future,\" as the Cangjie programming language continues to improve, it will inevitably have the same status as ArkTS. Then, DevEco Studio will naturally support HarmonyOS applications based on the Cangjie programming language without the need to install so many plugins.</p><p>The future of the Cangjie programming language is promising. Are you ready?</p><p>After understanding the differences between these HarmonyOS programming languages, I believe you now have your own judgment on choosing a HarmonyOS programming language. When selecting a language, you can consider the following aspects based on your own situation:</p><ol><li><ul><li>Developers have certain preferences for programming languages. You can choose ArkTS or Java based on your personal喜好.</li><li>If you are familiar with Java or Android, you can choose Java. If you are familiar with JS or TS, you can choose ArkTS. If you are familiar with Rust, Cangjie is also a good choice.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>If you want to implement powerful and complete HarmonyOS application functions and maximize compatibility with existing Android devices on the market, Java is currently a good choice. However, note that HarmonyOS will no longer support Java after API 8. For related content on developing HarmonyOS applications with Java, please refer to my books \"HarmonyOS Mobile Application Development Practice\" and \"HarmonyOS Application Development from Beginner to Master\" as well as the video tutorial \"HarmonyOS System Practical Short Video App Development from Scratch to Mastery (ArkTS Version).\"</li><li>ArkTS is currently the main language promoted in the HarmonyOS ecosystem. It is recommended to build new commercial projects based on ArkTS. For related content on developing HarmonyOS applications with ArkTS, please refer to my books \"HarmonyOS Application Development Introduction,\" \"HarmonyOS Application Development from Beginner to Master (2nd Edition),\" and \"Harmony Light: HarmonyOS NEXT Native Application Development Introduction\" as well as the video tutorial \"HarmonyOS Zero-Based Rapid Practical - Imitation Douyin App Development (ArkTS Version).\"</li><li>If you simply want to learn a new language and keep up with its evolution, Cangjie is also a good choice. From a future development perspective, Cangjie may replace ArkTS as the main development language. However, note that Cangjie is currently only a developer preview version, with an unstable API and incomplete functionality. It is not recommended for use in commercial scenarios.

Among its many powerful services is EBS (Elastic Block Store), an essential component for many organizations leveraging the AWS ecosystem. But what exactly is EBS, and why should it matter to you? Let's dive in and find out!</p><p>At its core, EBS is a block-storage service that provides persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volumes are network-attached, and they can be attached to any running instance in the same Availability Zone.</p><p>Key features of EBS include:</p><ul><li>: EBS volumes retain their data even when the associated EC2 instance is stopped or terminated, ensuring your data remains safe and accessible.</li><li>: You can easily increase the size of an EBS volume or create multiple volumes to meet your storage needs.</li><li>: EBS offers various volume types optimized for different workloads, such as General Purpose SSD (gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1), and Cold HDD (sc1).</li></ul><p>EBS offers several advantages, particularly for organizations looking to:</p><ul><li>: EBS volumes are automatically replicated within an Availability Zone, protecting your data from component failures.</li><li><strong>Improve application performance</strong>: With various volume types, you can tailor your storage to your application's specific performance requirements.</li><li>: EBS enables you to manage your storage resources independently from your EC2 instances, streamlining data management and reducing operational overhead.</li></ul><p>Here are six practical use cases for AWS EBS across various industries and scenarios:</p><ol><li>: EBS provides the performance and durability required for storing database workloads.</li><li>: Organizations can use EBS to store and process logs, making it easier to analyze and monitor system activities.</li><li><strong>Content management systems (CMS)</strong>: EBS enables businesses to store and manage digital content, such as images and documents, for their CMS platforms.</li><li>: EBS volumes can serve as storage for data warehousing solutions, allowing for efficient data analysis and reporting.</li><li>: EBS can be used as a durable storage solution for backup and disaster recovery purposes.</li><li>: EBS volumes facilitate the storage and management of code and data during the development and testing phases.</li></ol><p>The following components make up the core of the AWS EBS architecture:</p><ul><li>: Persistent block-storage devices that can be attached to EC2 instances.</li><li>: Virtual servers within the AWS ecosystem where EBS volumes can be attached.</li><li>: Geographically separated locations that contain one or more data centers, ensuring data durability and low-latency connectivity.</li><li>: Backup copies of EBS volumes, enabling point-in-time recovery and disaster recovery.</li></ul><p>Here's a simple diagram to illustrate how these components interact:</p><div><pre><code>+------------+        +------------+\n|   EBS      |   +---&gt; |  EC2       |\n|  Volume    |        |  Instance |\n+------------+        +------------+\n          |                  |\n          |                  |\n          |                  |\n    +-------------+       +------------+\n    | Availability |       | EBS Snapshot|\n    |   Zone       |       +------------+\n    +-------------+\n</code></pre></div><p>In this diagram, EBS volumes are attached to EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone. EBS snapshots are created from EBS volumes for backup and recovery purposes.</p><p>Let's explore a simple walkthrough for creating, configuring, and using an EBS volume:</p><ol><li>: Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EBS page. Click \"Create Volume\" and specify the desired volume type, size, and other settings.</li><li><strong>Attach the EBS volume to an EC2 instance</strong>: Once the EBS volume is created, attach it to an EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone.</li><li><strong>Format and mount the EBS volume</strong>: Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH and format the EBS volume using the appropriate file system (e.g., ext4). After formatting, mount the volume to a specific directory on the EC2 instance.</li><li>: Confirm that the EBS volume is accessible and functioning correctly by reading and writing data to it.</li></ol><p>EBS pricing consists of several components:</p><ul><li>: Charged per GB-month, depending on the volume type and provisioned capacity.</li><li>: Additional charges apply for io1 volumes based on the amount of provisioned IOPS.</li><li>: Data transfer costs are associated with data transferred in and out of AWS, and between Availability Zones.</li><li>: Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, and pricing is based on the amount of data stored per month.</li></ul><p>To avoid common pitfalls, monitor your usage regularly and ensure that you've selected the appropriate volume type for your workload.</p><p>AWS takes security seriously and provides several measures to protect EBS data, such as:</p><ul><li>: EBS volumes and snapshots can be encrypted, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.</li><li>: IAM policies, security groups, and network ACLs can be used to control access to EBS volumes.</li></ul><p>For best practices, follow the AWS security guidelines, regularly review your security settings, and ensure that you comply with your organization's security policies.</p><p>EBS integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as:</p><ul><li>: Use EBS volumes as a durable storage solution for data transferred between EC2 instances and S3.</li><li>: Attach EBS volumes to EC2 instances running Lambda functions to enable persistent storage for function code and data.</li><li>: Monitor EBS volume performance metrics using CloudWatch to optimize your storage configuration.</li><li>: Control access to EBS volumes and snapshots using IAM policies and roles.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Comparisons with Similar AWS Services\n</h2><p>Compared to other AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3 and EFS (Elastic File System), EBS is optimized for:</p><ul><li>: EBS is ideal for applications that require direct access to storage at the block level, such as databases and boot volumes.</li><li>: EBS offers various volume types optimized for different workloads, allowing for superior performance compared to other storage solutions.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Mistakes and Misconceptions\n</h2><p>Here are some common mistakes and misconceptions when working with EBS:</p><ul><li><strong>Inappropriate volume type selection</strong>: Choosing the wrong volume type can lead to suboptimal performance and increased costs.</li><li><strong>Forgetting to detach EBS volumes</strong>: When terminating an EC2 instance, ensure that you've detached any associated EBS volumes to avoid data loss.</li></ul><p>Here's a summary of the pros and cons of using AWS EBS:</p><ul><li>Persistent block-storage for EC2 instances</li><li>Various volume types for different workloads</li><li>Encryption and access control options</li></ul><ul><li>Limited to a single Availability Zone</li><li>Additional costs for data transfer and provisioned IOPS</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices and Tips for Production Use\n</h2><p>To make the most of AWS EBS, follow these best practices and tips:</p><ul><li>: Regularly review your EBS volume performance metrics to ensure optimal configuration.</li><li><strong>Choose the right volume type</strong>: Select the appropriate volume type based on your workload requirements.</li><li><strong>Implement proper backup and recovery strategies</strong>: Utilize EBS snapshots and other AWS backup solutions to safeguard your data.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts and Conclusion\n</h2><p>AWS EBS is a powerful and versatile block-storage service, offering unparalleled performance and durability for EC2 instances.

Instead, the question is: Who are you becoming?</p><p>In this new AI economy, your biggest competitive edge isn’t learning another prompt, it’s shifting your thinking and mindset to become someone who builds with AI not just reacts to it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Behavior #1: Innovators Don’t Wait - They Build\n</h2><p>Most people want certainty before they start. Pioneers know that clarity comes through action.</p><p>• They don't hesitate; they launch.\n• They don't chase perfect; they iterate.<p>\n• They don't fear being wrong; they fear being late.</p></p><p>AI has created a new kind of builder; not just coders or analysts, but architects of value.

Orchestrating AI workflows is the real differentiator.</p><p>Pioneers treat AI like a team of assistants:\n• They chain tools and prompts together like puzzle pieces.<p>\n• They automate based on signals, not guesses.</p>\n• They let AI handle logic and insert human insight at the right points. </p><p>Pioneers are AI-fluent thinkers; and that’s what matters in 2025.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Behavior #3: Adapt Fast. Iterate Faster.\n</h2><p>The economy isn’t slowing down and neither is AI. Pioneers thrive in this speed because they’ve trained for it.</p><p>• They ship before they feel ready.\n• They learn from feedback, not fear.<p>\n• They evolve fast because velocity beats perfection.</p></p><p>Adaptation is no longer optional; it's a core business capability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Behavior #4: Progress Over Perfection\n</h2><p>Pioneers don't chase sophistication.\n• They chase momentum.<p>\n• They treat workflows like deployable code.</p>\n• They publish, listen, and adjust.<p>\n• They build systems that evolve cycle after cycle.</p></p><p>Pioneers build those systems and improve them constantly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Behavior #5: Design for Leverage, Not Labor\n</h2><p>You can't thrust your way to freedom.

Na nuvem da Amazon, lidamos simultaneamente com serviços que executam software e serviços que são consumidos via APIs por nossas aplicações.</p><p>Embora eu tenha desenvolvido convenções próprias baseadas na experiência de criar dezenas de diagramas arquiteturais, sempre senti falta de um modelo padronizado que pudesse guiar não apenas meu trabalho, mas também o de colegas.

Torvalds recognized the work done on the GNU Project in 1983, which intended to create a complete, Unix-compatible OS comprised entirely of free software, and noted the GNU as a model for distribution. However, the work on GNU had not been finished by the time Torvalds sought a Minix replacement, prompting him to develop an alternate OS kernel dubbed Linux -- a contraction of Linus' Unix -- and adopt the GNU GPL.</p><p>Torvalds released the Linux kernel in September 1991. A community of developers worked to integrate GNU components with Torvalds' kernel to create a complete, free OS known collectively as Linux. Torvalds continues to develop the Linux kernel and a vast developer community continues to create and integrate a wide range of components.</p><p>While Linux still lags Windows and macOS on the desktop, it continues to challenge the proprietary OS vendors on servers and embedded systems.</p><p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems, built around the Linux kernel. It's known for its flexibility, security, and use in a wide range of devices, from smartphones to supercomputers. It's commonly distributed as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and other essential software. </p><p>Open source software. The Linux kernel is released under the GNU GPL open-source software license. Most distros include hundreds of applications, with many options in almost every category. Many distributions also include proprietary software, such as device drivers provided by manufacturers, to support their hardware.\nLicensing costs. Unlike Microsoft Windows or Apple macOS, Linux has no explicit licensing fees. While system support is available for a fee from many Linux vendors, the OS itself is free to copy and use. Some IT organizations have increased their savings by switching their server software from a commercial OS to Linux.<p>\nReliability. Linux is considered a reliable OS and is well-supported with security patches. Linux is also considered to be stable, meaning it can run in most circumstances. Linux also copes with errors when running software and unexpected input.</p>\nBackward compatibility. Linux and other open source software tend to be updated frequently for security and functional patches, while retaining core functionality. Configurations and shell scripts are likely to work unchanged even when software updates are applied. Unlike commercial software vendors that roll out new versions of their OSes along with new ways to work, Linux and open source applications generally don't change their modes of operation with new releases.<p>\nMany choices. Between the hundreds of available distributions, thousands of applications and almost infinite options for configuring, compiling and running Linux on almost any hardware platform, it is possible to optimize Linux for almost any application.</p></p><p>Key functions of Linux:- \nHardware Management\nSoftware Development\nCloud Computing\nNetworking<p>\nMulti-user and Multitasking</p>\nSecurity and Customization</p><p>Types of Linux\nDebian\nUbuntu</p><p>openSUSE\nLinux Mint\nCentOS</p><p>How to download Linux: -\nFirst you have to check your system security and configuration, turn Windows features on or off screen will open up, scroll to where you have Windows Subsystem for Linux and check the dialog box beside it, then choose the version of Linux you want to download; Ubutu releases a new version every six months; whereas, Long Term Support versions (LTS) are released every two years, go to Microsoft store choose the version and click get it will start downloading after that you click install and open.

Bash shell scripting refers to the practice of writing sequences of commands for the Bourne-Again Shell (Bash), a widely used command-line interpreter in Unix-like operating systems like Linux and macOS. These sequences of commands are stored in a plain text file, known as a Bash script, and are executed by the Bash interpreter.

So, you've written some code, and… it doesn't quite do what you expect? Welcome to the world of debugging! It's a core skill for  programmer, and honestly, you'll spend a lot of your time doing it. Don't worry, it's not a sign you're bad at coding – it's a sign you're !  Debugging is a crucial topic that often comes up in interviews, so getting comfortable with it now will really set you up for success.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Understanding \"Introduction Debugging\"\n</h3><p>Debugging is simply the process of finding and fixing errors (also known as \"bugs\") in your code. Think of it like being a detective. Your program is a mystery, and the bug is the culprit. You need to gather clues, investigate, and ultimately solve the case!</p><p>Imagine you're building with LEGOs. You follow the instructions, but the tower keeps falling over. Debugging is like carefully checking each step, making sure you used the right pieces and connected them correctly. </p><p>It's not about  bugs (that's nearly impossible!), it's about learning how to find them efficiently.  There are different types of bugs, but we'll focus on the most common ones:</p><ul><li> These are like grammatical errors in your code. The computer can't understand what you've written because it violates the rules of the programming language.</li><li> These happen while your program is running.  Maybe you're trying to divide by zero, or access something that doesn't exist.</li><li> These are the trickiest! Your code runs without crashing, but it doesn't produce the correct result. This means your  is flawed.</li></ul><p>Let's look at a simple example in Python. We'll create a function that adds two numbers together.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>What do you think will happen when you run this code?  It will print , but we  it to print ! This is a logic error.  We used the subtraction operator () instead of the addition operator ().</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now it prints , as expected.  Debugging often involves carefully reviewing your code line by line to spot these kinds of mistakes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes or Misunderstandings\n</h3><p>Here are a few common pitfalls beginners encounter:</p><p><strong>1. Not Reading Error Messages:</strong></p><p>Error messages might look scary, but they often tell you  what's wrong (in this case, a missing closing parenthesis).  Take the time to read them carefully!</p><p><strong>2. Assuming the First Error is the Only Error:</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Fixing the first error might reveal another one.  Don't stop at the first fix!</p><p><strong>3. Not Using  Statements:</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Adding  statements to display the values of variables at different points in your code can help you understand what's happening and pinpoint where things go wrong.</p><p>Let's imagine you're building a simple program to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code is well-structured and easy to understand. If the total cost is incorrect, you can use  statements inside the  method to check the <code>item.get_total_item_cost()</code> value for each item.  You could also print the  variable inside the loop to see how it's accumulating.</p><p>Here are a few exercises to help you practice your debugging skills:</p><ol><li> Write a simple calculator program that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides. Introduce a bug (e.g., incorrect operator) and then debug it.</li><li> Create a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number. Introduce a bug that prevents the game from working correctly (e.g., incorrect comparison).</li><li> Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list. Introduce a bug that causes the function to return the wrong sum.</li><li> Write a function that reverses a string. Introduce a bug that causes the function to return an incorrect reversed string.</li><li> Create a very basic login system with a username and password. Introduce a bug that always fails the login, even with the correct credentials.</li></ol><p>Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into the world of debugging. Remember, debugging is a skill that improves with practice. Don't be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them.  </p><ul><li>  What debugging is and why it's important.</li><li>  How to use  statements to inspect your code.</li><li>  Common mistakes to avoid.</li><li>  How to apply debugging to a real-world scenario.</li></ul><p>Next, you might want to explore using a debugger tool (like those found in IDEs) which allows you to step through your code line by line and inspect variables in real-time.  Keep coding, keep debugging, and most importantly, keep learning!

These include sorting by , incorrect data types, suboptimal indexing, overly large batch selections, poison pill messages, and inefficient index or visibility checks. A key insight was the performance impact of stale indexes, especially in high-throughput systems. To address this, the post proposed a revamped design using partitioned tables, which simplifies cleanup and mitigates visibility issues. Below is a summary of the traditional vs. revamped design, along with the DDL for both. Throughout this article, we will use the red color to indicate the traditional design and the blue color for the revamped design.

Finally, we will discuss index maintenance for the outbox tables, which is crucial for high-throughput systems.</p><div><pre><code>Outbox migration patterns\n  * COP: Cold Outbox Partitioning\n  * COPRA: Cold Outbox Partitioning w/ Rapid Attachment\n  * HOP: Hot Outbox Partitioning\n  * HOPER: Hot Outbox Partitioning w/ Eventual Replacement\n  * HOPIA: Hot Outbox Partitioning w/ Immediate Access\nTuning AUTOVACUUM for outbox tables\nOutbox table index maintenance\nConclusion\n</code></pre></div><p>Let's consider the scenario that we have an existing service with a traditional outbox table, and we want to migrate to a partitioned outbox table. We will use some schematics to illustrate the migration process, and assume a rolling update approach where the new version of the service is deployed alongside the old one, and they co-exist for a while. This is the most common scenario in production systems, where we cannot afford downtime or data loss. Depending on the requirements, we may have to deploy several versions of the service. The services will be denoted by the green color, and the version number like , , etc.</p><p>Below, I will describe five patterns for migrating the outbox table, in the increasing order of complexity. If your requirements allow for a simpler approach, you can choose one of the simpler patterns. If you need more flexibility or performance, you can opt for a more complex pattern. Each pattern is given a mnemonic acronym to help you remember it, and also there is a flowchart to help you decide which pattern to use. The mnemonics are meaningful names, though some of them are not well-known English words. So, below the flowchart, I used a symbol to indicate the meaning of each mnemonic. 😉</p><ol><li><strong>COP: Cold Outbox Partitioning</strong>. This is the simplest pattern, where you can stop the publication of messages for a short while (e.g., 10 minutes).</li><li><strong>COPRA: Cold Outbox Partitioning w/ Rapid Attachment</strong>. This pattern is similar to COP, except that the old outbox has to be rapidly attached to the new partitioned outbox table as the  partition.</li><li><strong>HOP: Hot Outbox Partitioning</strong>. In this pattern, your service cannot afford to stop the publication of messages, but you do not need to attach the old outbox table to the new partitioned outbox table.</li><li><strong>HOPER: Hot Outbox Partitioning w/ Eventual Replacement</strong>. This pattern is similar to HOP, except that the old outbox table eventually replaces the  partition, and newly published messages are copied over. No immediate access to the old outbox table is required, but it can be accessed later if needed.</li><li><strong>HOPIA: Hot Outbox Partitioning w/ Immediate Access</strong>. This is by far the most complex pattern, with all requirements of HOP, and your service needs uninterrupted access to all the published messages.</li></ol><p>The decision flowchart below can help you choose the right pattern for your requirements. The next sections will describe each pattern in detail.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  COP: Cold Outbox Partitioning\n</h2><p>COP is the simplest pattern for migration from a traditional outbox table to a partitioned one. The requirements are as relaxed as possible:</p><ol><li> You can stop the publication of messages for a short while (e.g., 10 minutes).</li><li> The existing data in the old outbox table is not needed to be available in the new partitioned setup. You can leave it as a separate table, or drop it if you want to save space.</li></ol><p>An example is a service that periodically uses the outbox. For instance, in our company, we have an \"interest service\" that uses the outbox during the nightly accrual or the monthly interest payout. In all other times, the outbox is rarely used, and therefore we can afford to pause the publication of messages for a short while during the migration.</p><p>Given these requirements, the migration process is straightforward:</p><ol><li> is using the traditional outbox table.</li><li> is deployed with the new partitioned outbox table:\n\n<ul><li>Insertions are now made into the  partitioned outbox table.</li><li>Publication continues from the  outbox table, until there are no more messages to publish.</li></ul></li><li> is deployed where both insertions and publication are now performed over the  partitioned outbox table.</li></ol><p>Between the  and  deployments, there is a short period where unpublished messages accumulated in the  table, and as such the publication is effectively paused.</p><p>Let's depict this process in a schematic. Notice that due to the rolling deployment,  and  co-exist for a while, and the same applies to  and . However,  and  do not co-exist. Also,  is only deployed after all messages in the old  table are published. To prevent name clashes, let's assume that the new partitioned outbox table is named .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  COPRA: Cold Outbox Partitioning w/ Rapid Attachment\n</h2><p>COPRA is the second-simplest pattern—after COP—for migration from a traditional outbox table to a partitioned one. The requirement on paused publication is the same as before, but the existing data in the old outbox table is needed to be available in the new partitioned setup:</p><ol><li> You can stop the publication of messages for a short while (e.g., 10 minutes).</li><li> The existing data in the old outbox table has to be available in the new partitioned setup.</li></ol><p>An example is when the application performs some kind of analytical query on the outbox table, or there is a logical replication setup that replicates the outbox table to another database. In this case, we cannot afford to lose the existing data in the old outbox table, and we need to attach it to the new partitioned outbox table.</p><p>The DDL to create the new partitioned outbox table is a bit different:</p><ul><li>It won't create the  partition, as we will attach the old outbox table to it later.</li><li>The  column has to be generated with a higher starting value to avoid clashes with the existing  values in the old outbox table.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The attachment of the old outbox table to the new partitioned outbox table can be done with the following DDLs:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You may also want to change or drop the indexes on the old outbox table (e.g., the primary key). A crucial point here, according to the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PostgreSQL documentation</a>, is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Note that when running the  command, the table will be scanned to validate the partition constraint while holding an  lock on that partition.</p><p>It is recommended to avoid this scan by creating a  constraint matching the expected partition constraint on the table prior to attaching it. Once the  is complete, it is recommended to drop the now-redundant  constraint.</p></blockquote><p>In the above example, the  table will be locked exclusively, to check that it satisfies the condition of being the  partition of the  table. This means that all the rows must satisfy the condition . If the outbox table is large, this can take a considerable amount of time. It can be OK if:</p><ol><li>The  table does not have to be accessed during the migration, and</li><li>The publication can remain paused for a while.</li></ol><p>If #1 is not the case, you can use the  constraint as the documentation suggests, and elaborated below. If #2 is not the case, you can use the  pattern instead, which does not require pausing publication.</p><p>To use the  constraint approach, you can follow these steps. Note that these steps must be done in separate transactions. The first step adds a  constraint to the  table, in the  mode. This means the constraint is only enforced for new rows (which in this case we don't expect any, since no new insertions are made into the  table for now). The second step validates the constraint, which will check all the existing rows in the  table, but it will not lock the table in the ACCESS EXCLUSIVE mode (or does so only very briefly to mark the constraint as valid at the end). The third step attaches the  table to the  table as the  partition.

This is important to ensure that the outbox tables are maintained properly, especially in high-throughput systems where many messages are inserted and published frequently. This section assumes familiarity with the  feature in PostgreSQL. A good, in-depth article is Laurenz Albe's <a href=\"https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tuning-autovacuum-postgresql/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tuning PostgreSQL autovacuum</a>.</p><p>By default, PostgreSQL's  settings are designed to work well on the medium-sized tables:</p><div><pre><code>postgres=# \\dconfig *autovacuum_*\n         List of configuration parameters\n               Parameter               |   Value\n---------------------------------------+-----------\n autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor       | 0.1\n autovacuum_analyze_threshold          | 50\n autovacuum_freeze_max_age             | 200000000\n autovacuum_max_workers                | 3\n autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age   | 400000000\n autovacuum_naptime                    | 1min\n autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay          | 2ms\n autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit          | -1\n autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor | 0.2\n autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold    | 1000\n autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor        | 0.2\n autovacuum_vacuum_threshold           | 50\n autovacuum_work_mem                   | -1\n log_autovacuum_min_duration           | 10min\n(14 rows)\n</code></pre></div><p>The following table summarizes the most important settings and their default values:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Vacuum run on update/delete</td><td>At least 20% of the table changes plus 50 rows</td></tr><tr><td>At least 20% of the table changes plus 1000 rows</td></tr><tr><td>At least 10% of the table changes plus 50 rows</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In our revamped outbox design, there's an imbalance between the partitions:</p><ul><li>The  partition is frequently inserted to and updated (resulting in delete), but its size is usually small.</li><li>The  partition is only inserted to, but it can grow indefinitely large.</li></ul><p>Since PostgreSQL default  settings are designed for small and medium-sized tables, we usually do not have to tune them for the  partition. However, keep an eye on the amount of time  takes to run on this partition, plus whether the query for the  partition is efficient. For both purposes, you can monitor the server logs. For the latter, you would need <code>log_min_duration_statement</code> set to a low value, such as 100ms, or use the  extension. Another possibility is to use the  extension, which can help you identify slow queries and their execution plans.</p><p>For the insert-only table , vacuuming is not needed except for preventing the transaction ID wraparound.\nIf it is not used in the application code, it does not have to be analyzed either. However, since disabling auto-analyze is not possible without disabling  entirely, we can tune the parameters to make it less frequent. Here's an example to run both vacuum and analyze on the  partition every 100K rows inserted, regardless of the table size. This gives you a consistent behavior, but it is suitable only for the case where the application code does not query the  partition directly. There is also no one-size-fits-all solution, so you may need to adjust the values based on your workload and performance requirements.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the revamped outbox design, we have a single indexes on the  partition, and no indexes on the  partition:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  partition is frequently inserted to and updated (resulting in delete), so the index on it is supposed to be severely bloated over time. We'll use the  extension to monitor the index bloat. It's a heavy operation, so do not do it in production.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>On a freshly created  partition, the following query shows that the index is empty, thus not bloated at all:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>-[ RECORD 1 ]------+-----\nversion            | 4\ntree_level         | 0\nindex_size         | 8192\nroot_block_no      | 0\ninternal_pages     | 0\nleaf_pages         | 0\nempty_pages        | 0\ndeleted_pages      | 0\navg_leaf_density   | NaN\nleaf_fragmentation | NaN\n</code></pre></div><p>Let's insert 100K rows into the  table, and see how the index looks like after that.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>-[ RECORD 1 ]------+--------\nversion            | 4\ntree_level         | 1\nindex_size         | 2260992\nroot_block_no      | 3\ninternal_pages     | 1\nleaf_pages         | 274\nempty_pages        | 0\ndeleted_pages      | 0\navg_leaf_density   | 89.83\nleaf_fragmentation | 0\n</code></pre></div><p>As you can see,  is almost at 90%, which is the default fillfactor for B-Tree indexes in PostgreSQL. This means that the index is filled to the maximum capacity, and there is no bloat yet.</p><p>Let's update the  column of all the rows, and see how the index looks like after that.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>-[ RECORD 1 ]------+--------\nversion            | 4\ntree_level         | 1\nindex_size         | 2260992\nroot_block_no      | 3\ninternal_pages     | 1\nleaf_pages         | 274\nempty_pages        | 0\ndeleted_pages      | 0\navg_leaf_density   | 89.83\nleaf_fragmentation | 0\n</code></pre></div><p>Hm, nothing?! How can that be? The reason is that we ran the query  immediately after the update, and AUTOVACUUM didn't have a chance to run yet. If you run it after a few minutes (or after a manual ), you will see that the index is bloated:</p><div><pre><code>-[ RECORD 1 ]------+--------\nversion            | 4\ntree_level         | 1\nindex_size         | 2260992\nroot_block_no      | 3\ninternal_pages     | 1\nleaf_pages         | 1\nempty_pages        | 0\ndeleted_pages      | 273\navg_leaf_density   | 0.05\nleaf_fragmentation | 0\n</code></pre></div><p>Only 5% of the index is leaf pages is used, which shows that the index is severely bloated. Notice that the (AUTO-)VACUUM did not remove the index bloat; it only marked them as invalid.</p><p>Fortunately, it's easy to remove the index bloat by running a  command on the index or the table. To prevent an EXCLUSIVE lock on the table, you should use the  option, which will take longer but will not block other operations on the table. Since the  partition is supposed to be small, the  command should not take too long:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The index maintenance is not a one-time operation, but rather a periodic task that should be run regularly to keep the index in good shape. The frequency of the maintenance depends on the workload and the size of the  partition. You can use the  extension to schedule the maintenance task, or use a job scheduler like  or K8s CronJobs to run the  command periodically. There's also a nice bash script by Vitaliy Kukharik, called <a href=\"https://github.com/vitabaks/pg_auto_reindexer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pg_auto_reindexer</a>, which can run during the set time and reindex all the indexes that are bloated more than a certain threshold. It can be used to automate the index maintenance process.</p><p>In this article, we explored various migration patterns for transitioning from a traditional outbox table to a partitioned one in PostgreSQL. We covered five patterns—COP, COPRA, HOP, HOPER, and HOPIA—each designed for different requirements regarding publication pauses and data accessibility. The choice of pattern depends on your specific needs, with simpler patterns like COP being suitable for systems that can tolerate brief publication pauses, while more complex patterns like HOPIA address scenarios requiring continuous publication and immediate data access.</p><p>We also discussed important operational aspects, including tuning autovacuum settings for outbox tables and maintaining indexes to prevent performance degradation. The partitioned outbox design offers significant advantages in terms of performance and maintenance, particularly for high-throughput systems.</p><p>By implementing these patterns and following the recommended maintenance practices, you can achieve a more efficient and reliable outbox implementation that scales well with your system's growth while minimizing the common pitfalls associated with traditional outbox tables.</p>","contentLength":22883,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"HarmonyOS Development: Drawing Ellipse with Ellipse","url":"https://dev.to/abnerming888/harmonyos-development-drawing-ellipse-with-ellipse-2ahm","date":1751237793,"author":"程序员一鸣","guid":175449,"unread":true,"content":"<p>this article is based on Api13</p><p>in the previous two articles, we outlined the geometric rectangle and Circle, which are implemented using Rect and Circle components respectively.

It supports basic functions such as filling, stroke, transparency adjustment, etc. Its core features include flexible layout, complex vector graphics (similar to SVG effect) can be used alone or nested in the parent Shape component, and dynamic attributes are also supported. Animation effects such as color gradient and size change can be realized through state variables.</p><p>Of course, to implement Ellipse, we can also draw through Canvas.

There are nothing specific to note, but there are still several things to note. The first is version compatibility. For example, if you want to use it in meta-service, you must use it in API11 and above. Also, when using strokeDashArray attribute, you must ensure the parameter is a numeric array, otherwise an error may be reported.</p><p>The second possibility is to pay attention to performance. Try to avoid frequently modifying the eclipse attribute in the callback of high-frequency update, and give priority to using @ State State variable to drive changes. For those complex graphics, it is recommended to use Shape to combine multiple drawing components instead of nesting multiple layers of eclipse.</p><p>The third is that when using the border, you need to set the transparency of the fill to 0 so that the border can be displayed.</p><p>in addition to using the Ellipse component to draw an Ellipse, we can also use Canvas to draw an Ellipse, but relatively speaking, it is still not as efficient as the Ellipse component. Therefore, if the Ellipse component can meet the requirements, the Ellipse component is still the main component.</p>","contentLength":3396,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"HarmonyOS Development: Filling the remaining space","url":"https://dev.to/abnerming888/harmonyos-development-filling-the-remaining-space-2ia5","date":1751236111,"author":"程序员一鸣","guid":175443,"unread":true,"content":"<p>this paper is based on api13.</p><p>There are two components, regardless of horizontal or vertical, the latter component needs to take up the rest of the space, how to draw it?</p><p>Surely some people will remember that it is not enough to set the width of the latter component to 100%?

The biggest reason is to improve users' control over privacy and data security and prevent malicious software from abusing their rights. Just Imagine, if there is no rights management, some malicious software will definitely use these default authorization rights to obtain users' sensitive information and pose a threat to users' privacy. This is one of them, and the other is the user experience, because users cannot authorize rights according to their own needs, which may lead to unnecessary rights being granted, in public and private, in emotion and reason, authority management must and firmly be implemented.</p><p>In Hongmeng ecology, it can be said that authority management has been consistently implemented from beginning to end. After all, ensuring user privacy, system security and functional integrity is Hongmeng's core mechanism. User privacy protection, such as user authorization when accessing sensitive data such as cameras, microphones and locations, is required to prevent malicious applications from stealing privacy. System resource security mainly restricts the disorderly access of applications to the underlying resources of the system, such as network and storage, avoid resource abuse or conflict; However, functional integrity, such as some functions, such as network requests, device sensor calls, etc., depend on Permission authorization. Failure to apply for permission will lead to functional failure. These permission requests are usually transparent, and the system will pop up an authorization prompt. Users can make choices according to their own needs and privacy considerations.</p><p>permission management is important, but in actual development, it should still be used reasonably and correctly to avoid unnecessary applications. Official website has the following principles for permission management:</p><ol><li><p>The developed application, of course, contains the three-party library referenced by the application. The required permissions must be declared one by one in the application's configuration file in strict accordance with the permissions development guidance. This principle is very important, otherwise you cannot apply for permissions.</p></li><li><p>The applied permissions shall meet the principle of minimization as far as possible, and it is strictly prohibited to apply for some unnecessary and abandoned permissions; In actual development, if an application applies for a lot of permissions, this situation will make users worry about application security and the use experience will deteriorate, which will also affect the installation rate and retention rate of the application.</p></li><li><p>If the application must use sensitive permissions, the permission use reason field must be filled in. Sensitive permissions usually refer to permissions closely related to user privacy, including geographic location, camera, microphone, calendar, fitness, body sensor, music, files, pictures and videos. Sensitive permissions for applications must be dynamically applied before the corresponding business functions are executed to meet the requirements of privacy minimization.</p></li><li><p>When the user refuses to grant a certain permission, other business functions unrelated to this permission should be allowed to be used normally, and do not exit directly or make other errors.</p></li></ol><p>in actual development, all application permissions must be in in the configuration file of the project, it is very important to declare one by one. If there is no declaration, the function cannot be used.

It should be noted that the UI style of the entry, the object data transfer used here, and the label setting of the prefix are convenient.

In view of this situation, in fact, we can package individual widget attributes independently and set them one by one in the form of callback functions. For example, our custom search template has many widget attributes.</p><div><pre><code>onSearchAttribute?: (attribute: SearchViewAttribute) =&gt; void //搜索属性\nprivate searchAttribute: SearchViewAttribute = new SearchViewAttribute()\n</code></pre></div><p>When you need to set the search widget attribute, you can directly call onSearchAttribute:</p><div><pre><code>SearchLayout({\n        hotList: this.hotList,\n        onItemClick: (text: string) =&gt; {\n          console.log(\"===ITEM CLICK：\" + text)\n        },\n        onSearchAttribute: (attr) =&gt; {\n\n          attr.placeholder = \"search\"\n          attr.onSubmit = (text) =&gt; {\n            console.log(\"===click：\" + text)\n          }\n        }\n      })\n</code></pre></div><p>one thing to note is that when setting properties using callback functions, you must remember to initialize the settings, that is, to call back the properties we initialized and receive the settings of the caller.</p><div><pre><code>aboutToAppear(): void {\n\n    if (this.onSearchAttribute != undefined) {\n      this.onSearchAttribute(this.searchAttribute)\n    }\n\n  }\n</code></pre></div>","contentLength":11230,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Programming Entry Level: learn self taught","url":"https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/programming-entry-level-learn-self-taught-b2k","date":1751235251,"author":"DevOps Fundamental","guid":175437,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Learn Self-Taught for Beginners\n</h2><p>Learning to code can feel overwhelming, especially when you're starting out.

This post will break down what it means to learn self-taught, common pitfalls, and how to get started. This is also a topic that often comes up in interviews – being able to articulate your self-learning journey is a valuable skill.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding \"Learn Self-Taught\"\n</h2><p>\"Learning self-taught\" simply means taking responsibility for your own learning journey. Instead of a teacher assigning you tasks and grading your progress,  decide what to learn, how to learn it, and how to measure your success. </p><p>Think of it like learning to cook. You could take a cooking class (a structured course), or you could find recipes online, watch videos, experiment, and learn from your mistakes (self-taught). Both methods can lead to delicious results, but they require different approaches.</p><p>Self-taught learning relies heavily on resources like online documentation, tutorials, blog posts (like this one!), and practice projects. It's about being proactive, resourceful, and persistent. It's also about building a portfolio to demonstrate your skills, since you won't have grades or a degree to show.</p><p>Here's a simple way to visualize the process:</p><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Identify Learning Goal] --&gt; B(Find Resources);\n    B --&gt; C{Practice &amp; Build};\n    C --&gt; D[Evaluate &amp; Refine];\n    D --&gt; A;\n</code></pre></div><p>This diagram shows the cyclical nature of self-learning: you set a goal, find resources, practice, evaluate your progress, and then refine your approach.

You've defined a  class with attributes (description, completed) and methods (mark_completed). This is a small but practical example of how you can build something useful.</p><p>Here are a few ideas to practice your skills:</p><ol><li> Create a program that takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the calculation.</li><li>  Generate a random number and have the user guess it. Provide feedback (too high, too low) until they guess correctly.</li><li><strong>To-Do List App (Console-Based):</strong>  Build a simple to-do list application where users can add, view, and mark tasks as complete.</li><li> Create a program that converts between different units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, inches to centimeters).</li><li>  Prompt the user for different types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) and then insert them into a pre-written story.</li></ol><p>Learning self-taught is a challenging but rewarding path. It requires discipline, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn from your mistakes. Remember to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you get stuck.  </p><p>Congratulations on taking the first step!

Whether it is defined locally or globally, passing parameters is very simple. Just call the builder function directly. The simple case is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>@Builder\n  function TextView(value: string) {\n    Text(value)\n  }\n\n\n@Entry\n  @Component\n  struct Index {\n    textBuilder: WrappedBuilder&lt;[string]&gt; = wrapBuilder(TextView)\n\n    build() {\n      Column() {\n        this.textBuilder.builder(\"params\")\n      }.width(\"100%\")\n        .height(\"100%\")\n        .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre></div><p>the above parameters are passed in the UI view. It is very simple to pass parameters, but what if they are not in the UI view? This is the problem I have encountered recently. The team has used the dialog of any position I have customized, which is similar to the dialog in the following figure. One requirement is that message is not a simple text, but may be a picture and text, may be a rich text, or may be other presentations. In this case, it is not flexible enough to receive a text or other types. Therefore, I directly exposed the message component and passed it to the caller.</p><p>In this way, the rich and diverse situation of message is solved. After all, the component is passed by the caller. Although the effect is realized, the problem is raised again:</p><p>\"My message is displayed according to logic, for example, to show this for true and to show another for false. How can the data be passed?\"</p><p>\"... Well, there are so many requirements, then forget it, you can define it yourself. \"Of course, this is just your own voice, the actual situation, or nod and say, okay, solve it immediately.</p><p>case, here I simplified, mainly defined a pop-up window tool class.</p><div><pre><code>import { ComponentContent } from \"@kit.ArkUI\"\nimport { DialogAttribute } from \"./DialogAttribute\"\n\nexport class DialogUtils {\n  private constructor() {\n  }\n\n  private static mDialogUtils: DialogUtils\n\n  public static get() {\n    if (DialogUtils.mDialogUtils == undefined) {\n      DialogUtils.mDialogUtils = new DialogUtils()\n    }\n    return DialogUtils.mDialogUtils\n  }\n\n  showDialog(context: UIContext, dialogAttribute?: DialogAttribute) {\n    if (dialogAttribute == undefined) {\n      dialogAttribute = new DialogAttribute()\n    }\n    this.show(context, dialogAttribute)\n  }\n\n  private show(context: UIContext, object: Object) {\n    let dView = wrapBuilder&lt;Object[]&gt;(dialogView)\n    let dialogContent: ComponentContent&lt;Object&gt; = new ComponentContent(context, dView, object)\n    context.getPromptAction().openCustomDialog(dialogContent)\n  }\n}\n\n@Builder\n  function dialogView(dialogAttribute?: DialogAttribute) {\n    Column() {\n      Text(dialogAttribute?.title)\n        .fontSize(16)\n        .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)\n        .margin({ top: 10 })\n\n      if (dialogAttribute?.messageView != undefined) {\n        dialogAttribute?.messageView.builder()\n      }\n\n      Row() {\n        Text(\"cancel\")\n          .height(40)\n          .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n          .layoutWeight(1)\n        Text(\"confirm\")\n          .height(40)\n          .layoutWeight(1)\n          .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n      }.width(\"100%\")\n    }.width(\"80%\")\n      .backgroundColor(Color.White)\n      .borderRadius(10)\n  }\n</code></pre></div><p>In the actual development, a lot of content is dynamically variable, but also need to expose these attributes, here I simply defined a property file, in the actual development, there will be a lot of attributes, here, I simply defined two, mainly for testing.</p><div><pre><code>export class DialogAttribute {\n  title?: \n  messageView?: WrappedBuilder&lt;Object[]&gt;\n}\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>import { DialogUtils } from './DialogUtils'\n\n@Builder\nfunction messageView() {\n\n  Text(\"简单测试\")\n    .margin({ top: 20, bottom: 20 })\n}\n\n@Entry\n@Component\nstruct Index {\n  build() {\n    Column() {\n      Button(\"click\")\n        .onClick(() =&gt; {\n          DialogUtils.get()\n            .showDialog(this.getUIContext(), {\n              title: \"dialog\",\n              messageView: wrapBuilder(messageView)\n            })\n        })\n    }.width(\"100%\")\n    .height(\"100%\")\n    .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>through the above case, we simply created a custom pop-up window.

Em vez de replicar conteúdos já disponíveis pela internet, pretendo fazer um  das minhas experiências pessoais e do meu entendimento sobre o tema. Hoje, iniciaremos com o princípio SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).</p><p>Os conceitos que formam o acrônimo SOLID já são bem conhecidos há pelo menos 20 anos e são frequentemente abordados em entrevistas técnicas. Mais do que isso, entender profundamente cada princípio melhorará significativamente a qualidade do seu código. A intenção destes textos é esclarecer definitivamente cada conceito para que você consiga aplicá-los independentemente da linguagem que utilizar.</p><p> No final do texto, vou deixar dois repositórios com exemplos práticos implementando cada conceito em Elixir e Golang. Contudo, o mais importante é compreender o fundamento para que você consiga adaptá-lo à sua realidade.</p><p>Esse termo foi cunhado por  (Uncle Bob) em 2000, no livro <em>Design Principles and Design Patterns</em>. Porém, esse problema clássico da programação surgiu após os anos 80 com o aumento da complexidade das aplicações. Com essa complexidade crescente, tornou-se necessário organizar melhor o código, o que impulsionou a implementação de <a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_orientada_a_objetos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">POO</a> no mercado visto que, já existia pelo menos a 20 anos na década de 80/90.</p><p>Segundo o livro , o conceito de SRP pode ser resumido da seguinte maneira:</p><blockquote><p>\"Uma classe ou módulo deve ter um, e apenas um, motivo para mudar.\" (, pág. 138)</p></blockquote><p>Mas, afinal, o que isso significa? Dentro de uma estrutura, seja ela um módulo, pacote ou classe, qualquer interação que fuja da sua responsabilidade original provavelmente violará o SRP.</p><p>Veja estes dois exemplos:</p><ul><li> Dentro de uma estrutura de usuário, existem propriedades e métodos que devem sempre refletir ações e características diretamente relacionadas ao usuário. Exemplo:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Porém, se adicionarmos algo como:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>claramente estaremos quebrando o SRP, já que salvar o usuário não deveria ser responsabilidade direta da estrutura de domínio .</p><ul><li> Também é possível violar esse princípio em outras camadas da aplicação. Veja o exemplo abaixo em Elixir:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Neste exemplo em Elixir fica claro como é fácil misturar responsabilidades. No código inicial, temos criação de usuário, envio de e-mail e log em uma única função, o que fere o SRP. O código corrigido separa claramente as responsabilidades.</p><p>Com esses exemplos, fica mais fácil entender como devemos pensar ao escrever código. Lembre-se de sempre avaliar se cada componente possui apenas uma única razão para mudar, se caso houver mais que uma com certeza o princípio SRP ta quebrado nesse contexto. </p><p>Se ainda houver dúvidas ou se você discordar de algo, deixe um comentário!</p><p>Repositórios com exemplos práticos:</p><p>Ainda vou escrever as outras partes, quando tiver publicado vou linkar aqui, até mais!</p>","contentLength":2933,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Understanding SOLID Once and For All | Part 01","url":"https://dev.to/rafahs/understanding-solid-once-and-for-all-part-01-2bab","date":1751234262,"author":"Rafael Honório","guid":175434,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This is the first post in a series where I’ll explain each SOLID concept clearly and engagingly. Instead of repeating content widely available online, I intend to provide a personal  of my experiences and understanding of these principles. Today, we'll begin with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).</p><p>The concepts forming the SOLID acronym have been well-known for at least 20 years and frequently appear in technical interviews. More importantly, deeply understanding these principles significantly improves your code quality. The purpose of these posts is to definitively clarify each concept so you can apply it independently of the programming language you use.</p><p> At the end of the post, I’ll include two repositories with practical examples implementing each concept in Elixir and Golang. However, the essential aspect is grasping the underlying principles so you can adapt them to your specific context.</p><p>This term was coined by  (Uncle Bob) in 2000, in the book <em>Design Principles and Design Patterns</em>. However, this classic programming challenge emerged during the 1980s as application complexity grew significantly. This increased complexity necessitated better code organization, promoting the adoption of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</a>, which already existed for around two decades by the 80s and 90s.</p><p>According to the book , the SRP can be summarized as follows:</p><blockquote><p>\"A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change.\" (, p. 138)</p></blockquote><p>But what does that mean in practice? Within a structure, be it a module, package, or class, any interaction that deviates from its original purpose probably violates SRP.</p><p>Consider these two examples:</p><ul><li> Within a user structure, properties and methods should always directly reflect user actions and characteristics. For example:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>However, if we add something like:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We clearly violate SRP, as saving the user should not be the direct responsibility of the domain structure .</p><ul><li> It's also possible to violate this principle in other application layers. Consider this Elixir example:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This Elixir example clearly illustrates how easy it is to mix responsibilities. The initial code combines user creation, email sending, and logging into one function, violating SRP. The corrected code clearly separates responsibilities.</p><p>With these examples, it becomes easier to understand how we should approach writing code. Always evaluate whether each component has only one reason to change—if there's more than one reason, SRP is likely being violated in that context.</p><p>If you have any doubts or disagree with anything, feel free to comment!</p><p>Repositories with practical examples:</p><p>I’ll write about the other principles soon and link them here once published.

Then I lined up the camera angle with the original 4Chan post's image. All looked good; it was probably possible! But knowing full well that I'd made it even less likely to work on Safari, the next step was to try and solve that issue.</p><p>From trying to fix the original, I knew that Safari didn't like the sheer size in pixels of the old maze. If I made the rooms tiny and if not too much went out of view, then it almost worked. So this time I scaled everything down. I made each 'room', or square of the grid, only 3x3rem; this helped, but it still crashed. Only when I narrowed down the path from a 12x12 grid to a 4x12 grid did things start to work.</p><p>I then spent the next three months working on a formula (I'm not very good at maths) to work out the position of the camera on the grid and remove cells that were not in view.</p><p>This is the formula to mark the position, not actually required for the final thing:</p><div><pre><code>    %test {\n        background: rgba( magenta,.9);\n    }\n\n    @for $x from 1 through $grid {\n        &amp;:has(#x-#{$x}:checked) {\n            @for $y from 1 through $grid {\n                &amp;:has(#z-#{$y}:checked) {\n                    $yn1: ($y - 1);\n                    $sum: ($yn1 * $grid + $x);\n\n                    floor:nth-of-type(1) tile:nth-of-type(#{$sum}) {\n                        @extend %test;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre></div><p>And it worked on Safari! 🥳</p><p>I then tidied everything up, and in doing so, learned a few useful things. Because of the size of these grids, I needed to make everything more efficient. When it came to mapping out the levels, I got this down to a fine art. I created  loops, so I could easily just add a batch of coordinates from the map.</p><div><pre><code>$east: ( 16: 4 2, 20: 8 2, 28: 4 3, 31: 7 3, 33: 9 3, 40: 4 4, 43: 7 4, 46: 10 4, 47: 11 4, 49: 1 5, 59: 11 5, 61: 1 6, 64: 4 6, 67: 7 6, 73: 1 7, 76: 4 7, 79: 7 7, 82: 10 7, 83: 11 7, 88: 4 8, 94: 10 8, 95: 11 8, 106: 10 9, 107: 11 9, 109: 1 10, 112: 4 10, 118: 10 10, 119: 11 10, 121: 1 11, 124: 4 11, 129: 9 11, 131: 11 11 );\n\n@each $key, $values in $east {\n    $first-value: nth($values, 1);\n    $second-value: nth($values, 2);\n\n    body:has(#level-1:checked):has(#x-#{$first-value}:checked):has(#z-#{$second-value}:checked):has(.x-rotation:checked) {\n        .downb {\n            @extend %d-none-i;\n        }\n\n        .downb[for=\"x-0\"] {\n            @extend %d-block-i;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Getting the first and second values was super handy and simpler than I had imagined.</p><p>I also had to pay attention to how the SASS compiled the output and discovered the beautiful benefit of . I probably should have already known this, but now I really understand.</p><p>And if, like me, you don't already know:</p><p>A loop would normally compile to each loop listing one after the other, for example, this:</p><div><pre><code>z floor tile{\n    $short-wood-right: 1, 2, 3;\n\n    @each $i in $short-wood-right {\n        &amp;:nth-of-type(#{$i}) span:before {\n            transform: translate3d(2.97rem, .5rem, 5.5rem);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>z floor tile:nth-of-type(1) span:before {\n    transform: translate3d(2.97rem, .5rem, 5.5rem);\n}\nz floor tile:nth-of-type(2) span:before {\n    transform: translate3d(2.97rem, .5rem, 5.5rem);\n}\nz floor tile:nth-of-type(3) span:before {\n    transform: translate3d(2.97rem, .5rem, 5.5rem);\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Whereas by using , this:</p><div><pre><code>%wood {transform: translate3d(2.97rem, .5rem, 5.5rem);}\nz floor tile{\n    $short-wood-right: 1, 2, 3;\n    @each $i in $short-wood-right {\n        &amp;:nth-of-type(#{$i}) span:before {\n            @extend %wood;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>z floor tile:nth-of-type(1) span:before, z floor tile:nth-of-type(2) span:before, z floor tile:nth-of-type(3) span:before {\n    transform: translate3d(2.97rem, .5rem, 5.5rem);\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Which is much lighter to load, especially with as many loops as I am using.</p><p>So I tidied everything up, improved the wallpaper, added two floors, put some wall furnishings in, created some kind of storyline with a beginning and end, and added some scary elements. It didn't seem quite complete without any sound, so I threw together some atmospheric loops and, much as it goes against the whole CSS only thing, I had to use a tiny bit to play the sounds 😬 but I made this the absolute bare minimum:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;script&gt;t = i =&gt; document.querySelectorAll('audio').forEach(a =&gt; { a.id == i ? (a.paused &amp;&amp; a.play()) : (a.pause(), a.currentTime = 0) })&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>If anyone can get that to be any smaller, then please let me know.</p><p>In the end, the CSS was so big that I couldn't fit the uncompiled SASS version into CodePen, so it's just the outputted CSS. And I think I added back in so much detail that it probably doesn't work on iPhones anymore. But, anyway, here it is; please let me know what you think I could do to improve the gameplay or the code, and the first person to share a screenshot of the end wins!

This is not clickbait. I thought for a long time about what to call this article, but it is hard to convey in words what is felt. Therefore, I wrote simply as I felt.</p><p>For a long year we have been supplementing the template language, but the range of applied use was quite limited. We developed within the framework of the template paradigm, but, in essence, it was correct, but in an applied <a href=\"https://github.com/hmpl-language/hmpl-dom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project</a> it is still quite difficult to implement this without something serious.</p><p>By serious I mean a framework, or something like that, that supported the syntax by default, but, in fact, if jsx has react, then it is quite difficult to build a structure on it, since it itself is structural.</p><p>Therefore, we took a different path, which I will try to describe in this article 🔎</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚙️ Structural modules and the real DOM\n</h2><p>Whatever anyone says, the time of template languages ​​is a bit different. Today, many people look at artificial intelligence as something breakthrough. And it is, but the fact is that it is not everything in our world. About 10 years ago, there was active development of various template languages, but now you are more likely to find 1000 new AI projects than one with templates.</p><p>And this is not surprising, because with the advent of jsx, ejs and handlebars, we can consider that this topic has exhausted itself and humanity can no longer come up with anything better. Maybe it is so, but only in some aspects. We interact with the server in the same way, and php to js, ​​no matter how much you want, you can’t normally attach it.</p><p>So, as an experiment, we created this project to move this topic forward.</p><div><pre><code>\n  {{#request src=\"/api/my-component.html\"}}\n    {{#indicator trigger=\"pending\"}}\n      Loading...\n    {{/indicator}}\n  {{/request}}\n</code></pre></div><p>HTMX, no matter what SEO techniques they use and how caricatured they are in some sense, have nevertheless proven over 10-12 years of work on the topic that this topic is truly relevant in development. Together with Alpine.js, we see that not all people want to work on frameworks. This is correct, but it is also difficult and cumbersome on the other hand.</p><p>, for some reason, was actively developed in attributes 3-4 years ago, but <strong>for some reason no one looks at template languages</strong>. It's as if the hype on them passed 10 years ago and everyone thinks that they are relics of the past, but this is not so.</p><p>We believe that this topic is not forgotten, but we cannot deny the fact that today most of such projects are based on working with the real DOM. There is simply no escape from this.</p><p>Anyone who thinks that in the world of development <strong>hype can be out of nowhere is wrong</strong>. Today, there are facts that in the state of the market today, people are not ready to switch to something more monumental, since it is easier to sit down at the framework. Therefore, working with the real DOM, when we connect only a couple of files - this is important. If you remember the same Docsify, to create documentation you do not need to install a bunch of packages that are not related to JS at all, as is done with Jekyll, this is the whole point.</p><p>Therefore, no matter how much we develop the theme of the template language, in a vacuum it is quite difficult to use, therefore, in fact, an obvious decision was made to supplement the functionality with a new module, which is called .</p><div><pre><code>Example\n          {{#request src=\"/api/my-component.html\"}}\n            {{#indicator trigger=\"pending\"}}\n              Loading...\n            {{/indicator}}\n          {{/request}}\n        </code></pre></div><p>Thanks to him, we combined the approach of a template language with working with a real DOM. I am convinced that attributes by definition, no matter how extensible they seem (like in Alpine.js, when you write expressions with functions there), they cannot be a full-fledged replacement.</p><p>Yes, they have their advantages, but it's not about them, it's about working with the real DOM without js.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  👀 What if I need to pass ?\n</h2><p>No one will move away from js, even in such an implementation. Its meaning is in the choice of using js or not, as well as in the simplicity that is currently on the market.</p><div><pre><code>Click!\n      Clicks: {{#request src=\"/api/clicks\" after=\"click:#btn\"}}{{/request}}\n    </code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can still pass everything that was done before. It's just another level of nesting, when we had it before only within one compile function, now in a whole connected chain of templates, where a separate templateFunction is created for each (yes, we wouldn't take outerHTML from the entire page, because that would be just stupid.</p><p>More about this project you can find here:</p><p>Also, if you want to support us, you can put a star on our main project.

However, this does not imply that full-service or legacy airlines recovered to pre-pandemic profit levels faster than low-cost airlines, as pre-pandemic profit was not controlled for in this analysis.</p><p><em>For the more statistically inclined, you may read my full analysis <a href=\"https://nbviewer.org/github/darrendube/airline-profitability-analysis/blob/main/notebook.ipynb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a></em>.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Big profits for full-service airlines - with a caveat\n</h4><p>Low-cost carriers earned less profit, on average, than full-service carriers – about $462 million less. </p><p>It is important to note that this does not imply that full-service carriers recovered faster than low-cost carriers – this analysis only considered absolute profit levels and did not control for pre-pandemic profit levels. It also does not imply that low-cost airlines were less profitable than full-service airlines – again, because absolute profit levels, not a ratio, were used.</p><p>Older airlines earned higher profit: each additional year of age resulted in an airline earning $7 million more. This is after controlling for the airline’s size as measured by the number of routes, and whether the airline was a low-cost carrier. </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  More routes, more profit?\n</h4><p>A 1% increase in an airline’s number of routes was found to decrease profit by a couple of millions of dollars (keeping the other factors in the model constant). In fact, an initially positive relationship (before accounting for any other factors) was found to change to a negative one after controlling for these factors. Factors in the model that may have confounded the initial relationship are load factor (indicating that airlines with more routes may have lower average load factors), and aircraft utilisation (indicating that airlines that overutilised their aircraft may have experienced lower average load factors). As the world was still recovering from COVID in FY 2022/23, it was perhaps the case that certain destinations (e.g. more \"ourdoorsy\" vacation destinations) were more popular than others, and airlines that better capitalised on this by focusing on those routes could overcome the disadvantage of maintaining a smaller route network than larger airlines.</p><p>The results of this analysis suggest that, overall, operational efficiency (particularly in how often planes flew and how full they were) may have been more important than airline size or type in determining profit. However, this analysis was based on a non-random sample of 100 airlines, restricting the number of statistical tools available in this analysis.</p><p><em>For a more comprehensive explanation and walkthrough of my analysis, click <a href=\"https://nbviewer.org/github/darrendube/airline-profitability-analysis/blob/main/notebook.ipynb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</em></p><p>Darren Dube - Data Science student at Stellenbosch University.

That's awesome! But the job search itself can feel like a whole new coding challenge. This guide will help you navigate the \"guide entry level job\" process – essentially, how to prepare for and succeed in getting that first developer role. It's important because knowing what to expect, how to present yourself, and what skills are valued can dramatically increase your chances of success. You'll encounter this topic  in interviews, where you'll be asked about your projects and how you approached problems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Understanding \"Guide Entry Level Job\"\n</h3><p>\"Guide entry level job\" isn't a technical term like \"recursion\" or \"polymorphism.\" It's about understanding the  of getting your foot in the door. Think of it like building a simple app. You don't just start coding; you plan, you learn the tools, you test, and you refine.  The \"guide\" part is about knowing the steps involved in the job search. </p><p>It encompasses several key areas:</p><ul><li>  Presenting your skills and projects effectively.</li><li>  Basic coding challenges to assess your fundamentals.</li><li>  Questions about how you work, solve problems, and handle challenges.</li><li>  Talking through the projects you've built, explaining your choices, and demonstrating your understanding.</li></ul><p>Essentially, it's about showing potential employers that you have the  to be a valuable team member, even if you don't have years of experience. They're looking for a willingness to learn, a solid foundation, and a positive attitude.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Basic Code Example: A Simple Resume Parser (Conceptual)\n</h3><p>Let's illustrate this with a very simplified example. Imagine you're building a tool to help you analyze job descriptions.  This isn't about writing a full-fledged parser, but about showing how you might approach a problem.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li><code>def extract_keywords(job_description):</code> defines a function that takes a job description as input.</li><li> converts the description to lowercase to ensure consistent keyword matching.</li><li> splits the string into a list of individual words (keywords).</li><li> returns the list of keywords.</li><li> The last two lines demonstrate how to use the function with a sample job description and print the results.</li></ol><p>This is a  basic example, but it shows how you can take a real-world problem (understanding job requirements) and start to break it down into code.  In a real interview, you'd be expected to discuss how you'd improve this – adding filtering, handling punctuation, etc.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes or Misunderstandings\n</h3><p>Here are some common mistakes beginners make when preparing for entry-level jobs:</p><p><strong>❌ Incorrect code (Resume):</strong></p><div><pre><code>Skills: Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Node.js, SQL, Git, Docker, Kubernetes\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>✅ Corrected code (Resume):</strong></p><div><pre><code>Skills: Python (Intermediate), HTML/CSS (Beginner), JavaScript (Basic), Git (Proficient)\n</code></pre></div><p> Listing  you've touched makes you look like a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Be honest about your proficiency level.  \"Intermediate\" or \"Beginner\" are perfectly acceptable for entry-level roles.</p><p><strong>❌ Incorrect code (Project Explanation):</strong></p><p>\"I just copied the code from a tutorial.\"</p><p><strong>✅ Corrected code (Project Explanation):</strong></p><p>\"I followed a tutorial to build a basic to-do list app, but I then modified it to include user authentication and local storage.\"</p><p>  It's okay to learn from tutorials, but employers want to see that you can  what you've learned and go beyond simply copying code.  Highlight your modifications and additions.</p><p><strong>❌ Incorrect code (Technical Screening):</strong></p><p>Trying to write the most complex solution possible.</p><p><strong>✅ Corrected code (Technical Screening):</strong></p><p>Writing a simple, correct, and readable solution.</p><p>  Technical screenings aren't about showing off your advanced skills. They're about verifying that you can solve basic problems correctly.  Prioritize clarity and correctness over complexity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Real-World Use Case: A Simple Portfolio Website\n</h3><p>A great way to demonstrate your skills is to build a simple portfolio website. This doesn't need to be fancy!</p><ul><li> Use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for basic interactivity.</li><li> Include a brief \"About Me\" section, a list of your projects (with links to GitHub), and your contact information.</li><li> Deploy it to a free hosting service like Netlify or GitHub Pages.</li></ul><p>This project showcases your ability to build a complete web application, even a simple one. It also provides a central location to showcase your work to potential employers.</p><p>Here are some practice ideas to help you prepare:</p><ol><li> Solve 5-10 easy problems on LeetCode to practice your coding skills.</li><li> Ask a friend or mentor to conduct a mock technical interview.</li><li> Take one of your existing projects and refactor it to improve its readability and maintainability.</li><li>  Get your resume reviewed by a career counselor or experienced developer.</li><li><strong>Behavioral Question Practice:</strong>  Research common behavioral interview questions (e.g., \"Tell me about a time you failed\") and practice your answers.</li></ol><p>So, \"guide entry level job\" is all about preparation and presentation. It's about understanding the process, showcasing your skills effectively, and demonstrating your willingness to learn. Don't be afraid to apply for jobs even if you don't meet all the requirements.  Focus on highlighting your strengths and your potential.  </p><p>Remember, everyone starts somewhere. Keep learning, keep building, and don't give up!  Next steps?  Explore resources on data structures and algorithms, practice your coding skills regularly, and start networking with other developers. Good luck!</p>","contentLength":5646,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AWS open source newsletter, #211","url":"https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-211-188","date":1751231597,"author":"Ricardo Sueiras","guid":175413,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to issue #211 of the AWS open source newsletter, the newsletter where I try and provide you the best open source on AWS content.

It enables users to create, manage, and share encrypted secrets (e.g., passwords) with individuals or groups, leveraging AWS Cognito for authentication, DynamoDB for storage, and KMS for encryption. Check out the repo for screenshots of what the app looks like as well as more technical implementation details (which you can deploy via OpenTofu/Terraform). I wish more READMEs would do this, but they also include some estimated costs of what it might cost to run this project in your AWS Account. Go check it out.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4er\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yes3-scanner</a> is the first in a series of projects from the folks at , which scans an AWS Account for potential S3 security issues such as access issues such as Public Access, preventative S3 Security Settings, additional security such as encryption, and Ransomware Protection, Data Protection, and Recovery.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4es\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aws-managed-kms-keys</a> more goodness from the folks at , this time providing a repo that provides a listing of AWS Managed KMS Keys and their associated policies in /reference_key_policies. There's a periodic scheduled job that will run and update the listings and data. The README does note that <em>\"AWS managed keys are a legacy key type that are no longer being created for new AWS services as of 2021\"</em> so you might not expect to see more AWS managed keys outside of the ones already listed</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4et\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finders-keypers</a> is a command line tool that will explore your AWS account and kook for direct connections for KMS Keys and resources in your account. This tool supports both AWS Customer Managed KMS Keys and AWS Managed KMS Keys (with some additional details in the README that you should check out). Typical use cases where this tool is helpful includes security and audit for KMS Key and Resources, Data Protection with Encryption, discovering blast radius of a specific KMS Key, changing a KMS Key or rotating key material, checking Default Settings in AWS that create new resources with the KMS Key, and audit of your resources that a KMS Key may grant access to. README provide examples of how to run the cli against some of those use cases. Very nice tool indeed.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ew\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iam-collect</a> is a tool from  that helps you collect IAM information from all your AWS organization, accounts, and resources. This is built to run out of the box in simple use cases, and also work in terribly oppressive environments with a little more configuration. If you want to analyze IAM data at scale this is what you've been looking for.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iam-lens</a> is another tool from , which builds upon iam-collect, and helps you evaluate your AWS IAM policies offline. It. helps you get visibility into the IAM permissions in your AWS Organizations and accounts. It will use your actual AWS IAM policies (downloaded via iam-collect) and evaluate the effective permissions.

Check out the README for example code and more details.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ex\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cdk-sops-secrets</a> helps you create secret values in AWS with infrastructure-as-code easily by providing a CDK construct library that facilitate syncing SOPS-encrypted secrets to AWS Secrets Manager and SSM Parameter Store. It enables secure storage of secrets in Git repositories while allowing seamless synchronisation and usage within AWS. Even large sets of SSM Parameters can be created quickly from a single file. Detailed README with plenty of examples of how you can use this. Very nice.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deploy-time-build</a> is an AWS CDK L3 construct that allows you to run a build job for specific purposes. Currently this library supports the following use cases: 1/ Build web frontend static files, 2/Build a container image, and 3/Build Seekable OCI (SOCI) indices for container images. Nice README with plenty of example code on how you can use against these use cases.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ez\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secret</a> is from  and provides a CDK Construct to create Secrets Manager secrets without unexpectedly recreating them (avoiding the issue when you update the generateSecretString property, the secret gets recreated!).

It is an AI generated migration of the Python SDK to TypeScript, using the same architecture and design principles. It is not a direct translation but rather a reimagining of the SDK in TypeScript, leveraging its features and idioms. As he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryancormack_github-ryancormackstrands-ts-activity-7343022012941975552-ANWU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">points out</a> in his social media post:</p><blockquote><p>🤖 Inspired by the power of today's coding agents, I decided to see if AI could translate it. The result? A semi/mostly/barely functional, AI-generated Strands SDK in Typescript! 🤔 </p><p>This unofficial repo mirrors the API of the original, complete with support for agents, built-in tools, custom tools and MCP. It's a testament to the quality of the original SDK that an AI could so effectively replicate its structure and style in a new language. Please don't use this repo for anything - it's missing a ton of stuff (not least a human reviewing it) and will probably break.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops\n</h3><p><strong>wio-from-diagram-to-code-with-amazon-q-developer</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4eu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wio-from-diagram-to-code-with-amazon-q-developer</a> is a repo from <strong>AWS Community Builder Olivier Lemaitre</strong> that provides an extensive set of tutorials and labs he has put together to support a number of blog posts he has written, on how to go from diagram to code using AI Coding Assistants like Amazon Q Developer.

We have more than we usually do, but thought these were all essential reads this month.</p><p>Each month I spend time reading posts from across the AWS community on open source topics. In this section I share what personally caught my eye and interest, and I hope that many of you will also find them interesting.</p><p>I want to start this issue by sharing info about <strong>AWS Community Builder Maandeep Singh's</strong> book (co-author), <a href=\"https://oreil.ly/ruQbc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">System Design on AWS</a>, which includes lots of open source technologies (Kubernetes, Valkey, and more). If you are looking for a good book on AWS, why not check it out.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4eh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strands Agents</a> is one of the hottest open source projects at the moment, that takes a simple yet powerful SDK that takes a model-driven approach to building and running AI agents. Not surprisingly, there has been a lot of great content appearing from the AWS Community to help you understand and get started with this. My colleague  put together <a href=\"https://dev.to/aws/i-built-a-city-explorer-using-the-strands-agents-sdk-4n9b\">I built a city explorer using the Strands Agents SDK</a> providing a quick guide on how you can get started, extending an application she had built previously.   also shared her experiences in the post <a href=\"https://dev.to/aws/first-impressions-with-strands-agents-sdk-4hha\">First Impressions with Strands Agents SDK</a>.  Long time contributor to this newsletter  is on a hot streak, creating more great content, this time on Strands Agents. In <a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ei\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Introducing AWS Strands Agents: A New Paradigm in AI Agent Development</a>, after a quick primer he shows you how to create a Perplexity-like web search agent using Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock foundation models, including Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 and Amazon Nova Premier. Following that, he dives into Model Context Protocol (MCP), showing you how Stands Agents and MCP help orchestrate searches across multiple third-party APIs in the post, <a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ej\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Strands Agents: Building and Connecting Your First MCP Server</a>.</p><p>There was a number of important posts for AWS CDK fans this month, starting with <strong>AWS Hero Rehan van der Merwe</strong> who shares his experiences and tips for migrating from CDK Pipelines to CDK Express Pipelines in the post, <a href=\"https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/4ef\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Migrate from CDK Pipelines to CDK Express Pipeline</a>. Following that is  who walks you through the CDK Toolkit Library, a library that allows you to directly incorporate CDK deployment and other operations into TypeScript programs for execution, in the post <a href=\"https://dev.to/aws-heroes/understanding-cdk-toolkit-library-comparing-with-cdk-cli-1k2b\">Understanding CDK Toolkit Library: Comparing with CDK CLI</a>. Not content with just one post, he followed that with another post, <a href=\"https://dev.to/aws-heroes/using-aws-cdk-property-injectors-2mo5\">Using AWS CDK Property Injectors</a> that takes a look at what CDK Property Injectors are and how you can use them. Both are essential reads if you are a CDK geek. The final CDK related post in this round up comes from <strong>AWS Community Builder Joris Conijn</strong> who addresses some pain points he had during one of the projects he was working on, and how he addressed it. Go read his post, <a href=\"https://dev.to/aws-builders/fixing-oversized-artifacts-aws-cdk-pipelines-33nc\">Fixing oversized artifacts AWS CDK Pipelines</a></p><p>Announced at the beginning of the month was news of the general availability of the AWS CDK Toolkit Library, a Node.js library that provides programmatic access to core AWS CDK functionalities such as synthesis, deployment, and destruction of stacks. This library enables developers to integrate CDK operations directly into their applications, custom CLIs, and automation workflows, offering greater flexibility and control over infrastructure management. Prior to this release, interacting with CDK required using the CDK CLI, which could present challenges when integrating CDK actions into automated workflows or custom tools. With the CDK Toolkit Library, developers can now build custom CLIs, integrate CDK actions in their existing CI/CD workflows, programmatically enforce guardrails and policies, and manage ephemeral environments.</p><p>We have a bunch of quick updates this month.</p><p>Kubernetes version 1.33 introduced several new features and bug fixes, and AWS is excited to announce that you can now use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon EKS Distro to run Kubernetes version 1.33. Starting today, you can create new EKS clusters using version 1.33 and upgrade existing clusters to version 1.33 using the EKS console, the eksctl command line interface, or through an infrastructure-as-code tool. Kubernetes version 1.33 includes stable support for sidecar containers, topology-aware routing and traffic distribution, and consideration of taints and tolerations when calculating pod topology spread constraints, ensuring that pods are distributed across different topologies according to their specified tolerance. This release also adds support for user namespaces within Linux pods, dynamic resource allocation for network interfaces, and in-place resource resizing for vertical scaling of pods. To learn more about the changes in Kubernetes version 1.33, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions-standard.html?trk=fd6bb27a-13b0-4286-8269-c7b1cfaa29f0&amp;sc_channel=el\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our documentation</a> and the Kubernetes <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project release notes</a>.</p><p>Amazon EKS Pod Identity now provides a simplified experience for configuring application permissions to access AWS resources in separate accounts. With enhancements to EKS Pod Identity APIs, you can now seamlessly configure access to resources across AWS accounts by providing the resource account’s IAM details during the creation of the Pod Identity association. Your applications running in the EKS cluster automatically receive the required AWS credentials during runtime without requiring any code changes. EKS Pod Identity enables applications in your EKS cluster to access AWS resources across accounts through a process called IAM role chaining. When creating a Pod Identity association, you can provide two IAM roles — an EKS Pod Identity role in the same account as your EKS cluster and a target IAM role from the account containing your AWS resources (like S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables). When your application pod needs to access AWS resources, it requests credentials from the EKS Pod Identity, which automatically assumes the roles through IAM role chaining to provide your pod with the necessary cross-account temporary credentials.</p><p>AWS also announced this month the general availability of Private CA Connector for Kubernetes Amazon EKS add-on. This new integration allows customers to easily issue certificates from AWS Private Certificate Authority (AWS Private CA) to their Kubernetes clusters running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The add-on installs and manages the Private CA Connector for Kubernetes. The connector enables customers to use AWS Private CA certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) termination at load balancers, Kubernetes ingress controllers, and pods, as well as securing pod-to-pod communication. With the new Amazon EKS add-on, customers can quickly and easily set up new and existing clusters using automation to leverage AWS Private CA certificates, enhancing security and simplifying certificate management. Previously, this process could take hours or even days and involved numerous manual steps. The connector works in conjunction with cert-manager, an open-source certificate lifecycle management Kubernetes add-on, to provide a comprehensive solution for certificate issuance and management within Kubernetes environments. cert-manager is also available through the Amazon EKS add-ons catalog. Amazon EKS add-ons are curated extensions that automate the installation, configuration, and lifecycle management of operational software for Kubernetes clusters, simplifying the process of maintaining cluster functionality and security. AWS Private CA is a managed service that lets you create private certificate authority hierarchies to issue private certificates. AWS Private CA secures private key material using Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3 Security Level 3 hardware security modules (HSMs).</p><p>Also announced this month was the general availability of configuration insights for Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes. These new insights surface configuration issues impacting the functionality of Amazon EKS clusters with hybrid nodes, and provide actionable guidance on how to remediate identified misconfigurations. Configuration insights are available through the Amazon EKS cluster insights APIs and on the observability dashboard in the Amazon EKS console. Amazon EKS cluster insights now automatically scans Amazon EKS clusters with hybrid nodes to identify configuration issues impairing Kubernetes control plane-to-webhook communication, kubectl commands like exec and logs, and more. Configuration insights surface issues and provide remediation recommendations, accelerating the time to a fully functioning hybrid nodes setup.</p><p>Amazon MWAA is a managed service for Apache Airflow that lets you use the same familiar Apache Airflow platform as you do today to orchestrate your workflows and enjoy improved scalability, availability, and security without the operational burden of having to manage the underlying infrastructure. Amazon MWAA now allows you to update your environment without disrupting your ongoing workflow tasks. By choosing this option, you are now able to update an MWAA environment in graceful manner where MWAA will replace Airflow Scheduler and Webserver components, provision new workers, and wait for ongoing worker tasks to complete before removing older workers. The graceful option is available only for supported Apache Airflow versions (v2.4.3 or later) on MWAA.</p><p>Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink (an open source framework and engine for processing data streams) now supports dual-stack endpoints for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. When you make a request to a dual-stack endpoint, the endpoint URL resolves to an IPv6 or an IPv4 address. You can access dual-stack endpoints using the SDK, a configuration file, or an environment variable. The continued growth of the internet is exhausting available Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses. IPv6 increases the number of available addresses by several orders of magnitude so customers will no longer need to manage overlapping address spaces in their VPCs.</p><p>Amazon EMR on EKS now supports Service Quotas, improving visibility and control over EMR on EKS quotas. Previously, to request an increase for EMR on EKS quotas, such as maximum number of StartJobRun API calls per second, customers had to open a support ticket and wait for the support team to process the increase. Now, customers can view and manage their EMR on EKS quota limits directly in the Service Quotas console. This enables automated limit increase approvals for eligible requests, improving response times and reducing the number of support tickets. Customers can also set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms to get automatically notified when their usage reaches a certain percentage of a maximum quota.</p><p>General Language Independent Driver for the Enterprise (GLIDE) 2.0, the latest release of one of its official open source Valkey client libraries, in now officially generally available (GA). Valkey is the most permissive open source alternative to Redis stewarded by the Linux Foundation, which means it will always be open source. Valkey GLIDE is a reliable, high-performance, multi-language client that supports all Valkey commands. GLIDE 2.0 brings new capabilities that expand developer support, improve observability, and optimize performance for high-throughput workloads.</p><p>Valkey GLIDE 2.0 extends its multi-language support to Go (contributed by Google), joining Java, Python, and Node.js to provide a consistent, fully compatible API experience across all four languages—with more on the way. With this release, Valkey GLIDE now supports OpenTelemetry, an open source, vendor-neutral framework enabling developers to generate, collect, and export telemetry data and critical client-side performance insights. Additionally, GLIDE 2.0 introduces batching capabilities, reducing network overhead and latency for high-frequency use cases by allowing multiple commands to be grouped and executed as a single operation.</p><p>This month AWS announced the open sourcing of pgactive, a PostgreSQL extension for active-active replication. pgactive lets you use asynchronous active-active replication for streaming data between database instances to provide additional resiliency and flexibility in moving data between database instances, including writers located in different regions. This helps maintain availability for operations like switching write traffic to a different instance. pgactive builds on the foundation PostgreSQL logical replication features, such as bidirectional replication between tables starting in PostgreSQL 16, adding capabilities that simplify managing active-active replication scenarios. Open sourcing the pgactive extension allows for more collaboration on developing active-active capabilities of PostgreSQL, while offering features that simplify using PostgreSQL in scenarios that benefit from multiple active instances.</p><p>In more PostgreSQL updates, Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL introduces Extended Support minor versions 11.22-rds.20250508 and 12.22-rds.20250508, which include important security updates and bug fixes for PostgreSQL databases.. We recommend upgrading your RDS instances to these latest versions to maintain optimal security and performance of your PostgreSQL deployments. Amazon RDS Extended Support provides you more time, up to three years, to upgrade to a new major version to help you meet your business requirements. During Extended Support, Amazon RDS will provide critical security and bug fixes for your RDS for PostgreSQL databases after the community ends support for a major version. You can run your PostgreSQL databases on Amazon RDS with Extended Support for up to three years beyond a major version’s end of standard support date.</p><p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MariaDB now supports new community MariaDB minor versions 10.11.13 and 11.4.7. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of MariaDB, and to benefit from the bug fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the MariaDB community. You can leverage automatic minor version upgrades to automatically upgrade your databases to more recent minor versions during scheduled maintenance windows. You can also leverage Amazon RDS Managed Blue/Green deployments for safer, simpler, and faster updates to your MariaDB instances.</p><p>Amazon RDS for MySQL now supports community MySQL Innovation Release 9.3 in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment, allowing you to evaluate the latest Innovation Release on Amazon RDS for MySQL. You can deploy MySQL 9.3 in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment which provides the benefits of a fully managed database, making it simpler to set up, operate, and monitor databases. MySQL 9.3 is the latest Innovation Release from the MySQL community. MySQL Innovation releases include bug fixes, security patches, as well as new features. MySQL Innovation releases are supported by the community until the next innovation minor, whereas MySQL Long Term Support (LTS) Releases, such as MySQL 8.0 and MySQL 8.4, are supported by the community for up to eight years.</p><p>First up is news that Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) now supports Apache Kafka version 3.8 on Express Brokers, introducing new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements for Kafka workloads running on Express Brokers. The update brings enhancements in data compression capabilities. You can now configure compression levels for lz4, zstd, and gzip formats, allowing precise control over the balance between compression efficiency and resource usage.</p><p>In related news, AWS Lambda now provides native support for Avro and Protobuf formatted Kafka events with Apache Kafka’s event-source-mapping (ESM), and integrates with AWS Glue Schema registry (GSR), Confluent Cloud Schema registry (CCSR), and self-managed Confluent Schema registry (SCSR) for schema management. This enables you to validate your schema, filter events, and process events using open-source Kafka consumer interfaces. Additionally, customers can use Powertools for AWS Lambda to process their Kafka events without writing custom deserialisation code, making it easier to build their Kafka applications with AWS Lambda. Kafka customers use Avro and Protobuf formats for efficient data storage, fast serialisation and deserialisation, schema evolution support, and interoperability between different programming languages. They utilise schema registry to manage, evolve, and validate schemas before data enters processing pipelines. Previously, customers were required to write custom code within their Lambda function, in order to validate, de-serialise, and filter events when using these data formats. With today's launch, Lambda natively supports Avro and Protobuf as well as integration with GSR, CCSR and SCSR, enabling customers to process their Kafka events using these data formats, without writing custom code. Additionally, customers can optimise costs through event filtering to prevent unnecessary function invocations.</p><p>Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a simple, open source, high-throughput file client for mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 now lets you automatically mount an S3 bucket when your Amazon EC2 instance starts up. This simplifies how you define a consistent mounting configuration that automatically applies when your instance starts up and persists the mount when the instance reboots. Previously, to use Mountpoint for Amazon S3, you had to manually mount an S3 bucket after every boot and validate the correct mount options. Now, with support for automatic bucket mounting, you can add your Mountpoint configuration to the fstab file so it is automatically applied every time your instance starts up. Linux system administrators commonly use fstab to manage mount configurations centrally. It contains information about all the available mounts on your compute instance. Once you modify the fstab file to add a new entry for Mountpoint for Amazon S3, your EC2 instance will read the configuration to automatically mount the S3 bucket whenever it restarts.</p><p>You can now attach Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Access Points to your Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file systems so that you can access your file data as if it were in S3. With this new capability, your file data in FSx for OpenZFS is accessible for use with the broad range of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and analytics services and applications that work with S3 while your file data continues to reside on the FSx for OpenZFS file system.</p><p>An S3 Access Point is an endpoint that helps control and simplify how different applications or users can access data. S3 Access Points now work with FSx for OpenZFS so that applications and services can access file data in FSx for OpenZFS using the S3 API and as if the data were in S3. You can discover new insights, innovate faster, and make even better data-driven decisions with your data in FSx for OpenZFS. For example, you can use your file data to augment generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock, train machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker, run analyses using Amazon Glue, a wide range of AWS Data and Analytics Competency Partner solutions, and S3-based cloud-native applications.</p><p><strong>Powertools for AWS Lambda</strong></p><p>Powertools for AWS Lambda now offers a new Amazon Bedrock Agents Function utility that simplifies building serverless applications integrated with Amazon Bedrock Agents. This utility enables developers to easily create AWS Lambda functions that can respond to Amazon Bedrock Agent action requests with built-in parameter injection, response formatting, eliminating boilerplate code and accelerating development.</p><p>With the Amazon Bedrock Agents function utility, developers can focus on business logic while the utility handles the complex integration patterns between AWS Lambda and Amazon Bedrock Agents. The utility provides seamless integration with other Powertools features like Logger, Metrics, among other utilities, making it easier to build, test, and deploy production-ready AI applications. This integration significantly improves developer experience when building agent-based solutions that require Lambda functions to process actions requested by Bedrock Agents.</p><p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for AWS, starting with RHEL 10, is now generally available, combining Red Hat’s enterprise-grade Linux software with native AWS integration. RHEL for AWS is built to achieve optimum performance of RHEL running on AWS. This offering features pre-tuned images with AWS-specific performance profiles, built-in Amazon CloudWatch telemetry, integrated AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), image mode using container-native tooling, enhanced security from boot to runtime, and optimised networking with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) support.</p><p><strong>Meet MCP Servers | Context-Aware AI for Amazon EKS and ECS</strong></p><p>These projects featured in the last newsletter, so it was good that the Containers from the Couch crew decided to put together a nice walk through of how to get started.</p><p>With re:Inforce just finished, it was good to see that the team had uploaded some of the session videos.

Today, too many developers show up armed with copy-paste reflexes, pasting half-baked questions into chat windows and waiting for the perfect snippet to drop. </p><p>Somewhere between the rise of StackOverflow and the AI autocomplete frenzy, we decided that thinking was optional—and in doing so, we sold our birthright for a bag of pre-wrapped “solutions.”</p><p>Imagine watching a generation of coders treat Google like a slot machine: pull the lever on a vague query, expect the jackpot of code, and move on. They beg for hand-outs rather than hunt for knowledge. They confuse answers with understanding, as if searching bandwidth were a substitute for brainpower. </p><p>But when tomorrow’s systems begin to outthink yesterday’s search bars, what will set you apart?</p><p><strong>The Death of Developer Curiosity</strong>\nCuriosity is the spark that turns lines of code into living systems. It’s the itch that drives you to stare at an error message until it bleeds clarity. When you replace that itch with instant gratification, you trade growth for glow—an artificial shine that masks brittle foundations. The next time you feel that twitch: pause. Ask yourself not, “Who can fix this?” but, “Why does this refuse to fix itself?” That momentary discomfort—that refusal to click “Send”—is the crucible of genuine mastery.</p><p><strong>Friction as Fuel, Not Friction as Foe</strong>\nWe worship efficiency, yet efficiency without friction is hollow. Real progress is forged in friction’s fire: documenting obscure libraries, tracing stack traces into legacy code, and parsing docs written in another century’s voice. Every automated “fix” you accept robs you of an opportunity to sweat ink on your mental blueprint. </p><p>In this age of AI mediators, reclaim friction by demanding more from your own intellect. Wear the burn of confusion like a badge of honour, and watch your neural pathways sculpt themselves into ever-sharper tools.</p><p><strong>Anatomy of a Worthy Question</strong>\nThe finest programmers are surgeons of inquiry. They distill colossal codebases into surgical snippets, they enclose error messages in quotes, and they wrap their context in a one-sentence mission statement. “I need to fetch user profiles from an API and parse timestamps, but response.json() throws SyntaxError even though the raw JSON seems valid.” </p><p>That’s not begging — it’s beaconing. It draws the most skilled responders faster than a cry for “fix plz” ever could.</p><p><strong>Why Minimal Reproducible Examples Matter</strong>\nYour twenty-line snippet is your calling card. Strip away everything but the problem’s DNA—no frameworks, no helpers, no noise. </p><p>If the essence of your question can’t be seen at a glance, it’s obscured by your own complexity. When maintainers and mentors scan your snippet, they should feel the pulse of the fault, not the flotsam of your unfiltered repo. This act of distillation teaches you not only how to ask, but how to think through a solution before words touch the keyboard.</p><p><strong>The Mirage of Instant Solutions</strong>\nEvery time you paste someone else’s code into your project, you learn two things: how to copy, and how not to understand. You sculpt a castle built on borrowed stone. It may stand for a moment, but the first storm of novelty will send it tumbling. </p><p>True resilience comes from the slow art of comprehension—reading three pages of documentation until paragraphs begin to resonate, until acronyms crack open like walnuts in your mind.</p><p>\nThis is your invitation to rebel. When you feel the urge to toss a half-formed plea into the void, lean in instead. Pinpoint your objective, excavate the layers of error, and construct the leanest code that still bleeds failure. </p><p>Hunt down the documentation that whispered its secrets at 2 AM, not just the excerpts that surfaced in search results. </p><p>Celebrate each moment of cognitive abrasion, for these are the bruises that shape a developer’s soul.</p><p>If you’re hungry for more unfiltered provocations—dispatches that refuse to smooth over life’s jagged edges—subscribe free to Nostradumbass,and join the few who still believe friction breeds brilliance.</p>","contentLength":4272,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why DigitalOcean Spaces Auto-Downloads Large PDFs - And How to Fix It","url":"https://dev.to/tahsin000/why-digitalocean-spaces-auto-downloads-large-pdfs-and-how-to-fix-it-jh","date":1751229484,"author":"Tahsin Abrar","guid":175399,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you're using  to serve static files like images, PDFs, or videos, you may have noticed something odd:\nWhen you try to <strong>open a large PDF file (say 20MB+) using a direct URL</strong>, instead of showing a preview in the browser, it just .</p><p>Frustrating, right?

Consider a financial institution needing to analyze transaction data for fraud detection.  The data volume is immense (terabytes daily), velocity is high (near real-time streams), schema evolves frequently (new transaction types), and query latency must be low (sub-second for alerts).  Traditional data warehousing solutions often struggle with this scale and flexibility.  </p><p>“Hadoop tutorial” – referring to the core principles of distributed data processing and storage initially popularized by the Hadoop ecosystem – remains fundamentally relevant, even within modern data lakehouse architectures. While the original Hadoop stack (HDFS, MapReduce) is often superseded by cloud-native alternatives, the underlying concepts of distributed file systems, parallel processing, and fault tolerance are crucial.  This post dives into the architectural considerations, performance tuning, and operational realities of building production-grade data pipelines leveraging these principles, focusing on how they integrate with technologies like Spark, Iceberg, and cloud platforms.  We’ll focus on the  of Hadoop-style processing, not necessarily the original Hadoop distribution itself.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is \"hadoop tutorial\" in Big Data Systems?\n</h2><p>From a data architecture perspective, “hadoop tutorial” represents a paradigm shift towards  and  distributed processing. It’s about breaking down large datasets into smaller chunks, distributing them across a cluster of commodity hardware, and processing them in parallel.  </p><p>Its role is primarily in data storage and batch/micro-batch processing.  While streaming frameworks like Flink are gaining prominence, many pipelines still rely on a “lambda architecture” or its variations, where batch processing provides a foundation for more complex real-time analytics.  </p><p>Key technologies include:</p><ul><li><strong>Distributed File Systems:</strong> HDFS (historical), S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage.</li><li> Parquet (columnar, efficient compression), ORC (optimized for Hive), Avro (schema evolution).</li><li> Spark, Hive, Presto/Trino, Flink.</li><li>  Data locality (moving computation to the data), data partitioning (splitting data based on keys), and fault tolerance (replication and job retries).</li></ul><ol><li><strong>CDC Ingestion &amp; Transformation:</strong> Capturing changes from operational databases (using Debezium, Maxwell) and applying transformations (cleaning, enrichment) before loading into a data lake.  This often involves large-scale joins with reference data.</li><li> Processing clickstream data from a website or mobile app.  Aggregating events, calculating metrics (DAU, MAU), and storing results in a time-series database.</li><li> Combining customer data with purchase history, demographic information, and marketing campaign data for personalized recommendations.</li><li><strong>Schema Validation &amp; Data Quality:</strong>  Validating incoming data against predefined schemas (using Great Expectations, Deequ) and flagging or rejecting invalid records.</li><li>  Generating features from raw data for machine learning models.  This often involves complex transformations and aggregations.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  System Design &amp; Architecture\n</h2><p>A typical data pipeline leveraging “hadoop tutorial” principles looks like this:</p><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Data Sources (DBs, APIs, Streams)] --&gt; B(Ingestion Layer - Kafka, Kinesis);\n    B --&gt; C{Data Lake (S3, GCS, ADLS)};\n    C --&gt; D[Processing Engine (Spark, Flink)];\n    D --&gt; E[Data Warehouse/Mart (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)];\n    D --&gt; F[Serving Layer (Presto, Druid)];\n    C --&gt; G[Metadata Catalog (Hive Metastore, Glue)];\n    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n</code></pre></div><p>This architecture emphasizes decoupling.  The ingestion layer buffers data, the data lake provides durable storage, the processing engine performs transformations, and the serving layer enables querying.  The metadata catalog provides schema information and data discovery.</p><p><strong>Cloud-Native Setup (AWS EMR):</strong>  EMR simplifies cluster management.  A typical EMR cluster might consist of:</p><ul><li>  Manages the cluster (YARN Resource Manager, Spark Driver).</li><li>  Store data (HDFS or S3) and perform computations (Spark Executors).</li><li>  Perform computations (Spark Executors) but don’t store data.</li></ul><p>Partitioning is critical.  For example, partitioning a table by date allows for efficient filtering and reduces the amount of data scanned during queries.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Tuning &amp; Resource Management\n</h2><p>Performance tuning is crucial for cost-efficiency and meeting SLAs.</p><ul><li>  Configure  and  appropriately.  Avoid excessive garbage collection by tuning .</li><li>  Set <code>spark.sql.shuffle.partitions</code> to a value that’s a multiple of the number of cores in your cluster.  A common starting point is 2-3x the total number of cores.</li><li>  Use Parquet or ORC for columnar storage and compression.  Configure <code>fs.s3a.connection.maximum</code> (for S3) to increase the number of concurrent connections.</li><li>  Small files lead to increased metadata overhead.  Regularly compact small files into larger ones.</li><li>  Minimize data shuffling by using broadcast joins for small tables and optimizing join conditions.</li></ul><p><strong>Example Configuration (Spark):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These settings impact throughput (data processed per unit time), latency (time to complete a query), and infrastructure cost (EC2/VM instances).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Failure Modes &amp; Debugging\n</h2><p>Common failure scenarios:</p><ul><li>  Uneven distribution of data across partitions, leading to some tasks taking much longer than others.</li><li>  Insufficient memory allocated to the driver or executors.</li><li>  Transient errors (network issues, temporary service outages) causing jobs to be retried.</li><li>  Errors in the Spark DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) causing the entire job to fail.</li></ul><ul><li>  Provides detailed information about job execution, task performance, and memory usage.</li><li>  Similar to Spark UI, but for Flink jobs.</li><li>  Monitoring metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O) to identify bottlenecks.</li><li>  Driver and executor logs provide valuable information about errors and exceptions.</li></ul><p><strong>Example Log Snippet (Data Skew):</strong></p><div><pre><code>WARN TaskSetManager: Task 0 in stage 1.0 failed 4 times due to Exception in app...\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n</code></pre></div><p>This suggests a task is processing a disproportionately large amount of data.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Data Governance &amp; Schema Management\n</h2><p>“Hadoop tutorial” systems require robust data governance.</p><ul><li>  Hive Metastore, AWS Glue, or similar tools store schema information and data lineage.</li><li>  Confluent Schema Registry or similar tools manage schema evolution and ensure compatibility.</li><li>  Use Avro or Parquet with schema evolution capabilities to handle changes to data schemas.</li><li>  Implement data quality checks (using Great Expectations, Deequ) to ensure data accuracy and completeness.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Security and Access Control\n</h2><ul><li>  Encrypt data at rest (using S3 encryption, GCS encryption) and in transit (using TLS).</li><li>  Implement row-level access control to restrict access to sensitive data.</li><li>  Enable audit logging to track data access and modifications.</li><li>  Use tools like Apache Ranger or AWS Lake Formation to define and enforce access policies.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Testing &amp; CI/CD Integration\n</h2><ul><li>  Test individual data transformations and aggregations.</li><li>  Test the entire data pipeline from ingestion to serving.</li><li>  Use Great Expectations or DBT tests to validate data quality.</li><li>  Use tools to check for syntax errors and best practices.</li><li>  Deploy pipelines to staging environments for testing before deploying to production.</li><li><strong>Automated Regression Tests:</strong>  Run automated tests after each deployment to ensure that the pipeline is still working correctly.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Operational Misconceptions\n</h2><ol><li>  Leads to metadata overhead and reduced performance.  Regularly compact small files.</li><li>  Causes uneven task execution times.  Use salting or bucketing to redistribute data.</li><li>  Results in out-of-memory errors.  Increase driver/executor memory or optimize data transformations.</li><li>  Leads to inefficient queries.  Choose partitioning keys based on query patterns.</li><li>  Leads to data discovery and governance issues.  Invest in a robust metadata catalog.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Enterprise Patterns &amp; Best Practices\n</h2><ul><li><strong>Data Lakehouse vs. Warehouse:</strong>  Lakehouses offer the flexibility of data lakes with the performance and governance of data warehouses.</li><li><strong>Batch vs. Micro-Batch vs. Streaming:</strong>  Choose the appropriate processing paradigm based on latency requirements.</li><li>  Parquet and ORC are generally preferred for analytical workloads.</li><li>  Use different storage tiers (hot, warm, cold) to optimize cost.</li><li>  Use Airflow, Dagster, or similar tools to manage complex data pipelines.</li></ul><p>“Hadoop tutorial” principles remain foundational for building scalable, reliable, and cost-effective Big Data infrastructure.  While the specific technologies may evolve, the core concepts of distributed processing, data partitioning, and fault tolerance are essential.  Next steps include benchmarking new configurations, introducing schema enforcement using a schema registry, and migrating to more efficient file formats like Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake to further enhance data management and query performance.  Continuous monitoring, proactive tuning, and a strong focus on data governance are critical for long-term success.</p>","contentLength":9206,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I Found A Lightweight CMS To Replace WordPress","url":"https://dev.to/newsx/i-found-a-lightweight-cms-to-replace-wordpress-5amb","date":1751227790,"author":"Jungu Seo","guid":175396,"unread":true,"content":"<p>After building hundreds of WordPress sites for clients—many of them news platforms—I started looking for a better way. WordPress is powerful, but it's also bloated. A simple install with a few basic plugins can easily chew up 120–150MB of disk space. On top of that, it's a resource hog when it comes to CPU and memory. For high-traffic sites, that means heavier hosting costs. For small projects, it means overkill.</p><p>I run a digital agency, and I wanted a CMS that was lighter, faster, and didn’t force me to wrangle with unnecessary complexity. That search led me to Bludit.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  From WordPress Fatigue to Simpler Alternatives\n</h2><p>Like many developers, I first looked into Grav. I liked that it didn’t need a database and kept things file-based. The backend is clean, and the overall design is decent. But the file structure? Confusing. Too many moving parts. I even paid close to \\$100 for a Fiverr gig to get a few key things working right. That was my red flag—if I can’t comfortably maintain a CMS myself, it’s not the right tool for me or my clients.</p><p>That’s when I found .</p><p>Bludit is also a flat-file CMS—no database required. But the user experience is a major upgrade compared to Grav. It’s simple to install, intuitive to use, and surprisingly feature-rich right out of the box.</p><ul><li>: Everything you need to run a personal blog or news site is already there. SEO, Markdown support, content scheduling, featured images via URL—no need to go plugin hunting.</li><li>: A full Bludit site with core features weighs in at around .

The biggest limitation is its theme selection—it’s nowhere near WordPress in that department. And if your project needs complex features, custom fields, or advanced user roles, WordPress still wins. </p><p>But for personal blogs, simple info sites, or lightweight news platforms, Bludit nails it. It’s clean, fast, and doesn’t waste your time.</p><p>If you're a developer tired of WordPress bloat—or just someone who wants a CMS that stays out of your way—<strong>Bludit is worth a serious look</strong>.

Among its many features, the  keyword stands out for its complexity and the nuanced behaviors it exhibits under different contexts. Understanding  is paramount for advanced JavaScript developers, as its behavior can significantly alter how functions operate, particularly in event-driven and object-oriented programming scenarios. This article aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of JavaScript's  keyword, delving into its historical context, technical intricacies, edge cases, performance considerations, and real-world applications.</p><p>The  keyword in JavaScript has its roots in the language's design philosophy, which was influenced by prototypes and the function-oriented paradigm. In classical object-oriented languages (like Java or C++),  typically refers to the current instance of an object. In JavaScript, however, its value is determined by the call site of a function, leading to a more dynamic and sometimes surprising behavior.</p><p>The ECMAScript (ES) standard has undergone substantial evolution since its inception. Each version, particularly ES5 (2009) and ES6 (2015), introduced features that changed how developers could interact with . The introduction of arrow functions in ES6, for instance, presented a new approach to handling  by lexically binding the context.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Behavior of </h2><p>The value of  is determined primarily by how a function is called. There are four primary ways of invoking a function in JavaScript:</p><ol><li>: When a function is called as a standalone function,  refers to the global object in non-strict mode (or  in strict mode).\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>: When a function is called as a method of an object,  refers to the object itself.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>: When a function is invoked as a constructor (using the  keyword),  points to the newly created instance.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>: JavaScript provides methods like , , and , which can explicitly set the value of .\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Edge Cases and Advanced Scenarios\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  Arrow Functions and Lexical </h4><p>Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, capture the  value of the surrounding lexical context, making them unique compared to traditional functions. They do not have their own  context.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the arrow function used within  captures  from its lexical environment, which is the .</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Confusing Contexts with Event Handlers\n</h4><p>Event handlers present another challenge in understanding .

Using arrow functions can resolve this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance Considerations\n</h3><p>While the profound flexibility of  can seemingly lead to more elegant code, it does come with a performance cost depending on implementation:</p><ul><li>: Using  or  can add overhead compared to regular calls. Using functions that frequently need contextual binding can inadvertently degrade performance.</li><li>: When using arrow functions in callbacks, particularly within closures, be cautious, as they can create closures that hold onto , leading to potential memory leaks.</li></ul><p>JavaScript's nuanced handling of  is widely utilized in frameworks and libraries. For instance, in React, the  context is frequently manipulated using arrow functions to ensure component methods bind correctly to the instance.</p><p>In Node.js,  plays a critical role in middleware composition and callbacks — a system designed for asynchronous operations. Understanding the implications of  is essential for creating performant and maintainable server-side code.</p><p>Frameworks like jQuery have custom handling for  inside methods like , which makes understanding  pivotal for effective jQuery programming.</p><p>Debugging issues related to  can be challenging. Here are advanced techniques:</p><ol><li>: Utilize  statements strategically within your functions to capture the context of  at various execution stages.</li><li>: Implement extensive console logging throughout your function calls to understand the flow and values associated with .</li><li>: Proxies can be used to intercept function calls and provide insights into how  is being interpreted at runtime.</li></ol><p>JavaScript's  keyword encapsulates a rich tapestry of behaviors that can either empower or hinder a developer's capabilities. Mastery of  requires an understanding that transcends syntactic sugar; it involves anticipating the effects of context on function calls, navigating the complexities introduced with features like arrow functions, and employing advanced debugging strategies to mitigate issues.

Rather than allowing direct SSH access to every server in your network, you only expose the jump server. All internal machines stay private and are only accessible through this single point. This limits the potential attack surface and makes it easier to monitor and control access.</p><p>It also improves operational efficiency by letting you manage all systems from one trusted point, while supporting things like key-based authentication and centralized logging.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  SSH ProxyJump: Secure Routing Through a Jump Host\n</h3><p>To connect to internal systems via the jump server, we'll use an SSH feature called , which routes traffic through an intermediate host.</p><p>To keep things clean and secure, we'll generate two SSH keys—one for the jump server and one for the internal VM:</p><div><pre><code>\nssh-keygen  ed25519  ~/.ssh/vm\n\n\nssh-keygen  ed25519  ~/.ssh/bastion\n</code></pre></div><p>Using separate keys makes it easier to manage access and rotate keys if needed.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up the Bastion Host\n</h3><p>Start with a minimal Linux install and harden it by:</p><ul><li>Disabling root login via SSH.</li><li>Disabling password-based logins.</li><li>Creating a non-root user with sudo access.</li><li>Installing your SSH public key into .</li><li>Adding basic security tools like  or .</li></ul><p>Your bastion should sit in a DMZ or a network zone that can reach internal systems but is locked down from the public internet.</p><p>You can quickly connect to an internal system using the  option:</p><div><pre><code>ssh  bastion_user@bastion_ip vm_user@vm_ip\n</code></pre></div><p>But for frequent use, configuring SSH access in  is cleaner.</p><p><strong>File: ~/.ssh/include.d/bastion</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>File: ~/.ssh/include.d/vm</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Main Config: ~/.ssh/config</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, connecting is as easy as:</p><blockquote><p> Organizing SSH configs with  files makes it easier to manage multiple environments—perfect for homelabs or consulting work.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  Security Advantages of This Setup\n</h3><p>Using  with a jump server improves security by:</p><ul><li>Preventing direct access to internal systems.</li><li>Using different keys for different roles.</li><li>Allowing you to monitor and control all access from a single point.</li><li>Making attackers go through multiple secured layers to reach your VMs.</li></ul><p>No system is hack-proof. But this setup raises the bar significantly. An attacker would need to:</p><ul><li>Access a trusted network or VPN.</li><li>Compromise the jump server.</li><li>Possess both SSH keys and know usernames and IPs.</li></ul><p>That’s a lot harder than attacking a single exposed VM.</p><p>In short, a jump server is a smart, simple way to improve your homelab’s security and organization—especially as you scale to multiple servers or VMs.</p><p> I help businesses streamline servers, secure infrastructure, and automate workflows.

They get the job done, but they have a fundamental problem: they were designed for computers, not for humans.</p><p>Ask a designer to make a color \"10% lighter,\" and they intuitively know what you mean. Ask a developer to do the same with HSL, and you might get a washed-out, gray-ish version of your color that looks nothing like you intended. This is because these color models are not .</p><p>Today, this is changing. A new wave of CSS color features is here, giving us access to more vibrant colors and tools that think about color the way humans do. Get ready to meet LCH, Oklab, and the game-changing  function.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: Why HSL Fails Us\n</h3><p>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) was a step in the right direction. It tried to give us human-friendly controls. But its \"Lightness\" channel is deeply flawed.</p><p>Consider these two colors in HSL:</p><ul><li> — A vibrant, pure blue.</li><li> — A bright, almost neon yellow.</li></ul><p>According to HSL, both have the exact same 50% lightness. But to our eyes, the yellow is dramatically brighter than the blue.</p><p>This inconsistency wreaks havoc when you try to create color palettes or gradients. Mixing two colors often results in a muddy, gray \"dead zone\" in the middle, because the path between them travels through a perceptually awkward part of the color space.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: Perceptually Uniform Color Spaces\n</h3><p>Enter  and . These are modern color spaces designed around how humans actually perceive color. They fix the HSL problem by making their Lightness channel perceptually uniform.</p><p>This means that a change of  in the Lightness value will look like the same  of change, regardless of the hue or saturation.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Meet LCH: Lightness, Chroma, Hue\n</h4><p>The  function is structured like this: <code>lch(Lightness Chroma Hue)</code></p><ul><li> A value from  (black) to  (white). This is the star of the show.  will always have a similar perceived brightness to any other  color.</li><li> Represents the \"amount\" of color or colorfulness.  is gray, while  (or higher) is intensely vibrant.</li><li> An angle on the color wheel from  to , similar to HSL.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A huge bonus of LCH is that it can access colors outside of the standard sRGB gamut. With modern displays, you can now show much more vivid colors (from the Display-P3 space) that were previously impossible on the web.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Meet Oklab &amp; Oklch: A Modern Alternative\n</h4><p>Oklab is another, even more modern color space optimized for perceptual uniformity. It's fantastic for creating smooth, vibrant gradients that never go through a muddy phase. For web development, you'll most often use its polar coordinate version, , which works just like LCH.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> For most tasks, they are both excellent. Oklch is often preferred by color experts for its superior performance in gradients and color manipulation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Real Game-Changer: Dynamic Color with </h3><p>Defining colors is one thing, but what about manipulating them? For years, this was the job of Sass functions (, ) or JavaScript. Not anymore.</p><p>The native CSS  function allows you to mix two colors together, right in your stylesheet.</p><p>Its syntax is: <code>color-mix(in &lt;colorspace&gt;, &lt;color1&gt; &lt;percentage&gt;, &lt;color2&gt;);</code></p><p>Let's see it in action. How would we create a hover state that's a 90% tint of our brand color?</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is huge! We can now create entire color systems from a few base tokens, without ever leaving CSS.</p><p>But here's where it all comes together. The color space you choose for  matters. Look what happens when we mix blue and yellow in the old  space versus the new  space.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By mixing in , we get a beautiful, vibrant transition because the browser is mixing the colors in a perceptually uniform way.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Putting It All Together: A Practical Palette\n</h3><p>Imagine you're building a design system. You can define a few base colors in Oklch and use  to generate the rest of your palette.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This system is readable, maintainable, and produces aesthetically pleasing, consistent results.</p><p>Modern CSS color isn't just a new syntax; it's a new way of thinking.</p><ul><li> LCH and Oklab let us work with color in a way that aligns with human vision.</li><li> We can finally break free of the sRGB gamut and use the full power of modern displays.</li><li> eliminates the need for preprocessor or JavaScript functions for basic color manipulation, making our design systems more robust and framework-agnostic.</li></ul><p>Browser support is already excellent in all major browsers. It's time to leave the muddy grays of the past behind and step into a more colorful, vibrant, and intuitive future for web design.

My thoughts here are limited to the full-time employment (FTE) interview process as I’m not personally familiar with freelance and contract work.</p><p>This lengthy process can be exhausting and overwhelming. How and where should you focus your energy? Revising your resume? Focusing on informational interviews? Heads down for hours on LeetCode to practice for coding interviews? Every rejection or ghosting is further discouragement and can send you spinning in circles increasing your stress and uncertainty.</p><p>Everything I say (and everything you read on the internet) should be taken with a healthy dose of salt. For example, while I’ve been deeply involved in the recruiting and hiring process for dozens of roles across multiple companies, I’ve never officially worked as a manager. And the interview process is a bit different for every role and company.</p><p>This is a light-weight data-first iterative approach to job searching that aligns with the natural engineering mindset. </p><p>Tracking your job search in a spreadsheet with notes about how each step of the process went can be helpful and provide better data for this analysis. </p><p>Too many times I've seen someone tell me they were doing a terrible job in interviews but then when we reviewed the data, there was something more specific going on. They were actually doing well in many interviews but having issues in a few specific circumstances. Once we identified a more concrete problem, they were able to fix it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Review your job search data\n</h2><p>Look back over your job search to date and get a sense of how you’re faring comparatively at each stage of the process. What ratio of interviews to applications are you getting?</p><p>What ratio of your applications are cold (you just applied online) vs warm (you have a referral or contact with a recruiter or employee at the company)? Are you getting recruiter screens from warm applications but not cold? You’ll always get fewer from cold, but if cold is zero, that’s something to investigate.</p><p>How often are you advancing from the recruiter screen to the tech screen? Tech screen to onsite?</p><p>Once you have a sense of the first big failure point in the pipeline, that’s a place you’ll want to shift more of your time and energy.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What to do if you’re getting stuck here\n</h2><p>At bigger companies it’s not unusual to get several thousand resumes for an open role. Typically a recruiter, but sometimes also a HM, will briefly review them to decide whether the applicant should advance to a recruiter screen.</p><p>This review is typically a combination of human review in conjunction with AI or other filtering software. Only a small percent of the resumes received will be reviewed by a human, usually those first identified by software as being a particularly strong match.</p><p>If you’re failing to get past this stage, two avenues to invest in are <a href=\"https://climbandpivot.beehiiv.com/p/the-two-biggest-networking-mistakes-when-job-searching?utm_source=climbandpivot.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=how-to-diagnose-where-your-job-search-is-failing&amp;_bhlid=4e3365b9a3176e884b579de38de085a191509231\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">networking</a> and revamping your resume. I’ll dive more deeply into common resume mistakes and how to fix them in other posts. But the most common issue I see are resume bullets that read like a job description instead of quantifying the unique impact you made during your time in that role. A good resume offers summaries of interesting stories that the recruiter and HM will be excited to dive into more deeply.</p><p>Especially for technical roles, recruiters are doing their best to translate from your resume to the job description, but they likely don’t have first-hand technical understanding themselves. As a result, you’ll often need to frame stories and your skills differently for a recruiter than a HM.</p><p>Recruiter screens can vary widely but are often a few “Tell me a time when” behavioral questions or asking about your experience with certain domains/tasks/technologies.</p><p>You should have 3-5 well prepared (but not excessively rehearsed) stories that you can tweak or shape to be responsive for many common questions. Common pitfalls here include forgetting the details of stories or projects mentioned on your resume, getting too in the weeds and losing the recruiter, or not having a polished succinct narrative on how your experience is relevant to the role. Your answers should not meander or drag on.</p><p>Your interviewer is aiming to get as much signal as possible in a limited time. Many folks are too polite to cut people off repeatedly when their answers are circular or unfocused. They just don’t move forward with the candidate.</p><p>Once you’ve covered the basics of the story, you can pause and ask what direction the interviewer would like to go in or what specifically they’re interested in hearing more about. “I could speak more to the impacts of the project or the challenges we encountered if that’s of interest?”</p><p>If you’re failing to pass recruiter screens, your resume is working but how you’re speaking to those stories could be revamped. Maybe you need to be more succinct. Or maybe you need a clearer narrative for how to speak to your interest in the role and how your previous experience makes you a great fit.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Went well but you didn’t get the job\n</h4><p>Every hire decision truly requires an amazing number of things to all go right. So if you keep making it to on-sites, odds are high you’ll find a new role soon.</p><p>If you didn’t get the role but the feedback was positive (for example the classic, you did well but another candidate had more specifically relevant experience), add the folks you interviewed with on LinkedIn. They often won’t give it, but you can always try asking the recruiter for any feedback for how you can improve for the future. If you really hit it off, could thank the hiring manager and ask if they know of any other opportunities you might be a good fit for at that company or if they have connections hiring elsewhere.</p><p>The interview reps are also really helpful to gaining confidence and experience.</p><p>10+ people often have to say yes to a hire, plus exigent factors like the economy and hiring freezes all have to work out. I’m sometimes amazed that anyone gets hired at all as it feels like such an uphill climb even when you’re inside a company actively trying to fill a role.</p><p>You’ll want to assess how to split your time between revising for technical and behavioral interviews depending how each went.</p><p>Is there any interview type you’re struggling with more? For example, algorithms are fine but system design is hard. Focus your prep accordingly. Post on LinkedIn or ask friends for specific, concrete recommendations like their absolute favorite system design prep resource. Mine is: <a href=\"https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grokking the system design interview</a> The more specific your ask, the better advice and suggestions you’ll receive.</p><p>If you’re interviewing for a role where the on-sites require a significant amount of prep such as software engineering technical interviews or management consulting case interviews, you’ll have to parallelize and split your time smartly. But putting all your focus on LeetCode won’t help if you can’t get past the resume review or recruiter screens.</p>","contentLength":7328,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"BlockArt: Bringing GPT-4o Image Generation to Storyblok’s CMS","url":"https://dev.to/youneslaaroussi/blockart-bringing-gpt-4o-image-generation-to-storybloks-cms-5860","date":1751225269,"author":"Younes Laaroussi","guid":175377,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Meet  — an AI-powered image editing plugin that turns Storyblok into your creative playground.</p><p>No more jumping between tools or begging designers for assets.

We should place them inside a parent folder, which you can choose any names for, but I will call it 'login-app'. </p><p>You can use your favorite code editor like Sublime or VS Code. Personally I will stick with VS Code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🖥️ 1. Backend – Express Setup\n</h3><p>Now let's open the terminal. If you are in VS code, a quick way is to press:  (on Windows) or  (on Mac)</p><p>Start by creating a folder for the backend, then open the folder and then initialize node:</p><div><pre><code>backend\nbackend\nnpm init </code></pre></div><p>Install the necessary dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>npm express bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors\n</code></pre></div><p>Since we’ll be using ES modules, make sure your  file includes this line: </p><p>And also inside  file change  to .</p><p>Now create a file called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is our basic express server setup.</p><ul><li>Imported  and  at the top</li><li>Enabled CORS to allow frontend to connect to our server</li><li>Enabled JSON parsing using </li><li>Created a simple test endpoint at </li><li>Started the server on port </li></ul><p>Now let's test it. Start the backend server:</p><p>In your terminal you should see something like:</p><div><pre><code>PS C:serslexandruesktopogin-apperver&gt; node server.js\nServer running on port 5000\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🖥️ 2. Frontend – React Setup with Vite\n</h3><p>Now let’s create the frontend app using Vite.</p><p>First press  or  in the terminal to close the connection. Let's navigate to parent folder using . Then let's run . Name your folder 'frontend', choose React and JavaScript, then navigate to  folder and install the dependencies. Like so:</p><div><pre><code> ..\nnpm create vite@latest\nfrontend\nnpm npm jwt-decode react-router\n</code></pre></div><p>Then start the React server:</p><p>✅ The frontend will be available at <a href=\"http://localhost:5173\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:5173</a> (or something similar) and you should see something like this:</p><div><pre><code>  VITE v6.3.5  ready 1046 ms\n\n  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/\n  ➜  Network: use  to expose\n  ➜  press h + enter to show </code></pre></div><p>Our folder structure at this point should look mostly like this:</p><div><pre><code>my-login-app/\n├── backend/\n│   ├── server.js\n│   └── package.json\n├── frontend/\n│   ├── src/\n│   ├── public/\n│   └── vite.config.js\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, before moving forward, you would want to close the server, again. In your terminal press  or . Why? Our code is broken for now, because we miss essential parts and you will get nasty error popping up in the console. So bear with me, we will get to the end together.</p><p>Let's add some styles for our UI. Add this code to a  file inside your  folder:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can of course design the app to your preferences, but I wanted to make sure we have a little bit of visuals here and to make our life a little easier.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Build The Login/Register Form\n</h2><p>Let's create a folder called  inside  folder. Once we are inside the  folder, let's add the following files: ,  and . We'll take them one by one, but for now let's focus on building our login form.</p><p>In your  file, add the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We created a form component that receives props from its parent  to manage state and actions:</p><p>: Function called when the form is submitted.</p><p> and : Functions to update the username and password states on input change.</p><p> and : State values controlled by the parent component, passed down as props.</p><p>: Text displayed on the submit button (\"Login\" or \"Register\"), so the form can be reused in login and register contexts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Build The Header Component\n</h2><p>Not our main focus here, but easy to implement and will give our app some design to look a little better.</p><p>Add this code in your  file:</p><div><pre><code>\n      // insert the img tag here\n      Login App</code></pre></div><p>Make sure you have an 'images' folder inside  folder and a picture for you to use. Feel free to choose whatever you like.</p><p>Note: I am getting an error when trying to publish the post because I tried to import the image inside the file, that's why that import line and image tag is removed. But on your local machine, add the import to your file and write the img src attribute like this:<code>import logo from 'some-source'</code><code>&lt;img src={logo} alt=\"logo\" /&gt;</code></p><p>It is better to import the images instead of passing a url path to src attribute:</p><ul><li>The images will be optimized, which will help with performance</li><li>It ensures path safety, we avoid incorect relative paths</li><li>Safer for refactoring: renaming the image or changing its location will break the imports, so better error handling</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Set up Authentication Logic / Build Main Component\n</h2><p>Let's move forward with our  file. Add this code to your :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I know this looks heavy and it is because our Main component is doing the hard work for our frontend, but there are a few things that happen here and I will list and explain them.</p><ul><li>Handled form input using </li><li>Toggled between login and signup mode</li><li>Sent form data to the backend using  (via helper functions  and )</li><li>Shared state from context using </li><li>Stored JWT tokens using  from context</li><li>Redirected the user to  route on successful login using </li><li>Renderd a reusable  component and displayed dynamic messages</li><li>Handled errors with </li></ul><p>So when we start our app, what we see is two inputs controlled by state,  and  respectively. And we have two buttons. The top button is the submit button and the bottom one's role is too toggle between submit modes: between logging and registering a user. The toggle mode button will also update the texts properly.</p><p>If you don't have an account you click on the button from below and you change the state:  is now set to false and you are now in register mode. If you now click the submit button, you will call  function. This will check for the mode you are in (for now it's registerMode) and will call the proper helper function (loginUser or registerUser which we'll talk about soon) with two arguments, which are the values from inputs held in  and  state.</p><p>You will receive a response from the server, which it is saved in  or  states and you will see some dynamic text appear on the screen, could be an error message or a success one.</p><p>If you want to login, suppose you already have an account, when you submit, you call , which will call  with username and password, you receive the token from the server, you save it in  via  function and you redirect to  route.</p><p>If it is still too hard for you to understand, just know that it will make more sense when we put all the pieces together and we make a recap. I know I was a little verbose, I felt like I should talk more, but hopefully it makes more sense now.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Create Profile Page, Context and Api Services\n</h2><p>Let's go to  folder and create a  folder, a  folder and a  folder. </p><p>Inside  folder let's create a file called . Inside  folder let's create a file called . And lastly, let's create a  file inside  folder.</p><p>This is the component we redirect users to after they log in. It displays a greeting using the user’s name (decoded from the JWT), and provides a logout button.</p><div><pre><code>Hello, !Logout</code></pre></div><ul><li>We access the user information and logout function using useContext(ProfileContext)</li><li>The user's name was extracted earlier from the JWT and stored in context</li><li>handleLogout() removes the token from localStorage and navigates back to the main page</li><li>We use conditional rendering to show 'Guest' in case something goes wrong and user.user is empty</li><li>This component only becomes meaningful once the token is successfully stored and decoded — so it relies on our authentication flow working correctly</li></ul><p>Let's write one more! Add this to you Context file:</p><div><pre><code>// Import dependencies\nimport { createContext, useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode';\n\n// Create the context object\nexport const ProfileContext = createContext();\n\n// Define the provider component\nexport const ProfileProvider = ({ children }) =&gt; {\n  // Store user info in state\n  const [ user, setUser ] = useState('');\n\n  // Function to log in a user\n  const login = (token) =&gt; {\n    localStorage.setItem('token', token); // Save token to localStorage\n    const decoded = jwtDecode(token); // Decode JWT to get username\n    setUser({ user: decoded.username }); // Store username in context state\n  };\n\n  // Function to log out a user\n  const logout = () =&gt; {\n    localStorage.removeItem('token'); // Clear token from localStorage\n  };\n\n  // On initial load, check if there's a token and decode it\n  // Persistent login across page refresh\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');\n\n    if (token) {\n      const decoded = jwtDecode(token); // Decode token on page refresh\n      setUser({ user: decoded.username }); // Restore user context state\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  // Provide context value to children\n  const value = { user, login, logout };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;ProfileContext.Provider value={ value }&gt;\n      { children }  {/* Render all children inside this provider */}\n    &lt;/ProfileContext.Provider&gt;\n  );\n};\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Created a global context: a context object we can use with React's useContext() hook anywhere in the app. It allows components to access shared data — in this case, the logged-in user's info and the ability to log in or out</li><li>Set up the context provider: the ProfileProvider component wraps our entire app (check App.jsx), and gives access to user, login(), and logout() to any component that consumes the context</li><li>Stored JWT token so that a user logs in, their JWT token is stored in localStorage, which means the login can persist even after a page reload</li></ul><p>We are getting closer to the end of our frontend work. Add this to authService.js file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Sent a POST request to /register with username and password in the body. The server hashes the password and stores the user. If successful, it responds with a success message. If not, an error is returned</li><li>Sent a POST request to /login with the same credentials. The server checks if the user exists and if the password matches. If valid, it sends back a JWT token. We’ll later save this token to localStorage so the frontend knows the user is authenticated</li><li>Placed these API functions in a separate authService.js file to keep our React components clean, to encourage reusability and to make it easier to update API logic in one place</li></ul><p>What else? We structured the app, into folders and files. By doing this we created a more scalable app, easier to debug and easier to read.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Update App.jsx and Main.jsx\n</h2><p>Our app is still broken at this point. We have to make a few changes to  and , which we didn't touch since we created the React application. So let's go first to App.jsx and modify it so it will look like so:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Used , , and  from react-router to enable routing between pages</li><li>Added the Header: this component displays the app’s title and is shown on all pages</li><li>Wrapped the app with ProfileProvider, this gives all components access to the global user context. It lets us share login/logout logic across the app</li><li>Defined Routes: \n - loads the , which holds the login/signup form\n - loads the , which shows the user’s profile page</li></ul><p>Let's continue with main.jsx file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>One more thing to do is to remove these files:  and . These are some styles from React and Vite, which we don't need since we have our own.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Backend Logic - Express Setup\n</h2><p>We are going now to implement the backend logic into our app. This is how  file should look. Let's update it as following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>For user registration, we check for duplicate usernames. We hash the password before storing. We store the user in an in-memory array (only for simplicity)</li><li>For our Login system, we verify user existence and correct password. We generatea a JWT token for authenticated access.</li><li>Protected route  can only be accessed if a valid JWT is sent in the request headers</li><li>Middleware: validates incoming JWT tokens to protect routes, in our case </li></ul><blockquote><p> In a real-world app, we would:</p><ul><li>Store users in a database (not memory)</li><li>Use HTTPS and stronger secrets</li><li>Handle errors more robustly</li><li>Use a different structure for backend logic, like moving routes and middleware to their own files, storing secret keys in a .env file, using a database (like MongoDB) and so on</li></ul></blockquote><p>: Let's start both servers for the frontend and for the backend to test our app!</p><p>Go to VS Code and open two terminals, we will use one for backend and the other one for frontend. You can rename them if you want. Go to one of them and run these commands:</p><p>Now open the other terminal and run these commands:</p><p>Now you should have two terminals with these results: \nFor :</p><div><pre><code>  VITE v7.0.0  ready 217 ms\n\n  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/\n  ➜  Network: use  to expose\n  ➜  press h + enter to show </code></pre></div><div><pre><code>PS C:serslexandruesktopogin-appackend&gt; node server.js\nServer running on port: 5000\n</code></pre></div><p>What this means is that both servers are now working and we could use our app! To open the app go to this link in your browser <a href=\"http://localhost:5173/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:5173/</a> or whatever link vite gave you.</p><p>Now try to create an account and login with the wrong credentials or the good ones. Write on purpose a bad password or a bad username and look at the dynamic status messages. Those comes from the server, check the routes in the server.js.</p><p>Try to write this app by yourself from scratch, no help at first. See how much you can remember. Read the app again and again until you understand the code.</p><p>Just one more small thing, if you care, just change the title of the app in  file to something like 'Login App' or anything, it will look better!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

A common scenario involves ingesting high-velocity, semi-structured data (e.g., clickstream events, application logs) into a Hadoop-based data lake.  Initial ingestion often results in numerous small Parquet files, leading to metadata overhead and drastically reduced query performance in engines like Spark, Presto, and Hive. This post dives deep into Parquet compaction strategies within a Hadoop ecosystem, focusing on architecture, performance tuning, failure modes, and operational best practices. We’ll assume a data lake built on HDFS, with Spark as the primary processing engine and Hive Metastore for metadata management. Data volumes are in the petabyte range, with ingestion rates of several terabytes per day.  Query latency requirements range from seconds for interactive dashboards to minutes for batch reporting. Cost-efficiency is paramount, driving a need to optimize storage and compute resources.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is Parquet Compaction in Big Data Systems?\n</h3><p>Parquet compaction is the process of merging numerous small Parquet files into fewer, larger files.  From a data architecture perspective, it’s a critical post-ingestion optimization step.  Small files exacerbate metadata lookup times in the Hive Metastore and create significant I/O overhead for query engines.  Each file requires a separate open, read, and potentially close operation.  Parquet, a columnar storage format, is inherently efficient for analytical queries, but its benefits are diminished when dealing with a large number of small files.  Compaction leverages the inherent parallelism of Hadoop and Spark to efficiently rewrite data. Protocol-level behavior involves reading data from source files, rewriting it in larger, optimized Parquet files, and then atomically replacing the source files with the compacted versions.  This atomic replacement is crucial for data consistency.</p><ul><li>  Ingesting clickstream data generates a high volume of small files. Compaction ensures fast query performance for analyzing user behavior patterns.</li><li>  Collecting logs from distributed applications results in numerous log files. Compaction enables efficient log analytics and troubleshooting.</li><li><strong>CDC (Change Data Capture) Pipelines:</strong>  CDC processes often write small batches of changes to the data lake. Compaction consolidates these changes into larger, queryable files.</li><li><strong>Machine Learning Feature Stores:</strong>  Feature pipelines generate numerous small files representing individual feature values. Compaction is essential for training and serving ML models efficiently.</li><li>  High-frequency sensor data ingestion creates a constant stream of small files. Compaction maintains query performance for real-time monitoring and analysis.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. System Design &amp; Architecture\n</h3><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Data Source (Kafka, Files)] --&gt; B(Ingestion Layer - Spark Streaming/Batch);\n    B --&gt; C{HDFS - Small Parquet Files};\n    C --&gt; D[Compaction Job - Spark];\n    D --&gt; E{HDFS - Large Parquet Files};\n    E --&gt; F[Query Engine (Spark, Presto, Hive)];\n    F --&gt; G[Dashboard/Reports];\n    subgraph Metadata Management\n        H[Hive Metastore] --&gt; C;\n        H --&gt; E;\n    end\n</code></pre></div><p>This diagram illustrates a typical data lake architecture. Data is ingested into HDFS as small Parquet files. A Spark-based compaction job periodically merges these files. The Hive Metastore maintains metadata about the file locations and schema.  Cloud-native setups often leverage services like AWS EMR with Spark, GCP Dataproc, or Azure Synapse Analytics.  These platforms provide managed Hadoop and Spark environments, simplifying deployment and management.  For example, on EMR, compaction jobs can be scheduled using AWS Glue or Airflow.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Performance Tuning &amp; Resource Management\n</h3><p>Effective compaction requires careful tuning. Key parameters include:</p><ul><li><strong><code>spark.sql.shuffle.partitions</code>:</strong> Controls the degree of parallelism during compaction.  A higher value can improve throughput but increases shuffle overhead.  Start with a value equal to the number of cores in your Spark cluster.</li><li><strong><code>fs.s3a.connection.maximum</code> (for S3):</strong>  Limits the number of concurrent connections to S3.  Increase this value to improve I/O performance when reading from or writing to S3.</li><li><strong> &amp; :</strong>  Allocate sufficient memory to executors and the driver to avoid out-of-memory errors.</li><li>  Aim for Parquet file sizes between 128MB and 1GB. Smaller files still incur metadata overhead, while larger files can lead to increased read latency for specific queries.</li><li>  Balance compaction overhead with query performance.  Daily or hourly compaction is often a good starting point.</li><li>  Proper partitioning of data based on query patterns is crucial.  Compaction should respect existing partitioning schemes.</li></ul><p>Example Spark configuration (Scala):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. Failure Modes &amp; Debugging\n</h3><ul><li>  Uneven data distribution can lead to some executors taking significantly longer to complete, causing job delays.  Monitor executor runtimes in the Spark UI.  Consider salting skewed keys to distribute the load more evenly.</li><li>  Insufficient executor memory can cause OOM errors.  Increase  or reduce the amount of data processed per executor.</li><li>  Transient network issues or resource contention can cause job retries.  Configure appropriate retry policies in your workflow orchestration tool (e.g., Airflow).</li><li>  Errors in the Spark application code can lead to DAG crashes.  Examine the Spark UI for detailed error messages and stack traces.</li><li>  Rarely, the Hive Metastore can become corrupted.  Regular backups and validation are essential.</li></ul><p>Monitoring metrics: HDFS file counts, Parquet file sizes, Spark job completion times, executor memory usage, and Hive Metastore query latency.  Datadog or Prometheus can be used for alerting.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Data Governance &amp; Schema Management\n</h3><p>Compaction should respect schema evolution.  Using schema registries like Apache Avro or Confluent Schema Registry ensures backward and forward compatibility.  The Hive Metastore should be updated with the latest schema information after compaction.  Data quality checks should be integrated into the compaction pipeline to identify and handle invalid data.  Tools like Great Expectations can be used for data validation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  8. Security and Access Control\n</h3><p>Access to HDFS and the Hive Metastore should be controlled using appropriate security mechanisms.  Apache Ranger or AWS Lake Formation can be used to enforce fine-grained access control policies.  Data encryption at rest and in transit is essential.  Audit logging should be enabled to track data access and modifications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  9. Testing &amp; CI/CD Integration\n</h3><p>Compaction pipelines should be thoroughly tested.  Unit tests can validate the compaction logic.  Integration tests can verify end-to-end functionality.  Automated regression tests should be run after any code changes.  Pipeline linting tools can identify potential issues.  Staging environments should be used to test changes before deploying to production.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  10. Common Pitfalls &amp; Operational Misconceptions\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Compacting Too Frequently:</strong>  Excessive compaction consumes unnecessary resources.</li><li>  Compaction without respecting partitioning can lead to performance degradation.</li><li><strong>Insufficient Resource Allocation:</strong>  Under-provisioned Spark clusters can cause compaction jobs to run slowly or fail.</li><li><strong>Not Monitoring File Sizes:</strong>  Failing to monitor file sizes can result in suboptimal compaction strategies.</li><li><strong>Assuming Atomic Replacement is Guaranteed:</strong> While HDFS provides atomic rename, ensure your compaction logic handles potential partial writes gracefully.</li></ul><p>Example log snippet (Spark executor OOM):</p><div><pre><code>23/10/27 10:00:00 ERROR Executor: Executor failed due to exception java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  11. Enterprise Patterns &amp; Best Practices\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Data Lakehouse Architecture:</strong>  Consider adopting a data lakehouse architecture with a transactional storage layer (e.g., Delta Lake, Iceberg) to simplify compaction and improve data reliability.</li><li><strong>Batch vs. Streaming Compaction:</strong>  For high-velocity data, consider micro-batch or streaming compaction using frameworks like Flink.</li><li>  Parquet is generally a good choice for analytical workloads, but ORC can offer better compression ratios in some cases.</li><li>  Move infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., S3 Glacier) to reduce costs.</li><li>  Use a workflow orchestration tool like Airflow or Dagster to schedule and manage compaction jobs.</li></ul><p>Parquet compaction is a fundamental optimization technique for Hadoop-based data lakes.  By carefully tuning compaction strategies, monitoring performance, and addressing potential failure modes, organizations can ensure fast query performance, efficient storage utilization, and reliable data analytics.  Next steps include benchmarking different compaction configurations, introducing schema enforcement using a schema registry, and evaluating the benefits of migrating to a data lakehouse architecture with a transactional storage layer.  Continuous monitoring and optimization are essential for maintaining a healthy and performant data lake.</p>","contentLength":9212,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Text Based Games and How to Make Them","url":"https://dev.to/jberesford94/text-based-games-and-how-to-make-them-4igj","date":1751218749,"author":"Jack Beresford","guid":175338,"unread":true,"content":"<p>After frustration at modern TV and film, I have returned to the ever reliable written word, by which I mean crude text-based games in Python.</p><p>At its core the text based game is just conditional logic.\nIf this, then print this, otherwise, print something else.</p><div><pre><code>choice1 = input(\"What's your name?\")\n\n\nif choice1 == 'Eggbert':\n    print (\"Hello!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid name\")\n</code></pre></div><p>All fun and games. But in a text based game we want 1 of 2 or more specific options. For example:</p><div><pre><code>choice1 = input(\"Are you better at ENGLISH or FRENCH?\")\n\n\nif choice1 == 'ENGLISH':\n    print (\"Hello!\")\nelif choice1 == 'FRENCH':\n    print(\"Bonjour!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid entry\")\n</code></pre></div><p>This is fine enough but two weaknesses we can see are: \n Case sensitivity. Writing ‘french’ or ‘French’ seems an equally valid entry, but it would be rejected as it is not == (equal to) ‘FRENCH’<p>\nThe else: statement doesn’t actually stop us, which is to say, we can get _past _choice1 by writing anything. In the case of text based games, there are right and wrong answers, so why let the player get past a stage by writing nonsense?</p></p><p>To solve this, we do the following:</p><div><pre><code>choice1 = input(\"Are you better at ENGLISH or FRENCH?\").upper()\n\n\nwhile choice1 != 'ENGLISH' and choice1 != 'FRENCH':\n    choice1 = input('Invalid entry. Are you better at ENGLISH or FRENCH?:   ')\n\n\nif choice1 == 'ENGLISH':\n    print (\"Hello!\")\n\nelif choice1 == 'FRENCH':\n    print(\"Bonjour!\")\n\n</code></pre></div><p>The upper() function converts the user input into all caps (even if the user writes in all caps). Doing this at the end of the input() function means all subsequent conditionals will work, no need to put upper on anything else.</p><p>Using a while loop with negative conditions keeps the user stuck until they have written 1 of these choices. What prevents this while loop from running indefinitely is that they have the chance to redefine the input. </p><p>It is with this logic that we make a common starting feature of games: a player choosing their name.</p><div><pre><code>player_name = input(\"What is your name?:    \")\nprint(f\"Hello, {player_name}\")\n</code></pre></div><p>Use of an f string i.e. f” allows the variable player_name to be invoked in a string, in this case a greeting. But let me show you a flaw of this simple approach:</p><p><code>What is your name?:    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1111111111111111111111111111111111111111\nHello, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1111111111111111111111111111111111111111</code></p><p>Not much good this; if your cat walked across your keyboard and pressed Enter, the name would be stuck like this and printed in all subsequent f strings. </p><p>We should therefore insert some rules. I’ve decided 1) the name should not be more than 12 characters,  and 2) made up of only letters (no numbers, punctuation or spaces).</p><div><pre><code>player_name = input(\"What is your name?:    \")\nwhile not player_name.isalpha() or len(player_name) &gt; 12:\nplayer_name = input(\"Invalid entry. Must be &lt;12 characters and only letters A-Z.\\nTry again:  \")\n</code></pre></div><p>I use a while not loop because it works well with isalpha(), a method of checking if a string is all letters (e.g. A-Z) or not. \nlen() &gt; 12  is True when the string is more than 12 characters<p>\nPutting them together in an or loop, checks if 1, or both of these conditions is true.</p>\nWe’ll test it now:</p><p><code>What is your name?:    john1\nInvalid entry. Must be &lt;12 characters and only letters A-Z.<p>\nTry again:  johnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn</p>\nInvalid entry. Must be &lt;12 characters and only letters A-Z.<p>\nTry again:  john11111111111111111111111111111111111</p>\nInvalid entry. Must be &lt;12 characters and only letters A-Z.\nHello, john</code></p><p>You’ll note that the logic governing this is similar to the logic governing what constitutes a ‘strong’ password, valid email addresses and so on. </p><p>You could probably make a decent text based game with just these features, but one thing I’ve learnt is that writing lines of text is the easy thing. Adding functionality, that’s the hard part. </p><p>*Note - this is the first time I use the \\n new line character. It is very helpful for f strings, inputs and so on, ensuring you can keep lines printed out in a user-friendly way. Basically, write \\n, and everything after will appear on a new line.</p><p>My final game (link below) uses 2 extra features: \n1) writing out the script via the sys.stdout.writeout() method, the speed of which can be user-defined, and 2) Dungeons and Dragons style combat using the random.randint() method. </p><p>The combat is quite simple. Anyone who’s made a dice roll will have used it.</p><div><pre><code>import random\ndice_roll = random.randint(1,6)\nprint(f\"You rolled a {dice_roll}!\")\n</code></pre></div><p>Import the random module. Random.randint(1,6) means, give me a random number between 1 and 6. Then print it. \nThis can also be done without the variable assignment (printed straight away), and it makes for a big difference. I’ll show you with a more combat based example.</p><div><pre><code>import random\n\nplayer_attack = random.randint(1,6)\nenemy_health = 2\nenemy_name = \"Jeff\"\n\nprint(f\"{enemy_name} is on {enemy_health}health. Time to attack!\")\nprint(f\"You hit {enemy_name} for {player_attack} damage.\")\n</code></pre></div><p>Looks fine right? Well, a problem is that the random.randint() will not run again and again and again, when we loop through a fight sequence. It will run one time, i.e. to assign the variable player_attack with the value of a random integer between 1 and 6. This means if you wanted a combat sequence, you could be hitting the same amount of damage every time you attack. This is not the point at all. </p><p>That being said, smart code is lazy code, and you don’t want to write random.randint(1,6) every time. You may even want to modify the attack range if your player finds a brand new fancy weapon or something. This is where I came up with a ‘max damage’ for characters.</p><div><pre><code>player_max_damage = 6\nprint(\n    f\"You hit {enemy_name} for {random.randint(1, player_max_damage)} damage.\")\n\n</code></pre></div><p>The key difference is that the random number is generated within each attack (between 1 and the max damage), not before and throughout.</p><p>The next concern should be how to win or lose a battle? How do we make sure it continues until one or both of us is dead?</p><p>Well first, we need to reassign values to health, such as:\nenemy_health -= 2<p>\nThis will subtract 2 from the current enemy health and then reassign that value to the variable.</p></p><p>Then, we need to end the fight if the enemy’s or our health reaches 0 or less.</p><p>Here’s how I achieved this:</p><div><pre><code>while True:\n    print('--⚔--⚔--⚔--⚔--ATTACK--⚔--⚔--⚔--⚔--')\n    input(f\"You have {player_health} health. {mob_name} has {mob_healths[mob_name]} health\")\n    player_attack = random.randint(1, player_damage)\n    mob_healths[mob_name] -= player_attack\n    if mob_healths[mob_name] &gt; 0:\n        print(f\"You hit the {mob_name} for {player_attack} damage.\")\n        print(f\"{mob_name} is now on {mob_healths[mob_name]} health.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"You hit the {mob_name} for {player_attack} damage and defeat it!\\n\")\n        break\n</code></pre></div><p>Putting this in a while loop ensures the conditions are checked, and that the only way we can leave is DEATH…</p><p>Jokes aside, most of these values are predefined, will show these later - they are easy to change.</p><p>In short, we have an if statement for if the enemy has more than 0 health, and an else if they don’t (we defeated it!)</p><p>Now within that same loop, we can put our defense (the enemy should get a turn to attack as well).</p><div><pre><code>    print('--🛡--🛡--🛡--🛡--DEFEND--🛡--🛡--🛡--🛡--')\n    input(f\"You have {player_health} health. {mob_name} has {mob_healths[mob_name]} health\")\n    mob_attack = random.randint(1, mob_max_damages[mob_name])\n    player_health -= mob_attack\n    if player_health &gt; 0:\n        print(f\"The {mob_name} hits you for {mob_attack} damage.\")\n        print(f\"You are now on {player_health} health.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The {mob_name} hits you for {mob_attack} damage.\")\n        print(\"💀 You died! GAME OVER 💀\\n\")\n        break\n</code></pre></div><p>I wrap this all together, within a combat() function, needing only the variables:(mob_name, player_health). Player_health is not so much a concern, when we run future combat() functions we can just put the {player_health} curly braced inside. I wanted the option to ‘level up’ the character at some point and therefore increase += their health.</p><p>Anyway, what I think makes this combat function powerful is that the mob_name will reference an indexed position in 1 list and 2 dictionaries i.e. [0] or [2] in mob_name, mob_healths, and mob_damages:</p><div><pre><code>    mob_names = [\"Bug 🐛\", \"Wolf 🐺\", \"Goblin 👺\"]\n\n\n    mob_healths = {\n        mob_names[0]: 6,\n        mob_names[1]: 8,\n        mob_names[2]: 10\n    }\n\n\n    mob_max_damages = {  # a random.randint() will run between 1 and these numbers\n        mob_names[0]: 3,\n        mob_names[1]: 5,\n        mob_names[2]: 6\n    }\n</code></pre></div><p>These run independent of the combat() function, and if you want to change the theme of the game then all you have to do is change the name. Nothing else needs to change, everything will print out and run for you. Of course you can change the healths and damages but be sure to consider balance in your game.</p><p>Now for the text speed, which relates to parts of the sys and time module.\nI did this all in one place at the top, along with the random module:</p><div><pre><code>import time  # for time.sleep() printing text\nimport sys  # for text speed (optional)\nimport random  # for 'rolling' a dice etc.\n</code></pre></div><p>Write an introduction, or scene description. Give it a name and try and keep it all in one string. This can be done by avoiding a long line as so:</p><div><pre><code>    intro = (f\"Welcome to {game_name}, a text-based adventure game.\\n\"\n             f\"{game_name} is set in {world}, in {time_or_setting}.\\n\"\n             \"Scenes will be read out for you, like this.\\n\"\n             \"Choices will be printed out in full and require you to type an answer.\\n\"\n             \"They will follow a ':' semicolon. You can only do 1 thing at a time. \\n\"\n             \"Let's begin with the first choice, your name.\\n\"\n             )\n</code></pre></div><p>Using \\n line breaks and keeping the quotation marks at the same indentation as the previous, ‘intro’ can be several lines long while still belonging to the same variable. That is all we need to have it written out:</p><div><pre><code>for char in intro:\n        sys.stdout.write(char)\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n        time.sleep(text_speed)`\n</code></pre></div><p>This works for with a for loop. We say that for every char in intro (for every character in intro)</p><p>Note that instead of char we could write anything, like ‘letter’, ‘thing’ and so on, as long as we correctly refer to it again in the sys.stdout.write() function. Anyway, char makes sense, and readability is important.</p><p>sys.stdout.write() is very similar to print(), only different insofar as it prints every character, and doesn’t add spaces. It’s basically a precise printing tool.</p><p>sys.stdout.flush() is very important here; it ensures that rerunning this loop still keeps the characters on the same line. Without it, the for loop would make each character print underneath itself. </p><p>time.sleep() is what we use as the time gap between each character being printed. I reference text_speed, which I put at the top of my program, allowing the user to define speed as they like (they may read faster or slower than me).</p><p>Wrapping up - I put the bulk of my game inside a main() function and indented the lot. This is a good idea because putting underneath the lot:</p><div><pre><code>if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n</code></pre></div><p>Will ensure that the program can only be run from the program directly; it’s best practice. I also like to hide the script this way and look at more ‘master’ items, such as:</p><div><pre><code>import time  # for time.sleep() printing text\nimport sys  # for text speed (optional)\nimport random  # for 'rolling' a dice etc.\n\n\n# User-defined items\ngame_name = \"The Project\"  # *changeable - will be reflected everywhere else\ntitle = (f\"-💾-⌨-💻---{game_name}---💻-⌨-💾-\")  # modify emojis as you wish\nworld = \"Procrastinationland\"  \n# be conscious of grammar when printed\ntime_or_setting = \"2025\"\n# get a feel for how fast you like the text speed when you run the code\ntext_speed = 0.05\n</code></pre></div><p>Voila. With those building blocks, more scenes, enemies, stories etc. can be fleshed out to make it more of a story.\nAdditional improvements I would make would be: <p>\n1) ‘dice rolls’ outside of combat to determine the possibility of doing things. I have made this before and it’s pretty easy - ‘if &lt; 10, fail. If &gt;10, pass. If == 1, spectacularly fail, etc. </p>\n2) consequences for decisions by storing a boolean that can be referred to later. For example, if you did choose to help the hungry villagers, then help_village = True. In your character’s return weeks later , the villagers could either be gone, or alive and willing to repay you, simply based on that boolean. <p>\n3) animations. While this technically contradicts the text based nature of the game, I am already using text read out, and a similar principle could do something like showing the character and an enemy get closer until they meet at crossed swords.

And on the other days I slept 5, 6, 7, or at least once even 8 hours. In reality though, I still have tonight — and no one canceled that. Time is a myth, just like thoughts, the future, the past, or even the present. If you look deeper into time, you’ll realize we don’t have it — and at the same time, we do. I believe there’s no point wasting something we kind of don’t even have, on things that are completely meaningless. Although, everyone does as they please, but I’ve chosen my own path. Below is the text I wrote, I think, on Thursday.</p><p><strong>This is how I learn Chinese.</strong> (The mnemonic method is weird, but it’s from the book . I’ve already memorized over 400 words in 3 months and one week. I also write down abbreviations for these words with later pronunciation of them, in addition to the more obvious reasons to remember these words for real-life situations → a method I got from YouTube. For once that platform was actually useful, and not just triggering FOMO.) I’ve been living in China for 3 months now, so I occasionally have conversations with native speakers, plus minimal practice with them. 400 words is very little… even a child knows way more. 1,000 words is the first minimum to understand most basic topics, and I still have a lot to learn. Also, sentence construction is often not obvious, which means I’ll need to memorize lots of phrases, particles, forms, structures, etc. Oh, almost forgot. I’m from Russia, so it’s much easier for me to come up with homonyms and associations in Russian… I’m baring my soul with this post, because many of the things below came to me by chance and initially in the form of a weird “mini-story.” I should also mention that even tones are included in my mnemonics, because if you pronounce even a single vowel at the wrong pitch, you probably won’t be understood…</p><p><strong>The words themselves (absurd, but it works):</strong></p><ol><li>bǎi - hundred, numerous\n(Можно сказать бай огромному количеству знакомых, наверное сотне)\n*Например, это стоило 100 юаней</li><li>bào zhǐ (бАо джи) - newspaper, newsprint\n(Да он избалованный джином словно, вот так пишет эти газеты)</li><li>guò - to pass (time), to celebrate\n(Гула то сколько было, но время прошло, вы же отмечали?)</li></ol><p>Next, I have 2 tests awaiting me from both sides (Chinese – English), which I might pass immediately, but usually I need to revise certain unlearned words first and only then pass everything. That’s how I test myself.</p><p>And I still have 3 projects, and possibly tennis coaching (the last one is not certain yet). One of them is a joint project, the other 2 are my personal ones. I don’t know how I manage everything, but I’m extremely motivated, because nothing else in this life or the entire world interests me.</p><p>And here are my 5 behind-the-scenes topics on computer theory (all links are in Russian, for an obvious reason… Previously, I tried learning completely new topics without knowing the basics and in a foreign language, especially English — it was pointless and difficult):</p><h3><strong>Boolean Algebra (Logic Algebra)</strong></h3><h3><strong>Logical Addition (Disjunction)</strong></h3><h3><strong>Logical Multiplication (Conjunction)</strong></h3><h3><strong>Logical Negation (Inversion)</strong></h3><ol><li>What is electric current?</li><li>What’s the difference between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC)?</li><li>What are a resistor, capacitor, and inductor?</li><li>How do a diode and a transistor work?</li><li>What is Ohm’s law?

This is the essence of microservice architecture:</p><ul><li>One service = One responsibility</li><li>Each service = Independently deployable</li><li>Services talk to each other = System communication</li></ul><p>For example, in an e-commerce platform:</p><div><pre><code>| Service            | Responsibility                  |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| OrderService       | Accepts and creates new orders  |\n| SMSService         | Sends SMS notifications         |\n| EmailService       | Sends order confirmation emails |\n| InventoryService   | Updates product stock           |\n\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Can be deployed separately</li></ul><p>But breaking a monolith into microservices is only the first step.</p><p>What follows is much harder:</p><blockquote><p>“How do these small, independent services talk to each other reliably, at scale, and without bringing the system down?”</p></blockquote><p>To understand this, let’s walk through a simple, relatable example:</p><blockquote><p>A user places an order in an e-commerce application.</p></blockquote><p>This one event will help us explore the evolution of communication patterns. When a user places an order, we want to:</p><ul><li>Send an order confirmation SMS</li><li>Send an order confirmation Email</li></ul><p>So, how can we make this happen?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🛜 The Naive Approach - HTTP Call\n</h2><p>The first solution that comes to our mind is making a HTTP call from one service to another.</p><ul><li>SMS or Email service is down?</li></ul><p>This is a synchronous way as our Order service is blocked or fails too. That’s too fragile. We can use a simple Message Queue for handling this.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📦 What is a Message Queue?\n</h2><p>A message queue follows simple FIFO (First-In, First-Out) logic. It decouples events from consumers — meaning:</p><ul><li>The producer service doesn’t care when or how the message is processed.</li><li>The consumer service pulls messages independently, processes them, and acknowledges success.</li></ul><p>This model allows both services to scale, fail, and recover independently.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ✅ The Asynchronous Solution – Message Queue\n</h2><p>Message queues provide at-least-once delivery. That means a message might be processed more than once if retries happen. It’s the consumer's job to make message handling idempotent — i.e., safely repeatable. So, we introduce a Message Queue between our services:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foah4bx2pz8rui9m8wl4x.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foah4bx2pz8rui9m8wl4x.png\" alt=\"Message Queues\" width=\"645\" height=\"330\"></a></p><ul><li>Order service drops the message to queues and moves on.</li><li>The queue stores it until their respective service processes it.</li><li>If it fails, the message is pushed back to the queue for retry.</li></ul><p>If we continue using a message queue, only one service will receive the message. Others will miss it.</p><p>We could try adding multiple separate queues, but that means the producer (OrderService) now needs to know all the consumers — tightly coupling everything again.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ✅ The Solution - Pub/Sub Architecture\n</h2><p>In Pub/Sub systems like Kafka, you can group consumers by concern — and each consumer group gets its own copy of the message. But delivery guarantees depend heavily on the implementation. So, we switch to a Pub/Sub system:</p><ul><li>OrderService just publishes an event.</li><li>All interested services subscribe to it.</li><li>Everyone receives the same message, independently.</li></ul><ul><li>Message loss possible if a service is offline during event publication.</li><li>No per-service retries as the event can't be republished for retry.</li><li>Consumers may race each other if not isolated.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Solution - Fan-Out Architecture\n</h2><p>Fan-Out is a hybrid of Pub/Sub + Queues.</p><p>Instead of one message going to many services directly, we create a queue per subscriber, resulting in a fallback for retrying failed events.</p><ul><li>Gets its own durable message queue.</li><li>Can retry failures independently.</li><li>Is fully isolated from the others.</li></ul><ul><li>Message Queues are great for decoupling a task from its processor, but not ideal where multiple services are involved.</li><li>Pub/Sub lets you notify multiple systems from a single event, but do not provide a fallback.</li><li>Fan-Out adds durability, reliability and a fallback point to the pub/sub pattern.</li></ul><p>A single event — like an order being placed — may seem small. But behind the scenes, it may trigger multiple workflows, handled by independent services, and needing different levels of reliability.

But have you ever considered the consequences of privacy data leaks? From spam calls to identity theft, the risks are significant. Fortunately, HarmonyOS has implemented comprehensive privacy protection measures.  </p><p>Imagine strangers accessing your health data, chat logs, or payment passwords—terrifying, isn't it? Privacy breaches not only violate personal rights but also pose financial risks. Moreover, privacy protection is a legal requirement and a corporate responsibility. HarmonyOS prioritizes privacy at every level, from the system core to application development.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  二、Six Golden Principles of HarmonyOS Privacy Protection\n</h3><p>HarmonyOS provides developers with strict privacy protection guidelines, acting as a \"security manual\" to ensure every application safeguards user privacy:  </p><ol><li><p><strong>Transparency &amp; Disclosure</strong><p>\nApplications must explicitly inform users about collected data and its purposes, avoiding hidden practices.  </p></p></li><li><p><p>\nCollect only necessary data. For example, a weather app only needs your city, not precise location.  </p></p></li><li><p><p>\nAll data processing requires user authorization, with the right to revoke consent at any time.  </p></p></li><li><p><p>\nData is encrypted throughout storage and transmission, protected by advanced encryption.  </p></p></li><li><p><strong>Local Processing Priority</strong><p>\nProcess data locally whenever possible. Cloud uploads must adhere to the \"minimum necessary\" principle.  </p></p></li><li><p><strong>Special Protection for Minors</strong><p>\nApplications targeting minors must comply with relevant laws, requiring parental consent for data collection.  </p></p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  三、Developer's \"Privacy Protection Toolkit\"\n</h3><p>To implement these principles, HarmonyOS offers developers practical security tools:  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1. Privacy Statement Dialog: Empowering User Awareness\n</h4><p>When launching an app, the privacy statement dialog (though seemingly verbose) serves to inform users: \"We collect this data for these purposes—proceed only with your consent.\" This transparency allows users to make informed decisions and retain control.  </p><p><strong>Key Developer Considerations:</strong><p>\n(1) Clearly specify collected data.</p><p>\n(3) Obtain explicit user consent.  </p></p><p><p>\nImplementing a privacy statement dialog in the \"HMOS World\" app (</p>):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  2. Fuzzy Location: Protecting Your Movements\n</h4><p>Many are unaware that location services offer both \"precise\" and \"fuzzy\" options. For apps that don’t require exact coordinates (e.g., music players), HarmonyOS recommends fuzzy location, which reveals only city/region-level information. This balances functionality with privacy.  </p><p><strong>Location Permission Application对照表:</strong><p>\n| Target API Level | Permission Requested         | Result         | Location Precision         |</p><p>\n|------------------|------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|</p>   | Success        | Precise (meter-level)      |   | Failure        | No access                  |<code>ohos.permission.APPROXIMATELY_LOCATION</code> | Success | Fuzzy (5km precision) |<p>\n| ≥9               | Both permissions             | Success        | Precise (meter-level)      |  </p></p><p>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Dynamically request permissions and retrieve location:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. Picker Selector: Avoiding \"Data Sweeps\"\n</h4><p>Previously, storage permissions gave apps unrestricted access to all files. With the Picker selector, users can now grant access to specific files or photos, similar to selecting items in a supermarket. For example, when sharing a photo on social media, the app only accesses the selected image, leaving other data untouched.  </p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  4. Dynamic Permission Requests: Authorizing Only What’s Needed\n</h4><p>When requesting sensitive permissions (e.g., camera, contacts), apps must explicitly state their purpose: \"Camera access is required for QR code scanning.\" Developers should only request essential permissions, preventing overreach.  </p><p><p>\nDeclare camera permission in </p>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Define permission rationale in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Dynamically request permission in code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Summary: Three Key Points of Privacy Protection\n</h3><ol><li>: Users understand data usage.\n</li><li>: Collect only essential data.\n</li><li>: Secure data from storage to transmission.</li></ol>","contentLength":4402,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"【HarmonyOS 5】Detailed Explanation of Laya Game Building and Publishing for HarmonyOS","url":"https://dev.to/georgegcs/harmonyos-5-detailed-explanation-of-laya-game-building-and-publishing-for-harmonyos-31fk","date":1751215280,"author":"GeorgeGcs","guid":175304,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  【HarmonyOS 5】Detailed Explanation of Laya Game Building and Publishing for HarmonyOS\n</h2><p>##HarmonyOS Development Capabilities ##HarmonyOS SDK Application Services ##HarmonyOS Financial Applications (Financial Management #  </p><p>LayaAir engine is one of the most powerful cross-platform engines in China.

Locked funds don’t unlock instantly - it takes a little time, typically 4 epochs (20 hours).</p></li></ul><p>A smart contract is a WebAssembly (WASM) program that can be deployed to an account. When you first create an account, it doesn’t have a contract by default. What makes NEAR flexible is that you can deploy, update, and even remove contracts from an account later. This means you can fully upgrade the code over time, something that’s not always possible on other blockchains. Once deployed, your contract can be called by anyone, and it has access to the account’s storage.</p><p>Every NEAR account has its own persistent storage, built as a key-value store. It can only be read and modified by the contract deployed on that same account, other contracts can’t directly access your storage, neither for read nor for write.</p><p>The data stored on your account is publicly visible. Anyone can read it through RPC calls — just something to keep in mind.</p><p>Storage on Near isn’t free. There’s a storage staking rule - you must hold 1  per 100 KB of storage used. This covers the account itself, contract code, stored data, and access keys.</p><p>The cool thing is, when you delete data from your storage, the  tokens tied to that storage are automatically released back to your available balance. So you’re not permanently spending tokens, you’re simply locking them as long as you use the storage.</p><p>This is one of Near's most unique features. Unlike many blockchains where each account is tied to a single key, Near accounts can have multiple keys at the same time, each with its own permissions.</p><p>There are two types of access keys:</p><ul><li><p>: Gives complete control over the account.</p></li><li><p>: Can only be used to call specific contract methods, usually with limited permissions. This key can only call non-payable methods—methods that don’t require a deposit. If you try to use it for a payable method, the transaction will simply fail.</p></li></ul><p>Accounts can have as many keys as you like, you can add/remove them anytime. You can even remove all keys from an account, which effectively locks it. Once locked, the account can’t perform any actions anymore, unless the smart contract deployed on it was specifically designed to handle interactions without relying on access keys (you’ll see an example of this later in the article when we talk about the Wallet Contract).</p><p>On Near, not all accounts are the same — there are a few distinct types, each with its own purpose and behavior. But before we dive into the details, let’s quickly look at the general rules that apply to all accounts.</p><p>Every account, no matter the type, follows a simple set of naming rules:</p><ul><li>: Account names must be at least 2 characters long and can go up to 64 characters.</li><li>: You can use lowercase letters (), digits (), and separators, including dots (), dashes () and underscores ().</li><li><ul><li>An account name can’t start or end with a separator - no  or .</li><li>Separators can’t follow each other - no , , , or mixed combinations like  or .</li></ul></li></ul><p>, , or  are valid account names.</p><p>As the name suggests, named accounts come with a human-readable name, which makes life on Near a lot easier, especially when it comes to branding and user experience. You don’t have to memorize long, random strings of characters anymore.</p><p>Creating a named account is simple, but not entirely free. You need to send a transaction to register the account on the blockchain. If you choose, you can also send some  tokens along with the transaction to pre-fund the account. Like any transaction on Near, you need to cover the network fee. The good news is, fees on Near are low, especially compared to other blockchains. In fact, some wallets or applications might even cover this fee for you using a relayer (a service that pays the transaction fee on your behalf). That said, not every wallet offers this, so in many cases, you’ll still need to pay this small fee yourself.</p><p>You’ve probably noticed examples like  and might be wondering - can anyone create that account? Actually, no. Near uses a hierarchical account structure and accounts are separated by dots to indicate their level. For example, only  can create , and if you try to create  directly, your transaction will simply fail. The account  must send the transaction to itself to create . No one else can do it.</p><p>Here's an important nuance - once a sub-account is created, it's fully independent. It has its own access keys, assets, etc. It doesn't belong to the parent account in any operational sense. The only thing the parent controls is the ability to create the sub-account in the first place. After that, the two accounts are completely separate.</p><blockquote><p>If only  can create , who created ?</p></blockquote><p>If you said , that’s exactly right. This brings us to the next section. </p><p>The  part isn’t just a label, it’s actually an account itself. In fact, it’s a special type of account called a top-level Account.</p><p>Top-level accounts on Near are, in many ways, just like the named accounts we’ve already discussed. The key difference is that you can’t create a top-level account yourself.</p><p>These accounts are predefined at the protocol level. They usually don’t have any Full Access keys attached, which means they can’t be deleted, and they technically belong to no one. They simply exist.</p><p>What makes top-level accounts so useful is that they can also have a smart contract deployed on them, and in most cases, they do. For example, the  account has a contract deployed on it that exposes the  method. Anyone can call it to create sub-accounts under the top-level account, which are the regular named accounts like . It’s as simple as that.</p><blockquote><p>You can check out the smart contract source code right <a href=\"https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Though, this contract does more than just create accounts, it’s actually a broader tool with additional functionality called Linkdrop. But we won’t dive into those details in this article.</p></blockquote><p>It’s also worth noting that  isn’t the only top-level account. For example, the  top-level account was introduced at the beginning of 2024 to support the HERE Wallet on Telegram. They needed a dedicated top-level account because their use case required a custom smart contract deployed specifically to handle batch account creation and other custom features.</p><p>I don’t know the exact requirements for getting a custom top-level account, but I guess that if your use case ever grows to the point where supporting millions of users would truly benefit from having a dedicated top-level account, there’s a chance you could request one.</p><p>Implicit accounts on Near work a little differently from the named accounts we’ve talked about so far. You won’t find a human-readable name here. Instead, the account ID is simply the hexadecimal representation of a public key.</p><p>The public key generated from Ed25519 is exactly 32 bytes long, and when you convert it to a hexadecimal string, you get a 64-character account ID. </p><p>You don’t need to send any transaction or pay any deposit to create an implicit account. You can generate it completely off-chain by simply creating a key pair and calculating the hex representation of the public key. That’s it. You can start using the address right away.</p><p>When you first generate an implicit account, Near Protocol knows nothing about it yet. It officially comes into existence the moment someone sends . At that moment, the blockchain registers the account with the exact public key you originally generated. This makes implicit accounts perfect for lightweight onboarding. You can start using the blockchain right away — no need to sign any transactions, no need to pay upfront fees. You simply generate a key pair and you’re good to go. If possible, you’re recommended to upgrade to a named account later.</p><p>Also, it’s important to note that implicit accounts can’t have sub-accounts. Their account ID is already 64 characters long (the maximum allowed on Near), so there’s simply no room to add anything else.</p><p>Imagine someone wants to send you  on Near, but you don’t have an account yet.\nWith a named account, you’d first need to register it by sending a transaction, which costs a small fee. If you skip this step and give them a name like  that hasn’t been created yet, you’re putting the funds at risk.\nWhy? Because anyone can create a named account that doesn’t exist yet. If you delay, someone else could create that same account before you and take the funds.</p><p>But with implicit accounts, it’s different.\nWhen you generate an implicit account, the account address is derived from your public key.<p>\nThe only way someone else could take over that account is by generating the exact same key pair, which is practically impossible.</p></p><p>Ethereum accounts on Near use the same familiar address format you’ll see in native EVM networks - a 20-byte hexadecimal string. If you’ve worked with Ethereum before, this format will feel instantly familiar.</p><p>These accounts were introduced to support smooth integration with Ethereum tools, especially wallets. The goal is to let users sign transactions using their Ethereum keys and execute them directly on Near.</p><p>When you create an Ethereum account on Near, a special <a href=\"https://github.com/near/NEPs/issues/518\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wallet Contract</a> is automatically deployed on it. One of its core methods is <code>rlp_execute(target: AccountId, tx_bytes_b64: Vec&lt;u8&gt;)</code>. This function takes an Ethereum transaction, verifies the signature using your Ethereum key, checks the nonce to ensure the transaction is in the correct order, and then executes it directly on Near.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Ethereum accounts on Near have limited capabilities, you can transfer  tokens, call functions on other smart contracts, and add or delete FunctionCall keys, but you cannot add Full Access keys or delete the account.</p><p>We’ve talked about how accounts can be created, but here’s something that makes Near stand out compared to many other blockchains - accounts on Near can also be fully deleted, and even recreated later, as many times as you need. This is not something you usually see on other chains, where account addresses are typically permanent.</p><p>Account deletion is done via a special transaction, and when you delete an account, its remaining available Near balance is automatically transferred to a beneficiary account of your choice. The account itself is completely removed from the blockchain’s state.</p><p>This feature gives you flexibility, but it also comes with a real risk of losing assets if you don’t handle the process carefully. When you delete an account, only the native  tokens are automatically transferred. Any other assets like FTs, or NFTs, won't be transferred automatically. If you forget to move those assets before deletion, you will lose them permanently.</p><p>If you spot anything incorrect or notice something important I missed, please feel free to correct me or add your thoughts in the comments. I’d appreciate it!</p><p>Otherwise, I hope this article helped you build a clear, practical understanding of Near accounts and gave you the confidence to work with them without second-guessing. \nThanks for reading and have a great day!</p>","contentLength":11950,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"API Gateway Design Pattern Unified Entry Management Strategy in Microservice Architecture（1751215090919000）","url":"https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/api-gateway-design-pattern-unified-entry-management-strategy-in-microservice-3eh3","date":1751215092,"author":"member_8d9a8f47","guid":175283,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have been fascinated by the challenge of building scalable microservice architectures. During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns\n</h2><p>Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:</p><p>Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Request/Response Compression\n</h3><p>Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.</p><p>API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication and Authorization\n</h3><p>Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h2><p>Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:</p><p>Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.</p><p>Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.</p><p>Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deployment and Scaling Strategies\n</h2><p>Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:</p><p>API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.</p><p>Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.</p><p>For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lessons Learned and Best Practices\n</h2><p>Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:</p><ol><li><p>: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.</p></li><li><p>: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.</p></li><li><p>: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.</p></li></ol><p>The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:</p><p>Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.</p><p>Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.</p><p>API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.</p><p>The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.</p><p>As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.</p><p><em>This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems. I hope my experience can help other students understand this critical architectural pattern.</em></p>","contentLength":7658,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🚀 What I Built: Lyra AI – RAG-Powered, Multilingual Customer Support as a Service","url":"https://dev.to/a6ar55/what-i-built-lyra-ai-rag-powered-multilingual-customer-support-as-a-service-h4n","date":1751215040,"author":"Adars T S","guid":175301,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  What I Built: Lyra AI - RAG-Powered, Multilingual Customer Support as a Service\n</h2><p>Lyra AI is a SaaS platform that transforms company documents into multilingual AI agents — capable of both text and voice-based customer support.

For those just beginning their journey into software development, such as students in coding bootcamps or early-phase tech training, keeping an eye on industry trends, innovations, and best practices is not just helpful—. In this blog, we’ll explore three major areas shaping the technology landscape today: the rise of AI and automation, the importance of modern web development tools, and the best practices every developer should adopt to stay efficient, scalable, and employable.</p><p><strong>1. Artificial Intelligence and Automation: The New Normal</strong></p><p>One of the most dominant trends in technology today is the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. From customer service chatbots to self-driving cars, AI is being integrated into every corner of the digital world. For developers, this means learning how to build smarter applications that not only respond to user input, but also learn and adapt from data.</p><p> AI isn't a distant concept anymore—it's a core part of modern app development. Tools like OpenAI’s GPT models are being used for natural language processing, while libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch help developers build and train machine learning models.</p><p> As a beginner, start by learning how to work with APIs that use AI (such as OpenAI or IBM Watson). Build simple apps that make use of these services—like a chatbot or a recommendation engine—to see how automation can elevate user experience.</p><p><strong>2. Modern Web Development: The Shift to JavaScript Ecosystem</strong></p><p>JavaScript has become the cornerstone of modern web development, supported by powerful frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. As of 2025, companies demand developers who can create interactive, responsive applications quickly and efficiently.</p><p><strong>Emerging Technologies to Watch:</strong></p><ul><li>React 19 (with React Server Components)</li><li>Next.js and Remix for server-side rendering</li><li>Tailwind CSS for utility-first design</li></ul><p> Mastery of JavaScript and its tools isn't optional anymore—it's a necessity. Companies expect developers to build responsive frontends and scalable backend solutions, often in the same codebase (as with Node.js).</p><p> Focus on learning vanilla JavaScript deeply before moving on to frameworks. Then, dive into React, and explore building full-stack apps with Express (Node.js) and MongoDB or PostgreSQL.</p><p><strong>3. Best Practices Every New Developer Should Know</strong></p><p>Knowing the tools is only half the battle. Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code is what separates a good developer from a great one. Below are a few non-negotiables:</p><p><strong>a. Version Control with Git</strong></p><ul><li>Commit early, commit often</li><li>Use clear commit messages</li><li>Create separate branches for features or bug fixes</li></ul><ul><li>DRY stands for \"Don’t Repeat Yourself\"</li><li>Reuse logic through functions and components</li></ul><p><strong>c. Understand RESTful APIs</strong></p><ul><li>Know your HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li><li>Understand status codes and headers</li></ul><p><strong>d. Follow Semantic HTML and Accessibility</strong></p><ul><li>Use tags like , , </li><li>Provide  attributes for images</li></ul><p><strong>e. Learn the Art of Debugging</strong></p><ul><li>Use Chrome DevTools, VSCode debugger</li><li>Understand stack traces and error logs</li></ul><p><strong>4. Security and Ethics in Development</strong></p><p>As we build increasingly powerful apps, ethical considerations and basic security become more critical.</p><p> Don’t store passwords in plain text. Learn about hashing with libraries like bcrypt.</p><p> Understand software licenses. Don’t plagiarize. Always give credit.</p><p><strong>Inclusivity and Bias in Code:</strong> Test your code with a diverse range of users in mind.</p><p><strong>5. Industry Trends: Remote Work and Continuous Learning</strong></p><ul><li>Communicate asynchronously via Slack, GitHub, etc.</li><li>Document code and processes clearly</li><li>Manage tasks on Jira, Trello, or Notion</li></ul><p><strong>Continuous Learning is Mandatory:</strong></p><ul><li>Follow platforms like freeCodeCamp, Dev.to, Stack Overflow, Medium blogs</li><li>Read official documentation</li><li>Watch conference talks and webinars</li></ul><p><strong>Final Thoughts: Building Toward a Career, Not Just a Project</strong></p><p>Phase 1 is just the beginning. Each lab or project you complete isn’t just a checkpoint—it’s a brick in the foundation of your career. Start thinking about your GitHub as your portfolio. Make your code clean, your commits meaningful, and your projects reflective of what you can do.</p><p>Your future employers aren’t just hiring skills—they’re hiring problem solvers, communicators, and lifelong learners.

Compared with other container components, its appearance has solved an important problem in actual development, that is element alignment in complex scenes.</p><p>The following layout between components, if there is no RelativeContainer component, how should we implement it? Obviously, many container components need to be nested or coordinate positioned before implementation. With the RelativeContainer component, we can place it according to its relative position.</p><p>Related code implementation:</p><div><pre><code>RelativeContainer() {\n      Text(\"1\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_1\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Red)\n\n      Text(\"2\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_2\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Orange)\n        .alignRules({\n          top: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Top },\n          right: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.End }\n        })\n\n      Text(\"3\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_3\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Yellow)\n        .alignRules({\n          top: { anchor: \"view_1\", align: VerticalAlign.Bottom },\n          left: { anchor: \"view_1\", align: HorizontalAlign.End },\n          right: { anchor: \"view_2\", align: HorizontalAlign.Start }\n        })\n\n      Text(\"4\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_4\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Blue)\n        .alignRules({\n          top: { anchor: \"view_3\", align: VerticalAlign.Bottom }\n        })\n\n      Text(\"5\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_5\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Brown)\n        .alignRules({\n          top: { anchor: \"view_3\", align: VerticalAlign.Bottom },\n          left: { anchor: \"view_2\", align: HorizontalAlign.Start }\n        })\n    }.width(300)\n</code></pre></div><p>skilled use of RelativeContainer components, that is, must know the relative position of the placement, that is, relative to who, how to place.</p><p>the B component is on the right side of the component. How does the B component know the location of the component? In the relative layout, each component is marked by setting a unique identification id for the component. Just as in the vast sea of people, your id card is your unique identification. Setting the id is very important. Without this id, the corresponding anchor component will be missing, and the relative placement of the position cannot be realized in the relative layout.</p><div><pre><code>Text(\"1\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_1\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Red)\n</code></pre></div><p>we have determined the anchor component by id, but relative to this anchor component, we need to control its corresponding position whether it is on the left, right, top or bottom.</p><p>The position of the current component is controlled by the aligrules attribute, which has attributes such as upper left and lower right, horizontal center, vertical center, etc. Each attribute corresponds to two parameters, one is anchor parameter, anchor component, and the other is align, that is, position. The code format is as follows:</p><div><pre><code> .alignRules({\n          top: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Top },\n          bottom: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Bottom },\n          left: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.Start },\n          right: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.End }\n        })\n</code></pre></div><p>anchor is set to__, which means that it corresponds to the relative parent component. If it is a definite ID, it is the anchor component corresponding to the ID.</p><p>The horizontal direction is HorizontalAlign.Start, HorizontalAlign.Center, and HorizontalAlign.End. The horizontal direction is HorizontalAlign.Start, horizontaltalalign. Center, and HorizontalAlign.End. The vertical direction is VerticalAlign.Top, VerticalAlign.Center, and VerticalAlign.Bottom.</p><p>for example, in a very simple case, if a component is displayed in the center, it is set relative to the parent container. The code is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>@Entry\n@Component\nstruct Index {\n  build() {\n    RelativeContainer() {\n\n      Text(\"1\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_1\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Red)\n        .alignRules({\n          top: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Top },\n          bottom: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Bottom },\n          left: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.Start },\n          right: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.End }\n        })\n\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>the effect is shown in the following figure:</p><p>of course, in addition to the four attributes of directly upper left and lower right, we can also directly set the horizontal center and vertical center attributes, and the effect is exactly the same.</p><div><pre><code>\n@Entry\n@Component\nstruct Index {\n  build() {\n    RelativeContainer() {\n\n      Text(\"1\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_1\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Red)\n        .alignRules({\n          center: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Center },\n          middle: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.Center },\n        })\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>at the top of a component, we need to set the bottom attribute, that is, the bottom is on the top of the anchor component, and then combine the anchor component to set other attributes, such as the anchor component is centered, where we add the attribute middle that is horizontally centered relative to the parent container.</p><div><pre><code>@Entry\n@Component\nstruct Index {\n  build() {\n    RelativeContainer() {\n\n      Text(\"1\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_1\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Red)\n        .alignRules({\n          center: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Center },\n          middle: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.Center },\n        })\n\n      Text(\"2\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_2\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Orange)\n        .alignRules({\n          bottom: { anchor: \"view_1\", align: VerticalAlign.Top },\n          middle: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: HorizontalAlign.Center }\n        })\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>The effect is as follows.

The relevant code is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>Text(\"4\")\n        .width(100)\n        .height(100)\n        .id(\"view_4\")\n        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)\n        .backgroundColor(Color.Pink)\n        .alignRules({\n          right: { anchor: \"view_1\", align: HorizontalAlign.Start },\n          center: { anchor: \"__container__\", align: VerticalAlign.Center }\n        })\n</code></pre></div><p>if we look at the effect, component 4 is to the left of anchor component 1.</p><p>on the right, the left attribute is used here, that is, the anchor component is on the left.

Through the above cases, it is not difficult to find that the so-called upper left and lower right are right. For example, above the anchor point, I use bottom, below the anchor point, I use top, which can greatly save our development time in actual development.</p>","contentLength":10113,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Event Stream Processing Architecture Design Pattern Best Practices in Real Time Applications（1751211246503100）","url":"https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/event-stream-processing-architecture-design-pattern-best-practices-in-real-time-2nc6","date":1751211246,"author":"member_8d9a8f47","guid":175236,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

Seeing that it ends with Ts, it must be easy for everyone to think of TypeScript. Yes, ArkTS is more straightforward. It is a language that has been optimized and expanded on the basis of inheriting TypeScript syntax.</p><p>The TypeScript language is very popular among developers because it provides a more structured JavaScript coding method, and ArkTS also maintains most of the syntax of TypeScript. It can be said that if you have a TypeScript language foundation, you can seamlessly connect ArkTS and get started very quickly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Declarative development paradigm\n</h2><p>although, for different purposes and technical backgrounds, in addition to the current ArkTs language, application development can also use the Web-like development paradigm, that is, to develop applications through classic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However, as application development, considering performance, underlying interaction, complexity, development efficiency and future development trend, ArkTs language is definitely our preferred method at present. Similarly, it is also the official way to push.</p><p>At present, the two development methods are as follows:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>name of development method</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>declarative development paradigm</td><td>programs with greater complexity and teamwork</td><td>mobile system application developer, system application developer</td></tr><tr><td>web-like development paradigm</td><td>simpler interface for program applications and cards</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>what is certain is that the future must be a declarative development paradigm. You can look at the current Android or iOS. Although the regular development method still dominates, the declarative UI development frameworks Compose,SwiftUI, and Flutter are also constantly developing and growing, and are constantly moving towards the first choice of developers. Speaking of which, let's extend the advantages of the declarative development paradigm.</p><p>as we all know, in the traditional imperative development method, if you want to render a data for a UI component, you must first obtain the specified component, and then set the data to the UI component through a certain method to achieve the function of data rendering. However, in this method, developers should not only pay attention to the essence of the problem, but also participate in the specific implementation steps, not only the code is redundant, but also the performance is consumed, in view of such a deficiency, which is not found in the declarative development paradigm, let's look at the advantages of the declarative development paradigm.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1, code simplicity and readability.\n</h4><p>The declarative development paradigm emphasizes \"what\" rather than \"how\". It does not need to worry about the specific process, making the code more concise and easy to read. That is to say, in development, developers only need to focus on describing the page structure and behavior, without getting into specific implementation details, which helps to improve development efficiency and reduce errors and debugging time.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2, high level of abstraction\n</h4><p>the declarative development paradigm is relatively more abstract, allowing developers to focus more on the nature of the problem rather than the specific implementation steps, and this high-level abstraction helps improve the maintainability of the code because the logic is clearer and relatively easy to maintain.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. Great potential for performance optimization\n</h4><p>the declarative development paradigm is usually combined with features such as reactive programming and data binding, enabling pages to automatically respond to changes in data and achieve dynamic updates, while the underlying framework can be implemented for specific optimization strategies, such as Virtual DOM, dirty check, etc., to improve rendering speed and responsiveness.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4, portability and parallelization.\n</h4><p>The logic and structure of the declarative development paradigm is decoupled from the underlying implementation, making it easier to implement cross-platform and portable code, and some declarative programming models are easier to perform parallel calculations, further improving performance.</p><p>It should be noted that although the declarative development paradigm has many advantages, it does not force everyone to switch. In actual development, due to developer preferences, historical legacy or other factors, it is recommended that everyone choose their own suitable development method.</p><p>Hongmeng development has a relatively good advantage. After NEXT, it directly provides a declarative development paradigm. Therefore, when we cut in, there is no need to have any burden. As mentioned earlier, although Hongmeng provides a Web-like development paradigm, for the sake of performance, better bottom-level interaction and future development trends, both the official and the author are concerned, it is suggested that everyone develop Hongmeng application and get started with ArkTs directly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. High development efficiency and good development experience\n</h3><p>the code expression is streamlined and efficient: the user interface (UI) is outlined in a way that is close to natural language, so that developers do not need to delve into the UI drawing and rendering details within the framework, thus focusing on the implementation of creativity and functionality.</p><p>Data-driven UI dynamic updates: This mechanism allows developers to focus more on the core processing of business logic. Once the UI needs to be adjusted, developers do not need to write complex UI switching code in person, but only need to pay attention to and write the data logic that triggers the interface update. Specific UI changes are intelligently processed and presented by the framework.</p><p>Excellent development experience: Because the interface design is also presented in the form of code, this feature greatly enriches the programming experience of developers, enabling them to create and debug more smoothly in the familiar code environment.</p><p>the declarative UI architecture realizes a clear hierarchy between the front end and the UI back end: the UI back end is based on the high-performance C ++ language, and carefully constructs all-round support covering basic components, flexible layout, vivid effects, rich interaction events, fine component state management and efficient rendering pipeline, providing a solid foundation and powerful functions for the front end.</p><p>In terms of language compiler and runtime optimization, a number of advanced technologies have been implemented, including but not limited to unified bytecode to improve execution efficiency, efficient external function interface (FFI) to facilitate cross-language calls, using ahead-of-time compilation (AOT) technology to reduce runtime overhead, implementing engine minimization to reduce resource consumption, and type optimization to enhance code security and execution speed. Together, these optimizations ensure superior performance and efficient operation of the platform.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3, the ecology is easy to advance quickly\n</h3><p>it can make full use of the advantages of the mainstream language ecology to achieve rapid development. Its language design uphold the principle of neutral and friendly, easy to integrate with a variety of programming languages and tools. At the same time, with the support of the corresponding standards organization, it can follow the established specifications and roadmap, continuously evolve and continuously improve the function and performance of the platform.</p><p>this layer mainly provides the basic language specification of UI development paradigm, including built-in UI components, layout and animation, etc., and also provides diversified state management mechanisms to ensure accurate tracking and efficient management of application states. In order to further improve the experience and efficiency of application developers, it also provides a series of interface support, covering all aspects from component calling to state synchronization, all-Round help developers to create excellent user interface.</p><p>the language runtime, which has powerful parsing capabilities for UI paradigm syntax, supports cross-language calls, and provides a high-performance runtime environment for TypeScript(TS) languages.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Declarative UI backend engine\n</h3><p>The back-end engine integrates UI rendering pipelines that are highly compatible with various development paradigms, which not only covers diversified basic components, accurate and efficient layout calculation, smooth and vivid dynamic processing and rich interactive event response, but also is equipped with a powerful state management mechanism and flexible rendering functions to meet the needs of UI development in all aspects.</p><p>provides efficient rendering capabilities, the ability to draw the rendering instructions collected by the rendering pipeline to the screen.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Platform Adaptation Layer\n</h3><p>provides an abstract interface to the system platform, with the ability to access different systems, such as system rendering pipeline, lifecycle scheduling, etc.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Adaptation rules (understanding)\n</h2><p>enforce static typing: Static typing is one of the most important features of ArkTS. If static typing is used, then the type of the variable in the program is deterministic. At the same time, because all types are known before the program actually runs, the compiler can verify the correctness of the code, thereby reducing runtime type checking and contributing to performance improvements.</p><p>Prohibit changing object layout at runtime: For maximum performance, ArkTS requires that object layout cannot be changed during program execution.</p><p>Restricting operator semantics: For better performance and to encourage developers to write clearer code, ArkTS restricts the semantics of some operators. For example, the unary addition operator can only work on numbers and cannot be used on other types of variables.</p><p>Structural typing is not supported: support for Structural typing requires a lot of consideration and careful implementation in the language, compiler, and runtime, and is not currently supported by ArkTS. According to the needs and feedback of the actual scene, we will reconsider later.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Extended Capability (Understanding)\n</h2><p>Currently, in the UI development framework, ArkTS mainly extends the following capabilities:</p><p>basic syntax: ArkTS defines declarative UI descriptions, custom components, and the ability to dynamically extend UI elements, together with the system components in the ArkUI development framework and their related event methods and attribute methods, to form the main body of UI development.</p><p>State Management: ArkTS provides a multi-dimensional state management mechanism. In the UI development framework, the data associated with the UI can be used within the component, can also be transferred between different component levels, such as between parent and child components, between father and son components, can also be transferred within the global scope of the application or across devices. In addition, from the form of data transfer, can be divided into read-only one-way transfer and can be changed to two-way transfer. Developers can flexibly use these capabilities to realize the linkage between data and UI.</p><p>Rendering control: ArkTS provides the ability to render control. Conditional rendering can render UI content in the corresponding state according to different states of the application. Loop rendering iteratively takes data from the data source and creates corresponding components during each iteration. Data lazy loading iterates data from the data source on demand and creates the corresponding components during each iteration.</p><p>this summary mainly briefly introduces the relevant knowledge of ArkTs language, which is of some conceptual nature. As an understanding, you need to know the following:</p><ol><li>ArkTs is based on TypeScript and has been expanded.</li></ol><p>2, understand the relevant architecture of ArkTs and related advantages.</p>","contentLength":12141,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SpinKit","url":"https://dev.to/787107497/spinkit-1411","date":1751211132,"author":"桃花镇童长老","guid":175255,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  🏆Introduction and Recommendations\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://ohpm.openharmony.cn/#/cn/detail/@pura%2Fspinkit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SpinKit</a> is a loading animation library for OpenHarmony/HarmonyOS.</p><p><a href=\"https://ohpm.openharmony.cn/#/cn/detail/@pura%2Fharmony-utils\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">harmony-utils</a> A HarmonyOS tool library with rich features and extremely easy to use, with the help of many practical tools, is committed to helping developers quickly build Hongmeng applications.</p><p><a href=\"https://ohpm.openharmony.cn/#/cn/detail/@pura%2Fharmony-dialog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">harmony-dialog</a> An extremely simple and easy-to-use zero-invasion pop-up window, which can be easily implemented with just one line of code, and can be easily popped up no matter where you are.</p><p>The renderings are slightly stumbled, please run the source code or add dependencies to view the effect.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fwsrv.nl%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fi-blog.csdnimg.cn%2Fimg_convert%2F9dbf847c21a14f327652c75a3a3ea3f4.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fwsrv.nl%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fi-blog.csdnimg.cn%2Fimg_convert%2F9dbf847c21a14f327652c75a3a3ea3f4.png\" alt=\"SpinKit\" width=\"426\" height=\"851\"></a></p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Animation size, default 60</td></tr><tr><td>Animation color, default white</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><pre><code>  SpinKit()\n\n  SpinKit({ spinType: SpinType.spinA })\n\n  SpinKit({ spinType: SpinType.spinH })\n\n  SpinKit({\n     spinType: SpinType.spinA,\n     spinColor: Color.Pink,\n     spinSize: 70\n  })\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  💖 Communication and communication 🙏\n</h2><p>Any problems found during use can be asked<a href=\"https://gitee.com/tongyuyan/harmony-utils/issues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Issue</a>Give us;\nOf course, we also welcome you to send us a message<a href=\"https://gitee.com/tongyuyan/harmony-utils/pulls\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PR</a> 。</p><p>This project is based on<a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apache License 2.0</a>, when copying and borrowing codes, please be sure to indicate the source.</p>","contentLength":1127,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Exploring ReplaySubject in RxJS: How to Replay Past Values in Angular","url":"https://dev.to/vetriselvan_11/exploring-replaysubject-in-rxjs-how-to-replay-past-values-in-angular-2eh5","date":1751208456,"author":"vetriselvan Panneerselvam","guid":175221,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome back to another weekly deep dive! 🚀</p><p>This time, we’re exploring an incredibly useful and powerful concept in  — the .</p><p>In our previous posts, we covered how to pass values asynchronously using  and .

They all help reduce boilerplate and add declarative magic to your code.\nAnd I’m sure you’ve come across the term “macro”, usually explained in some academic or cryptic way. But here’s the thing: these libraries are simulating macro-like behavior — just without true macro support.</p><p>In languages like Lisp or Clojure, macros are compile-time programs that transform your code before it runs. They let you:</p><ul><li>Build new control structures</li><li>Create entire domain-specific languages</li></ul><p>They're basically code that writes code — giving you full control of the compiler pipeline.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Java’s “Macro” Workarounds\n</h2><p>Java doesn’t support macros. Instead, it uses annotation processors and code generation tools:</p><ul><li>Lombok’s <a href=\"https://dev.to/data\">@data</a> → generates constructors, getters, and equals()/hashCode()</li><li>Jakarta Bean Validation (<a href=\"https://dev.to/min\">@min</a>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/notblank\">@notblank</a>) → declarative validation</li><li>AutoValue → immutable value types</li><li>MapStruct → type-safe mappers (my personal favorite)</li><li>Immutables → generates immutable types with builders</li><li>Spring Validation → framework-driven validation</li></ul><p>These are powerful tools — but they can’t create new syntax or change how Java works at its core. They're still working within the language, not extending it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Real Macros Look Like\n</h2><p>In Clojure, you can define a new data structure and its validator in a single macro:</p><div><pre><code>lisp\n(defmacro defvalidated\n  [name fields validations]\n  `(do\n     (defrecord ~name ~fields)\n     (defn ~(symbol (str \"validate-\" name)) [~'x]\n       (let [errors# (atom [])]\n         ~@(for [[field rule] validations]\n             `(when-not (~rule (~field ~'x))\n                (swap! errors# conj ~(str field \" failed validation\"))))\n         @errors#))))\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>lisp\n(defvalidated User\n  [name age]\n  {name not-empty\n   age #(&gt;= % 18)})\n\n(validate-User (-&gt;User \"\" 15))\n;; =&gt; [\"name failed validation\" \"age failed validation\"]\n</code></pre></div><p>No annotations. No libraries. No ceremony.\nJust your own language feature, built with a macro.</p><p>Java’s toolchain simulates macro-like behavior through annotations and codegen. But if you want to invent language, write less boilerplate, and build smarter abstractions — macros in languages like Clojure or Racket offer the real deal.</p><p>Java gives you a powerful toolkit. Macros give you the power to build your own.</p><p><em>Inspired by Paul Graham's essay collection \"Hackers &amp; Painters\"</em></p>","contentLength":2478,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"HarmonyOS Next- project actual combat, calendar development novice tutorial 1","url":"https://dev.to/xiaoyaolihua/harmonyos-next-project-actual-combat-calendar-development-novice-tutorial-1-1305","date":1751208336,"author":"xiaoyaolihua","guid":175218,"unread":true,"content":"<p>​\nThe author, began to lead everyone from scratch, our calendar actual combat.</p><p>The first step is to complete the calendar header navigation bar of our calendar.</p><p>The sample code is as follows:</p><p>@Entry\nexport struct Index {</p><p>build() {\n    Column() {\n        Image($r('sys.media.ohos_ic_public_arrow_left'))\n          .aspectRatio(1)\n          .onClick(() =&gt;

It was released by the State Cryptography Administration in 2006 and became the national cryptography industry standard in 2012 (GM/T 0002-2012). This algorithm uses a 128-bit packet length and a 128-bit key length to realize data encryption through 32 rounds of nonlinear iterative structures, and the security strength is comparable to that of AES-128. Its core design includes S-box replacement, cyclic shifting and other operations, and supports standard working modes such as ECB and CBC. As the core component of China's cryptographic system (SM series), SM4 is widely used in financial payment, e-government, Internet of Things and other fields, meeting domestic cryptographic compliance requirements. The algorithm has the characteristics of efficient software and hardware implementation, and has passed the ISO/IEC international standard certification (18033-3), becoming an important basic algorithm in the field of information security in my country.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  SM4 application scenarios\n</h2><p>Financial payment: Encrypt sensitive data (such as transaction amount and account information) in bank card transactions, mobile payments and online banking to ensure the security of transmission and comply with the password compliance requirements of China's financial industry;\nE-government: used for data transmission and encryption of electronic ID cards and government affairs systems, and combined with SM2 signature algorithm to achieve identity authentication and data integrity protection;<p>\nInternet of Things Security: Encrypt communication data between smart devices to prevent data leakage in industrial-grade SSDs, smart homes and other scenarios;</p>\nReplacement of localized innovation and innovation: replace AES algorithm in information technology application innovation projects to meet the independent and controllable needs of party and government organs and key infrastructure.</p><h5>\n  \n  \n  generateSymKey generates symmetric key SymKey\n</h5><div><pre><code>let symKey1 = await SM4.generateSymKey();\nlet symKeyStr1 = CryptoHelper.dataBlobToStr(symKey1.getEncoded(), 'hex');\nLogUtil.error(`对称密钥1：${symKeyStr1}`);\n\nlet symKey2 = SM4.generateSymKeySync();\nlet symKeyStr2 = CryptoHelper.dataBlobToStr(symKey2.getEncoded(), 'base64');\nLogUtil.error(`对称密钥2：${symKeyStr2}`);\n</code></pre></div><h5>\n  \n  \n  encryptGCM encryption (GCM mode)\n</h5><div><pre><code>let gcmParams = CryptoUtil.generateGcmParamsSpec();\n\nlet str1 = \"鸿蒙技术交流群：xxxxxxxxxxx\";\n\nlet smyKeyHexStr = \"da4eed5a22f8883e2339c0b563161c38\";

However, sometimes we encounter situations where the server and client need to render different content, which can lead to hydration mismatches. In this blog post, we'll explore a neat trick to handle this scenario without triggering React's hydration errors.</p><p>When using React with SSR, you might encounter situations where you need to render different content on the server versus the client. A common example is when we need to render something that depends upon browser cookies. React expects the server-rendered HTML to match exactly what would be rendered on the client during hydration. If there's a mismatch, React throws a hydration error:</p><div><pre><code>Warning: Text content did not match. Server: \"Bye World\" Client: \"Hello World\"\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example Approach (That Causes Problems)\n</h2><p>Here's a typical example that would cause hydration issues:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code will cause a hydration mismatch because the server renders \"Bye World\" (since  is undefined), but the client renders \"Hello World\".</p><p><em>You could use useEffect here and render but that would cause a flicker.</em></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: The Inline Script Trick\n</h2><p>Here's where our trick comes in. We can use an inline script that executes immediately after the HTML is rendered but before React hydration begins. Here's how it works:</p><div><pre><code>Hello WorldBye World</code></pre></div><p>Let's break down how this trick works:</p><ol><li>On the server, React renders <code>&lt;h1 id=\"hello\"&gt;Bye World&lt;/h1&gt;</code> because  returns .</li><li>Immediately after the HTML is sent to the browser, but before React hydration begins, our inline script executes:\n\n<ul><li>It finds the element with id \"hello\"</li><li>Changes its content to \"Hello World\"</li></ul></li><li>When React begins hydration, it sees \"Hello World\" in both:\n\n<ul><li>The actual DOM (thanks to our script)</li><li>The virtual DOM it wants to render (because  is now )</li></ul></li><li>No hydration mismatch occurs because the content matches!</li></ol><p>This approach works because:</p><ol><li>The inline script executes synchronously before React's hydration process begins</li><li>By the time React performs hydration, the DOM already contains the client-side content</li><li>React sees matching content in both the real DOM and its virtual DOM</li></ol><p>This hydration trick provides a clean solution to handle server/client content differences without triggering React's hydration warnings.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://builder.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Builder.io</a>, we rely on this very inline-script hydration trick to select the winning variant in our SDKs.

Whether you’re building a SaaS product, a CMS, or an internal dashboard, having a design system in place can be the difference between chaos and clarity.</p><p>In this post, I’ll explain what a design system is, why you should care as a frontend developer, and how to start building one that fits your workflow — especially if you’re using tools like Tailwind CSS, Figma, or Storybook.</p><p>What Is a Design System?\nA design system is a collection of reusable components, design tokens, principles, and documentation that define the visual and interaction language of your application.</p><p>Think of it as the source of truth for how your UI should look and behave. It includes things like:</p><p>Color palettes\nTypography scales\nButton styles\nComponent states (hover, active, disabled)<p>\nDocumentation and usage guidelines</p>\nIt’s not just a UI kit. A good design system is the combination of code, design, and rules that drive a product’s experience.</p><p>Why Every Frontend Developer Should Care\nYou might be wondering — isn’t this just for designers? Not at all. Here’s why it matters to developers.</p><p>Consistency Across the Codebase\nWith a design system, a Button component always looks and behaves the same — no more duplicated CSS classes or slightly different spacing everywhere.</p><p>Faster Development\nNo need to ask, “Which shade of blue are we using here?” It’s defined. It’s tokenized. You just apply it.</p><p>Scalability\nWhen working on large apps or across teams, design systems ensure that everyone speaks the same visual language. It’s the difference between working in harmony and stepping on each other’s toes.</p><p>Cleaner Code and Reusability\nYou write one component once and reuse it everywhere. Fewer bugs, fewer regressions.</p><p>Collaboration\nDevelopers, designers, and product managers align better when there’s a shared system in place.</p><p>Real-World Design Systems to Learn From\nHere are some robust examples of well-documented, open-source design systems:</p><p>Tools to Build Your Own Design System\nBuilding your own design system doesn’t have to be overwhelming. These tools make it easier.</p><p>Figma\nDesigners (or frontend devs like us) can create a visual style guide with shared components and variants. It’s your visual playground.</p><p>Tailwind CSS\nPerfect for creating token-based systems using utility-first classes. With tailwind.config.js, you can define your own:</p><p>module.exports = {\n  theme: {\n      primary: '#0D6EFD',\n      success: '#198754',\n    fontSize: {\n      lg: '1.125rem',\n    spacing: {\n      2: '0.5rem',\n  }\nStorybook<p>\nA tool to develop and showcase components in isolation. It’s a live documentation of your design system with usage examples, states, and accessibility notes.</p></p><p>Testing Tools\nPair your system with tools like Jest or Cypress to ensure components behave as expected — even at scale.</p><p>How to Build a Basic Design System (Step-by-Step)\nAudit Your Current UI<p>\nList all the repeated UI elements.</p>\nCheck inconsistencies in color, spacing, or states.\nColors, typography, spacing, shadows — define them in a config file or SCSS map.<p>\nKeep them semantic: primary, danger, text-muted.</p>\nBuild Reusable Components<p>\nStart with base components like Button, Input, Card, Modal.</p>\nUse slots or props to make them flexible.\nUse Storybook or markdown files to explain usage, do’s and don’ts, and variations.\nA design system is a living project. Evolve it as the product grows.\nAvoid these mistakes when working on your design system:</p><p>Over-engineering\nDon’t try to build the perfect system from day one. Start small.\nIf others can’t understand how to use it, it fails.\nTreat your design system like a package — version it.\nKeep the system synced between Figma and code.\nA design system isn’t just a buzzword. It’s the foundation for building interfaces that are consistent, efficient, and scalable — and as frontend developers, we should take the lead in integrating it into our workflow.</p><p>If you’re already using Tailwind, Vue or React, and Storybook — you’re halfway there.</p><p>Want to see how I structure design systems in my own projects?

How to quickly implement? Take another common scenario, a function, you have written a lot of code, you want to quickly extract a part of the code into a separate function, used to simplify the current code logic, how to quickly implement? Perhaps many old irons will think of it in the first place and copy the code. What's the difficulty? Although manual copying can be implemented, it is a waste of time. This article will tell you a convenient way to implement it, that is, code extraction in DevEcoStudio.</p><p>To give a very simple example, the following code, how to quickly extract the properties set by the Text component into a function call?</p><div><pre><code>@Entry\n@Component\nstruct Index {\n  build() {\n    Column() {\n      Text(\"我是测试内容1\")\n        .fontColor(Color.Red)\n        .fontSize(16)\n        .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)\n    }.width('100%')\n    .height(\"100%\")\n    .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>It's very simple, just select the attribute you want to Extract, right-click and select Refactor, then select Extract Method... and it will automatically Extract into an extended component style function.</p><p>The results are as follows:</p><div><pre><code>@Entry\n@Component\nstruct Index {\n  build() {\n    Column() {\n      Text(\"我是测试内容1\")\n        .newExtend()\n    }.width('100%')\n    .height(\"100%\")\n    .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)\n  }\n}\n\n\n@Extend(Text)\nfunction newExtend() {\n  .fontColor(Color.Red)\n  .fontSize(16)\n  .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>the dynamic effects are as follows:</p><p>after executing the Extract Method, the extended style function has a box. We can change the name of the Method, and it will automatically synchronize the generated function to make changes.</p><p>One thing to note is that if you are a private attribute, that is, the component itself, it will generally directly generate a function decorated with @ Extend. If it is a common attribute, it can be extracted as a function decorated with @ Styles or @ Extend.</p><p>As shown below, I selected the common attribute, and I can see that the generation options to be selected are given:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Extract new Method/function (Method)\n</h2><p>in the preface, we simply cited an example to quickly implement the component's attribute function generation, this extraction method is method extraction, in addition, in the actual development, we can not only extract attributes, but also extract components.</p><p>We can Extract a duplicate component to facilitate reuse of pages or simplify the code level. The extraction is also very simple, which is the same as the extraction of attributes. Select the range of components you want to Extract, right-click to select Refactor, and then select Extract Method... It will automatically be extracted into a function decorated by @ Builder.</p><p>You can select Global or Current Page:</p><p>the generated code is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>@Entry\n@Component\nstruct Index {\n  build() {\n    Column() {\n      this.newLocalBuilder()\n    }.width('100%')\n    .height(\"100%\")\n    .justifyContent(FlexAlign.Center)\n  }\n\n  @Builder\n  newLocalBuilder() {\n    Text(\"test 1\")\n      .fontColor(Color.Red)\n      .fontSize(16)\n      .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>the above is for component or component properties extraction, the same, if you want to extract the logic of a method into a new method is also supported, the use of the same as above, are selected to extract the code.</p><p>For example, I want to extract the following piece of code:</p><p>the code after extraction is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>add(a: number, b: number): number {\n    return this.newMethod(a, b)\n  }\n\n  private newMethod(a: number, b: number): number {\n    return a + b\n  }\n</code></pre></div><p>of course, the above is just a simple case, in the actual development, please also combine the business to extract.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Extract variables/constants\n</h2><p>the extraction of variables and constants is also very simple. Refactor is selected by right-clicking, Extract Variable is selected for variables, and Extract Constant is selected for constants. For example, I want the following code to Extract a Variable:</p><p>after the extraction the code is as follows, similarly, there is also a box where you can modify the variable name synchronously.</p><p>Constants and variables are different only keywords. Constants are const and variables are let.</p><p>in fact, we can see that there is also an interface extraction, which supports the extraction of selected object arguments into interfaces. The usage is as follows:</p><p>because the current ArkTs no longer supports this syntax, we generally do not write in this way, so we can ignore this.</p><p>The above usage method supports shortcut buttons. The system is different, and the shortcut keys set by oneself are different, and the shortcut methods are also different. When you choose, there are prompts on the right, just remember.</p><p>This article label: Hongmeng Development Tools/DevEco Studio</p>","contentLength":5008,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"WebSocket Real Time Communication Guide（1751204845114200）","url":"https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/websocket-real-time-communication-guide1751204845114200-37kc","date":1751204845,"author":"member_8d9a8f47","guid":175164,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have always been fascinated by real-time communication technologies.

For us Android devs using Kotlin, it opens up some really cool possibilities. Instead of just thinking about AI as something separate, we can start weaving it right into our development workflow. It's not about replacing us, but more about making us way more efficient. I mean, who wouldn't want that?</p><h3>Streamlining Android App Creation with prompt to kotlin</h3><p>Imagine just describing what you want your app to do, and then , Kotlin code appears. That's the promise of using AI for code generation. <strong>It's about turning ideas into reality faster.</strong> Think of it like this:</p><ul><li>You describe a UI element, and AI generates the Jetpack Compose code.</li><li>You outline a data processing task, and AI writes the Kotlin functions.</li><li>You specify an API interaction, and AI creates the network calls.</li></ul><h3>Integrating AI Capabilities into Existing Kotlin Projects</h3><p>It's not just about starting new projects; AI can also breathe new life into existing ones. We can use AI to add features that were previously too complex or time-consuming. For example:</p><ul><li>Adding intelligent search functionality.</li><li>Implementing personalized recommendations.</li><li>Automating data analysis and reporting.</li></ul><blockquote>The cool thing is, you don't have to be an AI expert to do this. There are libraries and frameworks that make it relatively easy to integrate AI models into your Kotlin code. It's all about finding the right tools and understanding how to use them effectively.</blockquote><p>It's a bit like adding Lego bricks to a structure you've already built. You can enhance what you have without tearing everything down. The key is to start small, experiment, and gradually incorporate AI into different parts of your app.</p><h2>The Kotlin Advantage in AI Integration</h2><p>Kotlin and AI? It's a match that makes a lot of sense. If you're coming from a Java and Spring background, you'll feel right at home. Integrating AI doesn't mean you have to ditch everything you know and jump into a Python world (unless you want to, of course!). Kotlin brings some serious advantages to the table, making the whole process smoother.</p><h3>Conciseness and Interoperability for prompt to kotlin</h3><p>Kotlin's  is a huge win. <strong>You end up writing less code, which means less boilerplate, especially when you're dealing with data classes.</strong> These are perfect for modeling the inputs and outputs of language models. Plus, Kotlin plays nice with Java. You can use all those existing Java libraries and frameworks without any headaches. This is great if you've already got a solid Java-based system and want to add some AI smarts to it. Kotlin is a <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-ai-apps-development-overview.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">versatile language</a> for AI development.</p><h3>Building Robust Systems with Kotlin and AI</h3><p>Kotlin isn't just about writing less code; it's about writing better code. It has features that help you avoid common programming mistakes, like null pointer exceptions. This is super important when you're building complex AI systems that need to be reliable.</p><blockquote>Think of it this way: Kotlin helps you build a solid foundation for your AI applications. It's like having a well-organized toolbox – everything is in its place, and you can find what you need quickly. This makes it easier to maintain and scale your systems as they grow.</blockquote><p>Here's a quick look at some of Kotlin's key features for building robust systems:</p><ul><li>Null safety: Avoid those pesky null pointer exceptions.</li><li>Data classes: Easily create data models for AI inputs and outputs.</li><li>Coroutines: Handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.</li><li>Extension functions: Add new functionality to existing classes without modifying them.</li></ul><h2>Real-World Applications of prompt to kotlin</h2><p>It's cool to talk about how AI can write Kotlin code, but what does that  look like in the real world? Turns out, there are some pretty interesting applications already popping up. Let's check them out.</p><h3>Androidify: AI-Driven Experiences with Jetpack Compose</h3><p>Jetpack Compose is Android's modern toolkit for building UIs, and it plays really well with Kotlin. <strong>AI can help generate Compose code from simple prompts, making it easier to create dynamic and personalized user interfaces.</strong> Imagine describing the layout you want, and the AI spits out the Kotlin code to make it happen. This can speed up development and let designers and developers work together more smoothly. It's not just about simple layouts either; AI can help with animations, state management, and even accessibility features. This is a game changer for <a href=\"https://medium.com/@electrophile172/kotlin-ai-framework-koog-7c51d69abc5f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Android app creation</a>.</p><h3>Kotlin Multiplatform for Cross-Platform AI Solutions</h3><p>Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) lets you write code that runs on multiple platforms, like Android, iOS, and the web. This is super useful for AI because you can share your AI models and logic across different apps. For example, you could build an AI-powered image recognition feature once and use it in both your Android and iOS apps. This saves time and effort, and it also helps ensure consistency across platforms. Demystifying <a href=\"https://medium.com/@electrophile172/kotlin-ai-framework-koog-7c51d69abc5f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KMP builds</a> is a must for any serious cross-platform project.</p><blockquote>Using Kotlin Multiplatform, developers can create a single codebase for their AI-powered features, significantly reducing development time and maintenance costs. This approach ensures consistency and efficiency across various platforms, making it easier to deliver innovative AI solutions to a wider audience.</blockquote><p>Here are some benefits of using Kotlin Multiplatform for AI:</p><ul><li>Code reuse across platforms</li><li>Faster development cycles</li><li>Consistent user experience</li><li>Reduced maintenance costs</li></ul><p>It's still early days, but the potential for AI-powered Kotlin development is huge. As AI models get better and tools become more refined, we'll see even more innovative applications emerge.</p><p>Imagine telling a computer what you want, and it just builds it for you, like magic! That's what turning your ideas into Kotlin code with AI is all about. It's super helpful for making apps and programs faster.

(Note to readers: Please don't actually do this—we'll get to the responsible part later.)\"  </p><p>I clicked through the signup with the enthusiasm of someone who's never received an unexpected cloud bill, added my card (while mentally calculating how many months of ramen $300 could buy me as a backup plan), and was immediately rewarded with my shiny new GCP playground.  </p><p>With my new GCP account ready, I turned to the documentation like a pirate consulting a treasure map.

That’s the power of Large Language Model (LLM) agents—AI systems that are transforming how developers work. From automating repetitive tasks to enhancing decision-making, LLM agents are becoming essential in modern development.</p><p>This article explores what LLM agents are, how they function, and why they matter for developers looking to streamline their workflows.</p><p><strong>After reading this article, you’ll:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Grasp the basics of LLM agents and their role in development.</p></li><li><p>Understand how language models drive agent capabilities.</p></li><li><p>Learn how LLM agents work and make decisions.</p></li><li><p>Discover why choosing the right LLM is crucial and what the future holds.</p></li></ul><p>LLM agents are advanced AI systems built on large language models, such as GPT-4 or Llama, designed to handle more than just text generation. These agents excel at understanding context, allowing them to interpret complex instructions or queries with ease. They can plan and act autonomously, breaking tasks into manageable steps and executing them without constant supervision. Additionally, LLM agents integrate with external tools, connecting to APIs, databases, or other services to fetch or process data. By reasoning through problems and adapting to new information, they function like virtual assistants, helping developers tackle diverse tasks efficiently.</p><h2><strong>The Role of Language Models in LLM Agents</strong></h2><p>The core of every LLM agent is a language model, a neural network trained on vast datasets to process and generate human-like text. This model enables the agent to parse natural language inputs, such as a request to schedule a meeting, and maintain context across multiple interactions, ensuring continuity in tasks. By generating coherent responses or actions, the language model empowers the agent to assist with complex developer needs, like querying a database for specific data. The quality of the language model directly impacts the agent’s performance, with stronger models handling nuanced or ambiguous requests more effectively than weaker ones.</p><h2><strong>Text-Based Diagram: LLM Agent Task Flow</strong></h2><p>Here’s a simple representation of how an LLM agent processes a task:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This shows the agent receiving a request, reasoning with its language model, planning steps, and acting via tools to deliver a result.</p><p>LLM agents operate through a structured cycle that makes them powerful tools for developers:</p><ol><li><p>: The agent receives a request, such as “Find recent articles on AI trends.”</p></li><li><p>: Using its language model, the agent interprets the request and considers relevant context.</p></li><li><p>: It breaks the task into actionable steps, like searching the web, filtering results, and summarizing findings.</p></li><li><p>: The agent executes these steps, often by calling external tools, such as a search API.</p></li><li><p>: Finally, it delivers the result, like a concise summary of articles.</p></li></ol><p>This cycle allows agents to automate tasks like generating reports or fetching data, freeing developers to focus on creative problem-solving.</p><h2><strong>How Language Models Guide Decisions</strong></h2><p>The decision-making ability of LLM agents stems from their language model’s capacity to analyze options and predict outcomes. These agents can prioritize tasks, deciding which step to tackle first in a complex process, or handle errors by determining how to recover from issues like a failed API call. They also make contextual choices, selecting relevant data based on the user’s intent.</p><p>However, the quality of these decisions depends on the model’s training and fine-tuning. A well-tuned model aligns closely with developer needs, such as focusing on performance metrics, while a generic model might produce less targeted results.</p><h2><strong>Why Choosing the Right LLM Matters</strong></h2><p>Selecting the appropriate LLM is critical for an agent’s success, as different models offer varying strengths. Advanced models like GPT-4 excel at handling complex, nuanced tasks, while smaller models like BERT are better suited for simpler operations.</p><p>Speed and accuracy also play a role—lightweight models process requests quickly but may sacrifice precision, whereas heavier models deliver reliable results at the cost of speed. Additionally, computational costs can be significant for powerful models, impacting project budgets.</p><p>Some LLMs are fine-tuned for specific domains, such as coding or finance, which can improve performance for targeted tasks. Developers must weigh these factors to choose an LLM that aligns with their project’s goals.</p><p>Despite their potential, LLM agents face several hurdles that developers must navigate. Their non-deterministic nature can lead to inconsistent outputs, where the same input produces varying results. Using structured prompts and validation tools can help ensure reliability.</p><p>Additionally, LLMs often struggle with mathematical calculations or complex logical reasoning, requiring integration with specialized tools like calculator APIs to compensate. Privacy is another concern, as sending sensitive data to external APIs can pose risks; opting for local or private LLMs mitigates this issue.</p><p>Finally, running advanced models can be resource-intensive, so developers must balance model capabilities with budget constraints to achieve cost-effective solutions.</p><h2><strong>What’s Next for LLM Agents?</strong></h2><p>The future of LLM agents holds exciting possibilities for developers:</p><ul><li><p>: Focused agents for specific tasks, like debugging or UI design, will emerge.</p></li><li><p>: Agents will connect seamlessly with tools like IDEs or CI/CD pipelines.</p></li><li><p>: Advances in training will enhance decision-making accuracy.</p></li><li><p>: Open-source and lightweight models will make agents more widely available.</p></li></ul><p>These trends suggest a future where LLM agents become integral to development, enabling faster innovation and more efficient workflows.</p><p>LLM agents are redefining how developers approach work, offering intelligent automation and decision-making capabilities. By understanding their components, functionality, and challenges, you can harness these tools to streamline tasks and boost productivity.</p><p>Whether you’re automating data analysis or exploring new workflows, LLM agents are a glimpse into the future of development.

Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.</p><p><strong>The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital Age</strong></p><p>Modern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.</p><p>I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.</p><p>Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.</p><p><strong>Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency Safety</strong></p><p>The framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.</p><p>This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.</p><p>Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.</p><p><strong>Framework Design: Layered and Resilient Defenses</strong></p><p>Beyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization</strong>\nThe principle of \"Never trust user input\" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.<p>\nIt also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.</p>\nMy tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This \"secure by default\" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Session Management and Authentication</strong>\nSecure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.<p>\nWhile it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).</p>\nI observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.</p></li><li><p>\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Dependency Management</strong>\nContemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.\nThe framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error Handling and Information Concealment</strong>\nExposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.</p></li><li><p>\nHTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).</p></li></ol><p><strong>Practical Security Considerations in Implementation</strong></p><p>When implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong>: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.</li><li><strong>Audits and Penetration Testing</strong>: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.</li><li>: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.</li><li><strong>Timely Dependency Updates</strong>: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Log Monitoring</strong>: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.</li></ul><p>This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.</p><p><strong>Comparative Analysis with Other Frameworks</strong></p><p>Compared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.</p><p>When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.</p><p>Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Security as a Continuous Endeavor</strong></p><p>In the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.</p><p>This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.</p><p>As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.</p>","contentLength":8578,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dynamic Fluent Interface for API calls (Powered by JS Proxy)","url":"https://dev.to/smlka/dynamic-fluent-interface-for-api-calls-powered-by-js-proxy-4084","date":1751197757,"author":"Andrey Smolko","guid":175120,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When working with REST APIs, having a clean, expressive client can greatly simplify how you write code.

Thread safety, deadlocks, and race conditions gave me headaches. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust-based async framework that I truly understood the charm of modern asynchronous programming.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Revolutionary Thinking of Async Programming\n</h2><p>Traditional synchronous programming models are like single-lane roads where only one car can pass at a time. Asynchronous programming, however, is like an intelligent traffic management system that allows multiple cars to efficiently use the same road at different time intervals.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example clearly demonstrates the advantages of async programming. Through the  macro, we can execute multiple async operations concurrently, reducing total time from 350ms to about 200ms—a performance improvement of over 40%.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deep Understanding of Async Runtime\n</h2><p>This framework is built on the Tokio async runtime, the most mature async runtime in the Rust ecosystem. It uses a concept called \"green threads\" or \"coroutines\" that can run many async tasks on a small number of OS threads.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Async Stream Processing: Handling Large Amounts of Data\n</h2><p>When processing large amounts of data, async streams are a very powerful tool. They allow us to process data in a streaming fashion without loading all data into memory.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Comparison: Async vs Sync\n</h2><p>To intuitively demonstrate the advantages of async programming, I conducted a comparison test:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In my tests, the synchronous approach required 450ms (100+150+200), while the async approach only needed 200ms (the longest operation time), achieving a performance improvement of over 55%.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Summary: The Value of Async Programming\n</h2><p>Through deep learning and practice with this framework's async programming patterns, I deeply appreciate the value of async programming:</p><ol><li>: Through concurrent execution, significantly reduced overall response time</li><li>: Better utilization of system resources, supporting higher concurrency</li><li>: Non-blocking operations make applications more responsive</li><li>: Async patterns make systems easier to scale to high-concurrency scenarios</li></ol><p>Async programming is not just a technical approach, but a shift in thinking.

In particular, how many key presses each type can endure before showing signs of wear?</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at both types and explore which one truly stands the test of time.</p><p><strong>Mechanical Keyboards: Built to Last</strong></p><p>Mechanical keyboards are known for their distinctive switches under each key. These switches come in many forms — tactile, linear, clicky — and each offers a different typing experience. What unites them is their impressive lifespan: most mechanical switches are rated for <strong>50 to 100 million keystrokes</strong> per key.</p><p>This level of durability makes mechanical keyboards especially popular among gamers, coders, and writers who rely on them for hours each day. They also tend to offer consistent feedback over time, which can improve typing speed and accuracy.</p><p><strong>Membrane Keyboards: Quiet and Affordable</strong></p><p>Membrane keyboards operate on a simpler mechanism: a rubber or silicone dome beneath the key completes a circuit when pressed. They're quieter, lighter, and typically less expensive than their mechanical counterparts.</p><p>However, membrane keyboards usually have a much lower lifespan — often around <strong>5 to 10 million keystrokes</strong> per key. Over time, the rubber dome can wear down, causing keys to feel mushy or become less responsive.</p><p><strong>Understanding Real-World Usage</strong></p><p>Of course, the rated lifespan is only one part of the story. The actual wear on a keyboard depends heavily on usage patterns. Gamers might pound the WASD keys, while writers hammer away at letters, spaces, and punctuation. Over time, some keys will experience significantly more pressure than others.</p><p>Some users, especially programmers and professional typists, tend to put much more strain on specific keys — like the spacebar, enter, or shift. Tools like a simple <a href=\"https://doubleclicktest.com/keyboard-counter.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keyboard counter</a> have made it possible to observe which keys receive the most use, offering real insight into wear patterns that aren’t always visible on the surface.</p><p><strong>Other Factors That Affect Lifespan</strong></p><p>Key switches aren’t the only part of a keyboard subject to wear. Several other elements impact how long your keyboard will stay in top shape:</p><ol><li><p> PBT tends to last longer and resist shine better than ABS.</p></li><li><p> Mechanical boards often have sturdier construction.</p></li><li><p> Heavy typists may shorten the lifespan of any board.</p></li><li><p> Dust, spills, and grime can all accelerate decline.</p></li></ol><p>Mechanical keyboards usually win in most of these areas, especially premium models with hot-swappable switches or metal backplates.</p><p><strong>So, Which Should You Choose?</strong></p><p><strong>So, which keyboard is better?</strong> The answer depends on what you value most. If longevity, customizability, and consistent performance are priorities,  clearly come out ahead. They're built to endure millions of presses and maintain their feel over time. </p><p>On the other hand, if you prefer something quiet, lightweight, and inexpensive for occasional use,  still have their place. </p><p>In the end, the better keyboard is the one that best fits how — and how much — you type.</p>","contentLength":3148,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Application and Evolution of Design Patterns in Modern Programming Modernization of Classic Patterns（1751196525967300）","url":"https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/application-and-evolution-of-design-patterns-in-modern-programming-modernization-of-classic-265e","date":1751196526,"author":"member_8d9a8f47","guid":175116,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

Unlike traditional networking, where control and data planes are tightly coupled, SDN separates these layers, offering unprecedented flexibility, programmability, and efficiency. This shift allows network administrators to manage the entire network through software applications, reducing complexity and enabling faster innovation.</p><p>In this article, we will explore what SDN is, how it works, and the key benefits it brings to modern network infrastructures.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Software-Defined Networking?\n</h2><p>SDN is a networking paradigm that decouples the network control logic from the underlying hardware, allowing centralized management of network resources. The core idea is to separate the control plane — which makes decisions about where traffic is sent — from the data plane, which actually forwards traffic to the selected destination.</p><p>This separation allows for programmable network management, making it easier to adjust network behavior dynamically, automate configuration, and respond rapidly to changing business needs.</p><p>An SDN architecture typically includes three layers:</p><ul><li> Contains business applications and network services that communicate their requirements to the SDN controller.\n</li><li> The SDN controller acts as the brain of the network, translating application requirements into network configurations and policies.\n</li><li> Comprises the physical or virtual switches and routers that handle the data forwarding.</li></ul><p>The SDN controller uses protocols such as OpenFlow to communicate with network devices, enabling centralized control and visibility.</p><ol><li><strong>Centralized Network Management:</strong> SDN controllers provide a single pane of glass to configure and monitor the entire network.\n</li><li><strong>Improved Network Agility:</strong> Network administrators can quickly adapt to changing needs without manual reconfiguration of devices.\n</li><li> By using commodity hardware with centralized control, organizations can reduce CAPEX and OPEX.\n</li><li> SDN enables dynamic security policies and segmentation to isolate threats and control traffic flow more effectively.\n</li><li><strong>Automation and Programmability:</strong> Network tasks can be automated through software, reducing human errors and speeding up deployments.\n</li><li> SDN supports rapid scaling of network resources to meet growing demands.</li></ol><ul></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Cisco Products Supporting SDN\n</h2><p>Cisco is a global leader in networking technology and offers a comprehensive portfolio of SDN-enabled products that help organizations modernize their network infrastructure. Some notable Cisco solutions include:</p><ul><li><strong>Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI):</strong> A policy-driven SDN solution for data centers that simplifies operations and accelerates application deployment.\n</li><li> A centralized network management and automation platform that leverages SDN principles to provide visibility, control, and assurance across enterprise networks.\n</li><li><strong>Cisco Nexus Series Switches:</strong> High-performance switches designed to support SDN and virtualization with programmability and scalability features.\n</li></ul><p>These products enable businesses to implement SDN architectures effectively, improving network agility, security, and operational efficiency.</p><p>For more information about Cisco's SDN offerings, visit <a href=\"https://amnshabake.ir\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amn Shabake Gostar</a>, your trusted partner for Cisco networking solutions.</p><p>Software-Defined Networking is transforming the way networks are designed, deployed, and managed. By separating control from hardware and enabling programmability, SDN offers organizations greater flexibility, efficiency, and security.

Turns out, it clearly mentioned:</p><p>“For Google OAuth we use . You'll need:</p><ul><li> in </li><li> in </li></ul><p>For these secrets, just message us on Slack. We'll take care of the rest.”</p><p>And guess who didn’t read that? 🙃</p><p>I messaged Aboo (our org admin), only to learn the files were on his old laptop. So I hopped on texts with Hardik, and we decided: okay, let’s set it up from scratch — new OAuth credentials, new keys, new everything.</p><p>We also geeked out a bit on why OAuth fails sometimes. Quick tip: OAuth credentials can expire if they’re rotated or due to change in Google's policies. So if you’re facing weird auth issues — always check your keys first.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Welcome to the World of RTL Languages\n</h2><p>Just when I thought I was done with multi-language support, Aboo said:</p><p><em>“We also need to support RTL languages — like Arabic and Hebrew.”</em></p><p>I’m going to be honest here — I barely manage English and Hindi. Arabic? Never seen, never typed.</p><p>So I started by detecting if the selected locale was RTL, and wrapped my widgets using . At first, I was manually adjusting everything. It felt huge, and the UI started looking weird to me.</p><p>But here’s the cool part — turns out Flutter handles RTL automatically if your localization setup is right. That discovery? Literal joy.</p><p>I used DeepSeek to auto-translate for testing (yes, AI is now my bestie), and then came Manar — who joined the RTL-support Slack group and saved my life. She pointed out mistakes that I couldn’t even spot because… I literally couldn’t read the script 😅</p><p><em>“Oh this looks like that word… maybe?”</em></p><p>She explained things patiently and I learned a lot — not just about the languages, but about designing with empathy for users you don’t share a language with.</p><p>Also added language-specific screenshots — earlier the UI changed, but the screenshots stubbornly stayed in English. Fixed ✅</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Markdown Mayhem: My Widget Had a Meltdown\n</h2><p>Now let’s talk about the Interactive Book section.</p><div><pre><code>EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY:\nFailed assertion: line 267 pos 12: '_inlines.isEmpty': is not true.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Malformed markdown content</p><p>Null or improperly formatted data</p><p>To address this, I started writing a function to sanitize Markdown input:</p><div><pre><code>String _sanitizeMarkdown(String content) {\n  debugPrint('Sanitizing markdown content...');\n  final originalLength = content.length;\n\n  content = content.replaceAll(RegExp(r'[\\x00-\\x09\\x0B-\\x1F]'), '');\n  content = content.replaceAll(RegExp(r'\\r\\n?'), '\\n');\n\n  content = content\n      .replaceAllMapped(RegExp(r'(?&lt;!\\*)\\*\\*([^\\*]+)(?!\\*\\*)'), (m) =&gt; '**${m[1]}**')\n      .replaceAllMapped(RegExp(r'(?&lt;!_)__([^_]+)(?!__)'), (m) =&gt; '__${m[1]}__')\n      .replaceAllMapped(RegExp(r'(?&lt;!`)`([^`]+)(?!`)'), (m) =&gt; '`${m[1]}`');\n\n  if (content.length != originalLength) {\n    debugPrint('Sanitization changed content length from $originalLength to ${content.length}');\n  }\n\n  return content;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>It’s not perfect yet, but it’s helping. Slowly taming the Markdown monster 🐉</p><p>I also peeked into pubspec.yaml and noticed:</p><div><pre><code>http: any\nmarkdown: any\nwebview_flutter: any\n\ndependency_overrides:\n  mime: ^1.0.1\n  plugin_platform_interface: ^2.1.2\n  markdown:\n    git: https://github.com/dart-lang/markdown.git\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Using  and  isn't best practice—could be contributing to instability. Tried a few changes, but didn’t get far (yet).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  “Hey… How Often Do You Talk to Your Mentors?”\n</h2><p>Now for the jump scare of the week.</p><p>I got a message from Aboo:</p><p><em>“Hey, how often do you discuss the project with your mentors? Do you keep meeting notes?”</em></p><p>But later Hardik clarified it was for internal process.

That changed when I decided to build something from scratch — not to learn, but to learn by building.</p><p>That's how AuraEdition was born — a full-stack, luxury vehicle e-commerce web app built using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. Over the course of 4 weeks, I went from wireframing and database design to frontend, backend, and admin panel development — with no framework, no templates, and no shortcuts.</p><p>This was my last PHP project before moving to other stacks, and I chose the luxury vehicle niche because it presented unique challenges: high-value products, image-heavy listings, and the need for a premium user experience. My goal was simple: learn end-to-end development while building something portfolio-worthy.</p><p>AuraEdition is a premium e-commerce platform designed for buying and selling luxury vehicles. It's built to mimic the functionality of a high-end marketplace with a sleek, modern aesthetic that matches the caliber of the products being sold.</p><p>From a user's perspective, the site allows for browsing listings of cars with filtering by make, model, and price, adding items to a cart or wishlist, registering and managing profiles, and securely placing orders with automatic invoice generation.</p><p>Admins have full control through a custom dashboard, including viewing sales analytics powered by Chart.js, managing vehicle listings with multi-image uploads, tracking and updating orders in real-time, and handling user accounts and permissions.</p><p>The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and designed in Figma for responsiveness and that premium feel. The backend runs on pure procedural PHP with MySQL and secure user sessions, while most UI interactions are powered by AJAX for a seamless user experience.</p><p>Security was a major focus throughout development. I implemented CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention through prepared statements, bcrypt password hashing, and proper session management to ensure user data stays protected.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Week 1 – Planning &amp; Prototyping\n</h3><p>The first week was all about laying the foundation. I created a Notion Kanban board and backlog to manage tasks iteratively, treating this like a real product development cycle.</p><p>I spent considerable time in Figma designing key screens: the homepage, vehicle listings, product details pages, and the admin dashboard. This upfront design work proved invaluable later when I needed to make quick UI decisions.</p><p>Database planning was crucial. I mapped out the initial schema, including tables for users, vehicles, orders, makes, models, and their relationships. I also made the architectural decision to avoid PHP frameworks — I wanted to understand how everything worked under the hood.</p><p>Finally, I defined clear user flows and core features, mapping out everything from browsing and filtering to the complete checkout process.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Week 2 – Frontend Development\n</h3><p>Week two was all about bringing the designs to life. I coded the homepage, vehicle listing pages, and detailed product views, ensuring each page felt cohesive and premium.</p><p>I implemented search functionality, category filters, and pagination at the database level for optimal performance. During this week, I made the decision to transition from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS for better design flexibility and a more modern approach.</p><p>Building reusable components like vehicle cards, navigation bars, and category boxes taught me the importance of consistent, maintainable code. Every page was built mobile-responsive from day one — no afterthoughts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Week 3 – Backend, Auth, and Checkout Logic\n</h3><p>The third week brought the real complexity. I built the entire user authentication system using sessions and proper password hashing, creating login, register, and logout functionality with AJAX for smooth user interactions.</p><p>The checkout system was particularly challenging. I had to create a seamless flow from cart to order completion, including subtotal calculations, address management, and order processing. This required building robust orders and order_items database tables and implementing the complete purchasing workflow.</p><p>Cart and wishlist functionality used a combination of sessions for guest users and database storage for registered users. I also integrated PHPMailer for automated order confirmations, adding that professional touch.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Week 4 – Admin Panel &amp; Final Touches\n</h3><p>The final week focused on the admin experience and polish. I created a comprehensive admin dashboard with key metrics like total orders, sales figures, and user analytics.</p><p>Developing full CRUD interfaces for vehicles, makes, and models taught me about proper data management and user permissions. Chart.js integration provided visual analytics that made the admin panel feel like a real business tool.</p><p>Order management was extensive — admins could view, update status, and filter orders by date ranges. The final days were spent on UI/UX polish, removing unused Bootstrap dependencies, and perfecting the overall experience.</p><p>This project fundamentally changed how I think about web development. I finally understood how frontend, backend, and database work together as a cohesive system rather than separate pieces.</p><p>Working iteratively — design a page, code it, connect it to the backend, test it, and move on — proved far more effective than trying to build everything at once. Building for users, even imaginary ones, forced me to focus on usability and user experience rather than just functionality.</p><p>The debugging skills I developed were invaluable. From foreign key constraint errors to session management bugs and AJAX issues, each problem taught me something new about how web applications really work.</p><p>Most importantly, I realized I don't need to master a framework to build something great — I just need to start building and figure things out as I go.</p><p>The journey wasn't smooth. I initially started with Bootstrap but had to switch to Tailwind CSS mid-project, which slowed me down initially but ultimately led to a better end result.</p><p>Designing a proper database structure without over-engineering it was surprisingly difficult. I had to balance normalization with performance and simplicity.</p><p>Image uploads with validation and multi-image support were trickier than expected. Handling file uploads securely while maintaining good user experience required careful consideration.</p><p>Keeping logic organized without a framework meant I had to think like a mini-architect, creating my own patterns for code organization and reusability.</p><p>I spent countless hours fixing bugs that turned out to be missing database indexes or simple typos. These frustrating moments taught me the importance of systematic debugging and proper error handling.</p><p>The hardest part was resisting the urge to fall back into tutorial mode when I got stuck. Pushing through these moments and finding solutions independently was where the real learning happened.</p><p>The complete project is available on GitHub with a detailed README that includes setup instructions, database schema, and usage examples. The repository demonstrates clean, well-documented code that other developers can learn from and build upon.</p><p>For those interested in seeing the application in action, I've included comprehensive screenshots and a detailed feature walkthrough in the repository documentation.</p><p>Now that AuraEdition is complete, I'm moving on to the MERN stack. My next stop is The Odin Project, where I'll rebuild similar applications using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js — and eventually learn Java with Spring Boot for enterprise-level development.</p><p>I'm also planning to build a real-time chat application to deepen my understanding of websockets, authentication, and state management. The goal is to continue building projects that challenge me and expand my technical capabilities.</p><p>AuraEdition taught me that I'm capable of building real products. Not MVPs. Not tutorials. Products. It's easy to feel like you're not progressing when all you do is consume content — but the minute I started building to learn, I accelerated faster than ever.</p><p>The confidence I gained from completing this project is immeasurable. Knowing that I can take an idea from concept to fully functional web application has fundamentally changed how I approach new challenges.</p><p>Whether you're stuck in tutorial hell or just unsure of where to start — build something. Choose a project that excites you, plan it out, and start coding. Struggle with it. Break things. Debug for hours. That's where the real magic happens, and that's where you'll discover what you're truly capable of creating.</p>","contentLength":8706,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Wisdom of Context Management Design Philosophy of Unified Data Flow and State Management（1751192873299400）","url":"https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/wisdom-of-context-management-design-philosophy-of-unified-data-flow-and-state-50nc","date":1751192874,"author":"member_f4f4c714","guid":175072,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.
