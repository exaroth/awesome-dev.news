Many users spend hours fixing robotic text that lacks personality and authentic brand voice. While AI write like human capabilities have improved, most tools still generate generic content that needs significant human touch-ups before publication. The latest AI platforms promise better results through advanced natural language processing and brand voice integration. Yet even these improved solutions can't fully replicate human creativity and nuance. Some newer tools are making progress by focusing on tone consistency and natural flow, but complete automation remains elusive. Understanding these limitations helps set realistic expectations - AI can enhance content creation, but skilled human editors remain essential for polished, engaging writing that resonates with readers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Current State of AI Content Generation\n</h2><p>AI writing technology has changed how businesses handle content creation. Teams looking for efficient content production methods need to understand what these tools can and cannot do to make smart choices about using them.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Understanding AI Writing Technology\n</h3><p>Large organizations are increasingly adopting AI for content creation, with estimates suggesting significant growth in AI-generated marketing messages over the next few years. These writing tools rely on advanced language models that learn from massive text databases to produce content that mimics human writing. They process language patterns and context to string together coherent sentences. Yet, since they lack true understanding, they sometimes miss the mark on conveying intended messages accurately.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Features of AI Writing Tools\n</h3><p>AI writing software typically includes several key components that determine how well it performs. Most platforms offer pre-made templates to guide content structure, which helps maintain consistency but often leads to writing that feels mechanical and repetitive. While these tools can handle basic SEO requirements like keyword placement, they frequently miss the subtle optimization techniques that come naturally to experienced writers.</p><p>Many marketing professionals find it challenging to maintain high-quality content when relying on AI tools. This happens because AI tends to generate safe, generic content that lacks personality and fresh perspectives. Though these platforms excel at creating quick first drafts, the resulting content often reads like a fill-in-the-blank exercise rather than an engaging piece tailored to specific audience needs. The key to success lies in using AI as a starting point, then adding human expertise to shape the content into something truly valuable for readers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Popular AI Writing Tools Analysis\n</h2><p>AI writing platforms have different strengths when creating human-sounding content. These tools share similar hurdles in generating text that requires minimal touch-ups before publishing.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ChatGPT and Its Limitations\n</h3><p>ChatGPT remains a popular option for quick content creation, though its output tends to lack substance and fresh perspectives. Many content teams find themselves spending extra hours adjusting ChatGPT-generated text to match their specific writing style. The tool handles basic factual content well but faces challenges producing engaging stories that keep readers interested and maintaining a steady voice throughout pieces.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Jasper AI Performance Review\n</h3><p>Jasper AI comes with more targeted content features than ChatGPT, yet users notice similar phrases and standard expressions showing up repeatedly. While it offers useful templates for various writing tasks, the finished pieces often read like they came from an assembly line, missing those crucial industry-specific details readers look for.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Copy.ai and Content Quality\n</h3><p>Copy.ai shines with shorter pieces, but struggles to maintain coherence in longer articles. This comparison shows how different AI writing tools stack up against key quality measures:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why AI-Generated Content Often Falls Short\n</h2><p>AI writing tools promise quick results, but their output typically needs extensive editing. Teams must recognize these limitations to properly handle the necessary content improvements.</p><p>Studies from Semrush reveal that 60% of marketing professionals find it difficult to create content that captures attention. AI writing tools make this problem worse since they generate predictable, cookie-cutter text without fresh perspectives. These systems draw from similar information pools, creating articles that mirror countless others online. Users of these tools end up publishing similar material across different websites, making it nearly impossible to grab readers' interest.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Lack of Brand Voice Integration\n</h3><p>AI write like human features still can't replicate authentic company voices because they miss essential nuances that define individual brands. Standard AI tools fail to incorporate industry jokes, specific references, and casual communication patterns that businesses use to build genuine connections with customers. Though some platforms offer tone adjustments, they only scratch the surface, resulting in content that sounds robotic or misaligned with the company's actual personality.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  SEO Optimization Challenges\n</h3><p>Simple AI writing solutions often miss the mark with keyword placement and content organization. Their attempts at incorporating search terms often feel forced, and they frequently miss chances to enhance semantic search performance. Content teams spend extra hours fixing these issues to satisfy search engines while keeping the text readable. Many content creators find themselves stuck between optimizing for rankings or natural flow - a choice they shouldn't have to make when using proper AI tools.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advancing Beyond Basic AI Writing\n</h2><p>Many AI writing tools fall short when creating authentic content, yet newer solutions successfully tackle common content creation challenges. These sophisticated platforms excel at preserving brand identity while producing text that reads smoothly and naturally.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Writness: A New Approach to AI Content\n</h3><p><a href=\"https://writness.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writness</a>) represents a significant step forward for AI write like human capabilities through its combination of intelligent language processing and brand profile integration. Instead of generating generic text like standard AI writers, Writness crafts articles that demonstrate genuine understanding of your business. The system studies your industry-specific language, writing preferences, and audience needs to generate content that authentically captures your voice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Brand Voice Integration Features\n</h3><p>The standout feature of Writness lies in its exceptional brand consistency across content pieces. Through careful analysis of your existing content and brand guidelines, the platform ensures each article perfectly reflects your company's distinct character. The integration of specialized industry terminology and adherence to your communication preferences results in content that connects meaningfully with readers while maintaining authenticity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Quality Comparison Analysis\n</h3><p>Recent testing between Writness and conventional AI writing tools reveals substantial improvements in both quality and readability. Research from Marketing Profs indicates marketers typically spend 3.5 hours editing AI-generated content. Writness users, however, report minimal editing requirements before publishing, significantly reducing time and resource investment. Advanced algorithms ensure natural keyword placement and fluid sentence construction, eliminating the mechanical feel often associated with AI-written material.</p><p><a href=\"https://writness.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writness</a>) successfully balances SEO requirements with natural writing flow. The platform grasps contextual nuances and creates meaningful connections between concepts, producing articles that captivate readers while achieving strong search rankings. This thoughtful approach eliminates the traditional conflict between optimizing for search engines and creating engaging human-readable content.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Choosing the Right AI Writing Solution\n</h2><p>AI writing software has flooded the market, yet results from these tools rarely match expectations. Most AI writers produce text needing heavy edits, wasting precious time rather than saving it. Standard AI platforms struggle to capture unique brand voices and create natural-sounding copy, resulting in dull content that readers simply skim past. The good news? Solutions like Writness prove that AI technology can actually deliver high-quality content when engineered with sophisticated language processing and brand personality integration. Through its focus on genuine communication styles and minimal editing needs, Writness enables companies to produce content that truly connects with readers while maintaining strong search rankings.</p><p>Teams looking to enhance their content output without compromising on quality will find that <a href=\"https://writness.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writness</a> strikes an ideal balance between speed and authenticity. This powerful platform helps organizations publish compelling, on-brand articles that achieve real business goals - all while making the entire process smoother and more efficient.</p>","contentLength":9275,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Navigating Software Development Problems: Strategies for Success in 2025","url":"https://dev.to/jetthoughts/navigating-software-development-problems-strategies-for-success-in-2025-3no2","date":1740315356,"author":"JetThoughts Dev","guid":9608,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Software development is always evolving, and with 2025 just around the corner, it's clear that developers face both exciting opportunities and tough challenges. From dealing with tight deadlines to keeping up with new technologies, the road can be bumpy. But don't worry—there are ways to make the journey smoother. This article digs into common software development problems and offers practical strategies to tackle them head-on.</p><ul><li>  Deadlines often fail due to unclear goals or changing requirements.</li><li>  Miscommunication can lead to costly mistakes in projects.</li><li>  Balancing new tech adoption with stability is a major challenge.</li><li>  Burnout in teams can derail even the best-laid plans.</li><li>  Writing scalable, secure, and maintainable code is more important than ever.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Root Causes of Software Development Problems\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Deadlines Often Go Wrong\n</h3><p>Deadlines fail for many reasons, but it usually boils down to poor planning. Teams often underestimate how long tasks will take. They also forget to account for unexpected delays. <strong>Rushing to meet a deadline can lead to sloppy work and technical debt.</strong></p><p>Here’s what contributes to deadline chaos:</p><ul><li>  Overpromising on timelines to impress stakeholders</li><li>  Ignoring risks or unknowns in the project scope</li><li>  Lack of buffer time for testing and debugging</li></ul><p>Want fewer deadline disasters? Build realistic schedules, and don’t skip risk planning.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Impact of Poor Communication\n</h3><p>Poor communication can sink even the best projects. If you’re not clear about expectations, things will go sideways fast. Miscommunication between product and engineering teams, for example, can lead to mismatched priorities.</p><p>Signs your team has a communication problem:</p><ul><li>  Conflicting interpretations of project goals</li><li>  Missed updates or critical information</li><li>  Frustrated team members working on overlapping tasks</li></ul><p><em>Clear and frequent communication</em> isn’t optional—it’s survival.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How Misaligned Goals Derail Projects\n</h3><p>Ever feel like everyone’s rowing in different directions? That’s what happens when goals don’t align. It creates confusion, wasted effort, and a lot of finger-pointing.</p><p>Common reasons for misaligned goals:</p><ol><li> Stakeholders and developers have different priorities.</li><li> Teams don’t revisit goals as the project evolves.</li><li> Lack of trust between departments.</li></ol><blockquote><p>When teams align their goals, they work smarter—not harder. Building trust between product and engineering teams can improve collaboration and productivity. Learn more.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Adapting to Emerging Technologies Without Losing Focus\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge of Staying Updated\n</h3><p>Technology moves fast. Sometimes it feels like there's a new framework or tool every week. <strong>Keeping up can feel like a full-time job.</strong> But ignoring it? That’s not an option. Falling behind means missing out on better ways to solve problems or even losing your edge in the job market.</p><p>Here’s how you can stay on top:</p><ul><li>  Set aside 30 minutes daily to read tech blogs or articles.</li><li>  Join online communities where developers discuss trends.</li><li>  Take short, focused courses on platforms like  or Coursera.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Balancing Innovation with Stability\n</h3><p>Chasing every shiny new thing can be dangerous. Teams often adopt new tech without considering its long-term stability. That’s when projects break, deadlines slip, and everyone gets frustrated.</p><p>To balance innovation with stability:</p><ol><li> Test new tools in small projects before rolling them out.</li><li> Keep a mix of proven tech and experimental tools in your stack.</li><li> Regularly review whether the tools you’re using still meet your needs.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Avoiding Overengineering in New Tech\n</h3><p>It’s easy to fall into the trap of overengineering. You pick a cutting-edge tool, and before you know it, you’re building something more complex than it needs to be. Overengineering wastes time and makes future maintenance a nightmare.</p><ul><li>  Focus on solving the problem, not showing off.</li><li>  Stick to the simplest solution that works.</li><li>  Regularly refactor to remove unnecessary complexity.</li></ul><blockquote><p>\"Sometimes, the best tech decision is sticking with what you already know works.\"</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Resilient Teams to Tackle Development Challenges\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Fostering Collaboration in Distributed Teams\n</h3><p>Working across time zones is tough. You’ve got one person starting their day while another is logging off. To keep everyone on the same page, <strong>clear communication protocols</strong> are a must. Use tools like Slack or Trello to track progress and avoid missteps. Regular team check-ins during overlapping hours also help bridge the gap. And don’t underestimate the value of video calls—they bring some much-needed face time to remote work.</p><blockquote><p>Pro tip: A little humor in team chats can go a long way in building camaraderie. Just don’t overdo it—nobody wants a stand-up comedian when deadlines are looming.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Role of Continuous Learning\n</h3><p>If your team isn’t learning, they’re falling behind. Encourage skill-sharing sessions where team members teach each other something new. Workshops, online courses, or even quick lunch-and-learn sessions can keep the team sharp. <strong>A learning-focused team is an adaptable team.</strong> Plus, it’s a great way to make everyone feel like their expertise matters.</p><p>Here’s a quick checklist to keep learning alive:</p><ol><li> Offer access to online learning platforms.</li><li> Schedule regular knowledge-sharing meetings.</li><li> Celebrate when someone learns a new skill and applies it.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Addressing Burnout in High-Pressure Environments\n</h3><p>Burnout is real, and it’s sneaky. One day your team’s fine; the next, they’re dragging. Keep an eye out for signs like missed deadlines or a drop in enthusiasm. The fix? Balance workloads and encourage breaks. Sometimes, the best productivity hack is just letting someone take a day off.</p><p>A quick table to manage workloads:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><p>By keeping things organized, you can avoid piling too much on one person. Remember, a well-rested team is a productive team.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Mastering the Art of Scalable and Secure Code\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls in Scalability\n</h3><p>Scalability isn't just about handling more users or data. It's about doing it without breaking a sweat—or your app. <strong>One common mistake? Overengineering.</strong> Teams often build for a future that never comes, wasting time and resources. Another trap is ignoring modular design. If your code is a tangled mess, scaling it is a nightmare.</p><p>Here’s how to avoid these pitfalls:</p><ul><li>  Start small but plan for growth. Use modular architecture from day one.</li><li>  Regularly test your system under load. Tools like JMeter can help.</li><li>  Keep an eye on database performance. Indexes and caching aren't optional.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Security Threats Developers Must Watch For\n</h3><p>Security threats evolve faster than you can say \"buffer overflow.\" You have to stay sharp. SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and insecure APIs are just a few of the usual suspects. <strong>Ignoring these is like leaving your front door wide open.</strong></p><ol><li> Validating all user inputs. No exceptions.</li><li> Encrypting sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.</li><li> Using libraries and frameworks that are actively maintained.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Writing Maintainable Code\n</h3><p>Maintainable code is your future self’s best friend. It’s not just about writing code that works; it’s about writing code that someone else—or you—can understand six months later.</p><ul><li>  Keep it simple. If you need a comment to explain it, rewrite it.</li><li>  Stick to coding standards. Consistency beats cleverness every time.</li><li>  Use version control religiously. It’s not just for backups; it’s for sanity.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Pro Tip: Modular design isn’t just for scalability; it’s a lifesaver for maintainability too.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Streamlining Development Processes for Better Outcomes\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Importance of Clear Requirements\n</h3><p>You can’t build a house without a blueprint, and software is no different. Clear requirements are your project’s foundation. They save time, reduce confusion, and keep everyone on the same page. <strong>Ambiguous requirements? Recipe for chaos.</strong></p><ul><li>  Involve stakeholders early and often.</li><li>  Use simple, jargon-free language.</li><li>  Break down goals into bite-sized, actionable tasks.</li></ul><p>Without clear requirements, you’re basically playing a guessing game—and losing.</p><p>Agile sounds like the golden ticket, right? But it’s not magic. When it’s done wrong, it’s just messy. Teams can spiral into chaos without proper structure or communication.</p><ol><li> Endless, aimless stand-ups.</li><li> Overloading sprints with too many tasks.</li><li> Ignoring retrospective feedback.</li></ol><p>Agile works best when you stay disciplined. Stick to the framework. Remember, <em>flexibility doesn’t mean anarchy.</em></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Optimizing Testing and Debugging Workflows\n</h3><p>Testing and debugging are like flossing your code—tedious, but essential. Skipping it? That’s how bugs creep in and ruin everything.</p><p>Here’s how to make it less painful:</p><ul><li>  Automate repetitive tests. Save your sanity.</li><li>  Prioritize high-risk areas first.</li><li>  Keep your test cases organized. No one likes digging through a mess.</li></ul><blockquote><p>A streamlined testing process doesn’t just catch bugs—it builds confidence in your code.</p></blockquote><p>By focusing on these areas, you’ll not only save time but also create software that doesn’t make users want to throw their laptops out the window.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Navigating the Complexities of User-Centric Design\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Meeting High User Expectations\n</h3><p>Users today want everything to feel personal. They expect apps and software to  them. This means predictive features, tailored recommendations, and seamless interactions. But here's the catch: adding these features can create performance headaches. Your app might feel slower, or bugs might pop up more often. The trick is to balance personalization with smooth functionality. Keep it smart, but keep it simple.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Role of Feedback in UI/UX\n</h3><p>If you're not asking your users what they think, you're missing out. Feedback is your secret weapon. It tells you what's working and what isn't. But don’t just collect it—act on it. Whether it’s a clunky button or a confusing menu, user feedback can point you in the right direction. And remember, feedback isn’t a one-time thing. Make it a regular part of your process.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Balancing Functionality with Simplicity\n</h3><p>Here’s the thing: more features don’t always mean a better product.  Think about the apps you love. They probably do a few things really well. Focus on making your core features shine. Sure, it’s tempting to add flashy extras, but don’t let them distract you from what your users actually need. Keep it clean, keep it clear.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Leveraging Tools and Automation to Solve Development Problems\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Choosing the Right Tools for Your Team\n</h3><p>Picking the right tools can feel like picking the right toppings for a pizza. Too many and it’s overwhelming. Too few, and you’re missing out.  Start by asking: What does your team actually need?</p><ul><li>: Is it project management, code review, or testing?</li><li>  Check compatibility: Does the tool play nice with your current tech stack?</li><li>  Don’t forget scalability: Will it still work when your team grows?</li></ul><p>A good tool should make your life easier, not harder. If it feels like you’re wrestling with it, it’s probably not the right fit.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Pros and Cons of Automation\n</h3><p>Automation is like a double-edged sword. It can save you tons of time, but if done wrong, it can waste resources. Here’s a quick breakdown:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Speeds up repetitive tasks</td><td>Can add unnecessary complexity</td></tr><tr><td>Setup can be time-consuming</td></tr><tr><td>Frees up time for creativity</td><td>Might not fit every team’s workflow</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Start small. Automate one or two tasks, like testing or deployment, and then build from there. Regularly check if the automation is still doing its job. If it’s not, tweak or scrap it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Avoiding Tool Overload in Development\n</h3><p>More tools don’t always mean better results. In fact, juggling too many can slow you down. Here’s how to avoid tool overload:</p><ol><li>: Are you using all of them, or are some collecting dust?</li><li>: If two tools do the same thing, pick the better one.</li><li>: Your team has to use these tools every day. Make sure they’re on board.</li></ol><blockquote><p>A cluttered toolbox leads to a cluttered workflow. Keep it simple, and your team will thank you.</p></blockquote><p>The right tools and automation can be game-changers. They help you work smarter, not harder. Just remember: tools are there to support you, not complicate things.</p><p>Using tools and automation can really help fix problems in software development. By streamlining tasks, teams can work faster and focus on what matters most.

This happens because JavaScript runs on a single thread by default, causing a bad user experience. Users can't interact and have to wait until the task finishes. This problem can be solved using web workers. In this article, we will discuss what web workers are, why they are useful, and how to use them with a practical example by building an image compression application. Exciting, right? Let's get started.</p><p>Web Workers let JavaScript run tasks in the background <strong>without blocking the main thread</strong>, which keeps your UI smooth and responsive. You can create them using the Web Workers API, which takes two parameters:  and . Here is a simple example of creating a web worker.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As mentioned earlier, web workers run tasks in the background. Here are a few reasons to use them</p><ul><li><p>Prevents page lag during heavy computations</p></li><li><p>Handles large data processing efficiently</p></li><li><p>Improves performance for complex web applications</p></li></ul><ol><li><p>The main thread  and gives it a task</p></li><li><p>The worker <strong>handles the task in the background</strong></p></li><li><p>When finished, it  to the main thread</p></li></ol><p>Alright, now we know what a web worker is, why to use them, and how they work. But that's not enough, right? So let's build the image compression application and see how to use web workers in practice.</p><p>Create a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS</p><div><pre><code>npx create-next-app@latest  web-worker-with-example\n\nweb-worker-with-example\n</code></pre></div><p>To compress images in the browser, we will use the  npm library to encode and decode WebP images. This library is powered by WebAssembly, so let's install it.</p><p>Great, our project setup is complete. In the next section, we will create a worker script to manage image compression.</p><p>A worker script is a JavaScript or TypeScript file that contains the code to handle worker message events.</p><p>Create an <code>imageCompressionWorker.ts</code> file inside the  folder and add the following code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, we import the  and  methods from the  library and use the worker global scope, , to listen for messages from the main thread.</p><p>When a message arrives, we get the image file and options, then compress the image by first decoding and then encoding it with the quality option. Finally, we use  to send the compressed image blob back to the main thread. If there's an error, we handle it and send the error message back using .</p><p>The worker script is ready. In the next section, we will build the Imagelist component, update the styles, update the page, and use the worker script to handle the compression.</p><p>Before we start, let's update the  file with the following content and remove the default styling.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Create a  in the  folder and add the following code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The ImageList component takes one prop, , which is a list of . It then displays the original and compressed images, showing their size and providing a download option for the compressed images.</p><p>Next, update the  with the following code, and let's go through the parts together.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>First, we import the hooks and the ImageList component, along with ImgData for type.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, we create a ref to hold the worker instance because we don't want to create the worker repeatedly with each re-render. We also want to avoid re-rendering the component if the worker instance changes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the useEffect, we are initializing the worker instance by using the <code>imageCompressionWorker.ts</code> worker script we created earlier.</p><blockquote><p>We use the URL API with . This makes the path relative to the current script instead of the HTML page. This way, the bundler can safely optimize, like renaming, because otherwise, the  URL might point to a file not managed by the bundler, stopping it from making assumptions. Read more <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker#url\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Once the worker is initialized, we listen for messages from it. When we receive a message, we extract the id, blob, and error, then update the images state with the new values.</p><p>Finally, we clean up the worker when the component unmounts.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To manage image file uploads, we use the  method. This method listens for the  event of the file input, processes the files, and sends them to the worker for compression.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, render the elements the textarea, image input, and image list.</p><ul><li><p> The user picks images using the file input, which makes the component create object URLs and mark each image as \"compressing.\"</p></li><li><p> The component sends each image file (with options) to the Web Worker.</p></li><li><ul><li> At the same time, the user can type in the text area, showing that the UI is not blocked.</li><li> The worker compresses the image in the background.</li></ul></li><li><p> When compression is done, the worker sends the result back to the component, which updates the UI with the compressed image while the text area keeps working smoothly.</p></li></ul><p>Great, everything is set up. In the next section, we will run the application and see how the web worker works.</p><p>Web workers are a great tool to improve application performance. By using Web Workers, you ensure <strong>faster, smoother, and more responsive applications</strong>. However, they should not be overused and should only be used when necessary. Also, check browser support, which is currently about 98% globally.

Among them, I identified areas that were confusing or required further clarification. This is the first in a series of posts where I’ll review incorrect answers from my SQL practice problems.</p><p>Before diving in, I’ll start by explaining the purpose of using JOINs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Use the JOIN Function in SQL\n</h2><p>The JOIN function is used to combine information scattered across different tables into a single dataset to retrieve the desired data.</p><p>For example, imagine one table contains \"customer information\" (e.g., name, customer ID), and another table holds \"order information\" (e.g., order ID, customer ID, order date). If I want to know \"which customers placed orders and when,\" how would I approach this?</p><p>I can connect the customer table and the order table using the common key, , through a JOIN, allowing me to view both the customer’s name and order date together in one result. If the customer table is called the  and the order table is , use <code>customer.customer_id = order.customer_id</code> retrieves only the rows where  matches in both tables. This effectively returns the intersection of the two tables—only the overlapping data.</p><ul><li>You need to generate a report of each employee’s salary grade, which is stored in the  table. The report should include the employee’s job title, department name, hire date, salary, and salary grade.</li></ul><ol><li><p>The  table does not contain .</p><ul><li><code>employees e JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id</code>: I use the employee’s  to fetch the  from the  table.</li></ul></li><li><p>The  table does not include .</p></li></ol><div><pre><code>- `employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id`: I use the employee’s `department_id` to retrieve the `department_name` from the `departments` table.\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>I needed to consider how to use the  and  fields in the  table to assign grades based on an employee’s salary. I couldn’t rely on the typical equi join (joining with ), which I’ve been accustomed to using.</li></ol><div><pre><code>- I realized that I need to fetch only the rows where the `salary` falls between `lowest_sal` and `highest_sal`. If I want to include employees whose salaries fall outside any defined range, I should use a `LEFT JOIN`. Using a plain `JOIN` (which defaults to `INNER JOIN`) would exclude employees whose salaries don’t fit any range, as those rows with NULL values would be omitted from the output.\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>```sql\nSELECT e.last_name, j.job_title, d.department_name, e.hire_date, e.salary, jg.grade_level\nFROM employees e\nJOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id\nJOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id\nLEFT JOIN job_grades jg ON e.salary BETWEEN jg.lowest_sal AND jg.highest_sal;\n\n```\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>This problem initially confused me because I had primarily used equi joins to solve problems. It turned out to be a valuable opportunity to learn more about non-equi joins.\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Some employees report to other employees as their managers (supervisors). Query the employees’ manager IDs, manager names, employee names, and employee IDs. If an employee does not report to a manager,  you must still include that information in the output, and the manager’s name should be displayed in uppercase.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Since the problem specifies, “If there are employees without a reporting manager, include that information as well,” I need to include employees with  as NULL in the results. Using a plain  (which defaults to ) would exclude employees without managers, as it only returns matching rows. Therefore, I must use  to ensure all employees are included.</p><p>Here’s another valid version:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Output the department name and employee count for departments with five or more employees, sorted by employee count in descending order.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I initially got this wrong because I performed the grouping before joining the tables. I need to join the tables first to establish the connection, then group and filter the results.</p><ul><li>Query the total number of employees working as managers.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Quick review of primary key and foreign key\n</h3><p>Databases store data across multiple tables. To connect data between tables, I use a common value called a “key,” which can be thought of as a column in a table. A <strong>primary key (Primary Key)</strong> uniquely identifies each row (record) in a table. A <strong>foreign key (Foreign Key)</strong> is a column in one table that references the primary key in another table (or the same table). “Referencing a key” means that a foreign key in one table points to or connects to a primary key in another (or the same) table. </p><p>[EER Diagram of the database]</p><p>I can use MySQL Workbench’s Reverse Engineer feature to create an EER diagram and examine the relationships between tables. By observing the four lines connected to the  table in the diagram, I can identify which columns in the  table are linked to columns in other tables.</p><p>Here, the  I need isn’t connected to any other table’s key. Instead,  references the  within the  table itself. Therefore, I need to use a self-join.</p><p>Every employee has an , and managers do too. To query employees working as managers, I can write:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> is the alias for the manager table, and  is the alias for the employee table. When joining the manager table () with the employee table (), <code>e1.employee_id = e2.manager_id</code> means it retrieves only the rows where the manager table’s  matches the employee table’s .</li></ul><p>Here’s another query that produces the same result:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The difference lies in the  clause and the  part. The logical relationship remains the same, so the results are identical. However, conventionally, placing the “subject (manager)” in the  clause and the “dependent (employee)” in the  clause is more readable and aligns with standard practices.</p><p>Conversely, if the logical relationship changes, the query results will differ. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This query implies that  (employee) references  (manager). “Reference” means a column in one table points to or connects to a column in another (or the same) table. Here,  (foreign key) references  (primary key) in the  table, forming a “self-referencing relationship.”</p><p>A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table and does not reference data in other tables—it is only referenced by foreign keys. A primary key does not reference a foreign key; rather, a foreign key references a primary key. In the EER diagram, the self-referencing relationship between  and  confirms this connection.</p><p>I used to interpret the JOIN as simply “fetching rows where they match,” but this review has helped me gain a clearer understanding of 'referencing' in joining tables. </p>","contentLength":6571,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Full Stack Security Essentials: Preventing CSRF, Clickjacking, and Ensuring Content Integrity in JavaScript","url":"https://dev.to/wils3b/full-stack-security-essentials-preventing-csrf-clickjacking-and-ensuring-content-integrity-in-4paf","date":1740314523,"author":"Wilson Gouanet","guid":9603,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s web development landscape, security is more than a buzzword—it’s a necessity. As full stack developers, we face a wide range of threats, from backend vulnerabilities to client-side exploits. In this article, we’ll explore three critical areas of JavaScript security: CSRF, clickjacking, and content integrity. We’ll discuss what each threat entails and provide practical tips on preventing them from both Node.js and in the browser environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)\n</h2><p>CSRF is an attack where a malicious website tricks a users browser into performing unwanted actions on a trusted site where the user is authenticated. This can lead to unexpected changes, unauthorized transactions, or data exposure.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  On the Node.js (Server-Side) End\n</h4><ul><li> Use middleware (e.g., csurf in Express.js) to generate unique tokens for each session or form submission. Verify these tokens on every state-changing request.</li></ul><p>Example using Express.js with csurf:</p><div><pre><code>npm  csurf cookie-parser\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  In the Browser (Client-Side)\n</h4><ul><li><p> Set your cookies with the SameSite attribute to Lax or Strict to prevent them from being sent along with cross-domain requests.</p></li><li><p> When making AJAX requests, include custom headers (like X-Requested-With) and validate them on the server to help identify legitimate requests.</p></li></ul><p>Clickjacking involves tricking a user into clicking on a disguised UI element, often hidden or overlaid by another element, which can lead to unintended actions like authorizing an action, sharing data, or even performing administrative tasks.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How to Prevent Clickjacking\n</h3><ul><li> Use the X-Frame-Options HTTP header to control whether your content can be embedded in frames. Options include:\n\n<ul><li>: Prevent all framing.</li><li>: Allow framing only from the same origin.</li></ul></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Use the  directive in your CSP headers to control what domains can embed your pages. For example:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> While these can be implemented using JavaScript to “bust out” of frames, they are less reliable than server-side HTTP headers and should be used as a secondary measure.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is Content Integrity?\n</h3><p>Content integrity ensures that the content served by your site (e.g., scripts, stylesheets) remains unchanged from its original, trusted source. This is crucial in preventing tampering and man-in-the-middle attacks, especially when using third-party resources.</p><ul><li> Users can trust that the data and code are coming from verified sources.</li><li> Protect against situations where third-party content may be compromised.</li><li> Meet security and compliance standards that require integrity assurances.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How to Implement Content Integrity\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Subresource Integrity (SRI):</strong> SRI allows browsers to verify that files they fetch (like JavaScript libraries) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It involves including a cryptographic hash attribute in the HTML tag linking the resource.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> When inline scripts are necessary, you can use CSP hashes to specify the expected hash of the script contents, ensuring that only approved code executes.</li></ul><p>Incorporating solid security practices into your JavaScript applications is not optional—it’s fundamental. By understanding the risks associated with CSRF, clickjacking, and the importance of content integrity, you can implement robust measures that safeguard both your application and its users.</p><p>Whether you’re tweaking your Node.js backend or reinforcing client-side defenses, these strategies help ensure that your applications remain secure in an increasingly hostile online environment. Security is a continuous journey—stay vigilant, keep your dependencies updated, and always be mindful of emerging threats.</p><p>To explore the concepts in this article further, you can read the following resources that provide more detailed information about CSRF, clickjacking, and content integrity.</p>","contentLength":3829,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FAQ: Product Hunt for DevTools","url":"https://dev.to/fmerian/faq-product-hunt-for-devtools-2c09","date":1740314220,"author":"flo merian","guid":9602,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Product&nbsp;Hunt is a place where I enjoy hanging out. </p><p>I've contributed to launching 42 dev tools there in the last 2 years — or maybe 55?

A class is defined in CSS and can be applied to HTML elements to style them consistently. Classes can contain multiple properties, allowing developers to maintain visual consistency across a web application. For instance, if you have a button class defined as:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can apply this class to any button element like so:</p><div><pre><code>Click Me</code></pre></div><p>This keeps your button styling consistent throughout your application.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Tailwind Limits the Design\n</h3><p>Tailwind CSS simplifies the way we apply styles, which helps in creating visually consistent applications.

For instance, if you want to create a card component, you might use:</p><div><pre><code>Card TitleSome descriptive text here.</code></pre></div><p>Here, using Tailwind's predefined utility classes ensures that shadows, padding, and rounded corners look the same every time. This prevents cross-app mistakes or variations in how elements appear, leading to a more cohesive user experience.</p><p>The term  refers to the underlying simplicity and efficiency that Tailwind CSS provides. While it offers a robust set of utility classes for immediate use, it also encourages a deeper understanding of how these styles are constructed. </p><p>Hidden tailwind manifests in how Tailwind allows developers to create designs without needing to write extensive custom CSS. For example, if you want to create a green button, you might write:</p><div><pre><code>\n    Submit\n</code></pre></div><p>In this case, hidden tailwind means you're leveraging predefined utility classes (, , , , ) to quickly achieve the desired design without crafting custom styles.</p><p>Moreover, hidden tailwind illustrates how using these utility classes can lead to a form of design discipline, where developers focus on composition over intricate styling. When using hidden tailwind, you can create dynamic, responsive components efficiently while maintaining design consistency:</p><div><pre><code>Welcome to Tailwind\n            Experience the power of utility-first CSS in a streamlined way.\n        \n            Get Started\n        </code></pre></div><p>In conclusion,  is a concept representing the usefulness and practicality of Tailwind CSS, making the design process straightforward and efficient. By embracing the underlying principles of this framework, developers can create beautiful, consistent web applications with ease.

But let’s be honest—managing infrastructure isn’t fun. Configuring servers, handling security, optimizing costs, and ensuring scalability takes time away from what developers love: building great applications.</p><p>This is why developers are increasingly moving from IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) to PaaS (Platform as a Service)—and it’s not just a trend, it’s the future of cloud deployment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Burden of IaaS: Too Much Complexity, Too Little Innovation\n</h2><p>IaaS platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure provide raw computing power, but they also come with a steep learning curve and a high maintenance overhead.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Managing Infrastructure Takes Too Much Time\n</h3><p>With IaaS, you need to:\n✅ Set up virtual machines (VMs) and networks<p>\n✅ Configure storage and security policies</p>\n✅ Optimize performance and scale resources manually<p>\n✅ Handle unexpected downtime and failures</p></p><p>If you're a solo developer or a small team, this can consume hours or even days—time better spent on improving your application.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. DevOps Skills Are a Requirement, Not an Option\n</h3><p>To effectively manage IaaS, teams often need dedicated DevOps engineers. If you’re a startup or freelancer, hiring a DevOps expert might be too expensive. Without DevOps expertise, maintaining cloud infrastructure can lead to security risks, poor performance, and escalating costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Scaling Isn’t Effortless\n</h3><p>When traffic surges, you need to manually adjust configurations or implement auto-scaling strategies. Misconfigurations can lead to over-provisioning (wasting money) or under-provisioning (causing crashes).</p><p>IaaS services charge based on resource usage, data transfer, and additional services. Developers often find themselves overwhelmed by complex billing structures and unexpected costs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Developers Are Choosing PaaS Instead\n</h2><p>PaaS (Platform as a Service) is the answer to these challenges. It abstracts away infrastructure management and lets developers focus on writing and deploying code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Hassle-Free Deployment &amp; Management\n</h3><p>With PaaS, developers can deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure setup, networking, or storage configurations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Built-in Scaling &amp; Load Balancing\n</h3><p>Most PaaS platforms automatically scale applications based on demand, ensuring smooth performance without manual intervention.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. No DevOps? No Problem!\n</h3><p>Since PaaS automates most infrastructure tasks, you don’t need deep DevOps expertise to manage deployments. This is perfect for solo developers, startups, and agencies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Cost Transparency &amp; Optimization\n</h3><p>PaaS services offer fixed pricing models or optimized resource allocation, reducing unexpected cloud costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. AI-Powered Cloud Management\n</h3><p>The latest PaaS platforms leverage AI to optimize cloud performance, security, and scaling. This is where the future of cloud computing is headed!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Introducing Kuberns – AI-Powered PaaS for Effortless Cloud Deployment\n</h2><p>At Kuberns, we’re redefining PaaS with AI-powered automation.

Our discussion today outlines a production-ready Node.js setup that integrates TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. This approach not only enforces coding standards but also minimizes technical debt, thereby accelerating delivery cycles and boosting overall reliability a key differentiator for top companies.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Project Initialization &amp; Tooling Strategy\n</h2><p>Traditional Node.js projects often evolve ad hoc, leading to inconsistent code quality and unforeseen bugs. By standardizing the development environment with TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for static code analysis, and Prettier for automated formatting, organizations can secure a robust foundation. This architecture is particularly critical when scaling applications or transitioning legacy codebases into a modern ecosystem.</p><p>A well-initialized project sets the stage for efficiency. Start by creating your project directory and initializing with npm:</p><div><pre><code>your-project\nyour-project\nnpm init </code></pre></div><p>These commands establish a reproducible starting point, ensuring that all future team members work from the same baseline.</p><p>TypeScript adds a layer of type safety and predictability to JavaScript. Installing it as a development dependency and generating an initial configuration are key steps:</p><div><pre><code>npm  typescript @types/node\nnpx tsc </code></pre></div><p>The generated  allows customization of the TypeScript compiler options, ensuring the codebase adheres to stringent type-checking rules a critical factor for long-term maintenance and scalable development.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Structured Code &amp; Dependency Management\n</h2><p>A clear directory structure and proper dependency management ensure seamless collaboration across teams. Here's an example folder hierarchy that supports a large-scale application:</p><div><pre><code>folder-structure/\n├─ .env.sample\n├─ .eslintignore\n├─ .eslintrc.json\n├─ .gitignore\n├─ .prettierignore\n├─ .prettierrc\n├─ public/\n│  └─ temp/\n│     └─ .gitkeep\n├─ src/\n│  ├─ app.ts\n│  ├─ constants.ts\n│  ├─ controllers/\n│  │  └─ .gitkeep\n│  ├─ db/\n│  │  └─ db.ts\n│  ├─ index.ts\n│  ├─ middlewares/\n│  │  └─ .gitkeep\n│  ├─ models/\n│  │  └─ .gitkeep\n│  ├─ routes/\n│  │  └─ .gitkeep\n│  └─ utils/\n│     └─ .gitkeep\n└─ tsconfig.json\n</code></pre></div><p>The design follows best practices in modularity and separation of concerns ensuring that API routes, business logic, and utility functions are clearly delineated. Such an architecture improves code readability and eases onboarding of new team members.</p><p>Optimized scripts accelerate the development lifecycle. Update your  with the following scripts:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This integrated script suite ensures that code formatting and linting are enforced consistently across development, reducing human error and maintaining a production-grade code quality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Installation of Core Dependencies\n</h2><p>For robust backend functionality, install the following dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>npm bcrypt cors crypto dotenv express jsonwebtoken multer node-cron nodemailer pg\n</code></pre></div><p>And for development dependencies, install:</p><div><pre><code>npm  @eslint/js @types/bcrypt @types/cors @types/express @types/jsonwebtoken @types/multer @types/node-cron @types/nodemailer @types/pg @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier globals nodemon prettier ts-node typescript typescript-eslint\n</code></pre></div><p>These dependencies have been vetted to ensure stability, security, and performance in a production environment. Their integration is fundamental to maintaining high standards in code consistency and application reliability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Configuration: ESLint &amp;&nbsp;Prettier\n</h2><p>Prettier enforces a consistent code style, which is essential when scaling teams. Below is a sample configuration ():</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And the corresponding ignore file ():</p><div><pre><code>node_modules/\ncoverage/\nbuild/\ndist/\n*.min.js\n*.min.css\n*.js.map\n*.css.map\n*.json\n*.md\n*.yml\n*.yaml\n*.txt\n*.lock\n*.gitignore\n.DS_Store\n</code></pre></div><p>ESLint coupled with Prettier ensures that the code not only follows stylistic guidelines but also adheres to best coding practices. An advanced ESLint configuration () might look like this:</p><div><pre><code>import globals from \"globals\";\nimport pluginJs from \"@eslint/js\";\nimport tseslint from \"typescript-eslint\";\nimport eslintConfigPrettier from 'eslint-config-prettier';\nimport prettier from 'eslint-plugin-prettier';\n\n/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.Config[]} */\nexport default [\n  {\n    files: [\"**/*.{js,mjs,cjs,ts}\"],\n    languageOptions: {\n      globals: {\n        ...globals.browser\n      }\n    },\n    plugins: {\n      prettier: prettier\n    },\n    rules: {\n      \"prettier/prettier\": \"error\",\n      \"semi\": [\"warn\", \"always\"]\n    },\n    ignores: ['node_modules/', 'public/']\n  },\n  pluginJs.configs.recommended,\n  ...tseslint.configs.recommended,\n  eslintConfigPrettier\n];\n</code></pre></div><p>This configuration integrates global variables and leverages recommended settings from ESLint and TypeScript ESLint plugins. It also disables conflicting Prettier rules to streamline the development process.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Application &amp; API Response Standardization\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Express Application Setup\n</h3><p>The core of your application starts with setting up Express in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The middleware configuration ensures that your API remains secure, scalable, and capable of handling a high throughput of requests a necessity in production-grade applications.</p><p>The server is initiated via :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A clear separation between application logic and server bootstrapping helps maintain a clean codebase and simplifies deployment strategies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Customizing API Responses\n</h3><p>For a consistent API experience, a dedicated module () handles response formatting:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By encapsulating response logic, you enforce a uniform API contract, reducing the risk of inconsistent client-side behaviors and facilitating easier debugging and monitoring.</p><p>Reordering functions, mutations, queries, and use cases according to production needs ensures that each module serves a clear purpose.

In simpler terms, it means offering a \"what\" while hiding the \"how.\" It allows us to interact with systems at a high level without being bothered by the details that make those systems work.</p><p>At its core, abstraction involves:</p><ul><li><strong>Hiding Implementation Details:</strong> Consumers interact with a simple interface without worrying about underlying complexities.</li><li> Changes to the internal implementation do not affect the external interface.</li><li><strong>Promoting Reusability and Extensibility:</strong> Well-designed abstractions allow code (or processes) to be reused in different contexts and make it easier to extend functionality later.</li></ul><p>Let's consider a library called . RestSharp is a lightweight HTTP API client library that provides an intuitive way to send HTTP requests. It’s essentially a wrapper around  that adds built-in serialization, deserialization, and other stuff.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this snippet, RestSharp simplifies the process of making an HTTP request. But what exactly is  that was mentioned?</p><p> is itself an abstraction. It streamlines HTTP communication by handling the complexities of crafting raw HTTP requests and managing responses. Underneath HttpClient is the .NET HTTP stack, which abstracts the low-level details of socket programming and network protocols.</p><p>Sockets provide an interface to the operating system’s network stack. They handle the conversion of high-level data into low-level electrical or optical signals and manage the intricate processes of establishing, maintaining, and terminating network connections.</p><p>So, when you use RestSharp, you're leveraging a series of nested abstractions—from a high-level, user-friendly API down to the fundamental network operations that interact directly with hardware. Each layer is designed to hide complexity and help you to focus on building your application without needing to manage the intricate details beneath. All of this to basically help you send an http request.</p><p>Abstraction isn't just confined to software, it’s a universal. </p><p>Consider driving a card. When you press the gas pedal, you're engaging with a simple, high-level control that hides a wealth of complex processes. Pressing the pedal sends a signal to the engine, regulating the air and fuel mixture entering the combustion chambers. This converts chemical energy into mechanical power. Beyond the engine, the transmission translates that power into wheel motion through a series of gears. The car abstracts a multitude of underlying mechanisms into a simple interface: you press the pedal, and the car takes care of the rest.</p><p>If you really think about it, every \"thing\" is an abstraction. Every tool, every interface, every object is hiding its underlying complexity, and the best ones are the ones that are so well crafted that you don't even notice the details.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So why is abstraction such a big deal in software?\n</h2><p>Because <strong>we build and refine abstractions every day</strong> and modern software isn’t static; it’s dynamic, evolving, and often unpredictable. That’s why the abstractions we design need to strike a balance: they must be generic and flexible enough to accommodate for future change in the requirement, yet detailed enough to provide clear benefits in terms of clarity, and functionality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is a good abstraction then?\n</h2><p>You want abstraction in your code because it makes complex tasks seem simpler, it makes life easier. You put common operations behind a simple contract so you can concentrate on the more important issues.</p><p>An abstraction should be solid and encapsulated, yet flexible enough to meet users needs. Poor encapsulation leads to a leaky abstraction, where you can see or even change what's happening behind the interface. That’s not good, because it lets other parts of your code use the class in ways they shouldn’t.</p><p>On the other side, an abstraction that isn’t flexible enough to handle change in the requirement will be abandoned, or even worst, it will become a . The right level of abstraction always depends on the context.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Repository, An abstraction that makes you cringe every time\n</h2><p>Consider this example (implementation details removed for simplicity):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>What’s wrong here? We are returning an  from one of the methods, which is a lower level of abstraction than the rest (considering we're using EF here). This exposes details of how things work on different levels, which should be hidden.</p><p>lets look at another example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>What about this on? it doesn't even look right. with any change in the requirement we would need to touch the abstraction. even if we used a , it would just reduce the number of inputs and underlying implementation will need to change with every new requirement.</p><p>What about a separate method for each requirement:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is just splitting one big problem to thousand mini problems.</p><p>What about specification pattern?</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Ahh, maybe? but at this point you would probably ask why even bother with the abstraction?</p><p>These points might seem either overkill or completely valid depending on the context. The required level of abstraction depends on your specific situation. Some even argue that using a repository is an extra layer of abstraction that should be avoided or some may even prefer the active record pattern.</p><p>The key is to be pragmatic: abstract only when it truly makes sense and adds value.</p><p>In general, a good abstraction simplifies life by hiding complex details, should be common enough to be useful, and must strike a balance between being cohesive enough to protect its internals while flexible enough to handle change.</p><p>Good abstraction cleanly separates concerns and allows developers (or users) to operate at a higher level without being bogged down in details. Key characteristics include:</p><ol><li><strong>Exposes Only the Necessary:</strong> Everything made public should be carefully considered to ensure it reveals only what’s essential, not the underlying implementation details.</li><li><strong>Considers Multiple Consumers:</strong> Robust abstractions anticipate diverse use cases, whether for an open-source library or a specific application integration.</li><li> Each abstraction should do one thing and do it well, without exposing any part of the \"how.\"</li><li> Abstractions, such as interfaces, facilitate unit testing by allowing the use of mock implementations.</li><li> Analyze every variable in the implementation—determine if it needs to be configurable, replaceable, or hidden from the consumer.</li></ol><p>Bad abstractions result when there is an attempt to oversimplify or combine unrelated responsibilities. Common pitfalls include:</p><ol><li> Forcing different concepts into one class or method.</li><li> When details that should be hidden become exposed, forcing users to understand the internal workings.</li><li> When a component does too many things, it becomes harder to maintain or extend.</li><li> Excessive reliance on conditionals (such as flags or type checks) to manage multiple cases within a single component can lead to confusion and error-prone code.</li></ol><p>Before creating an abstraction, always consider whether it's truly necessary. While the benefits of abstraction are substantial there are times when introducing another layer might be overkill. </p><p>If an abstraction is required, invest some time on designing the right public contract. Think of future change. Balancing simplicity with flexibility is key.</p><p>In the end, every man-made tool is just an abstraction :)</p>","contentLength":7358,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Using Docker to Simulate Production Environments for Mobile App Testing","url":"https://dev.to/swap11/using-docker-to-simulate-production-environments-for-mobile-app-testing-5ccl","date":1740302440,"author":"Swapnil Patil","guid":9534,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Testing mobile apps in a production-like environment is crucial to detect issues before deployment.

If you're tired of overwhelming services, countless subscriptions, and tricky dependencies,  might become your go-to solution for these challenges.</p><p>Modern Angular applications often face challenges such as:</p><ul><li>: tightly coupled services and components;</li><li>: components often depend heavily on each other;</li><li>: tracking lost or broken events can be tough;</li><li>: extending the application can lead to tangled logic.</li></ul><p>The  library introduces an , making asynchronous and synchronous processes easier to manage. It focuses on <strong>clean architecture principles</strong>, isolating logic from other layers of your app. This means your project becomes more modular, your code cleaner, and your life as a developer easier.</p><p>To better understand the benefits of , let's look at a common Angular challenge:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Problem: Using @Input for Communication Between Components\n</h3><p>Imagine you have a parent component () and two child components ( and ). The task is to send a variable’s state from  to . The simplest (and the worst one) Angular way to handle this requires:</p><ol><li>Binding the variable in  to its parent component () using the  decorator and an event emitter.</li><li>Passing the updated state from the parent to  using .</li></ol><p>This approach results in tightly coupled components and a more complex flow. The communication looks like this:</p><div><pre><code>ChildA --&gt; Parent --&gt; ChildB\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Downsides of This Approach\n</h3><ol><li>: Components are tightly bound through explicit @Input and @Output bindings.</li><li>: Adding more components requires manual updates to bindings at multiple levels.</li><li>: Testing the flow of data between the components requires mocking input and output connections.</li><li>: It introduces extra boilerplate code to achieve something simple, creating dependencies on the parent component.</li></ol><p>The  library eliminates the dependency chain. Instead of having  and  communicate via the parent, you can send an event from  that  listens for directly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example: Solving the Problem\n</h2><p>First, define an event that will carry the state from  to :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2. Emit the Event in </h3><p>In , emit the event when the variable changes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3. Subscribe to the Event in </h3><p>In , listen for the event and update the component’s state when it occurs:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Happens Behind the Scenes?\n</h3><ol><li>When the user updates the input in , the  is published.</li><li> listens for the event and updates its  property immediately.</li><li>There’s no interaction with the parent component, keeping the flow simpler and decoupled.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advantages of This Event-Driven Approach\n</h2><ol><li><p> and  no longer depend directly on the parent component. Updates flow through defined events instead.</p></li><li><p><p>\nAdding new listeners or publishers for the same event is seamless. For instance, you can add a </p> component to listen for the  without modifying the parent or .</p></li><li><p><p>\nInstead of juggling @Input and @Output decorators with event emitters, you write clear, focused logic for publishing and subscribing to events.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nThe code is straightforward: one part of the app publishes events, and others react to them. No need to trace convoluted binding hierarchies.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nEvents can be mocked and tested independently without needing to recreate the parent-child communication structure.</p></p></li></ol><p>Visit the library's <a href=\"https://postboy.artstesh.ru\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">site</a> to read more about the library.

I’ve been curious about that too. Showing hundreds or even thousands of assets updating in real time, whether it’s the steady pace of stocks or crypto’s wild swings, feels like a big challenge.</p><p>I decided to take a stab at it in Flutter, using Binance’s crypto ticker stream as my sandbox. I’m not saying I’ve cracked the perfect solution, but here’s how I tried to answer that question—hopefully it’s helpful to someone out there. 🙏</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Selective Updates That Don’t Break the App\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why It’s Tricky: Don’t Redraw Everything\n</h3><p>Imagine a list of 2000 crypto pairs, and every price tick—say, 10 per second—redraws the whole thing. In Flutter, a naive  would tank performance faster than you can say “lag.” I needed updates to hit only what changed, not the entire screen.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How I Approached It: Targeting Specific Changes\n</h3><p>First, I modeled each crypto pair and its live data. Here’s the  for structure:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And  for the latest stats:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Binance sends updates via a ticker stream, captured in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Using Riverpod in Flutter, I stored symbols in a  and updated only what changed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the UI, I hook into Riverpod’s  to watch just that symbol:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>It’s not fancy—just a way to keep updates small. When “BTCUSDT” or \"ETHUSDT” changes, only its row refreshes, which felt like a decent start.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Just Listen to What You See\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why It’s Tricky: Too Much Data\n</h3><p>Binance streams data for every pair, but why grab “XRPUSDT” if it’s 300 rows off-screen? Subscribing to all 2000+ pairs would choke the network. I needed to focus on what’s visible.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How I Approached It: Watching the Viewport\n</h3><p>In Flutter, I used a  and a  to figure out what’s visible:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The view model handles subscriptions, unsubscribes from symbols that are no longer needed and subscribes only to new ones. Overlapping symbols (already subscribed) are ignored to avoid redundant operations.:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This kept it simple—streaming maybe 15-20 assets instead of 500.

I wanted it to feel smooth, even with all that live data.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How I Approached It: Giving It a Breather and Fixed Sizes\n</h3><p>I added a debounce timer to calm things down:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And built the list with a fixed  in Flutter’s :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The debounce waits 300ms after scrolling stops, and  keeps layout quick.

Binance’s stream was a fun testbed, and while it’s not the ultimate answer, it got the job done for me. If you’re tackling live lists in Flutter, maybe these bits can help—or spark a better idea.

But as projects grow in complexity, its flexibility can become a double-edged sword. </p><p>Enter TypeScript—a superset of JavaScript that brings static typing and enhanced tooling to the table. In this post, I’ll break down the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript, explore their strengths, and help you decide which one fits your next project.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s the Deal with JavaScript?\n</h2><p>JavaScript is the wild child of programming languages—dynamic, forgiving, and everywhere. It’s what makes your browser dance, from simple button clicks to full-blown single-page applications. Here’s what makes it shine:</p><ul><li><p>: It runs natively in browsers and, thanks to Node.js, on servers too.</p></li><li><p>: No strict rules. Want to change a variable’s type mid-flight? Go for it.</p></li><li><p>: You can whip up a working app without much setup.</p></li></ul><p>But that freedom comes with a catch. Take this example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>JavaScript’s loose typing means bugs like this can sneak in, especially in larger codebases. You won’t know until runtime, and by then, it might be too late.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Enter TypeScript: JavaScript with Guardrails\n</h2><p>TypeScript, developed by Microsoft, builds on JavaScript by adding static types. It’s not a separate language—it’s JavaScript with extra features that get compiled down to plain JS. Here’s why developers love it:</p><ul><li><p>: Catch errors early, during development.</p></li><li><p>: Autocomplete, refactoring, and code navigation in IDEs like VS Code are top-notch.</p></li><li><p>: Ideal for big teams and complex projects.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s rewrite that  function in TypeScript:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The TypeScript compiler flags the issue before you even run the code. No surprises in production!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Differences at a Glance\n</h2><p>JavaScript is your go-to when:</p><ul><li><p>You’re building a small project or prototype where speed matters more than structure.</p></li><li><p>You’re new to coding and want to avoid extra complexity.</p></li><li><p>Your team prefers minimal tooling and maximum flexibility.</p></li></ul><p>Think personal portfolios, quick scripts, or small apps where you can keep the codebase in your head.</p><ul><li><p>You’re working on a large-scale app with multiple developers.</p></li><li><p>You want to reduce bugs and improve maintainability.</p></li><li><p>You’re integrating with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, which have stellar TypeScript support.</p></li></ul><p>Projects like enterprise software, open-source libraries, or anything with a long lifespan benefit hugely from TypeScript’s discipline.</p><p>Imagine you’re building a user profile feature.

But as my projects grew, so did the chaos—random runtime errors, unclear APIs, and refactoring nightmares. TypeScript changed that. It’s like having a co-pilot who spots mistakes before they crash the plane. Yes, there’s a learning curve, but the payoff in confidence and productivity is massive.</p><p>That said, JavaScript still has its place. Not every project needs the overhead of types. It’s about picking the right tool for the job.</p><p>Are you a JavaScript purist or a TypeScript convert? Maybe you’ve got a killer use case for one over the other—drop it in the comments!

From allowing users to register and log in to controlling access to specific parts of the app, authentication is crucial for building secure and personalized experiences. Here’s what I learned:</p><p><strong>1) Why Authentication Matters? 🤔</strong></p><p>Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be, while authorization determines what they’re allowed to do. Together, they form the foundation of a secure app. Django makes this process seamless with its built-in auth system.</p><p><strong>2) Setting Up User Registration:</strong></p><p>I created a simple registration form using Django’s UserCreationForm. This allows users to create accounts with a username and password securely ✅.</p><p><strong>3) Handling Login &amp; Logout:</strong></p><p>I implemented login and logout functionality using Django’s built-in views. These views manage user sessions, ensuring secure access control.​</p><p><strong>4) Restricting Access with Decorators:</strong></p><p>To restrict access to certain pages, I used the @login_required decorator. Now, only logged-in users can access the dashboard, and unauthorized users are redirected to the login page 🔐.</p><p><strong>5) Customizing the User Model:</strong></p><p>I learned how to extend Django’s default User model by creating a custom user profile. This allows me to store additional information about users, like their bio or location. </p><p>Authentication and authorization are essential for building apps where users can create accounts, log in, and interact securely. Django’s built-in tools make it easy to implement these features without reinventing the wheel, saving time and ensuring best practices.</p><p>Day 7 gave me a solid understanding of how to handle user authentication and permissions in Django. Tomorrow, I’ll be diving into class-based views, a powerful way to write reusable and scalable views in Django. I’m excited to see how they can simplify my code and improve efficiency!</p><p>If you’re also learning Django or have tips on working with handling the users and decorators, I’d love to connect and learn from your experiences 🤝.

The specific constraints that I was dealing with and the way I ended up resolving the issue were a bit interesting, so I felt like writing about it.</p><p>For context, this happened in a Node.js v22 application maintained by three fast-paced engineering teams, with a total of over a dozen contributors. We use Prisma v6 as our ORM against a MySQL database. However, everything I mention here is also applicable to Drizzle, another ORM for JavaScript and TypeScript applications.</p><p>The exact error I’m referring to is the one below:</p><div><pre><code>PrismaClientKnownRequestError: Transaction API error: Transaction\nalready closed: A commit cannot be executed on an expired\ntransaction. The this transaction was 5000 ms, however\n5012 ms passed since the start of the transaction. Consider\nincreasing the interactive transaction or doing less work\nthe transaction.\n  code: ,\n  clientVersion: ,\n  meta: \n    error: </code></pre></div><p>The error message is self-explanatory but it’s also misleading at the same time. You’ll indeed see this if you open a transaction with Prisma and don’t finish it or close it before the timeout interval, but what it doesn’t say is that open transactions can get stuck and never be closed by Prisma itself when certain conditions are met.</p><p>This can be minimally reproduced with the code snippet below:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>What’s happening here is that on the first  call, Prisma will open a transaction that is supposed to be committed when you exit the scope of the current callback. However, if you do another database write using the Prisma client instead of the available transaction before that exit, Prisma will never commit that open transaction and you end up getting the thrown exception above.</p><p>I can’t think of legitimate use cases for the code snippet above. Doing database mutations that way is almost certainly a mistake by the developer, not an intentional choice.</p><p>In a sense, we can say this is a bug in Prisma. I would not expect this code snippet to work as expected but at the very least, I feel that it could be handled slightly better by the ORM and provide a more useful error message that is less of a red herring.</p><p>The intended use of this API by the Prisma team is that you always use the transaction client inside the scope of an open transaction, but sadly, the design of the API does not help the consumer avoid this potential issue.</p><p>One additional hurdle here is that  has an overload that takes in an array of queries instead of a callback like the example above, and you can also run into the same error in situations where you mix both APIs.</p><p>This misuse is exactly what was happening to us.</p><p>We were aware of what caused the error and why, but we have a very large and complex code base with long function calls. To orchestrate database operations that happen in multiple modules, we pass the transaction client as an argument to functions through many levels. When endpoints get too big, this passing of arguments becomes an issue very similar to the <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“prop drilling”</a> problem you get in React apps.</p><p>This becomes more than just annoying when those functions are re-used in different contexts where a transaction is not always needed, so that argument is then marked as optional by the developer working on a new feature.</p><p>Our initial approach was to remove all optional transaction client arguments and make them all required instead. This worked well in a few places but we quickly realized that it did not scale well with the size of our code base and we had way too many instances of this issue that would’ve required too many risky changes to make safely, not to mention it would’ve taken us a long time to complete.</p><p>Our second approach was to try to track with logs whenever we accessed the Prisma client instead of the transaction client when a transaction was active so that we would surgically fix those few instances instead of doing a big massive re-write.</p><p>That second approach would’ve fixed our existing offending call-sites but it did nothing to prevent this from happening again in the future without a change in technical direction in how we dealt with transactions, so it didn’t sit too well with me.</p><p>I was looking for a solution that:</p><ol><li>Was minimal and did not require a massive refactor</li><li>Fixed the existing offending issues</li><li>Prevented the issue from happening again in the future altogether</li></ol><p>What I realized was that I had already implemented a context-tracking functionality in our app a long time ago based on <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, to store data like trace ids and user ids throughout the lifetime of a request. We had been battle-testing it for a long time already so I am 100% confident that it works everywhere, especially after we squashed a few edge cases like <a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/multer/issues/814\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this one</a>.</p><p>Our code base is private, but I extracted that bit to an OSS package, so you can view those sources here if you’re curious: <a href=\"https://github.com/reyronald/async-local-storage#readme\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/reyronald/async-local-storage</a>. We don’t use that package in our app but its implementation is very similar.</p><p>My solution consists of storing the active transaction in that asynchronous context, and instead of accessing the Prisma client, access the transaction client if available anytime a database query is attempted.</p><p>We also had OpenTelemetry already, which provides a context concept that’s internally built on top of AsyncLocalStorage. I could’ve used that instead if we didn’t already have our own.</p><p>To be able to do this though, I needed to be able to control all access to those clients. We had something in place already for this but it wasn’t used everywhere. Thankfully the changes required to address that were small and I was okay with pursuing that.</p><p>In essence, we wanted to go from:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This also has the additional benefit that it completely prevents the usage of the second overload of  which is another surface area that can trigger the error.</p><p>With this in place, I can now leverage our asynchronous context to implement the solution. First, I make sure to store the active transaction in the store:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, the magic. We have to make sure whenever  from  is used anywhere, we use  instead if it exists in the context.</p><div><pre><code>(\n        realTarget,\n        prop,\n        receiver,\n      )\n    },\n  })\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>A Proxy is a great feature of the language that allows us to intercept reads on objects. We can use it to wrap it around the return value of our utility and do our checks there.</p><p>This minimal change immediately addresses and fixes any existing instance of the problem in the entire code base and makes it impossible for a consumer to accidentally get into this situation again. It also allows us to remove transaction clients from arguments everywhere as we were doing before, reducing the complexity of the signature of our functions.</p><p>Something else that's really nice is that it mimics the semantics of transactions in SQL itself. In SQL, a transaction is started simply by executing the  statement. After that, any and all subsequent statements will happen inside that transaction scope until a  or  statement is found. There's no need to specify any form of transaction identifier in future statements, and there's no additional reference to the open transaction either.</p><p>In my solution, calling  represents that  statement, and closing the scope of its callback argument represents the  phase to end the transaction.</p><p>Although I understand Prisma's decision for its current transaction API, I feel we would be better off with an API that more closely resembles how it works in SQL.</p><p>I also maintain codebases in Go where we use GORM. They have an API that is exactly the same as Prisma's and Drizzle's callback version, but on top of that, they also offer a <a href=\"https://gorm.io/docs/transactions.html#Control-the-transaction-manually\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">manual transaction control option</a>. Take a look:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This makes more sense to me, especially after our experience with this issue. An API like this could be replicated in user-land using context and proxies, just like I did above.</p><p>The callback API feels like too much of a foot-gun. You only run into issues if you use it wrong, in an unintended way, but the fact that a wrong way to use it exists at all is a design flaw, in my opinion. Either way, offering options is the way to go, so kudos to the GORM team here.</p><p>A common concern and criticism that you see related to the usage of proxies is that they have an impact on performance. This impact comes from the additional overhead associated with the fact that each property access has to go through the Proxy handler.</p><p>To understand how much of an impact we’re talking about, I ran a local benchmark test with . This is what I got.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This shows that wrapping the client with a proxy slows down access by a factor of 6. I also ran tests where the proxied client was cached instead of re-wrapped on every iteration of the benchmark, and the result was the same, which means that the instantiation of the proxy doesn’t have a measurable impact.</p><p>This might seem concerning but if we look at the durations, we’re talking about a difference of 31 nanoseconds, versus 185 nanoseconds. For context, there are 1,000,000 nanoseconds in a millisecond. It would take roughly 6,500 property access calls before this adds 1ms to the duration of the request.</p><p>In our application, we only access the database client a handful of times per request, so this is certainly insignificant for us.</p><p>It’s safe to say that this won’t be an issue for most apps. If someone has a use case where a couple of hundred nanoseconds makes a difference, they probably shouldn’t be using Node.js or Prisma to begin with.</p><p>Drizzle is a competing option to Prisma in the ORM space for JS and TS runtimes. It’s a bit younger but preferred by many not only because of the similarity of its API to raw SQL, but also because it is said to be more performant and provides a few features that Prisma doesn’t have. For example, it supports transaction save points, which are not available at the time of this writing in Prisma v6.</p><p>I wanted to see how Drizzle would handle this same scenario. Turns out that it behaves almost the same, and you do get a similar runtime error thrown. See below.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There’s one big difference though. The delay is much longer, 50 seconds to be exact, before the transaction times out and throws. This timeout is not configurable with Drizzle.</p><p>This experience is much worse compared to that in Prisma which has a default timeout of 5 seconds that can be changed per transaction. Imagine introducing this bug by accident on production and your users have to wait 50 seconds before they get a failed response from the server! The longer timeout also makes it more difficult to troubleshoot and fix. So I’ll have to give Prisma the win on this one.</p><p>This solution has been in production for a while. I tested it across instances of previous incidents we had already fixed manually before. The results are as expected and no issues have been found.</p><p>Develoepr experience has also improved dramatically for implementation of new features now that our engineers don't have to worry about transaction management, argument drilling and making sure they're using the correct client. Personally I feel the release of this cognitive burden makes me more relaxed.</p>","contentLength":11187,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ShadeView 2 - First Complete Shader Helper - VSCode","url":"https://dev.to/przemysaw_orowski_585ea/shadeview-2-first-complete-shader-helper-vscode-29le","date":1740284423,"author":"Przemysław Orłowski","guid":9445,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello!

Is morality absolute, or does it depend on the context? Philosophers have long debated how ethical principles should be determined. Do we have \"the good\" and \"the bad\" or is it all relative?   </p><p>Let's begin with a general debate and see how the answer to the question evolved through history. Then, we will discuss how it applies to IT, our modern digital societies, and software development.   </p><p>Note: All the dates mentioned in this article are based on the Gregorian calendar.</p><p>Religious teachings often promote the idea of absolute morality, where right and wrong are already <strong>known and defined set in the stone</strong> by divine commandments. For instance, in Christianity, the Ten Commandments serve as a guide for moral behavior, while in Islam, the Quran provides clear guidelines for what is considered righteous. These absolute frameworks suggest that morality is not subjective but dictated by a higher power. The God's commands are considered the \"right\" actions, and if you obey them, you will be rewarded for eternity. On the other hand, disobedient is considered \"wrong,\" and you will be punished for eternity.</p><p> (<strong>Emanuel Kant, 1724–1804, Germany</strong>), a German philosopher, echoed this sentiment with his theory of the , which asserts that moral actions are those that <strong>can be universally applied</strong>. As he famously said:</p><blockquote><p>\"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\" — Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote><p>In contrast, modern societies often adopt a relativistic view of morality, where right and wrong are determined collectively based on cultural, social, and situational factors. This perspective argues that <strong>morality is not fixed but evolves over time and across different societies</strong>.   </p><p>So, what is right? It depends!<p>\nWhat is wrong? Again, it depends!</p></p><p> (also known as Ebn-e Sina, or Avicenna in the West, ), an Iranian philosopher, physician, and the founder of modern medicine, believed in rational ethics. He thought morality should be grounded in intellect rather than dictated purely by external forces. He argued that the pursuit of knowledge and virtue leads to ethical behavior.</p><blockquote><p>\" The highest good is that which is sought for its own sake, and the greatest evil is that which is avoided for its own sake. \" — Aboo Ali Sina, The Book of Healing (Shafa)</p></blockquote><p>PS: Shafa means healing in Persian, coming from an Arabic word.</p><p> (), an Iranian philosopher, poet, and mathematician, known for his skeptical view of absolute truths, particularly in morality and existential questions. His poetry often reflected a deep understanding that what people consider \"right\" and \"wrong\" is ever-changing.   </p><p>In his poems, he was suggesting that \"if something isn’t working, why not break it down and redesign it based on a deeper understanding of needs?\" He suggests there is <strong>no definitive answers, because it depends on context</strong>.   </p><p>This is an example of one of his poems, in which he challenges the religious idea of absolute morality coming from a higher power:  <a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fob6yz0mxq6grjakb04aa.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fob6yz0mxq6grjakb04aa.png\" alt=\"Omar Khayyam, a Persian poet. Robaiyat #87 in Farsi\" width=\"503\" height=\"78\"></a>  And this is the \"translation\" of it:</p><blockquote><p>\" They say there will be paradise and houris divine, With rivers of wine, honey, and things so fine. If we choose wine and love in this life, why regret? Since in the end, that’s what we’re promised to get! \" — Omar Khayyam, Robaiyat #87 (translation)</p></blockquote><p>Remember, words in Farsi have many different meanings, and no translation can capture the different layers of magic and the depth of the original text!</p><p> (), an Iranian philosopher, also challenged the idea of absolute morality. In his <strong>Substantial Motion theory</strong>, he argued that everything is in a constant state of change—including morality, knowledge, and understanding. He suggests that there is no absolute \"right\" or \"wrong,\" only different intensities of truth based on context.</p><blockquote><p>\"Being is a single reality that appears in different degrees and intensities.\" — Molla Sadra, Asfar ol-Arba‘a (The Four Journeys of the Intellect)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\"The essence of things is not fixed; rather, it transforms in response to time, space, and perception.\" — Molla Sadra</p></blockquote><p> (Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre, ), a French philosopher, championed the idea of existentialism, asserting that individuals are free to define their own values and morality. Sartre wrote:</p><blockquote><p>\"Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.\" — Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism is a Humanism</p></blockquote><p>This notion of freedom and choice highlights the subjective nature of morality in a relativistic framework.</p><p>This debate began earlier in the East, from Iran, and later a few centuries later, it was picked up in the West and evolved by philosophers like Kant and Sartre. Beyond Ebn-e Sina, Khayyam, Molla Sadra, Kant, and Sartre, many other thinkers have also contributed to this debate.   </p><p>Persian thinkers throughout history have challenged the meaning of \"good\" and \"bad\" and the way we think about things. This used to be pretty common in Iranian/Persian culture during the pre-Arab invasion era, where in Mithra-ism and Zarathustra's teachings, people were encouraged to think and question things. Later, after the attack of Arabs/Islam, our ancestors created Shia Islam (the new religion of resistance) to kick out invaders. Philosophers used the old Persian teachings to encourage the society to think again and push back the new strict Sunni/Arab/invader/colonist mindset who wanted to enslave the world.   </p><p>That's why a few centuries after that, Aboo Ali Sina, Omar Khayyam, and Molla Sadra argued that \"the answers\" are not fixed but evolves over time and context. They promoted the idea that decisions should be made with adaptability in mind.   </p><p>A few centuries later, Friedrich Nietzsche critiqued the traditional Western moral systems, declaring, \"God is dead\" (this has nothing to do against religion and beliefs in my opinion and is more about ways of thinking), and then he suggested that humanity must create its own values (focusing on thinking rather than just following).   </p><p>On the other hand, <strong>Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948, India)</strong> emphasized universal principles of truth and nonviolence, saying, \"You may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no result.\"</p><p>These contrasting views highlight the complexity of defining right and wrong, revealing that morality often depends on the interplay of culture, context, and individual beliefs.</p><p>In the world of IT, infrastructure, operations, and programming, the debate between absolutes and contextual decision-making is highly relevant. Unlike morality, where traditional societies and many philosophers seeked to define a universal truth, around A superpower like \"God\" or \"the mighty king\" or religion, software development thrives on contextual decisions.   </p><p>Some, still like the traditional absolute mindset and either blindly follow the hypes or just accept what a random person on the internet calls the \"best practice\" or \"the tool that you should use\"! The same applies to things like \"the best solution architecture\" or \"the best programming language\" ... That's why we always see conversations around \"blah blah programming language is dead\", \"Golang is the best\" or \"Kubernetes is the answer to all infrastructure problems you can imagine\"! — and you cannot even ask why?! 🙃   </p><p>So, back to the question of \"what is right and what is wrong?\" ...<p>\nThis time in the context of software development.</p><p>\nAgain, to make decision, it all depends on the underlying context of what we are debating! (ofc this is just my opinion &amp; you can disagree)   </p></p><p>It is crucial to always ask the \"why\" behind things instead of blindly following.<p>\nThis is important when choosing a technology or architecture to work with or making minor decisions like \"Should I use this library?\".</p></p><p>✅ There is no \"THE RIGHT ANSWER\" or \"the answer to life, universe, and everything\" — of course, except \"42\" and \"AI\"! 😄   </p><p>✅ Let's not assume that \"right\" means everything everyone else is doing. Before considering an approach, let's ask the \"why\" behind things instead of chasing the hype.   </p><p>✅ Let's constantly challenge our assumption about what is \"right\" and \"wrong\" and consider the context.   </p><p>✅ If microservice architecture works for AWS and Netflix, that doesn't necessarily mean it would work for a random small startup with 2-10 junior developers.   </p><p>✅ Kubernetes is great and works for many use cases, but that doesn't mean you should use k8s as your orchestration tool if you are a small startup with 2-3 services and no need to utilize anything from the CNCF ecosystem. Instead, for example, on AWS, you can use a more straightforward serverless containerization orchestration tool: ECS &amp;&amp; Fargate.   </p><p>✅ Do I need multi-cloud from day one? Probably not!<p>\n... and probably that even never happens!   </p></p><p>✅ Let's be efficient and use the power of managed services and serverless options like Fargate (ECS or EKS) unless we really need a very specific setup. Even in that case, ask yourself a few times, \"Do we really need that specific setup? Why not any of the existing standard ways?\"   </p><p>✅ Serverless doesn't mean Lambda/FaaS + API GW + DynamoDB!   </p><p>✅ Always study, value the power of R&amp;D, and continually challenge your ways of working. Ask yourself the \"why's behind things\" instead of blindly following what everyone else is doing.   </p><p>✅ Yes, the answer to life, universe, and everything is \"Platform\"<p>\n... oh - sorry, I mean 42!</p><p>\n... and yes, that \"answer\" used to be k8s!</p><p>\nDo we need more \"Platform Engining\", \"Kubernetes\", \"AI\", or \"the next hype\"? 🤔</p></p><p>If you liked the article and want to keep me motivated to provide more content, you can share this article with your friends and colleagues and follow me here on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pooyan_razian\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medium</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/prazian/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>.</p><ul><li>All content provided on this blog is for informational purposes only.

Docker simplifies this by containerizing applications, making development and deployment more efficient. This guide covers the basics of using Docker for mobile app development, including setting up a backend API and running it inside a container.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Use Docker for Mobile App Development?\n</h2><p>Docker offers several benefits for mobile developers:</p><p>✔ Consistent Development Environment – No more “it works on my machine” issues.\n✔ Dependency Management – Keep all dependencies in a containerized environment.<p>\n✔ Faster Onboarding – New developers can start with a single command.</p>\n✔ Easier CI/CD Integration – Automate testing and deployment workflows.<p>\n✔ Improved Security – Containers isolate applications, reducing attack surfaces.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Docker for Mobile Backend Development\n</h2><p>Most mobile apps rely on a backend server for user authentication, data storage, or API interactions. Let’s containerize a Node.js Express API and connect it to a PostgreSQL database using Docker.</p><p>Download and install Docker:</p><ul><li>Windows &amp; Mac: Docker Desktop</li><li>Linux: Install via package manager (apt, yum, etc.)</li></ul><p>Check if Docker is installed:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Create a Simple Node.js API\n</h2><p>First, create a directory for your project:</p><p><code>mkdir docker-mobile-api &amp;&amp; cd docker-mobile-api</code>\nInitialize a Node.js project and install Express:</p><p><code>npm init -y\nnpm install express pg</code></p><div><pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n    res.send(\"Hello from Dockerized Mobile Backend!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {\n    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Create a Dockerfile\n</h2><p>A Dockerfile defines how to package the app into a container. Create a Dockerfile in your project folder:</p><div><pre><code># Use official Node.js image\nFROM node:14\n\n# Set the working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy package.json and install dependencies\nCOPY package.json ./\nRUN npm install\n\n# Copy source code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Expose the API port\nEXPOSE 3000\n\n# Run the app\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Define Services with Docker Compose\n</h2><p>A mobile backend often requires a database. Let’s add PostgreSQL using Docker Compose.</p><p>Create a docker-compose.yml file:</p><div><pre><code>version: \"3.8\"\nservices:\n  backend:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"3000:3000\"\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n    environment:\n      DATABASE_URL: \"postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydb\"\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:latest\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_USER: user\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password\n      POSTGRES_DB: mydb\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:5432\"\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Run the Application\n</h2><p>Start the backend and database using Docker Compose:</p><p>Docker Architecture Overview</p><div><pre><code>  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐\n  │         Mobile App (iOS/Android) │<p>\n  └──────────────▲──────────────────┘</p>\n                 │ API Requests<p>\n  ┌──────────────▼──────────────┐</p>\n  │    Dockerized Backend API    │<p>\n  │ (Node.js inside a container) │</p>\n  └──────────────▲──────────────┘\n  ┌──────────────▼──────────────┐<p>\n  │  PostgreSQL (Dockerized)    │</p>\n  └─────────────────────────────┘</code></pre></div><h2><p>\n  Best Practices for Docker in Mobile App Development</p></h2><p>✅ Use Multi-Stage Builds: Keep Docker images small for better performance.\n✅ Leverage Docker Volumes: Store persistent data instead of losing it when the container stops.<p>\n✅ Monitor Containers: Use tools like Prometheus or Datadog for monitoring.</p>\n✅ Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly update base images to patch security vulnerabilities.</p><p>Docker simplifies mobile app backend development by providing a consistent, isolated, and scalable environment. Whether you’re developing a backend API, testing mobile app integrations, or setting up a CI/CD pipeline, Docker enhances the development experience.</p><p>Next Steps:\n🚀 Try containerizing your existing mobile app backend.<p>\n🔧 Explore Docker’s networking features for real-world API deployments.</p>\n📦 Deploy your containerized API to AWS, GCP, or Azure using Kubernetes.</p><p>With Docker, mobile app development becomes more efficient, scalable, and secure.

If both of them serve a similar purpose, why are they different? Let me share my insights! 💡</p><p>First, let's look at the definitions of both commands. The git pull command is used to fetch and merge changes from another branch into your target branch. Meanwhile, the git rebase command is used to reapply your commits on top of the base branch's commits. From the definitions themselves, we can see that both have the same purpose (to synchronize changes between branches) but with different methods.</p><p>In short, the pull method merges changes from another branch into your target branch by appending a single merge commit after your last commit. If there's a conflict during the merging process, it won't be merged, and you'll need to resolve it on your local branch first.</p><p>On the other hand, the rebase method reapplies your commits onto the base branch's latest commit. If conflicts arise, you'll need to resolve the conflict for each commit that applies your changes. You'll need to use  after resolving the conflicts in each individual commit.</p><p>So, when should you use which? To be honest, I think it depends on your own preferences. But for me, I use pull to merge from the base branch to my feature branch for simple updates, especially if it's okay to add an additional merge commit.

That doesn't accurately reflect my skills cause I use more JavaScript these days. So, I'm on a quest to get the other FCC (FreeCodeCamp) certifications to increase my skill and credibility as a developer.</p><p>This is a post in a new series I'll be putting up. My quest to get the remaining FCC certs (or as much as I can get) and add to my portfolio. I know FCC certs are not professionally recognized but they are credible and you get to build projects that can be recognized (depending on how you build them). Okay, enough intro, let's dig in.</p><p>I'm on the home page for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.</p><p>And the first required project is a to build a palindrome checker.</p><p>A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How I approached the problem\n</h2><p>It didn't seem too hard and I thought out the process (and tested it on VScode) before coding the solution.\nFirst, you define your input and output like so:</p><div><pre><code>\n    &lt;div id=\"wrapper\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;Palindrome Checker&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;form action=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"text-input\" name=\"text-input\"&gt;\n            &lt;button id=\"check-btn\"&gt;Check&lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;p id=\"result\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/form&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"info\"&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n</code></pre></div><p>You can add styling, these are the styles I used:</p><div><pre><code>#wrapper {\n    width: 100vw;\n    height: 100vh;\n    background-color: #1f153d;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    color: white;\n    margin: auto;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    align-items: center;\n}\nform {\n    text-align: center;\n    padding: 10px 20px;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    background-color: white;\n    color: black;\n}\nbutton {\n    background-color: #1f153d;\n    padding: 10px;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    color: white;\n}\n.info {\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin-top: 20px;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    background-color: green;\n    width: 50%;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>It should look like this:</p><p>For the functionality, we reference all DOM elements we'll be using:</p><div><pre><code>const textInput = document.getElementById('text-input');\nconst checkBtn = document.getElementById('check-btn');\nconst result = document.getElementById('result');\n</code></pre></div><p>Then listen for clicks on our button:</p><div><pre><code>checkBtn.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {})\n</code></pre></div><p>inside the function we ensure the input is not empty, then we call the function  to check if the string is a palindrome.</p><div><pre><code>checkBtn.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {\n    const text = textInput.value\n    if (text === \"\") {\n        alert(\"Please input a value\")\n    }\n    if (isPalindrome(text)) {\n        result.innerHTML = `${text} is a palindrome`;\n    } else {\n         result.innerHTML = `${text} is not a palindrome`;\n    }\n\n});\n</code></pre></div><p>Let's implement the  function below.</p><div><pre><code>function isPalindrome(text) {\n    // Convert to lowercase to get rid of casing\n    text = text.toLowerCase();\n    // Split the string by all white space characters into an array \n    text = text.split(/\\s+/);\n    // Join the array to get rid of the white space\n    text = text.join(\"\");\n    // Using this regular expression, remove all punctuation marks\n    text = text.replace(/[\\.\\(\\)\\[\\]\\{\\}&lt;&gt;_,!?\"':;-]/g, \"\");\n    // Finally perform your test\n    let reversedText = text.split(\"\").reverse().join(\"\");\n    return reversedText === text; // return the result\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>The function first convert's the string to lowercase, it then removes the white space and the punctuation. It then reverses the string and compares the reversed string with the original.\nIf you spells the same way, the function returns true else it returns false.</p><p>So, that was how I completed the first of 5 certification projects required for the FCC certificate.

Understand your access patterns\n</h2><p>Before you start any database design with DynamoDB, stop and do this instead: identify and understand your data access patterns.</p><p>What I mean by this is to take some time to find out how your users will be reading and writing data on your application.</p><p>For example, are users browsing your products by category or rather by most popular? (it could be both)</p><p>Do you allow sellers to add multiple products at a time or rather just one?</p><p>By the manner your application fetches data most commonly that should tell you how you model it.</p><p>Rather than using a general data model, model your data (that is primary keys) based on how they will be queried.</p><p>If your application often queries users’ data along with their orders and purchase history, then you should store user info, orders and purchases using the same partition key.</p><p>DynamoDB optimizes for latency at scale and designing based on your application’s access patterns will make or break that speed and scalability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Partition Key design lets you scale\n</h2><p>Always think high cardinality first.</p><p>High cardinality is simply a measure of uniqueness of your partition keys.</p><p>A high cardinality partition key is for example “userID” or “productID” — there is usually just one in your database.</p><p>A low cardinality partition key is for example “status” or “isFeatured” — there can be many shared values like “active” or “true/false”.</p><p>The higher the partition key cardinality the better your database can scale. Partition keys that have too many shared values will run into hot partitions — partitions that get too much traffic.</p><p>Your partition doesn’t always have to have a single unique value, sometimes you have no choice but to give it a value that will be shared. The thing to keep in mind here is when the partition key starts getting popular you should look towards sharding it.</p><p>Sharding partition keys can be as simple as adding a prefix before the partition key name, such as a date or a location value. That can further make the partition higher in cardinality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Sort Key design lets you filter\n</h2><p>DynamoDB’s API has a “FilterExpression” method. This lets you filter items will high flexibility.</p><p>Well because FilterExpressions will fetch all of the data in the query and apply the filter after having fetched the data. This essentially means you are spending the same capacity units and costs without the filter operation.</p><p>So how can you filter data in DynamoDB instead?</p><p>Sort keys support the following query operations:</p><p>= (equality)\nbegins_with() (sort key starts with substring)<p>\n&lt;= (less than or equal to)</p></p><blockquote><p>= (greater than or equal to)\nBETWEEN (sort key is between value a and b)<p>\nUsing particularly the begins_with() operator, we can perform some powerful filtering.</p></p></blockquote><p>For example, if we need to filter hotel rooms by features we can use the following sort key design:</p><div><pre><code>room#&lt;view-type&gt;#&lt;num-of-guests&gt;#&lt;features&gt;#&lt;floor-number&gt;#&lt;room-number&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>e.g.: \nRoom 1: \"room#sea-view#2-guests#smoking#f1#101\"<p>\nRoom 2: \"room#sea-view#3-guests#smoking#f2#201\"</p>\nRoom 3: \"room#garden-view#4-guests#no-smoking#f3#301\"<p>\nWith the data model above we can filter out rooms by their view, number of guests, features (like smoking allowed), floor number and room number.</p></p><p>In <a href=\"https://medium.com/aws-in-plain-english/how-i-would-design-the-data-model-for-a-hotel-booking-app-with-dynamodb-98769452e89e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a> article, I go more into detail on using the begins_with() method to perform these powerful filtering strategies.</p>","contentLength":3641,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Level up your tech career by being social","url":"https://dev.to/kareem_itani_e51fee03fb7a/level-up-your-tech-career-by-being-social-1lma","date":1740266993,"author":"Kareem Itani","guid":9388,"unread":true,"content":"<h2><strong>The Importance of Being Social in a Tech Company</strong></h2><p>Have you ever thought about the most important skill as a software developer outside of coding? While technical skills are essential, there’s another aspect that could be even more important, that is being social. I’ve been thinking a lot about the role of social skills in the tech industry and I wanted to share some thoughts and how important it is.</p><p>Let’s face it - networking is important. You’ve probably heard it a million times, but it’s true. I believe who you know matters more than what you know. You could create something amazing like the next Facebook, but if no one knows who you are, it’s like it never happened.</p><p>For example, you’ve been working hard on a feature for months, and it turns out great. But if no one knows you built it, your manager might not even notice, and you could miss out on the recognition or promotion you deserve.</p><p>Building relationships within the company ensures that your efforts don’t go unnoticed. Even if the project is small, if people know you and see what you’re working on, you’re more likely to gain attention and opportunities.</p><h3><strong>Building Strong Connections</strong></h3><p>It’s not just about recognition, having  with your coworkers makes collaboration easier. If you’re constantly engaging with your team and building a strong bond, it becomes much smoother to ask for help when needed.</p><p>You’re stuck on a bug for hours. Instead of struggling alone, if you’ve built a solid connection with someone, you can reach out without feeling awkward. Having that comfort level with your coworkers can make problem-solving faster and more enjoyable. You don’t want to be the person who only reaches out when something is wrong; being present and friendly makes your presence more liked.</p><h3><strong>Building Strong Connections</strong> Future Job Opportunities\n</h3><p>Social connections can also open up new opportunities down the road. Imagine one of your coworkers leaves the company and months later offers you a referral at their new workplace. Referrals can significantly boost your chances of landing a job, especially when the job market is tough.</p><p>Building a network of people who trust you as a developer can make all the difference when it comes to finding new roles. Instead of stressing over applications, you’ll have connections vouching for you.</p><p>Being social is often overlooked in the tech world because of the main focus being put on your technical abilities, but being social also plays a crucial role in career growth. Networking, building connections, and opening doors for future opportunities are all key benefits of being socially engaged at work.</p><p>I’ve personally found that being social and outgoing has helped me grow faster in my career and meet people I wouldn’t have connected with otherwise.</p><p>So, if you’re in tech and you’re not social, I’d encourage you to give it a try. The rewards, both personally and professionally, are worth it.

The ecosystem has some really <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cool</a> and <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">helpful</a> tools that enhance developer workflows. I believe VSCode offers a compelling platform for developers to build and distribute their software, but there are a few major hurdles that need to be overcome.</p><p>A few years back, I was working on a project heavily reliant on SQL. Deploying SQL changes across dev, QA, and production environments became a major bottleneck. With features often requiring 10+ SQL changes, the manual deployment process was tedious and time-consuming. To solve this, I built a <a href=\"https://github.com/ShawnRoller/DB-Deployer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mac app</a> that streamlined deployments by allowing us to select the target environment and the relevant scripts to deploy. It was a hit within the team, but as a standalone app, it introduced new challenges; users had to configure connections, manage accounts, and I became the de facto support person for the app.</p><p>Then came <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Data Studio</a> (a now-deprecated fork of VSCode), which our team quickly adopted. It occurred to me that I could rebuild my SQL deployment tool as a VSCode extension, which had significant benefits:</p><ol><li>: VSCode targets Mac, Windows, Linux, and the web. And by targeting VSCode I would automatically inherit those targets.</li><li>: VSCode handles much of the boilerplate: UI elements (progress indicators, notifications), and core functionalities like database connection management.</li><li>: Developers already spend a significant amount of time in VSCode (and its forks like <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cursor</a> and <a href=\"https://codeium.com/windsurf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windsurf</a>). Distributing my tool as an extension would greatly reduce the friction of adoption compared to getting users to download a separate app.</li><li><strong>Shared extension ecosystem</strong>: As just mentioned, Cursor and Windsurf are forks of VSCode, which means they all share the same extension marketplace.  Build for VSCode, and your extensions will automatically be available across these popular apps.</li></ol><p>So why aren't more developers targeting VSCode with their software? There are several major factors in my view:</p><ol><li>: Despite <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/111800\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repeated</a><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/90648\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">requests</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/36577\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developers</a>, Microsoft hasn't implemented support for paid VSCode extensions within the Marketplace. They even have a <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#extension-pricing-label\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"pricing\" label</a> in the publishing process, but it's misleading because the only real options are  and .</li><li>: The absence of official paid extension support has created an expectation of free extensions. This discourages developers who might otherwise invest more time and resources into building high-quality tools.</li><li>: Many developers haven't considered VSCode as a viable platform for their tools. Developers building development-focused software could gain significant benefits by porting their work to VSCode (such as those mentioned earlier).</li></ol><p>Like many indie developers, I'm driven by a desire to create useful tools. But maintaining software over the long term, especially when it becomes popular, can be draining without some form of sustainable income. My own goal has always been to build valuable tools and earn just enough to continue development and support. As a tool gains traction, I want to invest more in it: adding features, improving UX, and polishing the details.</p><p>To make VSCode a more viable platform for developers – and to improve the overall quality of VSCode extensions – I created <a href=\"https://codecheckout.dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">code-checkout</a>. It makes it dead simple to add paid features to VSCode extensions. Code-checkout handles licensing, payments, analytics, and more, so developers can concentrate on building and refining their extensions, rather than managing complex server infrastructure. </p><p>My top priority during planning was to make it as simple to integrate as possible, and I believe that goal was achieved. It also has a straightforward pricing model (free to use, with a 10% transaction fee), so the platform doesn't make money unless the developers do.</p><p>My goal is to help developers get paid for their work, enabling them to create and maintain high-quality software for the VSCode ecosystem. I believe this will ultimately lead to a superior VSCode Extension Marketplace, which benefits everyone.</p><p>If you're thinking about building a VSCode extension, I hope this post convinces you to do it! </p><p>PS - I'm always looking for feedback and use-cases to improve code-checkout, so don't hesitate to reach out to me on <a href=\"https://x.com/totalriffage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">X</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-roller-8a831856\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a> with any suggestions or comments.</p>","contentLength":4310,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Creating the Paramus Park Oral Surgery Website: A Comprehensive Guide to Planning, Design, and Development","url":"https://dev.to/noahnson/creating-the-paramus-park-oral-surgery-website-a-comprehensive-guide-to-planning-design-and-2fl1","date":1740257450,"author":"Finnian Hale","guid":9341,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s digital age, having a robust and user-friendly online presence is essential for any healthcare provider.

You know it could be one of two things, but TypeScript’s autocompletion is only showing you common properties?</p><p>Let’s say you have an Animal type, which can either be a Bird or a Dog. You need to figure out whether the animal you’re working with is a bird before performing bird-specific logic.</p><p>In this situation, it would be easy to fix this problem, to know if the animal provided is a bird or not, we would only need to check its name (or some sort of identifier).</p><p>This works because TypeScript can infer that the animal is a Bird by the return of our function, and therefore provides the correct type information. But it is not ideal, doesn't follow well DRY principles... For example if we need to do the same check in another place we would need to do the same  again...</p><p>And if someday we end up changing \"bird\" to \"eagle\", every file with this check would need to be updated. So how could we center the logic in order to be easier to maintain and re-use?</p><p>Simple! We can create a Type Guard, which is a function that is able to assert that a variable is from a specific type, making the process of checking types easier and centered in one place.</p><p>In practice, a Type Guard is a function that returns a boolean, and this boolean is the assertion if a variable is or not from a specific type.</p><p>If we want to create a Type Guard for the above scenario, it would be written this way:</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F85nm24ohy6mb3cx9fzm3.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F85nm24ohy6mb3cx9fzm3.png\" alt=\"Type guard to check bird\" width=\"800\" height=\"179\"></a>\nIf it returns  then animal is a Bird, if it is  it is a Dog.</p><p>The important part here is the  syntax, which is the core of a Type Guard. With it, we can use this function anywhere and our typings will be more powerful.</p><p>Let's try applying it to our previous example:</p><p>And as you can see, if it is  it enters the if statement, which has the correct type for Animal: Bird. TypeScript is able to assume that because of our type-guard :).</p><p>And TypeScript is smart, so if we add an else, then it would be considered a  on it!</p><p>A good detail is that the  syntax can be used in any function, even in callbacks!

Understanding key concepts like virtualization, scalability, and fault tolerance is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring seamless service delivery. Let’s dive into these essential terms and explore their impact on modern technology.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Virtualization: The Foundation of Modern IT\n</h3><p>Virtualization allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical machine, maximizing resource utilization and efficiency. Instead of using separate physical servers for different applications, businesses can create virtual machines (VMs) that operate independently on the same hardware. </p><p>This is made possible by a , software that manages virtual machines and allocates resources efficiently. Virtualization reduces hardware costs, improves flexibility, and enhances disaster recovery by enabling quick system backups and restorations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scalability: Preparing for Growth\n</h3><p>Scalability is all about handling growth effectively. A scalable system can expand to accommodate increased demand without performance degradation. There are two main types:</p><ul><li><strong>Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up):</strong> Enhancing an existing system by adding more power, like CPU or memory.</li><li><strong>Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out):</strong> Expanding capacity by adding more machines to share the workload.\nA well-designed scalable system ensures businesses can grow seamlessly without major infrastructure overhauls.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Agility: Adapting to Change Effortlessly\n</h3><p>Agility in IT refers to how quickly an organization can adjust to evolving demands, whether it’s new market trends or customer expectations. Cloud computing plays a vital role in agility by offering on-demand resources, fast deployment, and minimal downtime. Businesses that prioritize agility can innovate faster and stay ahead of the competition.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  High Availability: Keeping Systems Up and Running\n</h3><p>Nobody likes downtime, and that’s where high availability (HA) comes in. HA ensures that services remain operational, even in the face of hardware failures or network disruptions. By implementing redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing, businesses can minimize downtime and maintain customer trust.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Fault Tolerance: Ensuring Continuous Operations\n</h3><p>While high availability minimizes downtime, fault tolerance takes it a step further.

In this article, I'll guide you through configuring a .NET API with Keycloak, all running on Docker, to create a secure and scalable environment.</p><p>For simpler application cases, exploring .NET's built-in <a href=\"https://dev.to/marian_s/authorization-using-net-core-identity-2h7i\">authorization</a> and <a href=\"https://dev.to/marian_s/token-based-authentication-using-net-core-identity-30c7\">authentication</a> mechanisms using .NET Identity, as covered in some of my previous articles, might be sufficient and worth considering. These foundational approaches can provide the necessary security for many applications without the need for more complex solutions like Keycloak. However, as your application's requirements grow, integrating Keycloak can offer enhanced flexibility and scalability.</p><p>This article contains the following:</p><ol><li>Keycloack server configuration</li><li>Securing .NET API with Keycloack</li></ol><p>For this tutorial I am using .NET 9, Keycloak version 26.1.0 and Postgres version 17.4.</p><p>For the initial setup, all you need to do is to create a regular .NET API application with the default <code>WeatherForecastController</code> and with the default . Your should look something like this:</p><div><pre><code>dotnet restore dotnet build  /app/build\n\ndotnet publish  /app/publish /p:UseAppHost</code></pre></div><p>Now that you have the project setup, you need to add the following  file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This Docker file is self-explanatory. It has configuration for three services: the backend service on port , the Keycloak service on port , and the PostgreSQL database for storing Keycloak’s data on port . All three services use the  for communication, and the database uses a volume for persistent data storage.</p><p>To run this configuration, use the following command:</p><div><pre><code>docker compose up --build\n</code></pre></div><p>If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to navigate to  and see the login page for Keycloak’s management interface.</p><p>You can log in using the  and  defined in the Docker Compose file.

However, to keep this tutorial concise, I will focus only on the basic configuration.</p><p>Once you log in, you need to create a realm. A realm is a security domain that manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups, providing isolation between different applications or services. In my case, I am using the default realm — .</p><p>In order for an application to be able to use Keycloaks's services such as authorization, authentication and many more, it first needs to be registers inside the Keycloak service.

To enable this, we need to create a mapper. Go to the  configuration, then navigate to , select the  scope, and create the following mapper of type :</p><p>Now, fetch an access token from the following endpoint so you can test the authorization:</p><div><pre><code>curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n--data-urlencode 'client_id=net-web-api' \\\n--data-urlencode 'client_secret=HXduWLurrenfHLadKG71P1GbUKH2HG04' \\\n--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \\\n--data-urlencode 'audience=net-web-api'\n</code></pre></div><p>The  can be found in the  tab of the  client inside the management console.</p><p>Finally, use the token obtained previously to make a call to the  endpoint, and you should be able to get the result:</p><div><pre><code>curl --location 'http://localhost:5080/api/weatherforecast' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJVTDlhN25Fc3kzb0RVMGFhSVdSM3pWYkNwdEdsVnZOMjhMMFprdUJBVXVrIn0.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.Dv0u_z25t7YRrrCBtjjM6ETbmm7HuM2oAly3RBCpNFKMvellMieimFwUHfMIiKt0Ju6JUqr8KpTfX1aekBMSkRwcBDGTgs-TMByn-mNSawbTay1WAvrwYnSPPqgk4TJolmzFooNt-zw4uHAfBmf_Lg5KAwtM6_q2vTbUJmOUbUK-KupdwfT9q9poQ_ckBcnGAz3o-xAIMcwfnmOFWzF6aINZ6ZPrD4FiFeRrzXP6JePdvfFds3O514nFt4exV1rkEDXQMDTr7fK03TYQxXOlNXwOyWJf102eMRGwBxy7SQyibB0O9bIPZWUzjuXMP2kQ6hC9T1p-PZvUTYNUSOQz1g'\n</code></pre></div><p>In this article, I have demonstrated how to configure a Keycloak server and use it to secure a .NET API.

Among the filter options, we include a list of checkboxes for the client’s categories. Until now, we were making a  request to apply the filters, and everything was working fine—until a client with more than 100 categories started using the page.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: URL Length Limits\n</h3><p>When using  requests, filter parameters are sent via , which append data directly to the URL. While this approach works well for a small number of filters, it becomes problematic as the number of selected options grows. Some browsers and web servers impose strict limits on the maximum URL length they can handle, and exceeding these limits can lead to errors.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/url_display_guidelines/url_display_guidelines.md#url-length\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Chrome</a> limits URLs to a maximum length of 2MB. On the server side, web servers like <a href=\"https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#large_client_header_buffers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NGINX</a> limits URLs to  via the <code>large_client_header_buffers</code> directive. If a request exceeds this size, NGINX returns a  error.</p><p>In our case, since each selected category was appended to the URL as a separate query parameter:</p><div><pre><code>?filter[category_ids][]=1&amp;filter[category_ids][]=2&amp;filter[category_ids][]=3... # and so on\n</code></pre></div><p>the URL quickly grew beyond acceptable limits, leading to a  error.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Changing the Request to POST\n</h3><p>To prevent excessively long URLs, the first step was to change the request from  to , since  allows us to send data in the request body, keeping the URL short.</p><p>In the routes file, we needed to add a  route pointing to the controller's  action:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we updated the form:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When trying to use filters along with pagination, we encountered the following error:</p><div><pre><code>ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] \"/contacts/filter\"):\n</code></pre></div><p> makes a  request, but now we needed the request to be .</p><p>Additionally, I noticed that when no filters were applied, the generated link pointed to  (which needs to be ).

While it's true that only watching tutorials and coding without independent practice isn't enough, the real question is: how much learning is enough, and how do you balance it with real-world coding experience?</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge of Learning Too Much Without Applying It\n</h3><p>In today’s job market, developers are expected to master a wide range of skills, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to frameworks like React and tools like Tailwind or Sass. It can feel overwhelming trying to learn everything at once. I’ve spent a lot of time watching different tutorials and courses, and while they helped me understand concepts and best practices, I realized something crucial: watching alone isn't enough. </p><p>When I started solving challenges on Frontend Mentor, I encountered real-world coding issues that tutorials never fully prepared me for. Things like fixing unexpected bugs, centering elements properly, handling responsiveness, and refining my code structure weren’t as easy as they seemed in structured tutorials. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Power of Hands-On Practice\n</h3><p>I’ve completed over ten challenges so far, ranging from beginner-level to more advanced tasks. Through these challenges, I’ve discovered the importance of problem-solving, debugging, and thinking through solutions on my own. The act of struggling through an issue and eventually solving it has taught me more than any passive learning experience ever could. </p><p>Additionally, I test myself in different areas by mixing between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, and occasionally Sass. This approach keeps me flexible and helps me build a more well-rounded understanding of front-end development. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Finding the Right Balance\n</h3><p>What I’ve learned from this process is that I need to balance both learning and practice. My current approach is to spend about an hour watching a tutorial or reading an article to learn something new, followed by one to two hours working on challenges and writing code independently. This method allows me to reinforce what I learn while also improving my problem-solving skills. </p><p>One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that there’s no \"perfect\" time to start coding on your own. You don’t need to wait until you feel fully prepared because, in reality, no one ever feels 100% ready. The best way to learn is to start building, make mistakes, and learn from them. </p><p>There’s always more to learn in coding, but the key is to keep building and iterating. I’ve found that the more I code, the more I understand—and the more confidence I gain in my abilities. If you’re feeling stuck in tutorial hell, challenge yourself to build something from scratch. Even if it’s small, applying what you learn will deepen your understanding and make you a better developer.</p><p>At the end of the day, learning is a continuous journey. Balancing structured learning with hands-on coding is the best way to grow as a developer. So, if you’re still spending most of your time watching tutorials, take that first step—start building, start experimenting, and start solving real problems. That’s where true learning happens.</p><p>And hey, if breaking layouts counted as experience, I’d be a senior developer by now! 😆</p>","contentLength":3332,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"JS Craftsmanship Series: The Path to Pro-Level JavaScript","url":"https://dev.to/muthoni_muchiri_17933efd2/js-craftsmanship-series-the-path-to-pro-level-javascript-1bfk","date":1740251836,"author":"Sophie Muchiri","guid":9289,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>My JavaScript Journey  From Confusion to Clarity</strong></p><p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned about JavaScript, it’s that it can be hellishly confusing.</p><p>I remember the frustration, staring at error messages that made no sense, refreshing my browser hoping my code would magically fix itself, and wondering if I’d ever truly understand this language.

However, 2025 is shaping up to be the year of their resurgence. With modern browsers fully supporting the Web Components standard, and the growing need for framework-agnostic, reusable UI elements, developers are finally embracing them. But what’s driving this shift, and why are Web Components making a strong comeback?</p><h2><strong>1. The Framework Fatigue is Real</strong></h2><p>The web development landscape has been dominated by React, Angular, and Vue for years. While these frameworks provide powerful features, they also come with frequent breaking changes, steep learning curves, and heavy dependencies. Web developers are increasingly looking for a sustainable, lightweight solution that doesn’t lock them into a specific ecosystem. Web Components, being , offer an alternative that isn’t tied to any framework while still being compatible with them.</p><h2><strong>2. Native Browser Support is Solid</strong></h2><p>Initially, Web Components suffered from inconsistent browser support, leading to their slow adoption. However, as of 2025, all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) now fully support the Web Components standard <strong>without requiring polyfills</strong>. This means developers can confidently build and deploy components without worrying about cross-browser compatibility issues.</p><h2><strong>3. Performance and Lightweight Nature</strong></h2><p>Unlike JavaScript-heavy frameworks that rely on virtual DOM diffing and reconciliation, Web Components utilize the . Since they are built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript APIs, they lead to <strong>faster rendering and better performance</strong>. Additionally, they eliminate the need for bundling large dependencies, making them ideal for performance-critical applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example: Basic Web Component\n</h3><p>Here’s how you can create a simple Web Component:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can now use <code>&lt;hello-world&gt;&lt;/hello-world&gt;</code> in your HTML.</p><h2><strong>4. Interoperability Across Frameworks</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest advantages of Web Components is their ability to <strong>work across different frameworks</strong>. Developers can build a component once and use it in React, Vue, Angular, or even plain JavaScript projects. This is particularly beneficial for large enterprises managing multiple tech stacks, as they can create a  using Web Components instead of maintaining separate UI libraries for each framework.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example: Using Web Component in React\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Web Components can be seamlessly integrated with React, Vue, and Angular, making them a versatile option for UI development.</p><h2><strong>5. Standardization for Design Systems</strong></h2><p>Companies like Google (with Material Web Components) and Salesforce (with Lightning Web Components) are leading the way in using Web Components to <strong>standardize design systems</strong>. Instead of recreating the same UI components for each framework, businesses can now develop <strong>framework-independent UI libraries</strong> that maintain consistency across products.</p><h2><strong>6. The Rise of Edge Computing &amp; Micro Frontends</strong></h2><p>With the growing adoption of <strong>edge computing and micro frontends</strong>, the need for modular, independent UI components has increased. Web Components fit perfectly into this architecture by allowing teams to build self-contained, independently deployable UI pieces that integrate seamlessly across different applications.</p><h2><strong>7. Improved Developer Experience</strong></h2><p>The tooling and ecosystem around Web Components have improved significantly. Libraries like  (by Google) make it easier to write lightweight, performant Web Components. Additionally, modern development environments provide better support for native components, reducing friction in adopting them.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example: Creating a Web Component with Lit\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Using  simplifies the syntax and improves performance while keeping Web Components lightweight.</p><h2><strong>Should You Switch to Web Components?</strong></h2><p>While Web Components won’t replace frameworks like React or Vue overnight, they are certainly becoming an attractive choice for reusable UI components.

One minute you're deep in application code, crafting business logic in your Lambda functions, feeling productive and in the zone. The next minute you're jolted into infrastructure land, diving into CDK code to figure out why your permissions or environment variables aren't quite right.</p><p>I've spent the last three years building serverless applications, and I've felt this context-switching pain firsthand. That's why I want to share some patterns I've developed that help bridge these two worlds. In this post, we'll explore how to create a development experience where your tools work for you, not against you - particularly focusing on how to maintain type safety and confidence across both your application and infrastructure code.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge: Living in Two Worlds\n</h2><p>Picture this: you're implementing a new feature in your Lambda function. The code is flowing, TypeScript is catching potential bugs, your IDE is helping with intelligent autocomplete. Life is good. Then you realize you need to add a new environment variable and grant access to a new AWS service.</p><p>Suddenly, you're in a completely different context. You're navigating your CDK infrastructure code, which lives by different rules. It runs at deployment time, not runtime. It's still TypeScript, but it's speaking a different language - one of Constructs, Props, and CloudFormation templates under the hood. Your IDE doesn't help much because the two codebases are completely separate, and you're back in a world of \"find all\".</p><p>In a typical serverless application, these two worlds need to stay synchronized:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Infrastructure World (CDK)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Lives in your  directory</li><li>Defines the shape of your AWS resources</li><li>Controls permissions, environment variables, and configuration</li><li>Only comes alive during deployment</li><li>Mistakes here often only surface at runtime</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Application World (Lambda)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Lives in your  directory</li><li>Contains your actual business logic</li><li>Runs in response to events in AWS</li><li>Needs to know about decisions made in the infrastructure world</li><li>Has to trust that the environment variables and permissions are correctly set</li></ul></li></ol><p>The gap between these worlds is where many of our daily frustrations come from. Type safety works great within each world, but breaks down at the boundaries. Your IDE can't tell you if an environment variable is missing from your CDK code when you're writing your Lambda function. It can't warn you if you've forgotten to grant permissions that your code needs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Key Development Challenges\n</h3><p>The disconnect between these worlds creates several critical challenges:</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Configuration and Resource Access\n</h4><ul><li>Environment variables must be defined in CDK but aren't type-checked in Lambda code</li><li>Permissions are set in infrastructure but only validated during runtime</li><li>Resource names and ARNs defined in CDK need to match what the Lambda expects</li><li>Configuration errors only surface when the code actually runs</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Development Workflow Impact\n</h4><ul><li>Every infrastructure change requires mental context switching</li><li>Simple typos in environment variable names can slip through to production</li><li>Changes in CDK code can have non-obvious impacts on Lambda functionality</li><li>IDE features like \"Find References\" stop working at the boundary between worlds</li><li>More time spent verifying configurations than writing business logic</li><li>Reduced confidence when making infrastructure changes</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: Building a Bridge Between Worlds\n</h2><p>The key to solving these issues is to create a single source of truth that both worlds can understand. Let's take the simple case where a lambda needs to open a connection to a database. Both the database and the lambda are created in CDK. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Infrastructure World (CDK)\n</h3><p>First, we create a construct for the Database, with a grantAccess method that knows how to configure the lambda to access the database:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then when we create a lambda that needs this access:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Application World (Lambda)\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Create an enum for all the environment variables in your application:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And a library that loads all runtime values exporting them with the same names:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You will need to maintain consistency between these two files, and here's where unit testing helps. Yes, it's an extra context switch to a third yet mental space, but you have to do this only once:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Even though these pieces of code run at completely different times and in different contexts, they remain in sync because they're  referencing enums and constants that are in sync. This creates several benefits:</p><ul><li>Type safety across both worlds</li><li>IDE support for finding references and refactoring</li><li>Clear documentation of environment variable requirements</li><li>Early detection of configuration issues</li></ul><blockquote><p>Note that we could avoid the use of the  file and just invoke </p><pre><code></code></pre><p>in the lambda, but I find that this would make the code less testable and overall harder to read. Importing constants from environment.ts also ensures that we are always using the same constant name when we use this value, which improves consistency and readability across the codebase. </p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real World Example: Atlas MongoDB Integration\n</h2><p>Let's see how this pattern works in a real-world scenario with MongoDB Atlas integration. We are following best security practices in accessing the database, using <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/aws-iam-authentication/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IAM authentication</a>, and the database is accessible only from our VPC public IPs. We need to ensure a few things: that the lambda can assume the correct IAM role, that it runs in a VPC (the application has only one VPC), and that all the correct environment variable are set. </p><p>This example shows how to maintain type safety and clarity across both infrastructure and application code.</p><p>Ensure that both your infrastructure code and your lambda environments can access the common defintions by referencing them:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Infrastructure World: The Atlas Construct\n</h3><p>This CDK construct manages database access permissions and environment variables:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Infrastructure World: Using the Atlas Construct\n</h3><p>Here's how an Apollo Lambda construct gets its database access configured:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Application World: Lambda Runtime Code\n</h3><p>And here's how the Lambda code uses these environment variables to connect to Atlas, assuming the correct IAM role and refreshing credentials as required using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/client/sts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">STSClient </a>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This real-world example demonstrates how to maintain consistency across the infrastructure/application divide:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Early Validation in Both Worlds</strong></p><ul><li>CDK code validates VPC configuration at deploy time</li><li>Lambda code validates environment variables at startup</li><li>Type safety ensures consistency between both contexts</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>IAM roles with minimal required permissions</li><li>VPC requirement enforced at infrastructure level</li><li>Proper role assumption setup in application code</li><li>Secure credential handling</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Type-safe environment variable access</li><li>Clear error messages in both contexts</li><li>Centralized configuration</li><li>Connection reuse and expiration handling</li></ul></li></ol><p>At its core, this pattern isn't about type safety or configuration management - it's about making your development experience smoother and more productive. When we talk about developer experience in serverless applications, we're really talking about reducing the friction of working across these two worlds.</p><p>Think about your daily development flow. How much mental energy do you spend:</p><ul><li>Tracking down which environment variables are needed for a new Lambda?</li><li>Double-checking if you've configured all the permissions correctly?</li><li>Wondering if your infrastructure changes might break something in production?</li><li>Context-switching between your CDK and Lambda code?</li></ul><p>The patterns we've explored directly address these daily challenges. By creating a single source of truth and leveraging TypeScript's type system, we:</p><ol><li><p>: Focus on solving business problems instead of keeping track of configuration details. The type system remembers for you.</p></li><li><p>: Spend more time in flow state and less time context-switching between different parts of your application.</p></li><li><p>: Having strong typing across both worlds means you can move fast without breaking things.</p></li></ol><p>Yes, we get technical benefits like reduced runtime errors and better maintainability. But the real measure of success is in your daily development experience - those moments when you can make changes confidently, when your IDE helps you discover what you need to know, when you can focus on solving interesting problems instead of fighting with configuration.</p><p>After all, infrastructure code is more than just YAML and TypeScript - it's a critical part of your application that you interact with every day. Making it more intuitive and safer to work with isn't just about preventing errors; it's about creating an environment where you can do your best work.</p><p><em>This post is part of an ongoing exploration of AWS serverless development best practices, with a particular focus on enhancing the developer experience.

What I didn't mention at that time was that  wasn't my only contribution to that project. Shortly after that pull request got merged, I opened a second one. Once again, I created an issue, to report a bug, and a pull request, to solve the bug, back to back. However, this time I made them in the correct order. </p><p>The same project from the last article required me to enable ETags on the OData API that I was working on. An ETag is an HTTP header that's used for cache-invalidation and concurrency control. It's basically like a hash representing the state of the resource/data at said endpoint. The client may use it as a cache key and the server can use it for concurrency control when multiple requests attempt to update the resource at the same time. ETag values are based on a special field/column on the resource record that changes every time the record is updated. </p><p>Lets talk for a moment about how ETags help with concurrency control. There's a concept called <em>Optimistic Concurrency Control</em>. It's a non-locking mechanism that gets its name from the optimism of assuming that conflicts are very unlikely to occur. I like to think that it gets its name from the assumption that the user would be responsible enough to include the  header in the update request. This header, which holds the last known ETag value known by the client, is compared with the current value on the resource to detect conflicts. </p><p>Caching works in a similar manner. Client passes the ETag in a header called  in a GET request. If the value matches, the server sends back a  status. Otherwise it sends back the whole record. This reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up the response time. </p><p>In C#, a popular convention, but by no means a rule, for these concurrency check fields is to use a&nbsp;&nbsp;field called&nbsp; annotated&nbsp;with a&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute. The <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData</code> package has a lot of abstraction built in to simplify the generation and validation of ETags. If your model has concurrency fields set up correctly, it automatically picks them up and handles conversions. It even goes one step further and adds a field called  to the JSON response, rather than just putting it in the headers. <em>And even more importantly</em>, it gives you a these two prebuilt methods for computing and comparing ETags:</p><div><pre><code>queryOptions.IfMatch.ApplyTo(IQueryable query)\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>queryOptions.IfNoneMatch.ApplyTo(IQueryable query)\n</code></pre></div><p>The  method, which exists on the  class, has a  loop that iterates over all the concurrency properties and compares them one by one with the values on the actual record. As you might have already guessed, for each field, it was performing a simple equality comparison. Well and good, until you introduce array fields like 90% of the users like to. Meaning, the  and  headers were definitely not having the intended effect for what was undoubtedly the most popular use-case.</p><p>Initially, I thought it was just me and that I had configured something incorrectly. To make sure, I decided to take a look at the existing E2E tests for the ETag class. Surprisingly, not a single field in the model for the test was of the type . I proceeded to add one and sure enough, the test failed immediately. I went back to the  method and added a check inside the loop for array types. I added some code to handle the array condition and guess what? The tests passed.</p><p>I opened an <a href=\"https://github.com/OData/AspNetCoreOData/issues/1332\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issue</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/OData/AspNetCoreOData/pull/1334\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pull request</a> immediately. I added detailed instructions for reproducing the bug using the existing E2E ETag Test code. This happened at the very end of October. Since the team was busy creating releases for the already merged bugs, it took them as late as January to actually respond. They asked for more tests and I explained how I brilliantly modified an existing one. I thought they'd have a problem with me modifying an existing test since I myself didn't feel all that great about it but all I had really done was add a new field to the test and make sure that all the existing test cases were ignoring that field except for the one test case that actually needed it. </p><p>Luckily, a few days from that, they approved my changes and then another few days after that, they merged it. They are yet to make a release that includes this fix;  however, I'm hoping it's just around the corner because we are forced to use a fork in our project, instead of the NuGet package, solely because of this bug.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Got a problem that needs solving?\n</h2><p>➡️ </p>","contentLength":4544,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Capítulo 3.2 e 3.3: Criando Sua Própria Interface Funcional usando anotação","url":"https://dev.to/fundamentosjava/capitulo-32-e-33-criando-sua-propria-interface-funcional-usando-anotacao-1hl1","date":1740246026,"author":"FUNDAMENTOS JAVA","guid":9247,"unread":true,"content":"<p>No Java, qualquer interface com um único método abstrato já é considerada uma interface funcional.

By day’s end, they feel drained yet unproductive. Sound familiar? This chaos stems from </p>, the silent productivity killer. In this article, we’ll explore how —a time management strategy that groups similar tasks—can transform your workflow, boost focus, and maximize efficiency.  </p><p><p>\nTask batching is the practice of grouping related activities into dedicated time blocks. Instead of juggling emails, coding, and meetings sporadically, you might:  </p></p><ul><li>Reserve mornings for deep work (coding, debugging).\n</li><li>Handle communications (emails, Slack) post-lunch.\n</li><li>Schedule meetings in the afternoon.\n</li></ul><p>This method minimizes mental gear-shifting, allowing you to dive deeper into each task. </p><p><strong>The Hidden Cost of Context Switching</strong><p>\nResearch by the American Psychological Association reveals that multitasking can slash productivity by </p>. Every time you switch tasks, your brain expends energy reorienting—like a computer closing one program to open another. For developers, this might mean:  </p><ul><li>Losing 15–20 minutes of focus after an interruption.\n</li><li>Increased errors in code due to divided attention.\n</li><li>Mental fatigue from constant redirection.\n</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits of Task Batching for Developers</strong></p><p><strong>1. Reduced Cognitive Load</strong><p>\nGrouping similar tasks keeps your brain in the same “mode.” Writing code for three hours straight leverages your existing mental framework, whereas alternating between coding and meetings forces constant recalibration.  </p></p><p><strong>2. Deep Work and Flow State</strong>, argues that uninterrupted focus is essential for complex tasks. Batching creates windows for —a period of hyperfocus where developers produce their best work.  </p><p><p>\nBy designating specific times for emails or meetings, you signal to others (and yourself) when you’re available. This reduces ad-hoc interruptions, preserving your peak productivity hours.  </p></p><p><strong>4. Better Time Management</strong><p>\nBatching reveals how long tasks </p> take. You’ll avoid underestimating work (e.g., “I’ll just fix this bug quickly”) and create realistic schedules.</p><p><strong>How to Implement Task Batching</strong></p><p><strong>1. Audit and Categorize Tasks</strong></p><ul><li> Coding, debugging, architecture design.\n</li><li> Emails, code reviews, documentation.\n</li><li> Meetings, standups, retrospectives.\n</li></ul><ul><li> Deep work on high-priority features.\n</li><li> Meetings and collaboration.\n</li><li><strong>Late Afternoon (3 PM–5 PM):</strong> Shallow work and communications.\n</li></ul><ul><li>Use  modes on Slack/email.\n</li><li>Communicate your schedule to your team: <em>“I’m coding until noon but available after 1 PM for questions.”</em></li></ul><p><strong>4. Automate Repetitive Tasks</strong></p><ul><li>Use CI/CD pipelines for deployments.\n</li><li>Script routine tasks (e.g., data backups, testing).</li></ul><p><p>\nAllocate buffer time for urgent issues. For example, keep Friday afternoons flexible for unexpected tasks.  </p></p><p><strong>2. Managing Interruptions</strong><p>\nIf your team relies on instant responses, establish “office hours” for real-time help.  </p></p><p><p>\nStart small: batch emails into two daily check-ins. Gradually expand to coding blocks.  </p></p><p><strong>Tools to Support Batching</strong></p><ul><li> Organize tasks into boards.\n</li><li> Color-code time blocks.\n</li><li> Signal availability (“Deep Work Until 12 PM”).\n</li><li> Automate workflows (e.g., auto-responders).\n</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: Reclaim Your Productivity</strong><p>\nTask batching isn’t about rigid schedules—it’s about working smarter. By reducing context switches, you’ll unlock more time for creativity, fewer errors, and a greater sense of accomplishment. Start small, iterate, and watch your efficiency soar.  </p></p><p><em>Your codebase deserves your full attention. Give it the focus it needs.</em></p><p><p>\nReady to try task batching?

I've been diving deep into TypeScript lately, and I'm excited to share some of the incredible things I've discovered. I've been working on a fun little side project – a simulated pizza ordering system and a user management tool – and TypeScript has been a game-changer in keeping my code organized and efficient. Specifically, I want to talk about two TypeScript utility types that have dramatically improved my workflow: Partial and Omit. These might sound a bit abstract, but trust me, they are real lifesavers! These generic types have made my coding experience more flexible and less prone to errors. Let me show you how.</p><p>Section 1: The Project Context (Pizza &amp; User Management)</p><p>To give you some context, my project involves two main parts:</p><p>Pizza Ordering System: This handles creating a menu, taking orders, tracking order status, and managing the cash register.\nUser Management: This system deals with user data, roles, and actions like adding, updating, and filtering users.<p>\nManaging all of this data in a type-safe way could have been a nightmare, but TypeScript's powerful type system made it surprisingly smooth. Let me show you a few examples.</p></p><p>Section 2: The Pain Points (Without Partial and Omit)</p><p>Before discovering Partial and Omit, I was constantly running into issues when creating new objects or updating existing ones. I'd have to manually define complex types every time I wanted a slightly modified version of an object. It felt tedious and repetitive. It was like writing the same instructions again and again, even when the only changes were just minor tweaks. For instance, adding a new user meant providing every single property, even if some were optional. Updating a user meant creating a whole new object with the same properties if just one changed. It was far from ideal.</p><p>Section 3: Enter Omit - Streamlining User Creation</p><p>That's when I stumbled upon the Omit utility type. It's like a magic eraser for types! Omit lets you create a new type by excluding specific properties from an existing one.</p><p>In my user management system, every user has an id. However, when adding a new user, the id is generated automatically. So, I used Omit to create a special type that didn't need an id:</p><p>type User = {\n    id: number;\n    userRole: UserRole; // \"guest\" | \"user\" | \"admin\"</p><p>// Use Omit to create a type for adding a new user without an id\ntype NewUser = Omit;</p><p>let nextUserId = users.length + 1;\nfunction addNewUser(newUser: NewUser) {\n        id: nextUserId++,\n        username: newUser.username || \"Unknown\",<p>\n        userRole: newUser.userRole || \"guest\"</p>\n    };\n    console.log(<code>New user added: ${user.username} - ${user.userRole}</code>);\n}</p><p>//Example of use\naddNewUser({ username: \"Ernestoo2\", userRole: \"user\" });<p>\nExplanation Now, the addNewUser function only needs the username and userRole to create a new user, because the id is automatically generated. This prevents creating an incorrect user when we forget to add the Id. It makes the code cleaner and easier to read.</p></p><p>Section 4: Partial - Flexible User Updates</p><p>Then I discovered Partial. This utility type is the perfect tool for updating objects partially. It makes all properties optional, allowing you to only update what you need to without having to fill in all the details.</p><p>In my user management system, I realized that sometimes I only wanted to change a user's role or just their username, not all their information at once.

Writing a rudimentary “Hello, World!” program is frequently the first step in learning a new language since it gives you a better understanding of its syntax, execution mechanism, and fundamental features.</p><p>Examining “Hello, World!” in 50 different languages demonstrates the variety of programming paradigms, including declarative, procedural, object-oriented, and functional.</p><p>Learning new languages broadens your problem-solving abilities and enhances your comprehension of software development, regardless of your level of experience. The next stage is to move past “Hello, World!” and become proficient in the language of your choosing by experimenting with variables, loops, functions, and more.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading, hope you found it useful.

From defining key features to aligning the team around a cohesive roadmap, their guidance can make or break a project. Yet, despite the importance of this role, I’ve encountered a recurring issue: a lack of clear instructions and shifting expectations. While often unintentional, this ambiguity can disrupt workflows, drain motivation, and ultimately compromise the product’s quality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Importance of Clear Guidance\n</h2><p>When developers receive ambiguous or constantly changing instructions, uncertainty seeps into every stage of the development cycle. This uncertainty not only affects timelines and deliverables but also sows confusion throughout the organization. The primary goal is to create robust and maintainable solutions. Without concrete direction, even the most skilled engineers risk wasting time on features that diverge from the true vision.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Role of Well-Defined Requirements\n</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Avoiding Miscommunication</strong><p>\nComprehensive requirements serve as a universal reference, reducing misunderstandings and enabling targeted questions rather than guessing underlying goals.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlining Prioritization</strong><p>\nClear instructions allow teams to prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring work aligns with the product’s strategic vision without waiting for repeated clarifications.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nWell-documented requirements make it easier to measure progress and success, fostering transparency and trust within the team while simplifying the process of addressing roadblocks or re-scoping tasks.</p></p></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Personal Experiences with Ambiguity\n</h2><p>I have experienced firsthand how quickly confusion arises when expectations aren’t clearly communicated. These anecdotes are shared to illustrate how a lack of clarity can lead to significant rework and frustration, not to criticize any individual.</p><p>During an internship, I was assigned to \"implement a dev mode.\" Initially, I assumed this meant creating a toggle for developers to work on the product without interfering with production data. After spending considerable time on this assumption, I learned that the actual requirement was to enable compatibility for previews without an API key. Despite repeated requests for clarification, the answer remained vague: \"Just set up a dev mode.\"</p><p>The term “dev mode” was used without bridging the gap to the actual need—API key-free preview compatibility—which led to building a feature that did not meet the real requirement.</p><ul><li>Wasted hours on a feature that missed the mark.</li><li>Frustration from repeatedly seeking clarification.</li><li>Delayed delivery due to the need to backtrack and rewrite parts of the code.</li></ul><ul><li>Ask targeted questions, such as, \"Do you mean a mode that bypasses API authentication?\"</li><li>Request a simple user story or acceptance criteria to clarify requirements from the start.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Shifting Documentation Requirements\n</h3><p>In the same role, I was tasked with creating documentation for a new feature. Initially, a detailed written explanation was requested. After submitting my guide with code snippets and screenshots, the requirement changed to a code demonstration and later to video recordings.</p><p>The overall goal—comprehensive documentation—remained constant, but the chosen medium shifted multiple times without a clear plan.</p><ul><li>Repeatedly recreating documentation in various formats.</li><li>Uncertainty about which version was considered \"official.\"</li><li>Diminished morale from having to redo the same content multiple times.</li></ul><ul><li>Agree on a documentation format early, even if changes might occur later.</li><li>Clarify the intended audience (developers, QA, clients, etc.) to guide the appropriate format.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Handling Frequent Priority Shifts\n</h3><p>I have also witnessed projects suffer due to frequent changes in priorities. One week, the focus might be on a user-facing feature; the next, it pivots to backend optimization. While market feedback is essential, constant shifts can derail a team’s momentum.</p><ul><li>Tasks remain only partially completed.</li><li>Accumulation of technical debt due to rushed changes.</li><li>Communication breakdowns, where not everyone is on the same page about priorities.</li></ul><ul><li>External pressures from stakeholders or clients.</li><li>Overcommitment by saying “yes” to too many requests simultaneously.</li><li>A lack of a long-term vision, causing short-term decisions to override strategic planning.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Structure and Clarity Matter\n</h2><p>A clear roadmap and consistent requirements build trust among team members. When developers know what is expected, collaboration improves and knowledge sharing becomes seamless. Open dialogue is encouraged, and questions are viewed as constructive contributions rather than disruptions.</p><p>Well-defined requirements allow developers to focus on delivering features that truly meet user needs instead of interpreting vague instructions. This clarity accelerates development and enhances overall product quality by ensuring that everyone is aiming for the same target.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Enhancing Product Quality\n</h3><p>Stable, well-communicated requirements help each feature align with the overarching product vision. With clear goals, teams can iterate and refine purposefully, reducing the risk of releasing half-baked or inconsistent features that might confuse users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Additional Case Ideas &amp; Examples\n</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Hypothetical \"User Role\" Feature</strong></p><ul><li>Scenario: A product manager wants to introduce a new \"manager role\" in an application.\n</li><li>Ambiguity: It is unclear whether this role requires admin privileges or just elevated read permissions.\n</li><li>Impact: Without clear guidance, developers might build an overly permissive system that later needs restrictive adjustments.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Scenario: A \"quick prototype\" is requested to gather user feedback.\n</li><li>Ambiguity: It is uncertain whether the prototype should be production-ready or merely a proof-of-concept.\n</li><li>Impact: Misinterpretation could lead to spending unnecessary time on production-grade code for a prototype.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Scenario: There is an emphasis on optimizing page load times.\n</li><li>Ambiguity: The target performance metric (e.g., 1-second load time versus sub-500ms) is not clearly defined.\n</li><li>Impact: Developers might spend excessive resources on optimization without a clear performance benchmark.</li></ul></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Direct Message to Software Product Managers\n</h2><p>Based on my experiences, I offer the following suggestions:</p><ol><li>Define a clear vision before development begins. Spend time outlining what success looks like and provide user stories, acceptance criteria, and relevant diagrams or wireframes.</li><li>Communicate expectations explicitly. Avoid relying on ambiguous terms and encourage developers to ask clarifying questions.</li><li>Commit to decisions. While iterations are necessary, too many abrupt changes can stall progress. If a pivot is needed, explain why and how it affects the existing roadmap.</li><li>Respect the workflow. Understand that every requirement affects how developers structure their code. Provide ample notice and context before introducing significant changes.</li><li>Trust your team. Skilled professionals bring valuable perspectives. Allow them the space to contribute meaningfully and foster an environment where constructive criticism is welcomed.</li><li>Approach with patience and understanding. Recognize that mistakes are opportunities for growth and that every misunderstanding is a chance to improve communication.</li></ol><p>Creating and maintaining a successful product goes beyond having an innovative idea. It demands structured planning, transparent communication, and consistent execution. Product managers hold a critical role in ensuring that developers have the clarity they need to work efficiently. By defining clear goals, communicating expectations unambiguously, respecting established workflows, and trusting in the expertise of the team, product managers can cultivate an environment where software development truly flourishes.</p><p>My personal experiences underscore that assumptions and ambiguity can derail even the best-intentioned efforts. Clear communication is the cornerstone of productive collaboration, enabling teams to move forward with confidence and deliver products that fulfill their potential. Ultimately, we are all striving to build something valuable that meets users' needs and stands out in a competitive market. With a solid foundation of clarity and mutual respect, success becomes a shared achievement.</p><p>What has been your experience with unclear product requirements, and how can we improve communication in software development?

Can maintain state and update UI accordingly.</li></ul><p>A StatelessWidget is great when your UI doesn’t need to change dynamically. Think of displaying static text, icons, or images. But what happens when you need a widget to react to user interaction? That’s where StatefulWidgets shine.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is a simple counter app. If we made this a StatelessWidget, it wouldn’t work because  needs to change.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  \"Just Use State Management\" – A Misguided Statement\n</h3><p>Now, let’s address the biggest myth: <em>\"We don’t need StatefulWidgets because we have state management.\"</em></p><p>State management solutions like Provider, Riverpod, and Bloc are amazing for  state, but do we really need them for everything?</p><p>Imagine needing to track whether a button is pressed or a text field is focused. Are we supposed to create a Provider for that? Wrap everything in a ChangeNotifier? Dispatch Bloc events for every button press?</p><p>That’s like hiring a team of engineers to change a light bulb. Sure, it works, but why overcomplicate things?</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  When to Use StatefulWidgets\n</h4><ul><li>UI elements that only need local state (e.g., toggles, animations, text field controllers)</li><li>Keeping state within a widget that doesn't need to be shared</li><li>Simple interactive components like an expandable card or a dropdown menu</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  When to Use State Management\n</h4><ul><li>When state needs to be shared across multiple widgets (e.g., user authentication, themes, shopping cart data)</li><li>When managing complex business logic</li><li>When state persistence is required across screens</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The \"Necessary Evil\" Argument\n</h3><p>Yes, StatefulWidgets aren’t perfect. They have limitations, like lifecycle constraints and the potential for unnecessary rebuilds. But calling them  is like saying knives are bad because they can cut people—when, in reality, they’re essential for cooking.</p><p>A well-balanced Flutter app should use both StatefulWidgets and state management wisely. Blindly banning StatefulWidgets is like saying, \"We’ll only use screwdrivers from now on—no hammers allowed!\"</p><p>So, to my dear interviewer, if you’re reading this: I respectfully disagree. And to my fellow Flutter devs, don’t let anyone tell you StatefulWidgets are obsolete. They’re a necessary tool in your toolkit, and knowing when to use them makes you a better developer.</p><p>To all the Flutter developers out there—next time someone tells you <strong>StatefulWidgets should never be used</strong>, take a deep breath, smile, and know that you’re dealing with an extremist. Keep coding, keep learning, and use the right tools for the right job!</p><p>And as for my interview? Well… let’s just say I won’t be working there anytime soon.</p>","contentLength":3811,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Safeguarding Student Data: MeraSkool.com Security in School Management Software","url":"https://dev.to/nobullshit-coder/safeguarding-student-data-meraskoolcom-security-in-school-management-software-113n","date":1740235709,"author":"No Bullshit Coder","guid":9178,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Ensuring the highest level of data security is crucial for any school management software.

Launched in 2020, Solana aims to address the limitations of traditional blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, particularly in terms of speed and efficiency. At the heart of Solana’s architecture lies a groundbreaking mechanism known as , which plays a crucial role in enabling the platform’s impressive capabilities. This article delves into the intricacies of Solana, its unique features, and the innovative Proof of History mechanism that sets it apart from other blockchain solutions.</p><p>Solana was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and a team of engineers who sought to create a blockchain that could support high-throughput applications without sacrificing decentralization or security. The platform’s design is rooted in the belief that blockchain technology should be accessible, efficient, and capable of handling the demands of modern applications.</p><ol><li><p>: Solana can process over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), making it one of the fastest blockchains available. This high throughput is essential for applications that require quick transaction confirmations, such as trading platforms and gaming.</p></li><li><p> Transaction fees on Solana are typically a fraction of a cent, making it economically viable for users and developers. This low-cost structure encourages more users to engage with the network, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps).</p></li><li><p>: Solana’s architecture is designed to scale seamlessly with increasing demand. As more users join the network, Solana can maintain its performance without significant degradation, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.</p></li><li><p>: Solana employs robust security measures, including cryptographic techniques and a decentralized network of validators, to protect against attacks and ensure the integrity of the blockchain.</p></li></ol><p>Solana operates as a Layer 1 blockchain, meaning it processes transactions directly on its own network without relying on Layer 2 solutions. Its architecture consists of several key components:</p><ul><li><p>: The Solana network is composed of nodes that validate transactions and maintain the blockchain. Validators are responsible for confirming transactions and adding them to the blockchain. They are incentivized through rewards in the form of SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency.</p></li><li><p>: Solana uses a unique data structure that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of transaction data. This structure is optimized for high throughput and low latency.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Proof of History: The Heart of&nbsp;Solana\n</h3><p>Proof of History (PoH) is a unique consensus mechanism that allows Solana to create a verifiable historical record of events on the blockchain. By utilizing a series of SHA-256 hashes, PoH enables efficient transaction ordering and validation, significantly enhancing the network’s scalability and performance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How Proof of History&nbsp;Works\n</h3><p>Initial Hash Generation: When a transaction is submitted, the input data (e.g., “Alice sends 1 SOL to Bob”) is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size output of 256 bits (32 bytes) from any input data. This output is deterministic, meaning the same input will always yield the same hash.</p><p>For example, if we hash the string “Alice sends 1 SOL to Bob” using SHA-256, we get the following hash:</p><p><em><strong>H₀ = SHA-256(“Alice sends 1 SOL to Bob”) = 0x6f1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1</strong></em></p><p>Creating the PoH Sequence: For each subsequent transaction, the previous hash is combined with the new input data and hashed again. This creates a chain of hashes that represent the order of transactions.</p><p>For example, if Bob then sends 0.5 SOL to Alice, we would hash the previous hash along with the new transaction:</p><p><em><strong>H₁ = SHA-256(H₀ + “Bob sends 0.5 SOL to Alice”)</strong></em></p><p>Assuming the output of this hash is:</p><p><em><strong>H₁=0x7a2c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b2</strong></em></p><p>Next, if Alice sends another 0.2 SOL to Bob, we would hash again:</p><p><em><strong>H₂ = SHA-256(H₁ + “Alice sends 0.2 SOL to Bob”)</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>H₂=0x8b3c4b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b1c1e1c3b3</strong></em></p><p>: Nodes can verify the order of transactions by checking the hashes in the sequence. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the transaction order is confirmed. For instance, to verify Bob’s transaction, a node would check:</p><p><em><strong>Verify H₁ = SHA-256(H₀ + “Bob sends 0.5 SOL to Alice”)</strong></em></p><p>If the computed hash matches the stored hash H₁, the transaction is confirmed as valid.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of Proof of&nbsp;History\n</h3><ul><li><p>: PoH allows nodes to quickly verify the order of transactions without extensive communication, reducing the time required for consensus and enabling faster transaction processing.</p></li><li><p>: The combination of PoH and parallel processing allows Solana to achieve a sustained throughput of over 50,000 TPS, making it suitable for real-time applications.</p></li><li><p>: By trusting the timestamps encoded in the hashes, PoH minimizes the latency associated with transaction confirmations, leading to a smoother user experience.</p></li><li><p>: PoH enables Solana to scale effectively as the network grows, accommodating more users and applications without significant performance degradation.</p></li></ul><p>The Solana ecosystem is diverse and rapidly expanding, with numerous projects and applications across various sectors:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong>: Solana has become a popular platform for DeFi projects due to its speed and low transaction costs. Users can trade, lend, and borrow assets without the need for intermediaries.

Little did I know that that work would in the end result in  new distributions.  Each providing some useful sub-functionality of the REPL, but also providing useful functionality outside of the REPL context.</p><blockquote><p>Parallel to this effort, a <a href=\"https://github.com/raku/problem-solving/issues/459\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Problem Solving Issue</a> was created about the lack of configurability of the standard REPL, and a proof of concept <a href=\"https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/pull/460\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pull Request</a> was made by , which proved to be inspirational.</p></blockquote><p>But first, for the uninitiated, a small introduction.  The Raku standard REPL can be invoked by calling  from the command line without any arguments:</p><div><pre><code>$ raku\nWelcome to Rakudo™ v2025.01.\nImplementing the Raku® Programming Language v6.d.\nBuilt on MoarVM version 2025.01.\n\nTo exit type 'exit' or '^D'\n[0] &gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>And then you can enter Raku code and have it immediately executed.  For example:</p><div><pre><code>[0] &gt; my $a = 42\n42\n[1] &gt; say \"a = $a\"\na = 42\n[1] &gt; say $*0\n42\n[1] &gt; exit\n$\n</code></pre></div><p>The number between square brackets indicates the number of expression values that have been saved.  It is also the index at which the next expression value will be saved.</p><p>Note that that number went from  to  after the first line entered.  But  after the second line entered.  This is because the first line did  cause any output.  In that case, the REPL will show the value of the expression and keep it for future reference.</p><p>The second line entered  cause some output, so the value was  saved, and the index was  incremented.</p><p>Finally, the third line shows how you can refer to the originally saved value, by accessing the dynamic variable  (with the number corresponding to the index at which the value was saved).</p><blockquote><p>There is no help available in the standard REPL: it doesn't even have any commands!  The way to exit the REPL is to type \"exit\".  Which is in fact calling the Raku <a href=\"https://docs.raku.org/routine/exit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> function that exits the current process.</p></blockquote><p>Three months on since November 2024, the <a href=\"https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/REPL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> distribution provides a REPL that is ready for production (so to speak, as the use of this tool in production would be limited).</p><blockquote><p> is enough to install this distribution and all of its dependencies.</p></blockquote><p>The  distribution provides the same features as the standard Raku REPL, but also provides:</p><ul><li>configurable prompt through command line arguments and environment variables</li><li>REPL specific commands that can be entered by starting the line with \"=\" to distinguish them from Raku code</li><li>command shortcuts (\"=q\" being short for \"=quit\" to exit the REPL)</li><li>help sections for beginners (=introduction, =completions)</li><li>context-sensitive TAB completions</li><li>special purpose TAB completions (\\123 → ¹²³ → ₁₂₃, foo! → FOO → Foo, \\heart → 🫀 → 💓 → ...)</li><li>show stack trace (=stack), only makes sense if called when in the  sub</li><li>save code entered so far (=write)</li><li>reload code that was saved before (=read)</li><li>edit file inside the repl or code saved (=edit)</li><li>allow creation / switching between contexts (=context)</li><li>installs a command-line script  for direct access</li><li>provides a  role to facilitate further customization</li></ul><p>Over the coming months, a number of additional features will probably be added as well, depending on demand.  But first, let's have a look at one of the features.</p><p>When using the  command line script, one can customize the prompt with the  and  named arguments.  For example:</p><div><pre><code>$ repl --the-prompt='[:index:] :HHMM: :symbol: ' --symbols=🦋,🔥\nWelcome to Rakudo™ v2025.01.\nImplementing the Raku® Programming Language v6.d.\nBuilt on MoarVM version 2025.01.\n\nTo exit type '=quit' or '^D'.

This argument specifies what the  placeholder should be converted to.  This symbol indicates the state of the REPL with regards to code compilation.  Two states are currently recognized:</p><ul><li>ready to start new expression (in this example: 🦋, default \"&gt;\")</li><li>in the middle of a multi-line expression (in this example: 🔥, default \"*\").</li></ul><p>Note that the different states are separated by a comma in the specification.</p><p>If the  part does not contain a  placeholder, it will be automatically added at the end.

Docker-machine is a tool that helps you create and manage Docker hosts. Many times, these hosts run in a virtual machine. In such cases, you may not be able to reach your containers easily from your main computer. This is where port forwarding comes in. In this article, we will learn how to set up port forwarding in docker-machine. I try to use simple words and short sentences so it is easy to follow.</p><p>Docker-machine makes it simple to run Docker on many environments. It creates a virtual machine on your computer or in the cloud. However, when you use a virtual machine, the ports used by your containers are not automatically open on your host computer. To access your containers from your host, you need to forward ports from the virtual machine to your computer. This process is called port forwarding.</p><p>Port forwarding helps you send traffic from a port on your host machine to a port on the virtual machine. This allows you to test your applications in a container and access them as if they were running on your computer. For more details on how container ports work, you can read about <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-docker-container-ports-and-how-do-they-work.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">understanding Docker container ports</a>.</p><p>Docker-machine is a tool that creates and manages Docker hosts. It is useful when you want to run Docker on a local virtual machine or on cloud platforms. When you run docker-machine, it creates a virtual machine using a driver like VirtualBox. Once the machine is ready, you can use it to run your Docker containers.</p><p>Because docker-machine creates a separate virtual machine, the IP address of this machine is different from your computer’s IP address. To access services running inside the machine, you must know its IP address. You can get this by running:</p><div><pre><code>docker-machine ip default\n</code></pre></div><p>Here, \"default\" is the name of your docker-machine. This command shows the IP address of your Docker host.</p><p>Port forwarding is a method to redirect network traffic. In our case, it means sending traffic from a port on your host machine to a port on the virtual machine created by docker-machine. By doing this, you can access the container’s application from your host computer. For example, if a web server runs on port 8080 inside the container, you can forward this port so that it is available on your host machine as well.</p><p>This idea is very similar to <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-expose-ports-in-docker-containers.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exposing ports in Docker containers</a>. However, with docker-machine, an extra step is needed because of the virtual machine layer. You have to set up rules to forward the traffic correctly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Port Forwarding Works in docker-machine\n</h2><p>When docker-machine creates a virtual machine, it usually sets up a Network Address Translation (NAT) connection. NAT hides the virtual machine behind a private network. With NAT, the ports used by containers are not automatically accessible from the host computer.</p><p>To allow communication, you must create port forwarding rules. These rules tell the virtual machine to listen on a specific port on its host interface and then pass the traffic to a specific port on the container. For example, you may want to forward port 8080 on your computer to port 8080 in a container running inside the virtual machine.</p><p>A good explanation on <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-expose-docker-container-ports-to-the-host.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exposing container ports to the host</a> can help you understand why this step is necessary. It shows that without port forwarding, the service in the container remains hidden.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Port Forwarding in VirtualBox\n</h2><p>Most docker-machine users use VirtualBox as the virtual machine driver. In VirtualBox, you can set up port forwarding using the VirtualBox command-line tool called VBoxManage or by using the VirtualBox graphical user interface (GUI).</p><p>If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use VBoxManage. First, find the name of your docker-machine. It is often \"default\" unless you have changed it. Then run a command like this:</p><div><pre><code>VBoxManage modifyvm </code></pre></div><p>Let’s break down the command:</p><ul><li><strong>VBoxManage modifyvm \"default\"</strong> tells VirtualBox to modify the settings of the virtual machine named \"default\".</li><li><strong>--natpf1 \"tcp-port8080,tcp,,8080,,8080\"</strong> sets a NAT port forwarding rule.\n\n<ul><li>The rule is named \"tcp-port8080\".</li><li>The first \"tcp\" indicates the protocol.</li><li>The first empty field means the host IP is not specified (it listens on all interfaces).</li><li>The second \"8080\" is the port on the host.</li><li>The next empty field means the guest IP is not specified.</li><li>The final \"8080\" is the port on the virtual machine.</li></ul></li></ul><p>This command forwards traffic from port 8080 on your host computer to port 8080 on the docker-machine virtual machine.</p><p>If you prefer a graphical interface:</p><ol><li>Select your docker-machine virtual machine (often named \"default\").</li><li>Click on  and then .</li><li>Add a new rule with the following details:\n\n<ul><li> Leave empty or 127.0.0.1</li></ul></li></ol><p>This does the same as the VBoxManage command and forwards port 8080.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Running a Container with Port Forwarding\n</h2><p>After setting up port forwarding on your virtual machine, you can run a container in docker-machine as usual. For example, if you want to run a web server on port 8080, you can use:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  8080:80  my_webserver nginx\n</code></pre></div><p>This command does the following:</p><ul><li> runs the container in detached mode.</li><li> maps port 8080 on the virtual machine to port 80 inside the container.</li><li> gives the container a name.</li><li> is the image used (running a web server).</li></ul><p>Now, with port forwarding set up in VirtualBox, you can access the web server from your host computer by going to . The request goes to your host computer, then is forwarded by VirtualBox to the docker-machine virtual machine, and finally reaches the container on port 80.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Troubleshooting Port Forwarding Issues\n</h2><p>Even when you follow the steps, you might face some problems. Here are a few common issues and their fixes:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Incorrect Port Numbers\n</h3><p>Make sure you use the same port numbers in your port forwarding rule and in your docker run command. If you forward host port 8080, then your container should be mapped accordingly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Virtual Machine Not Running\n</h3><p>Before accessing your service, ensure that your docker-machine is running. Use the command:</p><p>This shows the status of your machines. If your machine is not running, start it with:</p><div><pre><code>docker-machine start default\n</code></pre></div><p>Your host computer’s firewall may block the forwarded port. Ensure that port 8080 is allowed. You may need to adjust your firewall settings.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Conflicting Applications\n</h3><p>If another application is using port 8080 on your host, you may need to change the host port in your forwarding rule. For example, you can set the rule to forward port 9090 instead:</p><div><pre><code>VBoxManage modifyvm </code></pre></div><p>And run the container with:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  8080:80  my_webserver nginx\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, access the service at .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Port Forwarding in docker-machine\n</h2><p>Here are some tips to make port forwarding work smoothly in docker-machine:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Use Consistent Port Numbers:</strong><p>\nAlways use the same port numbers in your Docker run commands and in your VirtualBox settings. This helps avoid confusion.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nWrite down the port forwarding rules you create. It will help you remember which ports are forwarded if you need to update your configuration later.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Check Docker-Machine Status Regularly:</strong> to ensure your virtual machine is running properly.</p></li><li><p><p>\nAfter setting up port forwarding, test your application by accessing the forwarded port in your web browser. This confirms that the rules are correct.</p></p></li></ul><p>For more advanced setups, you can also look at <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-use-docker-with-cloud-environments-aws-gcp-azure.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">using Docker with cloud environments</a>. This article explains how Docker can work with cloud providers and may give you ideas if you want to move beyond a local VirtualBox setup.</p><p>Let’s walk through a real-world example. Imagine you are developing a web application that runs inside a Docker container. You use docker-machine with VirtualBox on your laptop. You want to see your application in a web browser on your host computer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Create and Start Docker-Machine\n</h3><p>If you do not already have a docker-machine, create one using:</p><div><pre><code>docker-machine create  virtualbox default\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>docker-machine start default\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Set Up Port Forwarding\n</h3><p>Using VirtualBox’s command line, run:</p><div><pre><code>VBoxManage modifyvm </code></pre></div><p>This rule forwards traffic from port 8080 on your host to port 8080 on the docker-machine.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Run Your Web Application Container\n</h3><p>Run your container with port mapping:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  8080:80  my_web_app nginx\n</code></pre></div><p>This command maps port 8080 on the docker-machine (forwarded from your host) to port 80 in the container.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Access Your Application\n</h3><p>Open your web browser and go to:</p><p>Your request goes to your host computer, is forwarded to the docker-machine virtual machine, and finally reaches the container running the Nginx web server. You should see the default Nginx welcome page.</p><p>This scenario shows how port forwarding makes it possible to work with docker-machine easily.

Always check the documentation for your chosen driver.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple Forwarding Rules:</strong><p>\nYou can forward more than one port. Repeat the process with different port numbers for each service you want to access.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nWorking with docker-machine and port forwarding can be managed via the Docker CLI.

Ensure that only the necessary ports are forwarded and that your firewall settings are correctly configured.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Testing Your Configuration:</strong><p>\nAfter making changes, always test your configuration by accessing your application. Simple tools like </p> can help you check connectivity from the command line.</p></li></ul><p>Port forwarding in docker-machine is an important skill for anyone using Docker with virtual machines. By setting up port forwarding, you can access your containerized applications easily from your host computer. We learned that docker-machine creates a virtual machine where Docker runs. Because the virtual machine has its own IP address, you must forward ports so that services inside containers are reachable.</p><p>We also learned how to set up port forwarding using VirtualBox. You can use the VBoxManage command line tool or the VirtualBox GUI to create rules that forward traffic from your host machine to the docker-machine. In our example, we forwarded port 8080 and ran an Nginx container to demonstrate how it works.</p><p>Remember to use consistent port numbers and test your setup often.

In this article, we will learn how to persist data in a dockerized Postgres database using Docker volumes. I will use simple words and short sentences so it is easy to follow. This guide is written for beginners who work with Docker and databases.</p><p>Postgres is a popular database. Many people use it to store application data. When you run Postgres in a Docker container, by default, the data is stored inside the container. If the container is removed or crashes, you can lose your data. That is why data persistence is very important.</p><p>Docker volumes let you store data outside the container. This means that even if you delete the container, your data remains safe.

Containers are designed to be ephemeral. If you update the container or rebuild your image, the data may vanish. By using volumes, you can make your data persist independently of the container lifecycle.</p><p>There are many benefits to data persistence:</p><ul><li> Data remains even when the container is deleted.</li><li> You can easily move your data between containers or nodes.</li><li> It is easier to backup the data stored in volumes.</li></ul><p>Docker volumes are storage areas that exist outside of the container’s writable layer. They can be managed by Docker and are independent of the container lifecycle. Volumes are the recommended way to persist data.</p><p>Here are some key points about volumes:</p><ul><li>They are stored on the host machine.</li><li>They can be easily backed up or moved.</li><li>They work across container updates and removals.</li></ul><p>When you use volumes, the data for your Postgres database will be stored on your host and will not be deleted when the container is removed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up a Dockerized Postgres Database\n</h2><p>Let us start by creating a simple Docker command to run a Postgres container. Open your terminal and run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  my_postgres mysecretpassword  postgres\n</code></pre></div><p>This command does the following:</p><ul><li>Runs a container from the official Postgres image.</li><li>Sets the password for the Postgres user.</li><li>Runs the container in detached mode.</li></ul><p>At this point, the database is running. However, if you stop and remove the container, the data will be lost.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using Volumes for Data Persistence\n</h2><p>To persist data, you need to add a volume to the container. You can do this with the  flag. Here is an example:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  my_postgres mysecretpassword  pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres\n</code></pre></div><p>Let us break down the new part of this command:</p><ul><li>The flag <code>-v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data</code> tells Docker to create (or use an existing) volume named .</li><li> is the default directory in Postgres where the database stores its files.</li></ul><p>Now, any data that Postgres writes to this directory is stored in the  volume. Even if the container is deleted, the volume will still exist and keep your data safe.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using Docker Compose for Better Management\n</h2><p>For development and production, it is common to use Docker Compose. With Docker Compose, you can manage multiple containers and set up volumes in a clear and organized way.</p><p>Create a file called  with the following content:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This file defines a Postgres service with:</p><ul><li>A volume named  mounted to the directory where Postgres stores data.</li><li>Port mapping so you can access the database from your host on port 5432.</li></ul><p>Using Docker Compose makes it easier to start, stop, and manage your containers. You can start the service by running:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Backing Up and Restoring Your Data\n</h2><p>One benefit of using volumes is that they can be easily backed up. To backup your Postgres data, you can use the  command with volume mounting. For example:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  pgdata:/data :/backup alpine czvf /backup/pgdata_backup.tar.gz  /data </code></pre></div><p>This command does the following:</p><ul><li>Runs a temporary Alpine container.</li><li>Mounts the  volume to  inside the container.</li><li>Mounts the current directory to  inside the container.</li><li>Creates a compressed backup file of the volume.</li></ul><p>To restore the backup, you can run a similar command in reverse:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  pgdata:/data :/backup alpine sh </code></pre></div><p>Backing up your data is crucial for production environments. With volumes, backups become much more manageable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Data Persistence with Postgres\n</h2><p>When working with dockerized databases, keep these best practices in mind:</p><ol><li><p><p>\nDo not store your database data in the container’s file system. Always use volumes to ensure data persistence.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nSchedule regular backups of your volumes. This way, you can restore data in case of failure.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nUse Docker commands to list and inspect your volumes periodically. It helps in managing storage and detecting issues early.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nProtect your volumes by setting proper permissions and using secure storage solutions when needed.</p></p></li></ol><p>By following these practices, you can maintain a robust and reliable database in your Docker environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Troubleshooting Common Issues\n</h2><p>Sometimes, you may run into issues when persisting data. Here are some common problems and solutions:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Volume Not Persisting Data\n</h3><p>If you see that data is not being saved, check that:</p><ul><li>The volume is mounted to the correct directory ().</li><li>The container is using the correct volume name.</li><li>You have not accidentally overridden the volume mount in your Docker Compose file or run command.</li></ul><p>Postgres may have issues with file permissions on the volume. To fix this:</p><ul><li>Ensure that the volume’s permissions match what Postgres expects.</li><li>You might need to adjust the user or group settings in your container.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Backup and Restore Failures\n</h3><p>If your backup or restore commands fail:</p><ul><li>Double-check the paths you use in your  commands.</li><li>Make sure that the volume is not being used by another container during the backup.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Example: Using a Dockerized Postgres with Persistent Data\n</h2><p>Imagine you are building an application that uses Postgres to store user data. You need to make sure that every time you update your application, the data remains intact.

When you work with Docker Swarm, you may need to share data between containers. This is done using volumes. Volumes are used to store data and make it persistent. In a simple Docker setup, volumes work well because they are local to one machine. But Docker Swarm runs on multiple nodes. In this article, we explain how Docker Swarm handles volume sharing. I use simple words and short sentences so it is easy to understand.</p><p>Docker volumes are storage areas that hold data outside the container’s writable layer. They are very important because they keep your data safe even if the container stops or is deleted. Volumes are useful for databases, log files, or any data that must persist.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Volume Sharing in a Single Docker Host\n</h2><p>On one machine, sharing data between containers is simple. You can create a volume and mount it to multiple containers. This lets the containers share files and information. There is a clear method to do this. For example, you may use the command:</p><div><pre><code>docker volume create shared_volume\n</code></pre></div><p>Then, you can attach the volume to two or more containers. When containers share a volume, changes made by one container are available to the others. If you want to know more about sharing data, please read <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-share-data-between-docker-containers-using-volumes.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to share data between docker containers using volumes</a>. This article gives a practical view of the process.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Docker Swarm and Its Special Case for Volumes\n</h2><p>Docker Swarm is made to manage containers across different machines or nodes. In a swarm, services are spread out over many hosts. Each node in a swarm has its own local storage. This makes volume sharing more challenging because volumes created on one node are not automatically available on other nodes.</p><p>By default, Docker Swarm does not share volumes across nodes. This means that if you create a volume on one node, containers running on another node will not see that volume. To overcome this, you need to use external storage systems or volume plugins that allow sharing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Options for Sharing Volumes in Docker Swarm\n</h2><p>There are several methods to share volumes in a Docker Swarm environment:</p><ol><li><p><p>\nYou can use a shared storage system like NFS (Network File System) or GlusterFS. This shared storage is mounted on every node in the swarm. With this method, all nodes have access to the same data. It is a common solution in production systems.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nDocker supports third-party volume plugins. These plugins can manage storage across multiple nodes. They allow you to create volumes that are available to every node in your swarm. Using a volume plugin makes the setup easier for volume sharing.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nIn Docker Swarm, you can create named volumes that point to an external source. This is useful when you want a consistent volume name across different nodes. Learn more about this idea in </p><a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-named-volumes-in-docker.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are named volumes in docker</a>. Named volumes give you a clear way to refer to shared storage in your configuration.</p></li></ol><p>Each of these methods has benefits and limitations. The best choice depends on your use case and the storage system available in your environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Create and Use Docker Volumes\n</h2><p>Before using volumes in Swarm, it is good to know how to create and use them in a single Docker host. The process is simple. You run:</p><div><pre><code>docker volume create my_volume\n</code></pre></div><p>After you create the volume, you can use it in a container by adding the  flag. For example:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  my_volume:/data my_image\n</code></pre></div><p>This command mounts the volume called  to the container’s  directory. For a more detailed guide on creating and using volumes, see <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-create-and-use-docker-volumes.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to create and use docker volumes</a>. This tutorial explains every step in a clear manner.</p><p>In a swarm, you include the volume in your service definition. When you create a service, you can specify the volume like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>However, remember that in a swarm, if the service runs on a different node than where the volume was created, the volume must be available on that node too. This is where external storage or volume plugins come into play.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using Storage Drivers in Docker Swarm\n</h2><p>Docker uses storage drivers to manage the file system of volumes. These drivers help Docker manage image layers and volume data. When you use a storage driver that supports shared storage, it can help Docker Swarm work with volumes more effectively.</p><p>For instance, a storage driver might integrate with a network file system so that data is the same on every node. To learn more about these drivers and how they work, please check out <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-use-docker-storage-drivers.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to use docker storage drivers</a>. This article explains how storage drivers manage data and help with volume sharing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations in Volume Sharing\n</h2><p>Even with the methods mentioned, volume sharing in Docker Swarm has some challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Local vs. Shared Volumes:</strong><p>\nBy default, volumes are local. This means that if a container is restarted on a different node, it may lose access to its local volume. External shared storage is needed to overcome this.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nWhen multiple containers write to the same volume, you need to ensure that data remains consistent. Some storage systems offer locking and other mechanisms to help with this.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nUsing network storage or volume plugins may introduce extra latency compared to local storage. It is important to test the performance in your environment.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nSetting up external storage or volume plugins can be more complex than using local volumes. You must ensure that every node in your swarm can access the shared storage system.</p></p></li></ul><p>Understanding these challenges is important when designing your swarm architecture. Testing and monitoring are key parts of managing a production system with shared volumes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Example: Sharing Data in a Swarm Service\n</h2><p>Let’s look at a simple example. Suppose you have a swarm service that runs a web application. The application needs to serve static files that are stored on a shared volume. One way to set this up is:</p><ol><li><p><p>\nConfigure an NFS server or another shared file system that is accessible from all nodes in the swarm.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nIn your swarm configuration, create a named volume that uses the external storage. For example, in your service definition you might have:</p></p></li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the volume  uses NFS to mount a shared directory. Every container running the  service will have access to the same static files.</p><ol><li>\nDeploy the service using Docker Swarm. Because the volume is shared, even if a container is moved to a different node, it still has access to the static files.</li></ol><p>This example shows how volume sharing works in a swarm when you use an external storage solution.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Volume Sharing in Docker Swarm\n</h2><p>When planning to use volume sharing in Docker Swarm, here are some best practices:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Plan Your Storage Solution:</strong><p>\nDecide if you need external storage like NFS or if a volume plugin fits your needs. Your choice depends on the scale and performance requirements of your system.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nNamed volumes provide clarity in your configuration and can be easily referenced in your service files. They also help when you switch nodes. Read more about the benefits of named volumes in </p><a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-named-volumes-in-docker.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are named volumes in docker</a>.</p></li><li><p><p>\nAlways test volume sharing before deploying in production. Verify that containers on different nodes can access the shared volume without issues.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Monitor Performance and Consistency:</strong><p>\nKeep an eye on performance. Network storage may slow down your system. Use monitoring tools to ensure data consistency and access speed.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Document Your Configuration:</strong><p>\nWrite down how your volumes are set up. Clear documentation helps when troubleshooting or scaling your swarm.</p></p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Summary and Final Thoughts\n</h2><p>Docker Swarm is a powerful tool for managing containers on multiple machines. However, volume sharing in a swarm is not as simple as on a single host. By default, volumes are local to each node. To share data between containers across nodes, you must use external storage or volume plugins.</p><p>In conclusion, Docker Swarm does not share volumes automatically between nodes. You must use a shared storage solution or a volume plugin that supports multi-node access. This approach ensures that your data remains consistent and accessible, regardless of where your containers are running.</p><p>Keep your configuration simple and test your setup often. With careful planning and the right storage solution, you can successfully implement volume sharing in a Docker Swarm environment. This will help your services work together seamlessly and keep your data safe.</p><p>Happy containerizing and best of luck with your Docker Swarm projects!</p>","contentLength":8530,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Page Objects vs. Functional Helpers","url":"https://dev.to/muratkeremozcan/page-objects-vs-functional-helpers-2akj","date":1740228253,"author":"Murat K Ozcan","guid":9132,"unread":true,"content":"<h3><strong>Page Objects vs. Functional Helpers</strong></h3><p>A while ago, I published <a href=\"https://dev.to/muratkeremozcan/functional-test-patterns-with-cypress-27ed\">Functional Programming Test Patterns with Cypress</a>, where I went in-depth on <strong>why page objects are unnecessary in modern test automation</strong>.

In every project, a Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image. A Dockerfile is a plain text file with a list of instructions. Two important instructions are  and . At first glance, they seem very similar. But they have differences that can affect how your image is built.</p><p>In this article, I will explain both commands in simple words. I will also show examples and best practices. This guide is for beginners who are learning Docker. I try to use simple sentences and a friendly tone. You can learn more about Dockerfiles in this <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-is-the-dockerfile-and-how-do-you-create-one.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide on creating a Dockerfile</a> which explains the basics.</p><p>A Dockerfile is like a recipe. It tells Docker how to build your image step by step. Each instruction creates a new layer in your image. The final image contains all the layers from the instructions. The Dockerfile can include commands to copy files, install programs, and set up the environment. Understanding the Dockerfile is very important. If you want to know more about how images are built, check out <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-do-you-build-a-docker-image-from-a-dockerfile.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile</a> for clear steps.</p><p>The  command is used to copy files or directories from your host computer (or build context) to the image. It is very simple and does exactly what it says. No extra work is done by COPY.</p><p>When you write a Dockerfile, you use COPY like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This instruction tells Docker to copy the contents of  on your computer into  in the image. COPY does not unpack files or do any processing. It just copies the data.</p><ul><li> COPY only copies files. It does not add extra functionality. This makes it predictable and easy to understand.</li><li> With COPY, you know exactly what is being copied.</li></ul><p>The  command looks like COPY but has extra features. In addition to copying files, ADD can do more. It can automatically extract compressed files and even fetch files from remote URLs.</p><p>A simple ADD command looks like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, ADD not only copies the file  but also automatically extracts it into . This is something COPY does not do.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Additional Features of ADD\n</h3><ul><li> If the source is a compressed file (for example, a .tar or .tar.gz file), ADD will automatically extract its contents into the destination directory.</li><li> ADD can copy files from a remote URL. For example, you could write:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>  ADD https://example.com/file.txt /destination_folder/file.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>However, using ADD with URLs is not always recommended because it can make your build less predictable.</p><ul><li> Use ADD when you need to automatically extract an archive during the image build.</li><li> If you really need to fetch a file from a URL (although it is better to use a separate script for this task), ADD can do that.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Differences Between COPY and ADD\n</h2><p>Even though both COPY and ADD copy files into an image, they are not the same. Here are the key differences:</p><ol><li><ul><li> simply copies files or directories. It does not do any extra processing.</li><li> copies files and can also extract compressed files. It may also fetch files from URLs.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> is clear and simple. It is the best choice if you only need to move files.</li><li> has extra features that can make your Dockerfile less obvious. It is best used only when its extra functions are needed.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Both commands create image layers. However, using ADD to extract archives may result in more layers or a larger image if not managed carefully.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>For most cases, it is best to use  because it is more predictable.</li><li>Use  only if you need to extract an archive or download a file. Avoid using ADD for simple file copying tasks.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Choosing the right command can help in keeping your image simple and efficient. For more on how Docker images are created and why commands matter, see <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-do-docker-images-get-created.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the process of creating Docker images</a>.</p><p>Let’s look at some examples that show the difference between COPY and ADD.</p><p>Suppose you have a directory called  in your project. You want to copy it to your image. Your Dockerfile might include:</p><div><pre><code>npm </code></pre></div><p>This Dockerfile uses COPY to move the  folder into the image. It is simple and does one task.</p><p>Now, imagine you have an archive file called . You want the contents of this archive in the image. Your Dockerfile can include:</p><div><pre><code>npm </code></pre></div><p>With ADD, Docker will automatically extract  into the working directory. This is convenient if you need to extract compressed files.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices When Using COPY and ADD\n</h2><p>As a beginner, it is important to follow best practices. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li><p><p>\nUse COPY when you only need to copy files or directories. It is more predictable and easier to understand.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Use ADD Only for Its Extra Features:</strong><p>\nUse ADD when you need to extract a compressed file automatically or when you have a strong reason to download a file from a URL. For normal file copying, COPY is sufficient.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Keep Your Dockerfile Simple:</strong><p>\nSimple Dockerfiles are easier to maintain. The more complicated your Dockerfile is, the harder it can be to troubleshoot.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Be Aware of Image Layers:</strong><p>\nEvery instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. Using ADD to extract files may result in more layers than necessary. For tips on keeping your image efficient, check out </p><a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-optimize-docker-images-for-performance.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">optimizing Docker images</a>.</p></li><li><p><p>\nComment in your Dockerfile why you chose COPY or ADD. This is helpful for other developers who read your file.</p></p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Impact on Docker Image Layers\n</h2><p>Each command in a Dockerfile creates a new image layer. This is very important because layers affect the size and performance of your image. Using COPY and ADD in the right way can make your image smaller and faster.</p><p>When you use COPY, the file is simply added to the image as a new layer. With ADD, if you extract a file, the resulting files are also added as new layers. Understanding these layers can help in optimizing your build process. For more detailed information on image layers, you can read <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-is-a-docker-image-layer-and-why-does-it-matter.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article on Docker image layers</a>.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How the Build Process Works\n</h2><p>The Docker build process reads the Dockerfile line by line. Each instruction adds a new layer on top of the previous ones. This process is very important for both COPY and ADD.</p><p>For example, if you change a file that was copied with COPY, Docker may be able to use a cached layer for the earlier commands. This speeds up the build process. When using ADD to extract an archive, changes in the archive may force a rebuild of that layer, which can slow down the build.</p><p>In summary, here is a simple guideline for choosing between COPY and ADD:</p><ul><li><ul><li>When you need to copy files or directories from your build context to the image.</li><li>When you do not need to extract files or download content.</li><li>When you want a simple and clear Dockerfile.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>When you have a compressed file (such as a .tar or .tar.gz) and you want it automatically extracted.</li><li>When you have a special need to download files from a URL (though this is not common and may lead to unpredictable builds).</li></ul></li></ul><p>This guideline can help keep your Dockerfiles clean and your images efficient.</p><p>Imagine you have a web application project. Your project folder has a directory called  with your source code and a compressed file called  that contains static assets.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Using COPY for the Source Code\n</h3><p>Your Dockerfile might start like this:</p><div><pre><code>pip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>Here, COPY is used to move your source code to the image. The source code is not compressed, so no extraction is needed.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Using ADD for Static Files\n</h3><p>Now, you want the static assets to be unpacked automatically. You can add the following line in your Dockerfile:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This line will copy the  file and extract its contents into . Now, your web server can serve the static assets from that folder.</p><p>Using both COPY and ADD in one Dockerfile can be useful. Just remember to use ADD only when you need its extra capabilities.</p><ul><li><p><p>\nTry different Dockerfiles with COPY and ADD. See how changes affect your image. Experimenting helps you understand the impact of each command.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nDocker is a powerful tool and there is always more to learn. If you are new to Docker, reading more guides can help. For instance, learning </p><a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-do-docker-images-get-created.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how Docker images are built</a> can be very useful.</p></li><li><p><p>\nThe official Docker documentation and online tutorials are great resources. They can show you the best practices and common pitfalls.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Simplify Your Dockerfile:</strong><p>\nAvoid using extra features if they are not needed. The simpler your Dockerfile, the easier it is to maintain and debug.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nEvery instruction in a Dockerfile creates an image layer. Use COPY when possible to keep your image lean. This is important for performance.

Both commands are used to bring files from your host system into the Docker image. However, they have key differences:</p><ul><li> is simple and copies files or directories exactly as they are.</li><li> does more by extracting compressed files and downloading content from URLs.</li></ul><p>For most situations, it is best to use COPY for clarity and simplicity. Use ADD only when you need its extra features, such as automatic extraction of archives.</p><p>Knowing which command to use can help you build more efficient Docker images. It can also make your Dockerfile easier to understand for other developers. Remember, each command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer, so keeping your instructions simple can lead to better performance.</p><p>By following these guidelines and best practices, you will build Docker images that are clean and efficient.

That’s why we decided to introduce a feature that allows players to control the types of events that occur during flights.</p><p>Now, we’ve divided events into two main categories:</p><ul><li>Mild events: These include helping passengers, offering additional meal services, and handling minor inquiries.</li><li>Intense/dangerous events: Situations such as onboard fires, unruly passengers, terrorism, or emergency landings.</li></ul><p>With this improvement, you can now choose how you want to play. Do you want a challenge or a stress-free flight? The choice is now yours.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Market Level 2 : Expanding Services and Passenger Interaction\n</h2><p>Starting from level 4, players could begin selling basic items onboard, including souvenirs. However, we realized that in-flight services needed to be richer to truly reflect the role of the cabin crew.</p><p>This update unlocks Market Level 2, adding a variety of new products and services to increase passenger satisfaction. Now, you can offer hot beverages, pre-packaged meals, and exclusive services to enhance the overall flight experience.</p><p>Beyond simply adding new items, we have also improved passenger AI so that they react more realistically to the services you provide. If you serve the right items quickly, passengers will show their appreciation and might even leave positive feedback. Conversely, if service is slow or incorrect, they might complain and lower your rating.</p><p>Additionally, microwaves will be introduced, meaning you’ll need to heat pre-packaged meals before serving them, ensuring food quality is at its best. If not, negative reviews will appear at the end of the flight.</p><p>We believe these improvements will make in-flight service more immersive and realistic, helping you feel like a true cabin crew professional.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Improved Graphics With Automatic Anti-Aliasing\n</h2><p>One common issue that players encountered was jagged edges on different devices with varying hardware configurations. To resolve this, we have implemented an automatic anti-aliasing system, allowing the game to dynamically adjust the level of anti-aliasing based on your device’s performance.</p><p>This feature not only enhances visual smoothness but also optimizes game performance, ensuring better graphics without affecting frame rates. Since every player has a different system, automatic recognition and optimization are the best ways to ensure everyone gets the best visual experience possible.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  AI Crew Assistants : Your Reliable Team Onboard\n</h2><p>As the game's title suggests, you wouldn’t be able to manage flights without the help of your cabin crew team. Especially on larger aircraft with more passengers, the workload increases significantly.</p><p>AI assistants have always been an essential part of Cabin Crew Life Simulator, but we received plenty of feedback stating that AI wasn’t as effective as players expected. Some reported that AI was slow to react and wasn’t proactive in assisting during urgent situations.</p><p>Therefore, in this update, we have significantly enhanced AI Crew Assistants, making them more intelligent and efficient. AI can now autonomously handle tasks such as fulfilling passenger requests, collecting trash, and automatically returning to their seats during takeoff and landing. This gives you more time to focus on critical flight management tasks.</p><p>These improvements not only reduce your workload but also make the game feel more immersive just like working with a real airline crew.</p><p>Looking Ahead &amp; Thank You!\nWe understand that no update is perfect right from the start, but we are always ready to listen to community feedback to improve the game day by day. Our development team has worked tirelessly to bring these new features to life, and we hope they make your experience even more enjoyable.</p><p>Once again, thank you for being a part of this journey with us. We’re eager to hear your thoughts on the upcoming update, and as always keep flying high with us.What features would you like to see in future updates?

In many cases, you might have more than one docker-compose project. These projects can run different services in separate files. But sometimes you need these projects to talk with each other. This article explains how you can set up communication between multiple docker-compose projects. I use simple words and short sentences so it is easy to understand.</p><p>Docker-compose makes it simple to define and run multi-container applications. Each project can have its own docker-compose file. In a microservices world, you may build different parts of your application as separate projects. For example, one project may run a web service while another runs a database or a cache. At some point, these services need to share data or work together. In this article, I will show you how to let these projects communicate.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding docker-compose Projects\n</h2><p>Each docker-compose project usually has its own file (commonly called ). In that file, you define services, networks, volumes, and other settings. When you run the command , all the services in that file start together. They share the network defined in the compose file. But if you have separate projects, they normally use different networks.</p><p>When projects use different networks, the containers in one project do not talk directly with the containers in another project. For many real world scenarios, you may want these projects to communicate. The solution is to create a common network that both projects can use.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up a Common External Network\n</h2><p>One common method to allow communication is to use an external network. You can create a network outside of any docker-compose file. Then, in each project, you declare that they will use the external network. This way, all the containers join the same network and can see each other.</p><p>Here is an example of how to create an external network. Open your terminal and run:</p><div><pre><code>docker network create common_network\n</code></pre></div><p>This command makes a network called . Now, in your docker-compose files, you add a section to use this network. For instance, in your first project's , you might add:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And in your second project's , add a similar network definition:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this setup, the  container from the first project and the  container from the second project share the same network. They can communicate by using container names as hostnames.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Communication via Container Names\n</h2><p>When containers are in the same network, they can call each other by name. For example, in the first project, your web service can reach the database by using the name defined in the second project. In our case, the  container is reachable as “db” if you do not change the service name.</p><p>If you want to test this, you can open a shell in one container and use a command like  or  to contact the other container. This is a simple and effective way to verify that your setup works.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using Multiple Compose Files for Different Environments\n</h2><p>Often, developers use separate docker-compose files for different environments such as development, testing, and production. When you have multiple compose files, you may need to override some settings. This helps you to adjust the network configuration or other parameters without changing the base file. </p><p>For more details on how to override configurations, check this <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-override-docker-compose-configurations.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tutorial on how to override docker-compose configurations</a>. It shows how you can add or change settings in a secondary file. This is very useful when you want to share an external network or change port mappings without rewriting your main file.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Writing a Simple docker-compose.yml File\n</h2><p>For beginners, it is a good idea to start with a simple docker-compose file. A basic file shows how services, networks, and volumes work together. This <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-write-a-simple-docker-compose-yml-file.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide on how to write a simple docker-compose yml file</a> is a good place to begin. You will learn to define services and networks step by step.</p><p>A simple docker-compose file may look like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This file starts one service called . It maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on the host. It also attaches the service to the external network we created earlier. Once you are comfortable with a simple file, you can expand it to include more services and complex settings.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using docker-compose for Development and Testing\n</h2><p>Docker-compose is not only for production deployments. It is also very useful during development and testing. When you work on your application, you may need to spin up multiple services quickly. Docker-compose makes this easy. </p><p>You can use a command like:</p><p>This command starts all your services in detached mode. You can then work on your application and see the results without spending too much time on configuration. For more ideas on using docker-compose in development and testing, you can read this <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-use-docker-compose-for-development-and-testing.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide on how to use docker-compose for development and testing</a>. It gives tips and examples that are useful for beginners.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Communication Between Different Projects\n</h2><p>When you run multiple docker-compose projects on the same host, they are isolated by default. But with the use of an external network, you can break down this isolation. Let us review the steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Create an External Network:</strong><p>\nFirst, create a network with the command </p><code>docker network create common_network</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Declare the External Network in Each Compose File:</strong><p>\nIn each docker-compose file, add a networks section that points to the external network. Make sure the network name is the same in all files.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Use Service Names to Communicate:</strong><p>\nWhen services run in the same network, they can talk using the service names. For instance, a web service can contact a database service simply by calling it “db” if that is the service name.</p></p></li><li><p> or  inside one container to see if it can reach the other.</p></li></ol><p>These steps help you create a smooth communication channel between different docker-compose projects. They work well for development, testing, and even production when you want to keep projects separated but allow them to share data.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Starting and Stopping docker-compose Services\n</h2><p>When you work with several projects, you may want to control them independently. You can start or stop services as needed. This can be very useful if you only need one part of your application running at a time. </p><p>For example, if you only need the web service running, you can start that project only. When you want to test communication between projects, you must start both. Use the following commands to control your services:</p><div><pre><code>docker-compose up \ndocker-compose down\n</code></pre></div><p>Let us look at a practical example. Imagine you have two projects: one for a frontend web application and one for a backend API. They are built as separate docker-compose projects. Here is how you can set them up to talk with each other.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Frontend docker-compose.yml\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Backend docker-compose.yml\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the frontend service runs on port 3000 and the backend service runs on port 4000. Both join the . In the frontend code, you can refer to the backend service by its name, “backend”. This way, the frontend can send API requests to the backend without using hardcoded IP addresses.</p><p>This approach is common in microservice architectures. It makes deployment easier because each project can be managed separately. Yet, they all work together because they share a common network.</p><p>Here are some best practices when you work with multiple docker-compose projects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Keep Your Network Names Consistent:</strong><p>\nWhen declaring an external network, use the same name in every docker-compose file. This ensures that all projects join the same network.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Document Your Configuration:</strong><p>\nWrite simple notes in your docker-compose files. It helps you remember why you set the external network.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Test Communication Early:</strong><p>\nAfter you set up the external network, test the connection between containers. Use tools like </p> or  to verify they can talk.</p></li><li><p><p>\nUse different docker-compose files for development and production if necessary. Override the configurations using extra files if your settings need to change for different environments. You can learn more about this in the </p><a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-override-docker-compose-configurations.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide on overriding docker-compose configurations</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Descriptive Service Names:</strong><p>\nGive each service a name that makes it clear what it does. This way, when containers try to communicate, the names are easy to understand.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nIn production, monitor the network communication between services. This can help you catch issues before they affect users.</p></p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Troubleshooting Communication Issues\n</h2><p>Sometimes, even after setting up the external network, containers may not communicate as expected. Here are some common issues and fixes:</p><ol><li><p><p>\nCheck that the network name in every docker-compose file is exactly the same. A small typo can cause containers to join different networks.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nMake sure you are using the correct service name. If a container is named “api” in one file, the other containers should refer to it as “api”.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Firewall and Security Rules:</strong><p>\nSometimes, security settings on your host machine or within containers may block traffic. Review any firewall or security group settings.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nVerify that all containers are running. Use </p> to list running containers. If a container has stopped, check its logs to see why.</p></li><li><p><p>\nIf two containers try to publish the same port on the host, there might be a conflict. In such cases, only use external networks for inter-container communication and do not map the ports unless needed for external access.</p></p></li></ol><p>Using these troubleshooting steps will help you resolve most issues with inter-project communication.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Summary and Final Thoughts\n</h2><p>In this article, we explored how to set up communication between multiple docker-compose projects. We learned that by default, docker-compose projects run in separate networks. However, by creating an external network and declaring it in every project, you can let containers from different projects talk with each other.</p><p>We saw an example where a frontend project communicates with a backend project through a shared network. The containers use each other’s service names to communicate. We also learned how to override configurations when needed and how to manage services using docker-compose commands.

In many projects you use Docker to run your code in isolated environments. In this article, we will talk about two important concepts:  and  in Docker. I try to use simple words and short sentences. This guide is written in a way that a beginner can understand it. I am a non-native English speaker and I keep my language simple.</p><p>Containers have many benefits in software development. They run the same way on different computers. Docker helps you to build, ship, and run containers. When you run a container, you may want to control how it talks to other containers or to your host machine. Two ways to do that are by using the commands  and  (or the  flag). Although they sound similar, they work in different ways.</p><p>Many people are confused about when to use EXPOSE and when to use publish. This article will explain both ideas in detail. We will also see examples with code snippets. If you want to learn more about how to expose ports in Docker, you can read this <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-expose-ports-in-docker-containers.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide on exposing ports in Docker containers</a>. It gives a clear view of the steps needed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is EXPOSE in Docker?\n</h2><p>The EXPOSE instruction is used in a Dockerfile. It is a command that tells Docker that the container will listen on a specific port at runtime. When you write a Dockerfile, you can include a line such as:</p><p>This command is only informational. It does not actually publish the port. Instead, it serves as a documentation for people who look at your Dockerfile. They can see which port your container expects to use.</p><p>EXPOSE does not change the way the container runs. It does not open the port on your host machine. It simply tells Docker and other developers that this container listens on port 8080. This can help when you are planning container networking or when you are using orchestration tools. It is a simple and useful note in your Dockerfile.</p><p>Sometimes, you may add more than one EXPOSE instruction if your container uses many ports. Each line tells a different port that the application listens on. For example:</p><p>These lines mean that your container will listen on port 8080 for one type of traffic and port 443 for secure connections. Note that even if these ports are exposed, they are not accessible from the host machine until you publish them.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is PUBLISH in Docker?\n</h2><p>Publishing a port is a different process. This happens when you run a container. When you use the  flag, Docker creates a mapping between a port on the host and a port on the container. For example:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  8080:8080 my_image\n</code></pre></div><p>This command tells Docker to publish port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on the host. Now, if you open your browser and go to <a href=\"http://localhost:8080\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:8080</a>, you can see the application running in the container.</p><p>The publish operation is an active change. It binds the container’s port to a port on the host machine. This means that the application becomes accessible outside of the container environment. Publishing is necessary when you want to share your containerized service with other systems or users.</p><p>When you publish a port, you can also change the port number on the host. For example:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  9090:8080 my_image\n</code></pre></div><p>In this case, the container still listens on port 8080. But Docker maps port 9090 on your host to port 8080 in the container. This is useful if you already have something running on port 8080 on the host. It gives you more flexibility in how you arrange your network settings.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Differences Between EXPOSE and PUBLISH\n</h2><p>It is important to understand that  and  serve different purposes:</p><ul><li> is used in the Dockerfile. It only informs that the container will use a certain port. It does not make the port accessible from the host by itself. It is like a note in the Dockerfile.</li><li> is used at runtime. It maps a container port to a port on the host machine. This makes the application reachable from outside the container.</li></ul><p>In other words, EXPOSE is a declaration. It tells developers and Docker tools which ports the container needs. Publish is an action. It opens a door between the container and the host machine.</p><p>A good <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-docker-container-ports-and-how-do-they-work.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explanation of Docker container ports</a> shows that ports play a vital role in container communication. Without properly exposing or publishing the ports, containers cannot communicate well with each other or with the outside world.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How EXPOSE and PUBLISH Work Together\n</h2><p>When you write a Dockerfile, you add EXPOSE to indicate the ports your application uses. Later, when you run your container, you decide if you want those ports to be available on your host machine. In many cases, you may want to publish a port if your application needs to be accessed by users or other services.</p><p>For instance, consider a web application that listens on port 80. In your Dockerfile, you might have:</p><p>This shows that the Nginx server inside the container listens on port 80. Then, when you run your container, you might use:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  8080:80 my_nginx_image\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, Docker maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. Without the publish flag (-p), even if the port is exposed in the Dockerfile, the container would not be reachable from outside. A <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-expose-docker-container-ports-to-the-host.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tutorial on exposing Docker container ports to the host</a> gives more details on how to set up this mapping.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Code Examples and Practical Scenarios\n</h2><p>Let us look at some practical examples. Suppose you have a Dockerfile for a simple web application:</p><div><pre><code>npm </code></pre></div><p>In this Dockerfile, the EXPOSE command tells that the app listens on port 3000. However, if you build the image and run it without publishing, you cannot access the web app from your browser. To publish the port, you run:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  3000:3000 my_node_app\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, the app is available on your host at port 3000. This example shows how EXPOSE and publish work in tandem. The EXPOSE in the Dockerfile is like a guideline. The publish flag in the docker run command is what makes it actually available.</p><p>Sometimes, people get confused and think that using EXPOSE in the Dockerfile will open the port automatically. It does not. You must always publish the port if you want external access. The <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-do-docker-containers-communicate-with-each-other.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insights on container communication</a> can help you understand how containers talk to each other and why port mapping is needed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When to Use EXPOSE and When to Use PUBLISH\n</h2><p>As a beginner, you might wonder when to use one or the other. Here are some guidelines:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Use EXPOSE in the Dockerfile for Documentation:</strong><p>\nAlways include the EXPOSE instruction in your Dockerfile. It acts as a reminder of which port your application uses. It also helps others who read your Dockerfile. They can quickly see what network communication is expected.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Use PUBLISH When Running the Container:</strong><p>\nWhen you need your application to be available to other systems, use the -p flag in the docker run command. This command tells Docker to bind a container port to a host port. It is required if you want users or services to access your app.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nIn development, you may only need the container to talk to other containers on the same network. In that case, you might rely on the EXPOSE command without publishing. But if you need to test the app from your browser, you must publish the port.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nIn production, you usually publish ports. You might also use orchestration tools that read the EXPOSE instruction to set up networking. However, the final binding is done with publish.</p></p></li></ol><p>The <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-is-the-dockerfile-and-how-do-you-create-one.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article on creating a Dockerfile</a> gives a good example of how to write a Dockerfile with the EXPOSE command. It shows step-by-step instructions which are useful for beginners.</p><p>Let us summarize the key differences:</p><ul><li><p><p>\nEXPOSE is a static declaration in your Dockerfile. It does not make any runtime changes. PUBLISH is a dynamic operation done at container startup.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nWith EXPOSE, the port is only known to Docker and is available for linking containers. With PUBLISH, the port is open on the host. This makes your application accessible from outside the container network.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Documentation vs. Action:</strong><p>\nEXPOSE is like a note in your project. It tells others which port your container listens on. PUBLISH is the actual action that sets up a network binding.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nWhen you use orchestration systems like Docker Compose or Kubernetes, the EXPOSE command can be read as part of the configuration. However, you must still configure port mapping (publishing) to allow traffic from outside the container.</p></p></li></ul><p>These differences may seem small at first but are very important when designing containerized systems. Using them correctly can help you avoid issues with network connectivity. It also makes your container configuration more clear and maintainable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Additional Considerations\n</h2><p>When working with Docker, you may also come across other network-related terms and commands. For example, Docker allows you to create custom networks so that containers can easily communicate with each other. This is especially useful when you run many containers together. Understanding how to expose and publish ports is only one part of Docker networking.</p><p>Remember that exposing a port in a Dockerfile does not mean that the port is automatically available. It simply marks the port for potential use. The publish operation makes that port accessible on your host. This means that if you forget to publish a port, your application might seem like it is not running correctly.</p><p>Furthermore, the published port can be mapped to a different host port than the container port. This is useful if you have conflicts on your host. For instance, if two containers both expose port 80, you can publish one container with  and the other with . This technique helps in managing multiple services on one host.</p><p>Let us consider a real-world scenario. Imagine you have a microservice architecture. One service is a web server and another is a database. The web server might expose port 80 inside the container. The database might listen on port 3306. In your Dockerfile for the web server, you include:</p><p>For the database, you might include:</p><p>When running the containers, you want the web server to be available to your customers. You run:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  8080:80 web_image\n</code></pre></div><p>Here, port 8080 on the host is mapped to port 80 in the web container. The database may be used only by the web server. In that case, you do not publish the database port. The web server and database can communicate using Docker networking internally. This setup helps to protect the database from external access.</p><p>In another case, if you want to access the database from outside for testing, you might run:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  3307:3306 db_image\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, port 3307 on your host is mapped to port 3306 in the database container. You can connect to the database using this host port. These examples show how publishing ports changes the way services are accessed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Using EXPOSE and PUBLISH\n</h2><p>Here are some best practices to follow:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Always include EXPOSE in your Dockerfile:</strong><p>\nIt is a good habit to document which ports your application uses. This makes it easier for others to understand your project.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Publish only when necessary:</strong><p>\nDo not publish ports if you do not need external access. This can improve security. Use publishing only for services that need to be reached from outside.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nWhen you publish a port, choose host ports that do not conflict with other services. This avoids confusion and port conflicts.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Keep your configuration simple:</strong><p>\nAvoid using too many ports unless necessary. Simple configurations are easier to manage and troubleshoot.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Test your network settings:</strong><p>\nAlways test if the published ports work as expected. Use commands like </p> or a web browser to check access. This helps to catch errors early.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  How These Options Affect Container Communication\n</h2><p>Understanding EXPOSE and publish is crucial for container communication. When containers run in the same network, they can communicate using their container names or IP addresses. The EXPOSE command helps document these ports. However, when you want external devices or users to access a container, publishing is required.</p><p>In many cases, containers communicate without published ports. For example, in a Docker Compose setup, services can talk to each other using the service name. This internal communication does not require port publishing. However, if you need to access one of these services from outside the network, you must publish the port.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using EXPOSE and PUBLISH in Docker Compose\n</h2><p>Many projects use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers. In a Compose file, you can define both the EXPOSE and publish settings. Although the EXPOSE instruction is usually in the Dockerfile, you can set port mapping in the Compose file like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This configuration publishes port 80 from the container to port 8080 on the host. The EXPOSE command in the Dockerfile tells that the container listens on port 80, and the Compose file does the mapping. This separation makes the configuration flexible and clear.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Troubleshooting Port Issues\n</h2><p>Sometimes, things may not work as expected with ports. Here are a few tips for troubleshooting:</p><ol><li><p><p>\nMake sure you have the correct EXPOSE instruction. If you have the wrong port number, it can cause confusion.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Review the docker run command:</strong><p>\nWhen you run the container, check that you have used the correct publish flag. For example, verify that </p> maps the right ports.</p></li><li><p><code>docker inspect &lt;container_name&gt;</code> to see the network settings. This command shows you the port bindings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test with simple commands:</strong><p>\nInside a container, use commands like </p> to see if the service is running on the expected port.</p></li></ol><p>By following these troubleshooting steps, you can fix most port mapping issues. Simple checks and clear configuration are very helpful.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Summary and Final Thoughts\n</h2><p>In summary,  and  are two different ways to handle ports in Docker. EXPOSE is a static declaration in the Dockerfile. It tells others which ports the container will use. Publish is used at runtime. It maps container ports to host ports and makes the application accessible externally.</p><p>Using EXPOSE is like adding a comment in your Dockerfile. It is good for documentation and internal communication. Publishing ports is an active operation that creates a network binding. It is necessary when you want your service to be used by users or other systems.</p><p>When you are building containerized applications, both commands are important. They work together to ensure that your application runs correctly in different environments.

In this article, we will talk about what docker networks are and why they matter. I try to use simple words and short sentences so it is easy to read. This guide is for beginners who want to learn about container networks in Docker. </p><p>Docker Networks let containers talk to each other. They also let containers talk to the host computer. When you work with many containers, networks help you manage them better. You can even separate the traffic between containers for extra security. In this article, I will cover many details on docker networks and show some basic commands.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Introduction to Docker Networks\n</h2><p>Docker is a tool that helps developers create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are like small, isolated environments. They run your code and have everything they need to run. But for many applications, these containers must interact with each other. This is where docker networks come in. They allow communication between containers and between containers and the outside world.</p><p>Many people ask, \"What are docker networks and why are they necessary?\" You can read more on this topic in this helpful article on <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-docker-networks-and-why-are-they-necessary.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are Docker Networks and Why They Are Necessary</a>. This resource explains why networks are a key part of containerization. It shows that without a network, containers cannot share data or services easily.</p><p>When you create a container, Docker attaches it to a default network called the bridge network. The bridge network is like a switch that connects all containers on the same host. This network gives each container its own IP address. With this IP address, containers can talk with each other using the network.</p><p>To see all the networks on your system, you can run the command:</p><p>This command shows a list of networks that Docker has created. You will see the default networks like bridge, host, and none. Using these networks, Docker controls how containers communicate.</p><p>Sometimes you want to create your own network. Custom networks give you more control over container communication. When you create a custom network, you can define how containers connect and share data. For more on creating your own networks, check out the guide on <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-do-you-create-custom-docker-networks.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creating Custom Docker Networks</a>. This article gives simple steps and examples that help you set up a custom network.</p><p>Docker provides several types of networks. Each type is used for different purposes. Here are some common ones:</p><p>The bridge network is the default network for containers. It is like a private internal network on the host. Containers on the same bridge network can talk to each other using their IP addresses. If you want to know more about this, read about <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-bridge-networks-in-docker.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding Bridge Networks</a>. This article explains how the bridge network works and why it is useful.</p><p>With a host network, a container uses the network stack of the host machine. This means there is no isolation for the network. It is faster because there is no network translation. But it is less secure because containers share the host’s network space. Use the host network when you need very high performance and can handle the risks.</p><p>An overlay network is used when you have many Docker hosts. In a swarm mode, overlay networks let containers on different hosts talk to each other. This network type is very useful for distributed applications. You can use overlay networks to manage multi-container apps that run on different machines.</p><p>Custom networks are created by users. They can be bridge networks or overlay networks. Custom networks give you flexibility. You can set up networks that match your app’s needs. When you create a custom network, you can choose its settings. For example, you might want to assign a subnet or change the driver. This extra control can help you avoid conflicts and improve security.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Docker Container Communication\n</h2><p>Communication between containers is a key part of working with Docker networks. Containers can communicate using the network names you give them. They do not need to use IP addresses directly. Instead, you can use container names as hostnames. This makes it easier to set up communication.</p><p>For instance, when you run a container, you might use a command like this:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  my_app  my_network my_image\n</code></pre></div><p>This command runs a container named “my_app” and connects it to the network “my_network”. Other containers on the same network can now use “my_app” to talk to it. For further details, you may find this guide on <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-do-docker-containers-communicate-with-each-other.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker Container Communication</a> very useful. It explains how container names and IP addresses are used in networking.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Creating and Using Docker Networks\n</h2><p>Creating your own docker network is simple. You can use the following command:</p><div><pre><code>docker network create my_network\n</code></pre></div><p>This command creates a new network called “my_network”. Once you have created a network, you can attach containers to it. Using custom networks helps you to isolate parts of your application. It also makes it easier to manage and secure your containers.</p><p>Here is an example workflow:</p><div><pre><code>   docker network create my_network\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>Run a container on that network.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>   docker run  container1  my_network my_image\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>Run another container on the same network.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>   docker run  container2  my_network my_image\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, container1 can talk to container2 using the name “container2”. This method is useful when you have multiple services that need to work together. It also helps with scaling. When you add more containers, you can put them on the same network and they will communicate easily.</p><p>In more advanced cases, you may have many containers spread across several hosts. Docker networking in multi-container applications can be a bit more complex. You may need to manage many network rules. For more advanced networking and container management, I recommend reading about <a href=\"https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-does-docker-networking-work-for-multi-container-applications.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker Networking for Multi Container Applications</a>. This article offers step-by-step guidance and real examples.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices with Docker Networks\n</h2><p>When you design a system with docker networks, there are some best practices you can follow. These practices can help you avoid problems later.</p><p>Do not create too many networks. Only create what you need. Simple networks are easier to manage. If you add more networks, it becomes hard to track how containers connect.</p><p>Give your networks meaningful names. A name like “my_network” is fine for a small test. But for production, use names that reflect the function of the network. For example, use “frontend_network” for containers that handle web traffic and “backend_network” for databases and internal services.</p><p>Keep different environments separated. Do not mix development and production containers on the same network. This helps to avoid accidental changes that may affect a live system.</p><p>Security is important. Make sure you secure your networks by only allowing trusted containers. If needed, you can use firewall rules or other security measures. Though Docker provides basic isolation, extra security can be important for sensitive applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Monitor Network Performance\n</h3><p>Always check the performance of your networks. Use tools like Docker stats and other network monitoring tools. This will help you know if your containers are having communication issues. Regular monitoring can save you time if you run into problems later.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Troubleshooting Docker Networks\n</h2><p>Sometimes, things do not work as expected with Docker networks. Containers might not be able to communicate or the network might show errors. Here are some tips for troubleshooting:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Check the network settings.</strong><code>docker network inspect my_network</code> to see the details. This shows you the IP range, connected containers, and other settings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test container communication.</strong> or  inside a container to test if it can reach another container by its name.</p></li><li><p><p>\nCheck the logs of your containers for any network related errors. Sometimes, errors in configuration cause issues.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nSometimes simply restarting the network or recreating the containers can solve issues.</p></p></li></ol><p>If you follow these steps, you can find and fix most problems. It is always good to review the documentation when you are not sure. There are many resources online that explain these issues in detail.</p><p>Let us imagine a small web application. In this application, you have a frontend service and a backend service. The frontend is a web server, and the backend is a database. You want these two to talk to each other securely. You can create a custom network for this purpose.</p><p>First, create the network:</p><div><pre><code>docker network create web_app_network\n</code></pre></div><p>Then, run the backend container:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  my_database  web_app_network mysql:5.7\n</code></pre></div><p>After that, run the frontend container:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  my_webserver  web_app_network nginx\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, the web server can connect to the database using the container name “my_database”. This setup is common in many projects. Using networks in this way makes it simple to manage the communication between the services.</p><p>In real projects, you may add more containers. For example, you might add a caching service like Redis. Each service can be placed on a network that suits its need. The flexibility of Docker networks is one of the reasons many companies use Docker in production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Docker Networks in Multi-Host Environments\n</h2><p>In larger deployments, you may have containers on different machines. Docker supports multi-host networking with overlay networks. Overlay networks work across many Docker hosts. They use the host machines’ network interfaces to create a virtual network that spans all hosts.</p><p>Overlay networks are essential in Docker Swarm mode. Swarm mode lets you manage a cluster of Docker engines. When you create a service in Swarm, you can attach it to an overlay network. This lets containers on different hosts communicate as if they were on the same network. </p><p>Although setting up an overlay network is more complex, it gives you great flexibility. You can have containers running on different servers but still interact easily. This approach is useful for scaling applications. With overlay networks, you can add or remove nodes without changing the network configuration much.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Additional Considerations\n</h2><p>When you work with Docker networks, keep in mind a few more points:</p><ul><li> Practice is the best way to learn. Create different networks on your own machine and see how containers connect.</li><li> Always refer to Docker documentation for the most accurate details. Docker docs are very helpful.</li><li> Many online communities can help you. Forums and chat groups can be good places to ask for help.</li><li> Before using a network configuration in production, test it in a safe environment. This helps you catch any problems early.</li></ul><p>Docker Networks are a key part of using Docker. They allow containers to communicate with each other and with the host. In this article, we learned what docker networks are and the different types you can use. We saw the default bridge network and learned how to create custom networks. We also touched on host and overlay networks.</p><p>I used simple examples and short sentences to explain the ideas. This article is written in a way that a beginner can understand. If you want to dive deeper into the subject, you should try to create your own networks and test them with different containers.</p><p>Learning about Docker networks takes time and practice. Each network type has its own use case. Experiment with these networks to see which one fits your project. As you become more comfortable, you will learn to design systems that are scalable and secure.</p><p>Remember, Docker is a tool to help you build and run applications smoothly. Docker networks add to this by ensuring that your containers can talk to each other. Whether you are building a small web app or a large distributed system, the proper use of networks can make your work much easier.</p><p>I hope this article helps you understand docker networks better.

After a period of hotfixes and anticipation, Microsoft has finally rolled out FSLogix v3, with its Early Access phase kicking off in December 2024. As of today, February 22, 2025, this release is either still in Early Access or freshly available to the public, depending on Microsoft’s timeline. In this blog, we’ll dive into what’s new with FSLogix v3, highlighting the key updates and improvements that Microsoft has introduced to keep this tool relevant and robust for modern IT needs.</p><p>Before we get into the specifics, let’s set the stage. The last major feature release for FSLogix was version 2210 in December 2022, which brought innovations like VHD Disk Compaction and Recycle Bin roaming. Since then, it’s been a quiet couple of years marked by hotfixes rather than major updates, leading some to speculate about the product’s future. FSLogix v3 puts those concerns to rest, signaling Microsoft’s continued investment in this critical tool. While it’s not a feature-heavy overhaul, v3 focuses on stability, alignment with other Microsoft products (notably Teams), and some thoughtful refinements.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s New in FSLogix v3?\n</h2><p>Based on the Early Access announcement from December 2024, here are the standout updates and changes in FSLogix v3:</p><ol><li><p>Major Version Jump and New Naming Convention\nFSLogix v3 marks a significant shift in versioning. Moving from version 2.x to 3, Microsoft has also revamped how releases are named and numbered. Build versions now follow a date/time format (e.g., 25.XX, reflecting the year 2025), making it easier to track when a release was created. Going forward, major releases will increment the version number (3 to 4 to 5, etc.), providing a clearer roadmap for future updates. This change might seem minor, but it reflects a more structured approach to development and release cycles.</p></li><li><p>Enhanced Cloud Cache Flexibility\nOne of the most practical updates in v3 is the tweak to Cloud Cache, FSLogix’s feature for high availability and disaster recovery of profile containers. Previously, Cloud Cache would flag certain failure states as configuration errors, limiting how admins could test redundancy. In v3, this restriction is lifted—Cloud Cache no longer assumes a failure is a misconfiguration. This gives IT teams more freedom to validate their setups and experiment with redundancy strategies tailored to their environments. Whether you’re syncing profiles across multiple storage providers or testing failover scenarios, this change makes Cloud Cache more adaptable.</p></li><li><p>PowerShell Module for Cloud Cache Troubleshooting\nTo complement the Cloud Cache update, Microsoft has introduced the Microsoft.FSLogix PowerShell module. This tool is designed to simplify investigation and troubleshooting of Cloud Cache-related issues. Admins can now use PowerShell commands to dig into logs, check container status, or diagnose connectivity problems—streamlining what was once a manual, time-consuming process. For those managing large-scale VDI deployments, this addition could save hours of headache and improve uptime.</p></li><li><p>Improved Stability and Microsoft Ecosystem Alignment\nWhile v3 isn’t brimming with flashy new features, Microsoft has emphasized “significant updates and improvements to enhance overall stability.” A key focus has been aligning FSLogix with other Microsoft products, especially Microsoft Teams, which is a cornerstone of many virtual desktop workflows. This could mean better handling of Teams data in profile containers or smoother integration with multi-session environments—though exact details are still unfolding as the release matures from Early Access to GA.</p></li><li><p>Retirement of Legacy Features\nFSLogix v3 isn’t just about adding—it’s also about pruning. Microsoft has retired several outdated features to streamline the product. Notably, support for 32-bit operating systems (like Windows 7 and Server 2012 R2) is gone, reflecting the industry’s shift to 64-bit architectures. Other deprecated elements include the Cloud Cache size limit setting (CcdMaxCacheSizeInMBs), the system tray applet, and the Profile Configuration Tool. These cuts might require some adjustment if you’re still relying on older setups, but they pave the way for a leaner, more modern FSLogix.</p></li></ol><p>If you were hoping for a slew of bold new features, v3 might feel understated. Unlike the 2210 release, which added capabilities like disk compaction and AppX manifest generation, v3 prioritizes refinement over revolution. That said, the Early Access notes hint that this is a foundational release, setting the stage for future enhancements. Microsoft’s focus on stability and integration suggests they’re playing the long game, ensuring FSLogix remains a reliable backbone for VDI as the ecosystem evolves.</p><p>Look, if you’re like me—someone who’s spent way too many late nights babysitting FSLogix profiles—v3 feels like Microsoft finally tossing us a lifeline. The Cloud Cache tweaks? Total game-changer. I once had a failover test go sideways because of those old config error flags, and I swear I aged a decade troubleshooting it. Now, with that restriction gone and a shiny new PowerShell module to poke around with, I’ve got more control than ever—and fewer gray hairs. The stability boost is clutch too; no more praying a Teams call doesn’t tank a session. With hybrid work still ruling the roost, that Teams alignment is honestly a godsend for keeping everyone chatting smoothly in VDI land. Oh, and the new versioning? That’s Microsoft promising they won’t leave us hanging for two years again—hallelujah, because I was starting to think 2210 was the end of the road.</p>","contentLength":5856,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Streamline Your Mobile App Releases with GitHub Actions","url":"https://dev.to/appdeploypro/streamline-your-mobile-app-releases-with-github-actions-27af","date":1740224218,"author":"AppDeployPro","guid":9099,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Releasing a mobile app can be a time-consuming process filled with manual steps—from building and testing your code to generating changelogs and submitting your app to the Google Play Store.

Here's How to Take Control","url":"https://dev.to/charliekatherine/multi-cloud-chaos-heres-how-to-take-control-1eo7","date":1740223898,"author":"Charlie Katherine","guid":9098,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Juggling multiple cloud providers can feel like managing a digital jungle—different platforms, varied data formats, and inconsistent security protocols all spiral out of control.</p><p>You're in the thick of it: Each cloud service excels at different aspects, with its best computing power matched against superior storage capabilities. The third solution provides unmatched features for artificial intelligence integration.</p><p>Uniting these multi-cloud services becomes as challenging as putting together a puzzle without visible guidance.</p><p>So, how do you survive the chaos and maintain order? </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Is Your Multi-Cloud Strategy More of a Headache Than a Benefit?\n</h2><p>Multi-cloud solutions are often touted to enhance flexibility, reduce vendor lock-in, and optimize performance through various . But in reality, things rarely run that smoothly. You find yourself tangled in different billing systems, trapped by varying compliance requirements, and forced to deal with a never-ending stream of configuration headaches. </p><p>Why does it feel like you're working with three teams, yet nothing is fully aligned?</p><p>It's not about abandoning the multi-cloud approach—it's about controlling it. The first step is accepting that chaos is part of the equation. </p><p>Now, how do we make sense of it?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Problems of Multi-Cloud\n</h2><p>Navigating a multi-cloud environment often reveals a host of challenges. From potential vendor lock-ins to inconsistent security measures, the complexity can quickly become overwhelming. </p><p>Let's look into the core issues you may be facing.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Vendor Lock-In? Still a Thing.\n</h3><p>While you may think you're dodging vendor lock-in by using multiple providers, you could feel even more trapped. Different systems, APIs, and user interfaces make switching between platforms or scales seamlessly challenging. </p><p>So, how do you avoid getting stuck with one provider while still taking advantage of the best features from each?</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Security Concerns Across Platforms\n</h3><p>If security protocols aren't standardized across your cloud services, you’re opening up to vulnerabilities. One platform might offer sophisticated encryption, while another might have outdated authentication mechanisms. How can you be sure your data is safe if it's spread across inconsistent security systems?</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Increased Complexity and Cost\n</h3><p>Managing different cloud environments might sound cost-effective on paper, but the administrative overhead can be astronomical. Are the savings in performance and flexibility worth the potential increase in complexity? </p><p>Those savings disappear when you factor in management costs, integration time, and troubleshooting.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conquer the Chaos: Actionable Strategies to Manage Multi-Cloud Environments\n</h2><p>Now that we've highlighted the challenges, it's time to focus on how to actually take control of your multi-cloud environment. The right strategies can transform chaos into order.\nDid you know?</p><p>The adoption of multi-cloud strategies is on the rise, with nearly three-quarters of public cloud customers globally utilizing multi-cloud environments.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Standardize Your Approach to Security\n</h3><p>First, get serious about unifying security protocols. Forget relying on the default security measures from each cloud provider. Implement a robust, standardized framework that spans your entire cloud infrastructure. This means encryption across the board, multi-factor authentication, and centralized logging for better monitoring. You'll reduce the risk of a breach while simplifying management.\nInvest in a cloud security posture management solution to automatically assess your cloud services for vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. A Cloud Management Platform (CMP) provides the solution.\n</h3><p>The desire to handle multiple cloud dashboards independently can be strong but unwise. But let's face it: you're not a circus performer. A cloud management platform is a single point of control that enables users to orchestrate and monitor provisioning and performance across everything. This approach provides a unified view while eliminating the need to access each cloud service separately.\nIntegrating CMPs with significant cloud services and automated tasks such as scaling and updating will help your team work more efficiently.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Harness Data Portability Tools\n</h3><p>The challenge of moving data between different cloud services stands as a major obstacle for multi-cloud deployments. Data stored within one provider's ecosystem becomes a major challenge when moving to another platform unless their formats match. Data portability tools enable smooth data transfers between platforms while ensuring complete mobility of your data.</p><p>One thing you should know is that data orchestration tools help you simplify information transfer between different cloud systems while avoiding data silo formation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Automate and Integrate Where Possible\n</h3><p>Any organization that handles everything manually has already surrendered to defeat. Use cloud-native tools along with third-party integrations to automate repetitive processes that include scaling and load-balancing operations. Your service integration enables you to create a seamless system that runs without interruptions. The key to successful scaling lies in automation, which prevents system chaos.</p><p>You can create a personalized dashboard that retrieves data from your entire cloud infrastructure to deliver live monitoring alongside automated task scheduling for daily operations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Optimize Your Costs—Don't Let Billing Control You\n</h3><p>You can have the best of both worlds with multi-cloud, but you're in for a rough ride if your billing system feels like a minefield. Each provider has its own pricing model, and without proper monitoring, costs can spiral. Implement a cloud cost management platform that provides full visibility across all your cloud services and keeps track of your expenses.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Taking Control Means Thinking Outside the Box\n</h2><p>The idea of having more flexibility, more control, and a diversified cloud infrastructure is enticing, but it can turn into a tangled mess if you're not careful. The key to successfully managing a multi-cloud environment lies in creating a balanced strategy that maximizes benefits while minimizing chaos.</p><p>What’s your next move? You need a solid foundation, which means investing in the right tools, processes, and technologies that simplify complexity and give you clear visibility.</p><p>\nA multi-cloud setup does not need to be a difficult experience. Different cloud services integration, security challenges, and cost management become manageable through proper strategic implementation.</p><p>Multi-cloud development in the future will focus on achieving control while making better choices and performing ongoing optimization processes. </p><p>The strength of your ability to overcome challenges makes the complexities of multi-cloud management irrelevant.</p><p>Your ability to transform cloud management disorder into a streamlined operation determines your success rather than your capability to handle multiple clouds. The time has come for you to invest in proper tools and develop your strategy to move from survival mode into thriving success.</p>","contentLength":7196,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"https://rb.gy/l2hewa","url":"https://dev.to/cxcsd/httpsrbgyl2hewa-5e0f","date":1740223654,"author":"tgb yhn","guid":9097,"unread":true,"content":"<p>TensorFlowは画像分類の実装に最適なライブラリの一つです。本記事では、TensorFlowを用いて画像分類モデルを構築し、実際に動作させる方法を解説します。</p><p>画像分類は、一般的なタスクである「特徴抽出」と「分類器の構築」からなります。CNNは、画像から関連する特徴を抽出し、分類器で判定する仕組みを持っています。</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>CNNは、複数の小さなフィルタを通じて特徴を抽出する機構です。</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>TensorFlowを使うことで、実際に画像を分類する機械学習モデルを構築できます。</p>","contentLength":624,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Create Kubernetes CRDs Using Golang and Master Controller Programming ️","url":"https://dev.to/devangtomar/how-to-create-kubernetes-crds-using-golang-and-master-controller-programming-2982","date":1740222937,"author":"Devang Tomar","guid":9095,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Kubernetes has revolutionized the way we manage containerized applications, but what happens when you need to extend its capabilities to fit your unique use case?

The methods promote immutability, reduce side effects, and simplify working with arrays. Let’s explore these new, powerful additions to the JavaScript arsenal.</p><p>Most of the traditional array methods like sort(), reverse(), and splice() modify the original array directly. This can lead to issues and bugs, especially in big applications where the same array is accessed somewhere in multiple locations in the code. Immutability, or not modifying data directly, prevents these issues. The new methods we will cover embrace immutability and return new arrays instead of modifying the ones that already exist.</p><p>The following is an overview of the most significant new array methods and how they can make your coding process easier:</p><p> and : They are the reverse of  and , but they search for the element from right to left. This is very useful when you need to obtain the last index of an element that meets a certain condition.</p><div><pre><code>const numbers = [1, 5, 3, 5, 2];\nconst lastFive = numbers.findLast(num =&gt; num === 5); // 5\nconst lastFiveIndex = numbers.findLastIndex(num =&gt; num === 5); // 3\n</code></pre></div><p>: Returns a fresh array with elements reversed, leaving the original unchanged. It's a side-effect-free counterpart to the usual reverse() operation.</p><div><pre><code>const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];\nconst reversedArray = originalArray.toReversed(); // [3, 2, 1]\nconsole.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3] (Original array remains unchanged)\n</code></pre></div><p>: Similar to :, this sorts the array and returns a fresh sorted array without altering the original.</p><div><pre><code>const unsortedArray = [3, 1, 4, 2];\nconst sortedArray = unsortedArray.toSorted(); // [1, 2, 3, 4]\nconsole.log(unsortedArray); // [3, 1, 4, 2]\n</code></pre></div><p>: This method is the immutable version of . It returns a new array with the specified changes (deletion or addition of elements), but does not modify the original.</p><div><pre><code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconst newArray = myArray.toSpliced(1, 2, 5, 6); // [1, 5, 6, 4] (Removes 2 elements and adds 2)\nconsole.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (Original array remains unchanged)\n\n</code></pre></div><p>: A more compact replacement for replacing an element at a specified index in an array without modifying the original.</p><div><pre><code>const myArray = [10, 20, 30];\nconst newArray = myArray.with(1, 25); // [10, 25, 30] (Replaces element at index 1)\nconsole.log(myArray); // [10, 20, 30] (Original array remains unchanged)\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advantages of Using These Functions\n</h2><p><strong>Improved Code Readability</strong>: These methods are likely to express intent better than their mutable counterparts.\nLess Side Effects: Immutability avoids state changes, reducing the likelihood of side effects, which is easier to debug. More readable code is less error-prone and easier to understand, modify, and maintain.<strong>Improved Support for Functional Programming</strong>: These approaches are more in line with functional programming, where you can write more supportable and composable code.</p><p> Combining Methods</p><div><pre><code>const products = [\n    { name: \"Apple\", price: 1.50 },\n    { name: \"Banana\", price: 0.75 },\n    { name: \"Orange\", price: 1.25 }\n];\n\nconst sortedAndDiscounted = products\n    .toSorted((a, b) =&gt; a.price - b.price) // Sort by price\n    .with(0, {...products[0], price: products[0].price * 0.9}); // Apply 10% discount to the cheapest item\n\n\nconsole.log(sortedAndDiscounted);\n</code></pre></div><p>These new approaches can be elegantly chained together for sophisticated data transformations:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Browser Compatibility and Polyfills\n</h2><p>While these methods are novel, they have solid support in browsers. If you need to support older browsers, however, you can employ polyfills to bridge the gap in the unavailable functionality. A polyfill is a piece of code that brings a new feature to an older environment. Libraries like core-js provide comprehensive polyfills for newer JavaScript features.</p><p>These new JavaScript array methods give us a powerful way of writing cleaner, more maintainable, and predictable code. By embracing immutability and minimizing the complexity of common array operations, they make it possible for developers to write more robust and scalable apps.

SSL/TLS certificates are essential for encrypting data transmitted between servers and clients, ensuring secure access to websites and applications. ACM provides a centralized solution for managing these certificates, including tasks like provisioning, deploying, and renewing, which can be complex to handle manually.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  key Terminology and Prerequisites for Understanding AWS ACM\n</h2><p>Before exploring AWS ACM’s features and use cases, it’s essential to understand some fundamental concepts and terminology related to SSL/TLS certificates and secure communication. These concepts form the basis of secure data transmission in web applications and cloud services.</p><ol><li>Certificate Authority (CA)\nA Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted organization responsible for issuing digital certificates.</li></ol><p>When a CA issues a certificate, it verifies the identity of the certificate requester, ensuring that they are authorized to represent the domain or entity in question.</p><p>CAs play a crucial role in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), acting as a trusted third party that vouches for the authenticity of public keys, which are used for encryption.</p><ol><li>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security)\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that establish secure connections over the internet, enabling data to be encrypted in transit.</li></ol><p>SSL was the original protocol, but due to security vulnerabilities, it has been largely replaced by TLS, the more secure and modern standard.</p><p>These protocols work by authenticating the server (and optionally, the client) and encrypting the data exchanged between them. Although TLS has replaced SSL, the term “SSL” is often still used as a generic reference for secure communication.</p><ol><li>Encryption in Transit\nEncryption in Transit refers to the process of encrypting data as it travels across networks, from a client to a server or between servers.</li></ol><p>SSL/TLS certificates facilitate encryption in transit, protecting data from interception or tampering during transmission.</p><p>This is essential for applications handling sensitive information, such as login credentials, payment information, or personal data, as it prevents unauthorized access while data moves between systems.</p><ol><li>SSL/TLS Certificates\nSSL/TLS Certificates are digital files issued by a CA that authenticate a website’s or service’s identity and enable encrypted connections.</li></ol><p>Certificates contain information about the certificate owner, the certificate’s validity period, and the public key used for encryption.</p><p>When a browser or client connects to a server with a valid SSL/TLS certificate, they initiate an encrypted session using the public key from the certificate.</p><ol><li>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system of digital certificates, public and private keys, and trusted CAs that enable secure communication over the internet.</li></ol><p>PKI underpins SSL/TLS, enabling secure transactions and communications by providing a framework for issuing, managing, and revoking digital certificates.</p><p>Within PKI, CAs play the role of verifying identities and issuing certificates, while entities like AWS ACM help manage these certificates within specific environments.</p><ol><li>Expiration and Renewal of SSL/TLS Certificates\nSSL/TLS certificates come with expiration dates, typically ranging from 90 days to a few years.</li></ol><p>An expired certificate can disrupt service availability, as browsers and clients will warn users or block access to the site or service.</p><p>Renewal of certificates is essential to ensure continuity, and in managed environments like AWS ACM, public certificates are automatically renewed before expiration, eliminating much of the manual work involved.</p><p>Types of Certificates in ACM\nAWS ACM provides two main types of certificates to address different security needs:</p><p>Public certificates are issued by external, trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and are designed for securing publicly accessible resources.</p><p>These certificates are essential for securing data sent from internet-facing services like websites or APIs and are widely accepted by browsers and client applications.</p><p>Common use cases include securing websites, load-balanced applications, and API gateways.</p><p>Private certificates, issued through AWS ACM Private Certificate Authority (PCA), are ideal for securing internal applications, such as internal web servers or private APIs.</p><p>These certificates do not rely on a publicly trusted CA, which keeps them internal to your organization, enhancing control and reducing costs.</p><p>Use cases include internal services that handle sensitive data or manage internal traffic within the organization.</p><p>Key Use Cases for AWS ACM\nSecuring Elastic Load Balancers (ELB):</p><p>AWS ACM integrates seamlessly with Elastic Load Balancers (Application, Network, and Classic Load Balancers) to secure incoming traffic.</p><p>For instance, if you have a web application running on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), attaching an ACM certificate to the ALB enables HTTPS connections to secure user data.</p><p>Example Use Case: E-commerce websites can leverage ALBs with ACM certificates to securely handle payment information and customer data.\nAmazon CloudFront for Global Content Delivery:</p><p>When delivering content across various geographical regions with CloudFront, ACM certificates enable HTTPS for secure communication.</p><p>ACM makes it easy to deploy certificates globally, helping you protect assets like static files, images, or dynamic web content.</p><p>Example Use Case: Media streaming services can use CloudFront with ACM certificates to securely stream content to viewers worldwide.\nAPI Gateway for Secure API Access:</p><p>With API Gateway, you can assign an ACM certificate to a custom domain, ensuring secure access to your APIs.</p><p>This is particularly important for APIs that handle sensitive information or connect with external clients.</p><p>Example Use Case: A financial institution providing secure access to customer data for authorized partners through a REST API can benefit from ACM certificates for encrypted connections.</p><p>IoT Devices with AWS IoT Core:</p><p>ACM certificates can also be applied to IoT Core, enabling secure communication between IoT devices and the AWS cloud.</p><p>Secure device-to-cloud communication is essential for IoT applications where devices transmit sensitive or personal data.</p><p>Example Use Case: A smart home security system that sends real-time video and data to the cloud could use IoT Core with ACM certificates to ensure privacy and security.</p><p>Internal Applications Using ACM Private CA:</p><p>ACM Private CA is useful for internal applications that require SSL/TLS encryption but don’t need publicly trusted certificates.</p><p>Example Use Case: An internal HR portal or an internal dashboard for data analysis can be secured with private certificates from ACM, ensuring only authorized users can access these applications.</p><p>Managing Certificate Expiration with AWS Config and EventBridge\nOne challenge with SSL/TLS certificates is ensuring they don’t expire unnoticed, which could lead to service outages or compromised security. AWS Config and EventBridge offer a solution to proactively manage certificate expiration.</p><p>Using AWS Config to Track Certificates:</p><p>AWS Config monitors ACM resources and tracks details like certificate expiration dates.</p><p>You can configure AWS Config to set up rules that trigger when a certificate is nearing expiration (e.g., 30 days before expiration).</p><p>Setting Up Automated Alerts with EventBridge:</p><p>EventBridge can be configured to detect Config events related to certificate expiration.</p><p>When an expiration event occurs, EventBridge can send an alert to administrators through Amazon SNS or trigger a Lambda function to take action.</p><p>EventBridge rule detects that a certificate will expire in 30 days.</p><p>Rule triggers a Lambda function that either sends a notification or attempts to renew the certificate automatically (if it’s managed by ACM).</p><p>Best Practices for Using AWS ACM\nLeverage ACM’s Automatic Renewal for Public Certificates:</p><p>ACM automatically renews public certificates before they expire, ensuring that your applications continue to run smoothly without manual intervention.</p><p>This feature is particularly beneficial for services like CloudFront or ELBs that depend on continuous HTTPS availability.</p><p>Limit Access to Certificates:</p><p>Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access to ACM resources.</p><p>Only allow specific roles or users to view or modify certificates, limiting potential security risks from unauthorized modifications.</p><p>Use Private Certificates for Internal Services:</p><p>By using ACM Private CA for internal services, you keep these certificates within your AWS environment, reducing the risks associated with public exposure.</p><p>Private CA also allows you to enforce stricter policies for certificate issuance and lifecycle management.</p><p>Monitor with AWS Config and Automate with EventBridge:</p><p>Combining AWS Config’s monitoring capabilities with EventBridge’s automation potential enables proactive certificate management.</p><p>For mission-critical applications, set up multiple notification channels (e.g., SNS, email, and SMS) to ensure no expiration goes unnoticed.</p><p>Conclusion\nAWS Certificate Manager (ACM) offers a comprehensive solution for SSL/TLS certificate management across AWS resources. From public to private certificates, ACM supports a range of use cases, including load balancers, API gateways, CloudFront distributions, and IoT endpoints. By automating certificate renewal and implementing monitoring with AWS Config and EventBridge, you can maintain secure connections and eliminate the risks of expired certificates.</p><p>This streamlined approach to certificate management not only enhances security but also reduces operational overhead, allowing your team to focus on higher-value activities while ACM takes care of the complexities. For any application that handles sensitive data or requires encrypted communication, AWS ACM is an essential tool in your AWS toolkit.</p>","contentLength":10103,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why Does \"Load More\" Feel Slow?

Giới thiệu về Scrum và sự cần thiết trong quản lý dự án phần mềm\n</h2><p>Trong bất kỳ doanh nghiệp phần mềm nào, các nhà quản lý luôn cần theo dõi tiến độ và đánh giá khả năng hoàn thành dự án đúng thời hạn với ngân sách đề ra. Để đáp ứng yêu cầu này, các phương pháp phát triển phần mềm theo kế hoạch (Plan-driven approaches) đã ra đời. Tuy nhiên, khi Agile xuất hiện, nó đã đưa ra một cách tiếp cận linh hoạt hơn, trong đó Scrum nổi lên như một phương pháp phổ biến nhất để tổ chức và quản lý các dự án phát triển phần mềm.</p><p>Scrum không chỉ giúp tổ chức công việc trong các nhóm phát triển mà còn giúp tăng cường khả năng thích ứng với thay đổi và đảm bảo tính minh bạch trong dự án. Nhờ vậy, Scrum đã trở thành một phương pháp quản lý quan trọng trong các công ty phần mềm, đặc biệt là trong những môi trường có yêu cầu thay đổi liên tục.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Tổng quan về phương pháp Scrum\n</h2><p>Scrum là một phương pháp phát triển phần mềm theo mô hình Agile, tập trung vào việc tổ chức công việc theo các chu kỳ phát triển ngắn gọi là Sprint (thường kéo dài từ 2 đến 4 tuần). Các thành viên trong nhóm Scrum làm việc cùng nhau để hoàn thành một phần chức năng của sản phẩm sau mỗi Sprint.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Các thành phần chính trong Scrum\n</h3><div><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Nhóm phát triển (Development Team)</strong></td><td>Một nhóm tự tổ chức, gồm tối đa 7 thành viên, chịu trách nhiệm phát triển phần mềm và các tài liệu liên quan.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sản phẩm có thể giao hàng (Potentially Shippable Product Increment)</strong></td><td>Một phần mềm hoàn chỉnh được tạo ra sau mỗi Sprint, có thể được triển khai ngay mà không cần chỉnh sửa.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Danh sách công việc tồn đọng (Product Backlog)</strong></td><td>Danh sách các yêu cầu, tính năng hoặc nhiệm vụ mà nhóm Scrum cần thực hiện.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chủ sở hữu sản phẩm (Product Owner)</strong></td><td>Người chịu trách nhiệm xác định các tính năng, sắp xếp thứ tự ưu tiên và đảm bảo rằng sản phẩm đáp ứng nhu cầu kinh doanh.</td></tr><tr><td>Người hướng dẫn và đảm bảo Scrum được thực hiện đúng cách, đồng thời bảo vệ nhóm khỏi sự can thiệp từ bên ngoài.</td></tr><tr><td>Một chu kỳ phát triển phần mềm kéo dài từ 2 đến 4 tuần.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tốc độ phát triển (Velocity)</strong></td><td>Số lượng công việc mà nhóm có thể hoàn thành trong một Sprint, giúp ước tính tiến độ của dự án.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Quy trình làm việc trong Scrum\n</h2><p>Mỗi Sprint bắt đầu bằng một cuộc họp lập kế hoạch Sprint (Sprint Planning). Trong cuộc họp này:</p><ul><li>Product Owner ưu tiên các mục trong Product Backlog.</li><li>Nhóm phát triển lựa chọn các mục có thể hoàn thành trong Sprint.</li><li>Sprint Backlog được tạo ra, chứa danh sách công việc của Sprint.</li></ul><p>Ví dụ:\nMột công ty phát triển ứng dụng thương mại điện tử muốn thêm tính năng \"Thanh toán qua ví điện tử\". Trong cuộc họp lập kế hoạch Sprint, Product Owner sẽ xác định các hạng mục công việc như:</p><ul><li>Tích hợp API của nhà cung cấp dịch vụ ví điện tử.</li><li>Thiết kế giao diện người dùng cho trang thanh toán.</li><li>Viết unit test để kiểm tra chức năng.</li></ul><p>Trong thời gian Sprint diễn ra, nhóm phát triển làm việc để hoàn thành các nhiệm vụ đã cam kết. Mỗi ngày, nhóm tổ chức cuộc họp Scrum ngắn (Daily Scrum) để cập nhật tiến độ.</p><p>Ví dụ:\nNếu trong Sprint, nhóm phát triển gặp lỗi khi tích hợp API ví điện tử, họ sẽ báo cáo trong Daily Scrum và điều chỉnh công việc để giải quyết vấn đề kịp thời.</p><p>Khi Sprint kết thúc, có hai cuộc họp quan trọng:</p><ol><li> Trình bày sản phẩm đã hoàn thành.</li><li> Đánh giá lại cách làm việc và đề xuất cải tiến cho Sprint tiếp theo.</li></ol><p>Ví dụ:\nNếu sau Sprint, nhóm nhận thấy việc giao tiếp giữa các thành viên chưa hiệu quả, họ có thể đề xuất sử dụng công cụ như Slack hoặc Trello để cải thiện quy trình làm việc.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Lợi ích của Scrum và ứng dụng thực tế\n</h2><p>Scrum mang lại nhiều lợi ích cho doanh nghiệp và nhóm phát triển, bao gồm:</p><ul><li><strong>Tăng cường khả năng thích ứng:</strong> Khi yêu cầu thay đổi, nhóm có thể điều chỉnh kế hoạch mà không làm ảnh hưởng đến toàn bộ dự án.</li><li><strong>Cải thiện giao tiếp và minh bạch:</strong> Mọi thành viên đều biết rõ tiến độ công việc.</li><li> Nhóm tập trung vào các nhiệm vụ ưu tiên, giúp nâng cao hiệu suất làm việc.</li><li><strong>Khách hàng có thể thấy kết quả sớm:</strong> Do sản phẩm được phát triển theo từng phần nhỏ, khách hàng có thể kiểm tra và phản hồi ngay.</li></ul><p>Ví dụ:\nCông ty phát triển phần mềm quản lý bệnh viện đã sử dụng Scrum để phát triển từng module (quản lý bệnh nhân, quản lý thuốc, thanh toán). Nhờ Scrum, họ có thể đưa vào sử dụng từng module một cách nhanh chóng thay vì chờ hoàn thành toàn bộ hệ thống.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Những thách thức khi áp dụng Scrum\n</h2><p>Mặc dù Scrum mang lại nhiều lợi ích, nó cũng có những thách thức:</p><ul><li><strong>Khó khăn khi áp dụng trong các nhóm lớn:</strong> Khi có nhiều nhóm làm việc cùng nhau, cần có sự điều phối tốt để tránh xung đột.</li><li><strong>Phụ thuộc vào Product Owner:</strong> Nếu Product Owner không quản lý Product Backlog hiệu quả, dự án có thể bị chậm tiến độ.</li><li><strong>Yêu cầu sự thay đổi văn hóa làm việc:</strong> Scrum đòi hỏi nhóm làm việc chủ động và tự tổ chức, điều này có thể gây khó khăn trong môi trường truyền thống.</li></ul><p>Ví dụ:\nMột công ty phần mềm tại Việt Nam áp dụng Scrum nhưng gặp khó khăn vì nhân viên đã quen với mô hình quản lý truyền thống. Để khắc phục, công ty đã tổ chức các buổi đào tạo về Scrum và dần dần thay đổi cách làm việc.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Scrum trong môi trường phát triển phần mềm phân tán\n</h2><p>Ngày nay, nhiều công ty có nhóm phát triển làm việc từ nhiều quốc gia khác nhau. Để áp dụng Scrum hiệu quả trong môi trường này, có thể sử dụng:</p><ul><li><strong>Công cụ quản lý dự án như Jira, Trello để theo dõi tiến độ.</strong></li><li><strong>Họp Scrum qua video call (Zoom, Google Meet).</strong></li><li><strong>Chia múi giờ làm việc hợp lý để đảm bảo giao tiếp hiệu quả.</strong></li></ul><p>Ví dụ:\nMột công ty phần mềm tại Mỹ có nhóm phát triển tại Việt Nam và Ấn Độ. Họ sử dụng Jira để quản lý công việc và tổ chức họp Scrum vào buổi tối (theo giờ Việt Nam) để cả ba nhóm có thể tham gia.</p><p>Scrum là một phương pháp linh hoạt giúp nâng cao hiệu suất làm việc trong phát triển phần mềm. Khi được áp dụng đúng cách, nó giúp tổ chức công việc hiệu quả, tăng tính minh bạch và đảm bảo sản phẩm đáp ứng yêu cầu của khách hàng. Tuy nhiên, việc triển khai Scrum cũng đi kèm với những thách thức, đòi hỏi sự thích nghi từ cả đội ngũ quản lý lẫn nhân viên.</p><p>Việc hiểu rõ và ứng dụng Scrum một cách linh hoạt sẽ giúp các công ty phần mềm tối ưu hóa quy trình làm việc và đạt được thành công bền vững. Do đó đây sẽ là nền tảng quan trọng để các nhóm phát triển phần mềm nâng cao hiệu suất, giảm thiểu lãng phí thời gian và tài nguyên, đồng thời tăng khả năng thích ứng với những thay đổi nhanh chóng của thị trường.</p><p>Ngoài lĩnh vực phần mềm, Scrum cũng được áp dụng rộng rãi trong các ngành khác như quản lý dự án, sản xuất, giáo dục và thậm chí cả y tế. Việc hiểu sâu về phương pháp này không chỉ giúp nhóm làm việc hiệu quả hơn mà còn góp phần xây dựng văn hóa làm việc linh hoạt, tập trung vào kết quả và cải tiến liên tục.</p><p>Với sự phát triển không ngừng của công nghệ và nhu cầu đổi mới sáng tạo, Scrum sẽ tiếp tục là một trong những phương pháp quản lý dự án quan trọng nhất, giúp các tổ chức cạnh tranh và phát triển bền vững trong thời đại số. </p>","contentLength":8731,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"About EC2 config","url":"https://dev.to/shiv15/-559h","date":1740217644,"author":"Shivendu Amale","guid":9056,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>EC2 Configuration options</h2>","contentLength":25,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Generate SK massal dengan template simpan massal ke ZIP","url":"https://dev.to/ekopriyanto/generate-sk-massal-dengan-template-simpan-massal-ke-zip-39he","date":1740217530,"author":"Eko Priyanto","guid":9055,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Begini kira-kira Generate SK massal dengan template simpan massal ke ZIP</p><ol><li>Instalasi PHPWord\nJika belum terpasang, install PHPWord dengan Composer:\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>composer require phpoffice/phpword\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>Script PHP untuk Generate dan ZIP\nBuat file generate_sk_massal.php dengan isi berikut:\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Pastikan ada file template template.docx di folder templates/.</li><li>Jalankan script di browser\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>http://localhost/generate_sk_massal.php\n\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Hasilnya: File ZIP akan terunduh, berisi banyak SK dalam format DOCX.</li></ul><ul><li>Looping $dataPegawai: Membuat SK dari template untuk setiap pegawai.</li><li>saveAs($fileName): Menyimpan setiap SK ke folder temp_sk/.</li><li>ZipArchive: Mengompresi semua file DOCX ke dalam file ZIP.</li><li>header(): Mengirim file ZIP untuk diunduh oleh pengguna.</li><li>Pembersihan otomatis: Menghapus file DOCX sementara dan ZIP setelah diunduh.</li></ul><ul><li>Ambil data pegawai dari database.</li><li>Tambahkan nomor SK otomatis.</li><li>Gunakan format PDF jika diperlukan.</li></ul>","contentLength":878,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Simplifying React Hooks: useRef 💯","url":"https://dev.to/alisamir/simplifying-react-hooks-useref-599","date":1740217160,"author":"Ali Samir","guid":9054,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When working with React,  is a powerful hook that allows you to access and persist values across renders without causing re-renders.

If you're running distributed systems on multiple servers, this one's for you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: Duplicate Data from Firestore Triggers\n</h2><p>In our application, we had a Firestore trigger that would fire whenever a new document was created.

But even with its advantages, there are common stumbling blocks. Let's tackle them one by one, and by the end, you'll be well on your way to mastering TypeScript.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Mistake 1: Ignoring Type Annotations\n</h2><p>One of the primary benefits of TypeScript is its type system, but many developers overlook type annotations.

Microservices are costly in terms of workforce. If I were leading a company, I would never start with a microservices architecture.

They simplify client interactions by abstracting internal service complexities, allowing backend architectures to evolve without impacting external consumers.  </p><p>API Gateways are particularly useful in microservices architectures.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Functionalities of an API Gateway\n</h2><ul><li>: An API Gateway exposes a  for clients, which is then routed to multiple underlying services.\n</li></ul><ul><li><p>: In monolithic applications, data resides in a single store.

But extracting it? That’s where the real challenge lies. The official API gives access, sure, but its limits can be frustrating. And when you need more? Scraping is the answer. No API restrictions. No caps. Just raw, valuable data.\nBut scraping Twitter isn’t as simple as clicking a button. You need the right tools, the best practices, and—most importantly—proxies to keep your efforts undetected. So, how do you pull data from Twitter without running into a wall? Let’s break it down.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Scrape Twitter Data Without API Hurdles\n</h2><p>Scraping Twitter without the official API can be done. Sure, it comes with its own set of hurdles, but it’s completely doable. Tools like Twint, Tweepy, and GetOldTweets3 let you bypass the API and access data directly. These tools are perfect for tracking trends, monitoring hashtags, and diving deep into sentiment analysis. You can even scrape data without needing an official developer key.\nBut beware—scraping comes with its own set of challenges. Without the API’s rate limits, it’s easy to trigger Twitter’s anti-scraping measures. That’s where proxies come in, and we'll talk about those in a second.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Tools That Make Scraping Twitter a Breeze\n</h2><p>Need more power? Enter the specialized tools. Octoparse, Import.io, and ParseHub take scraping to the next level. They’re designed for those who want to scrape without writing a ton of code. The beauty of these tools? You can visually build your scraping workflows, with easy drag-and-drop features. No deep programming skills needed.\nThese tools are packed with extras: built-in proxy handling, rate limit management, and more. So whether you're gathering tweets, monitoring mentions, or analyzing user behavior, these tools have your back.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Supercharging Your Scraping with Twitter Scraping APIs\n</h2><p>Okay, so scraping without the API is possible. But what if you want to automate everything, scale your scraping, and ensure everything runs smoothly? That’s where scraping APIs come in. Services like ScraperAPI offer streamlined solutions. These APIs rotate your IPs, solve captchas, and handle data parsing—making large-scale Twitter scraping feel effortless.\nNeed data fast and with minimal setup? These APIs deliver with endpoints designed to make your scraping process quicker and more efficient. No extra overhead, no guesswork.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Proxy Solutions for Effective Twitter Scraping\n</h2><p>Without proxies, your scraping efforts are likely to get blocked or rate-limited. Twitter's security features are aggressive, and without a proxy strategy, you’re asking for trouble. Proxies allow you to make requests from different IPs, which keeps Twitter from flagging your activity.\nThere are several types of proxies to choose from. Residential proxies come from real devices, making them almost impossible to detect. Datacenter proxies are cheaper and faster but are a bit easier for Twitter to flag. Rotating proxies, on the other hand, automatically change IPs, reducing the risk of getting blocked.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Power of Python in Data Scraping\n</h2><p>Python is the backbone of most scraping operations, and for good reason. It’s flexible, scalable, and packed with powerful libraries like Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Scrapy. These libraries handle everything from sending HTTP requests to parsing the HTML and extracting the data you need.\nIf you're focused on Twitter, specialized libraries like Twint and Tweepy can simplify the process. Python also integrates seamlessly with proxies and scraping APIs, allowing you to create an automated, efficient scraping pipeline.</p><p>While scraping Twitter data is incredibly valuable, it’s important to do it ethically. Stay within Twitter’s terms of service to avoid running into legal trouble. Scrape with respect, and don't overload Twitter’s servers with unnecessary requests.\nTo streamline your scraping efforts, use a scraping proxy API. This allows you to focus on the data, not the technicalities of managing proxies.</p><p>Scraping Twitter data is one of the most effective ways to gather insights, track trends, and monitor sentiment. With the right tools and strategies, you can bypass API limitations and unlock the full potential of Twitter data. From specialized scraping tools to <a href=\"https://www.swiftproxy.net/?ref=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proxy services</a>, the options are plentiful. The key to success? Combining the right tools with ethical practices and efficient proxies.</p>","contentLength":4483,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mastering Pod Affinity and Anti-affinity in Kubernetes","url":"https://dev.to/olamyde/mastering-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity-in-kubernetes-5ec8","date":1740209059,"author":"olamide odufuwa","guid":9027,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the world of Kubernetes, efficient resource management is a cornerstone of maintaining a robust and scalable infrastructure. Two often discussed strategies that help achieve this are pod affinity and pod anti-affinity. These concepts assist in configuring the placement of pods in a Kubernetes cluster to either congregate or disperse across nodes. But what exactly do these terms mean, and how do they affect workloads in practice? This blog post will explore the distinct functionalities and applications of pod affinity and pod anti-affinity, delving into the intricacies of how they contribute to the overall orchestration ecosystem in Kubernetes. Understanding these concepts is vital for any DevOps engineer aiming to optimize resource usage and application performance.</p><p><strong>Understanding Pod Affinity</strong></p><p>Pod affinity primarily focuses on ensuring that certain pods run on specific nodes or alongside other pods that match specified criteria. This can be particularly beneficial when certain workloads require low-latency communication or share a dependency. For instance, if two pods frequently communicate, having them reside on the same node minimizes network overhead and increases data throughput.</p><p>Pod affinity is orchestrated through Kubernetes node labels and affinity rules in the pod specification. These rules can be configured using <em>requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</em> or <em>preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</em>. The former mandates the scheduler to enforce the rule, whereas the latter suggests it as a preference.</p><div><pre><code>\naffinity:\n  podAffinity:\n    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n      - labelSelector:\n          matchExpressions:\n            - key: \"app\"\n              operator: In\n              values: [\"web\"]\n        topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\n\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Diving into Pod Anti-affinity</strong></p><p>Conversely, pod anti-affinity is a strategy to prevent specific pods from being scheduled on the same node, promoting dispersion. This can be crucial for maintaining availability and reducing single points of failure. For example, if two replicas of a database service run on the same hardware, a node failure could be catastrophic. Anti-affinity rules ensure these replicas distribute across different nodes.</p><p>Like pod affinity, anti-affinity is also defined through labels and rules within the pod specification. The key difference lies in the intention to separate rather than combine certain pods.</p><div><pre><code>\naffinity:\n  podAntiAffinity:\n    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n      - weight: 100\n        podAffinityTerm:\n          labelSelector:\n            matchExpressions:\n              - key: \"app\"\n                operator: In\n                values: [\"db\"]\n          topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\n\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Balancing Affinity and Anti-affinity</strong></p><p>The choice between using pod affinity and anti-affinity is not always straightforward and often depends on specific application requirements and constraints. Both strategies can be utilized simultaneously to achieve a more fine-tuned pod distribution. Administrators must carefully evaluate the trade-offs, such as potential scheduling delays associated with hard constraints versus the benefits of improved latency or fault tolerance.</p><p>A specific set of priorities can be configured using the Kubernetes scheduler to tune the behavior, providing a balance that aligns with operational goals.</p><p>Pod affinity and anti-affinity are critical components in optimizing Kubernetes cluster management. By understanding and leveraging these configurations, administrators can craft tailored environments that suit unique application demands. Pod affinity ensures co-location for efficiency, whereas anti-affinity focuses on separation for resilience. Both strategies, when applied judiciously, can enhance application performance, scalability, and fault tolerance in distributed systems. In adopting these practices, organizations can achieve a more resilient architecture, paving the way for a more efficient and effective Kubernetes environment. Therefore, mastering these techniques is crucial to enhancing operational strategies within Kubernetes clusters.</p>","contentLength":4132,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Kubernetes Probes: Enhance Application Health and Reliability","url":"https://dev.to/olamyde/kubernetes-probes-enhance-application-health-and-reliability-5518","date":1740208706,"author":"olamide odufuwa","guid":9026,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s fast-paced digital environment, maintaining the seamless operation of services is crucial. Kubernetes, the leading orchestration platform for containerized applications, employs a range of mechanisms to ensure that applications run optimally. Among these mechanisms, readiness and liveness probes are pivotal in maintaining the health and efficiency of applications. This blog post delves into the critical roles that readiness and liveness probes play in Kubernetes. We’ll explore their functionality, differences, and how they can be effectively used to enhance application reliability. Understanding these probes is vital for anyone managing containerized applications, as they prevent downtime and ensure that resources are directed only to healthy instances of your application.</p><p><strong>Understanding Readiness Probes:</strong></p><p>Readiness probes determine if a container is ready to start accepting traffic. Before traffic is routed to a pod, the readiness probe checks if it can handle user requests. This might involve checking if the necessary dependencies and configurations are in place. For instance, if your application relies on an external database, the readiness probe might ensure that database connections are established before your application starts receiving requests. If the readiness probe fails, the pod remains in an unready state, ensuring no traffic is directed to it.</p><p><em>Example of a readiness probe configuration:</em></p><div><pre><code>\n  readinessProbe:\n    httpGet:\n      path: /health\n      port: 8080\n    initialDelaySeconds: 5\n    periodSeconds: 10\n\n</code></pre></div><p>This example configures a readiness probe to call the /health endpoint every 10 seconds after an initial delay of 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>Exploring Liveness Probes:</strong></p><p>While readiness probes focus on the application’s ability to handle traffic, liveness probes monitor its ongoing health. If an application becomes unresponsive or crashes, a liveness probe initiates corrective action. This involves restarting the pod to restore functionality. Liveness probes are crucial for self-healing and resilience, ensuring applications recover automatically from transient errors without manual intervention.</p><p><em>Example of a liveness probe configuration:</em></p><div><pre><code>\n  livenessProbe:\n    tcpSocket:\n      port: 8080\n    initialDelaySeconds: 15\n    timeoutSeconds: 5\n\n</code></pre></div><p>This liveness probe checks the application’s TCP socket on port 8080, with an initial delay of 15 seconds and a timeout of 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>Differentiating Readiness and Liveness Probes:</strong></p><p>While both probes serve to maintain application health, their roles are distinct. Readiness probes focus on when a pod can start receiving traffic, ensuring that all dependencies are ready and that the application is fully initialized. In contrast, liveness probes are concerned with the ongoing health of a pod. They can restart a pod that is running but has become unhealthy over time. Utilizing both probes ensures end-to-end application health, from deployment to uptime.</p><p>In the dynamic world of Kubernetes, readiness and liveness probes are essential for maintaining robust application deployments. Readiness probes ensure that pods receive traffic only when they are fully prepared, while liveness probes guarantee ongoing health and automatic recovery. Together, they form a comprehensive health strategy, enabling applications to adapt and thrive amidst challenges. Leveraging these tools effectively maximizes application uptime and reliability, providing a seamless and resilient user experience. For developers and operators, understanding and implementing readiness and liveness probes is an investment in the robustness and reliability of their application landscape.</p>","contentLength":3639,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Creates Better Electronic Molecules Using Smart Learning System","url":"https://dev.to/mikeyoung44/ai-creates-better-electronic-molecules-using-smart-learning-system-3fc4","date":1740206986,"author":"Mike Young","guid":9012,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>New method called STGG+ for generating π-functional molecules</li><li>Combines active learning with molecular generation</li><li>Creates molecules with specific electronic properties</li><li>Built specialized dataset of conjugated molecules</li><li>Achieves better results than previous approaches</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Plain English Explanation\n</h2><p>Scientists developed a better way to create new molecules for electronics and solar cells.

Premature optimization is one of the biggest mistakes we've made.</p><p>We don’t regret the optimizations we implemented, as some customers appreciate them. However, our growth path could have been easier if we had started simpler instead of focusing on premature optimization.</p><p>We are FeatBit, an open-source feature flag platform. This article discusses the mistakes we made and the lessons we learned while building and maintaining an open-source product.</p><p><strong>Premature optimization is the root of all evil</strong></p><p>FeatBit was designed as a self-hosting-friendly service, and it has remained that way until today. On the other hand, FeatBit wanted to provide customers with a performance guarantee. So, we put in a lot of effort at the very beginning of our open-source journey:</p><ol><li>We offer two versions to suit different needs:\n\n<ul><li>Standard: Supports high concurrency and connections, but does not include experimentation analysis.</li><li>Professional: Based on Standard, with added capabilities to handle large data volumes for experimentation analysis.</li></ul></li><li>Our platform uses WebSocket connections for real-time feature flag updates, and we’ve made efforts to ensure:\n\n<ul><li>Scalability for high concurrency.</li><li>High availability for continuous uptime.</li></ul></li></ol><p>These efforts seemed like the right things to do at the time. However, after receiving feedback from customers, we realized that we had made several mistakes:</p><ul></ul><p>To ensure high performance, scalability, and availability, we introduced Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, and ClickHouse as databases. However, the big challenges we faced are:</p><ol><li>MongoDB is well-known, but it's not widely used by most of our target customers.</li><li>Many of our target customers lack experience with Redis.</li><li>Kafka and ClickHouse are even less relevant; many B2B customers don’t need them because they don’t deal with large volumes of data.</li></ol><p>It doesn’t make sense to require customers to learn and manage technologies that FeatBit doesn’t directly provide, as this can be a dealbreaker when deciding whether to adopt our product. Especially when the maintainers are Ops teams, not the developers and product managers who will actually use FeatBit.</p><p>We might not have built such a complex system at the beginning of our product development.</p><ol><li>REST APIs are sufficient for many use cases. We could have supported WebSocket after receiving enough feedback.</li><li>We didn't need to focus on high performance for individual calculation resources. Making it scalable would have been enough.</li><li>A multiple-region high availability solution wasn't necessary at the start. Edge agents might have been simple enough.</li><li>We didn't need to add too many features (such as A/B experimentation) initially. Focusing on feature flags might have been sufficient.</li><li>We didn't need to design a microservice architecture at the beginning. A monolithic architecture might have been enough.</li></ol><p>By considering these points, we could have started with a much simpler architecture, allowing us to focus more on marketing and enabling users to easily deploy and use FeatBit in their production environments.</p><p>We recognized our mistakes, but time has passed. Fortunately, the complex system we built allowed us to gain highly valued paid customers. However, to acquire more customers, we need to simplify our product so it can be used by a broader audience.</p><p>Making decisions is always difficult, because supporting a simpler version means we won't have time to develop new features.

They also face new challenges along the way from ideation to design and delivery of end-products. To succeed, systems engineers need to ensure potential risks are mitigated early in the development process and unexpected surprises are kept to a minimum. They need to build and deploy, cost reductions and with better performance and transparency. Designing complex systems therefore requires a foundation that is reliable, precise, connected, and efficient, and that can help turn the everyday struggle into a true competitive advantage.</p><p>The SysML V2 language provides such a foundation, leading to design quality improvement and additional effectiveness to the systems engineering processes. This article provides a short overview.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  SysML V2 is defined by Systems Engineers, for Systems Engineers\n</h2><p>SysML V2 was developed by systems engineers for systems engineers, to help them design complex systems by providing an enhanced, more precise and expressive formal language with textual and graphical notations that are interchangeable. SysML V2 provides a more comprehensive and flexible framework for modeling systems enabling better communication and collaboration among stakeholders.</p><p>SysML V2 offers natural and more effective description capabilities, improved reasoning, and problem solutioning. It enhances automation, provides interoperability, and streamlines integration between models and tools (including AI), all of which empowers systems engineers with modern workflows that boost coordination across engineering domains. It brings an experience of real-time consistency across projects and development stages, enhanced ease of use, and increased modeling speed.</p><p>SysML V2's enhanced capabilities in modeling and visualizing system architectures, requirements, and behaviors make it an ideal choice for managing the intricacies of complex, large-scale robust systems, such as automotive, aerospace, and defense systems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Engineering a system with SysML V2\n</h2><p>Every system, be it natural, or human-defined, consists of parts and parts of those parts (imagine a composite structure creating multiple levels of sub-systems). In systems modeling, these parts are further tied to unique behaviors, attached to unique characteristics, and can come in various states. They are placed in mutual relationships, are interconnected, while their connection enables a two-way interaction, allowing for information exchange.</p><p>In SysML V2, essentially any element that represents a physical or tangible component of a system can be considered an item. This can include both hardware and software components, such as algorithms or applications. Items are often used to model the system's physical composition and can be tied to specific locations, quantities, or other attributes.</p><p>An item can be associated with one or more parts. A part represents a logical or functional component of a system, representing a distinct function or behavior, and is typically used to model the system's architecture. This distinction between parts and items helps clarify the system's structure and enables a more accurate representation of the system overall.</p><p>With SysML V2, every system owns, receives, provides, and manipulates its items, while every item can be further described in more detail (items flow through the system, can be stored, or are attached to attributes, behaviors, states). The SysML V2 specific approach to an item, introduces a significant simplification: a reduction in the number of model elements. A point of connection between any two items, used for inputs or outputs is represented by a port and an interface, while these allow for information flow.</p><p>In short, a system can be described through its:</p><ul><li><p>Usage: how and who is using the system (actors' and subjects' parameters; use cases providing results or value).</p></li><li><p>Structure: what parts it is made of, how these parts connect and relate to the external environment.</p></li><li><p>Data: how it processes, receives, and outputs data.</p></li><li><p>Behaviour: what actions the system can take, what are its states and functions.</p></li></ul><p>Engineering a system with SysML V2 enables practitioners to bring, define, handle, and manage a requirement, and model requirements relationships, while supporting the integration of <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-based-systems-engineering\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">model-based systems engineering (MBSE)</a> with other engineering disciplines.</p><p>Processing, managing, and analyzing data is also supported, by providing notations and tools for modeling and visualizing data flows, structures, and relationships. SysML V2 also offers several features and notations for verification, enabling users to ensure that their systems meet intended performance goals, and allowing for improved quality, reliability, and reduced risk of errors.</p><p>SysML V2 also comes with streamlined definition and usage. Reuse of a concept in various contexts is much less formalized vs SysML with creating and using definition-less items – this simplifies the style of systems modeling and a minimizes the time needed for repetitive specification. Moreover, SysML V2 allows users to standardize and use a standard concept across industries, through model libraries. These are an integral part of the modeling language and include models for the base types of various definition and usage elements.</p><p>To describe the behavior of a system, SysML v2 provides action and state-based views which when combined with the expression language allow complex system behaviors to be modelled. Allocating behavior to structure can be done in a flexible way using the performer concept.</p><p>SysML V2 is a system-engineering-specific modeling language, with textual and graphical notations, that supports the design of complex systems with more natural, precise, and expressive modeling capabilities.</p><p>Building upon a strategic partnership with Siemens, IBM is introducing an entirely new solution designed for model-based collaboration with SysML V2 across the entire development lifecycle: the new <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/products/rhapsody-systems-engineering\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM Rhapsody Systems Engineering</a>.

UFS is a type of flash memory. Similar to eMMC, it integrates a control chip, accesses a standard interface, and undergoes standard packaging on the basis of NAND storage chips, thus forming a highly integrated storage chip. Due to its compact characteristics, UFS is widely used in embedded devices such as mobile phones and tablets. Moreover, since UFS far outperforms eMMC in terms of performance, it is often used in high-end products.</p><ol><li>Faster response speed for multitasking</li></ol><p>Devices using UFS2.0. LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling) has a dedicated serial interface, allowing read and write operations to be carried out simultaneously. The CQ (Command) queue dynamically allocates tasks without waiting for the previous process to end. It’s like a car getting on the highway, with multiple lanes allowing high-speed and smooth travel. In contrast, mobile phones using EMMC must perform read and write operations separately, and the instructions are also packaged. In terms of speed, EMMC is already at a disadvantage, and it is naturally slower when performing multitasking. It likes traveling on an common two-lane road with speed limits.</p><ol><li>Low latency, UFS has a 3-times faster response speed</li></ol><p>When reading large-scale games and large-volume files, UFS2.0 takes less time. The time required to load a game is one-third of that of EMMC5.0. Correspondingly, when experiencing games, mobile phones with UFS2.0 have lower latency and smoother pictures.</p><ol><li>Shorter loading time for photo thumbnails in the album</li></ol><p>Taking the mobile phone album as an example, many people’s mobile phones are filled with hundreds or even thousands of photos. When you open the photo thumbnails in the album, you can clearly see the loading process. This is caused by the fact that the mobile phone cannot keep up with the refresh speed when reading photos from the flash memory. On a mobile phone with a good screen, the pictures will load smoothly as you scroll, while on a less-capable mobile phone, you can clearly feel the lag during loading.</p><ol><li>Faster speed and lower power consumption</li></ol><p>After the UFS chip improves its speed, it means that it takes less time to complete the same task. Higher efficiency means lower power consumption. When working simultaneously, the power consumption of UFS is 10% lower than that of eMMC, and it can save approximately 35% of power consumption in daily work.</p><p>UFS interface read-write performance test</p><p>RK3576 CPU also provides a UFS2.0 interface and an emmc5.1 interface.</p><p>FET3576-C SoM&nbsp;also reserves a UFS interface.</p><p>Refer to Rockchip’s official document “Rockchip_Developer_Guide_UFS_CN_V1.3.0” to conduct read-write tests on the UFS flash memory of&nbsp;OK3576-C.</p><p>Sequential write testroot@ok3576-buildroot:/# fio -filename=/dev /sda -direct=1 -iodepth 32 -thread -rw=write -bs=1024k -size=1G -numjobs=8 -runtime=180 -group_reporting -name=seq_100write_1024k seq_100write_1024k: (g=0): rw=write, bs=(R) 1024KiB-1024KiB, (W) 1024KiB-1024KiB, (T) 1024KiB-1024KiB, ioengine=psync, iodepth=32 ... fio-3.34 Starting 8 threads note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 note: both iodepth &gt;= 1 and synchronous I/O engine are selected, queue depth will be capped at 1 Jobs: 8 (f=8): [W(8)][96.0%][w=359MiB/s][w=359 IOPS][eta 00m:01s] seq_100write_1024k: (groupid=0, jobs=8): err= 0: pid=1296: Thu Jan 1 00:01:32 1970 write: IOPS=332, BW=333MiB/s (349MB/s)(8192MiB/24631msec);

It allows you to create reusable components that manage their own state and efficiently update the UI.</p><ul><li>2. What are Components in React ?</li></ul><p>Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable pieces of code that encapsulate functionality and UI. You can think of them as independent modules that display a specific part of your application's interface.</p><p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code. It improves readability and makes it easier to visualize the structure of your UI components.</p><ul><li><strong>4. Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM.</strong></li></ul><p>The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept implemented in React that provides a programming API that works like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This means that whenever a component’s state changes, the Virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.\nReact then efficiently updates the real DOM to match the Virtual DOM, minimizing performance costs and enhancing user experience.</p><ul><li>5. Distinguish between a Class component and a Functional component.</li></ul><p>Class components are ES6 classes that extend from ‘React.Component’ and can hold and manage local state and lifecycle methods. On the other hand, Functional components are simpler and primarily used for rendering UI without handling state or lifecycle methods, although with React Hooks, they are now capable of using both.</p><ul><li>6. How do you create a React component?</li></ul><p>There are two main ways to create React components:\n● Class-based components: These use the class keyword and lifecycle methods to manage state and handle events.<p>\n● Functional components: These are simpler functions that return JSX code and can leverage React Hooks for managing state and side effects.</p></p><ul><li>7. </li></ul><p>Props are read-only properties passed down from parent components to child components.\nThey act like arguments, providing data to child components without modifying their internal</p><ul><li>8. <strong>What's the difference between Props and State in React ?</strong></li></ul><p>● Props: Read-only data passed down from parent to child components. Used for customization without changing internal state.\n● State: Internal data managed by a component. State can be changed, making it ideal for keeping track of user inputs, events, and data that changes over time.</p><ul><li>9. <strong>What does the render() method do in React components ?</strong></li></ul><p>The render() method is essential in class components. It examines this.props and this.state and returns one of the following: React elements, arrays and fragments, portals, string and numbers, Booleans or null. This output represents what should be displayed on the screen.</p><ul><li>10. <strong>What are keys in React and why are they important ?</strong></li></ul><p>Keys are special string attributes that you need to include when creating lists of elements. They help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity, enhancing performance during updates.</p><ul><li>11. <strong>What is an event in React ?</strong></li></ul><p>In React, an event is similar to events in plain JavaScript—actions like clicks, form submissions,\nor key presses. React wraps these events in its own SyntheticEvent wrapper to ensure consistency across different browsers.</p><ul><li>12. <strong>How do you handle events in React ?</strong></li></ul><p>Handling events in React is straightforward: you use event handlers. These are functions you write to execute when an event occurs. For example, you might have a button that needs to handle a click event, which you can set up like this: Click me!, where handleClick is the function that runs when the button is clicked.</p><ul><li>13. <strong>What is a stateful component ?</strong></li></ul><p>A stateful component in React is one that can hold and change state over time. These components are usually class components but can also be functional components using hooks like useState. They are handy when your component needs to remember something or be interactive.</p><ul><li>14. <strong>What is a stateless component ?</strong></li></ul><p>Conversely, a stateless component is one that doesn't manage any state. These often serve as presentational components, merely rendering UI elements based on the props they receive.Stateless components can be functional components without any hooks for state management.</p><ul><li>15. How do you pass data between components in React ?</li></ul><p>Passing data between components in React is done through props (short for properties). You pass data from parent components to child components as arguments to the child component in the JSX where it's used.</p><ul><li>16. What are controlled components ?</li></ul><p>In React, a controlled component is one that manages its own state and updates based on user input. For example, form elements like inputs often need to be controlled components, whereas React handles the form data.</p><ul><li>17. <strong>How do you update the state of a component ?</strong></li></ul><p>To update the state of a component in React, you use the setState method in class components or the setter function from useState in functional components. It's important to remember that state updates may be asynchronous and should not rely on the previous state directly.</p><ul><li>18. What is the significance of the componentDidMount lifecycle method ?</li></ul><p>componentDidMount is a lifecycle method in class components that is called after the component is rendered for the first time. This is the perfect place to initiate API calls, set timers, or handle any interactions that require the DOM nodes to be present.</p><ul><li>19. Explain the purpose of the useState hook.</li></ul><p>The useState hook is a fundamental hook in React for adding state to functional components. It allows you to add and manage state in a component without converting it into a class component.</p><ul><li>20. What is the useEffect hook and how is it used ?</li></ul><p>The useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in your components. These can be anything from fetching data to directly interacting with the DOM. It can be configured to run after every render or only when certain values change.</p><ul><li>21. <strong>What are higher-order components ?</strong></li></ul><p>Higher-order components (HOCs) are a powerful pattern used in React to enhance components with additional functionality. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. It's useful for reusing code, logic, and bootstrap abstraction in React applications.</p><ul><li>22. <strong>Explain the lifecycle of a React component .</strong></li></ul><p>The lifecycle of a React component can be divided into three phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting. Mounting is when the component is being created and inserted into the DOM. Updating occurs when a component is re-rendered due to changes in props or state.\nUnmounting is the final phase when the component is removed from the DOM. Lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount allow developers to hook into these phases for managing operations appropriately.</p><ul><li>23. How can you handle forms in React?</li></ul><p>Forms in React can be handled using controlled components where form data is handled by the state within the component. Each state mutation has a corresponding handler function, making it straightforward to modify or validate user input.</p><ul><li>24. What is lifting state up in React?</li></ul><p>Lifting state up is a common pattern for sharing state between multiple components. It involves moving state to the nearest common ancestor of the components that require it. This way, state can be passed down as props to the components that need it, ensuring consistent data and behavior.</p><ul><li>25. <strong>How does React implement the re-rendering of components ?</strong></li></ul><p>React implements re-rendering through its reconciliation algorithm, where it updates the DOM based on the changes in the component's state or props. React efficiently updates only the parts of the DOM that actually changed, rather than re-rendering everything, which enhances\nperformance.</p><ul><li>26. <strong>What are controlled components ?</strong></li></ul><p>Controlled components are those where React controls the values of input elements. The input form elements, such as , , and , have their values controlled by React's state, and their values change via state, not directly from user input.</p><ul><li>27. What are uncontrolled components?</li></ul><p>Uncontrolled components work like traditional HTML form inputs, where the forms naturally keep some internal state. In React, uncontrolled components are managed using a ref to get form values from the DOM instead of handling the form state via state.</p><ul><li>28. <strong>Explain the concept of virtual DOM and how it differs from real DOM .</strong></li></ul><p>The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. It is a concept implemented by React that allows for efficient updates to the UI by minimizing direct manipulations of the real DOM,which can be slow. When a component’s state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it with the previous version. Only the differences are updated in the real DOM.</p><ul><li>29. <strong>How do you optimize performance in a React application ?</strong></li></ul><p>Optimizing performance in a React application can involve several strategies, such as using \nshouldComponentUpdate or React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, code-splitting to reduce the size of bundles loaded initially, and using lazy loading for components.</p><ul><li>30. <strong>What is the context API ?</strong></li></ul><p>The Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to \"prop drilling\" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is often used to share data such as user authentication, themes, or a language preference.</p><ul><li>31. <strong>How do you use refs in React ?</strong></li></ul><p>Refs in React are used to get references to a DOM node or an instance of a component in a React Application. Refs are created using React.createRef() and attached to React elements via the ref attribute.</p><ul><li>32. Explain forward refs in React.</li></ul><p>Forward refs in React allow you to pass a ref down to a child component. This is particularly useful in higher-order components or when you need the parent component to directly interact with child component DOM nodes.</p><ul><li>33. What are synthetic events in React ?</li></ul><p>Synthetic events in React are wrapper objects around the native event. They combine the behavior of different browser's native events into one API, ensuring that the events behave identically across all browsers.</p><ul><li>34. <strong>How do you implement error handling in React components ?</strong></li></ul><p>Error handling in React components can be achieved using error boundaries. An error boundary is a component that catches JavaScript errors in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.</p><ul><li>35. What are portals in React ?</li></ul><p>Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. This is commonly used for modals, tooltips, and floating menus.</p><ul><li>36. <strong>How does React Router work ?</strong></li></ul><p>React Router is a library that enables dynamic routing in a web app. It keeps the UI in sync with the URL, allowing you to handle routing declaratively. It works by changing your application's components depending on the browser's URL, without reloading the page.</p><ul><li>37. <strong>What is the difference between React Router and traditional routing ?</strong></li></ul><p>React Router uses client-side routing, where the routing is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page, without the need for page reloads. Traditional routing, on the other hand, involves requests to a server and reloading the entire page with new content.</p><ul><li>38. <strong>How do you implement code-splitting in React ?</strong></li></ul><p>Code-splitting in React can be implemented using React.lazy and Suspense. This allows you to split your code into separate chunks which can be loaded on demand. It is particularly useful for improving the initial load time of the application.\nAdvanced ReactJS Interview Questions for Experienced:<p>\nMastering advanced React concepts is crucial for handling complex projects and architectural challenges. Our \"Advanced ReactJS Interview Questions for Experienced\" section delves into advanced topics that seasoned developers often encounter. From state management strategies to handling side effects, hooks, and server-side rendering, this section is designed to test and expand your mastery of React.</p></p><ul><li>39. What are the different ways to manage State in a React application ?</li></ul><p>React offers multiple ways to manage state, each with its own use case. Here are the common approaches:</p><p>● Local state: Managed within a component using useState or useReducer.\n● Global state: Tools like Redux or Context API help manage state that is accessible by any component in the application.<p>\n● Server state: Data fetched from an external server which can be managed via React Query or SWR.</p>\n● URL state: State represented in the URL parameters accessible via React Router.</p><ul><li>40. How do you handle side effects in React components </li></ul><p>Side effects are operations affecting other components or that involve asynchronous operations.\nReact uses the useEffect hook to handle side effects, such as API calls, subscriptions, or manually manipulating the DOM.</p><ul><li>41. Explain the concept of hooks in React. What problems do they solve?</li></ul><p>Hooks are functions that let you \"hook into\" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They allow you to write functional components with the same capabilities as class components, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.</p><p>Problems Solved by Hooks:\n● Code Reusability: Share logic across components without resorting to higher-order components (HOCs).<p>\n● Component Composition: Build complex UIs by combining simpler functional components.</p>\n● State Management: Use the useState hook to manage component state within functional components.</p><ul><li>42. <strong>How would you implement global state management in React without using external libraries ?</strong></li></ul><p>To manage global state without external libraries, the Context API can be utilized effectively. It allows you to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.</p><ul><li><ol><li>What is React Fiber ?\nReact Fiber is a complete re-implementation of the React core algorithm. It enhances the suitability of React for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM.</li></ol></li><li><ol><li><strong>How do you handle server-side rendering with React ?</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>SSR allows you to render your React application on the server, improving initial page load times and SEO. Libraries like Next.js simplify SSR implementation in React projects.</p><ul><li>45. <strong>What are the common performance issues in React applications ? How do you troubleshoot them ?</strong></li></ul><p>Performance issues in React often include:\n● Unnecessary Re-renders: Optimize components using shouldComponentUpdate (classcomponents) or React.memo (functional components) to prevent unnecessary re renders.<p>\n● Large Virtual DOM Diffs: Break down complex components into smaller ones to minimize the amount of DOM that needs to be updated.</p>\n● Excessive Prop Drilling: Use Context API or state management solutions to avoid passing props through multiple levels of components.</p><ul><li>46. How do you secure a React application?</li></ul><p>Just like any web application, React applications need to be secured. Here are some key areas to focus on:\n● Sanitize User Input: Prevent XSS attacks by sanitizing any user-provided data before displaying it on the UI.<p>\n● Secure API Communication: Use HTTPS for API communication to encrypt data transmission.</p>\n● Implement Authentication and Authorization: Control user access to specific features and data based on their roles.</p><ul><li>47. What are the pros and cons of using Redux?</li></ul><p>Redux is a popular state management library, but it's not always necessary. Here's a quick breakdown:</p><p>Pros:\n● Centralized State: Keeps all application state in one place, making it easier to manage and reason about.<p>\n● Predictable Updates: Makes application flow more predictable and easier to debug.</p>\n● Large Community and Ecosystem: Plenty of resources and tools available for working with Redux.</p><p>Cons:\n● Complexity: Setting up and managing Redux can add complexity to smaller applications.<p>\n● Boilerplate Code: Requires writing additional code for actions, reducers, and middleware.</p></p><ol><li>How do you integrate TypeScript with React?</li></ol><p>TypeScript can be integrated by creating React components with TypeScript. This adds static type checking, enhancing the reliability and maintainability of the application.</p><ol><li>Explain the main principles of Redux.</li></ol><p>Redux follows three fundamental principles:\n● Single source of truth: The state of your entire application is stored in one object tree.<p>\n● State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action.</p>\n● Changes are made with pure functions: Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action to compute the next state.</p><ol><li>How do you handle asynchronous actions in Redux?</li></ol><p>Asynchronous actions in Redux are handled by middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.\nThese allow you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.</p><ul><li>51. <strong>What is React Suspense and how do you use it ?</strong></li></ul><p>React Suspense lets you specify the loading indicator in case some components in the tree below it are not yet ready to render. It's used for code splitting and lazy loading components.</p><ul><li>52. Explain the role of immutability in React.</li></ul><p>Immutability is a core concept in React, especially when working with state and props. It helps prevent unexpected mutations and enables optimized performance with pure components.</p>","contentLength":17459,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"<> Fixing HTML Elements </>","url":"https://dev.to/vijayr00/-fixing-html-elements--54i0","date":1740201520,"author":"Vijay Kumar","guid":8980,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Generally we developers start with </p> and wrap everything into it .\n\n<p>If we need a button, form we just wrap it inside a div class . </p><p>Ever wondered if this is really correct ? or there is more to these HTML Elements which could be make code maintainability better .</p><p>SEO says \" Use Semantic Elements if you want me 😁😁\"</p><ul><li><ol><li> element - a container where it could be used when there is no specific content and use it for purely styling.\n\n</li><li><ol><li> - a container when there is content marking , grouping of content &amp; needs a common theme styling for that group.

Your browser and the web server engage in a silent conversation using HTTP status codes, three-digit messages that indicate whether a request was successful, redirected, or failed.</p><p>You’ve probably encountered a  error before, but there’s a lot more to these status codes than meets the eye. They help developers debug issues, improve website performance, and even affect SEO rankings.</p><p>Let’s break down the most important HTTP status codes, focusing particularly on <strong>client-side (4xx) and server-side (5xx) errors</strong>—and why they matter.</p><h2><strong>1xx: Informational – The Conversation Has Started</strong></h2><p>These codes are rarely seen by users but indicate that the request has been received and is still being processed.</p><ul><li> – The server acknowledges the request and is waiting for more information.\n</li><li> – The client has requested a change in protocol (e.g., switching from HTTP to WebSockets), and the server has agreed.\n</li></ul><h2><strong>2xx: Success – Everything’s Good</strong></h2><p>When you see a  response, it means your request was successful, and the server has returned the requested content.</p><ul><li> – The request was successful, and the response contains the requested resource.\n</li><li> – A new resource was successfully created (commonly used in APIs for new database entries).\n</li><li> – The request was successful, but there is no content to return (used when an operation, like deleting a record, doesn’t require a response body).\n</li></ul><h2><strong>3xx: Redirection – You’re Being Sent Somewhere Else</strong></h2><p>These codes indicate that the requested resource has moved, and the browser should redirect to a new URL.</p><ul><li> – The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL (important for SEO).\n</li><li> – The resource has been temporarily moved to another location.\n</li><li> – The requested resource hasn’t changed since the last request, so the browser should use its cached version.\n</li></ul><p>When things go wrong on the web, the problem usually falls into one of two categories:</p><ol><li> → Issues caused by the user or their request.\n</li><li> → Issues caused by the web server itself.\n</li></ol><h2><strong>4xx: Client Errors – The User Messed Up</strong></h2><p>Client-side errors happen when there’s something wrong with the request. This could be due to a typo in the URL, missing authentication, or an unauthorized request.</p><h3><strong>Common Client Errors and Their Causes:</strong></h3><ul><li><p> → The request is malformed or contains invalid syntax.  </p><ul><li> Sending an API request with missing or incorrectly formatted data.\n</li><li> Double-check the request syntax before submitting it.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → Authentication is required, but missing or incorrect.  </p><ul><li> Trying to access a restricted page without logging in.\n</li><li> Provide the correct username and password or an API key if required.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → The request was valid, but the server is refusing access.  </p><ul><li> Trying to view a file you don’t have permission to access.\n</li><li> Ensure you have the right credentials or contact the website admin.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → The requested resource doesn’t exist.  </p><ul><li> Clicking on a broken link.\n</li><li> Check the URL for typos or see if the page has been moved.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → The request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is not allowed for the resource.  </p><ul><li> Trying to use a  request on a URL that only accepts  requests.\n</li><li> Use the correct request method as specified in the API documentation.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → The user has sent too many requests in a short time (rate limiting).  </p><ul><li> Refreshing a webpage too frequently or making excessive API calls.\n</li><li> Wait for a while before trying again or follow the API’s rate-limiting rules.\n</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>5xx: Server Errors – The Server Messed Up</strong></h2><p>Server-side errors indicate that something went wrong on the web server. Unlike  errors, which are caused by the user,  errors mean the problem is out of your control.</p><h3><strong>Common Server Errors and Their Causes:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong> → A generic error message when something goes wrong on the server.  </p><ul><li> A coding bug in a website’s backend crashes the server.\n</li><li> Website admins need to check error logs and debug their application.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → A server acting as a proxy or gateway received an invalid response from an upstream server.  </p><ul><li> A CDN (like Cloudflare) fails to connect to the origin server.\n</li><li> Check if the upstream server is down or misconfigured.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → The server is temporarily down or overloaded.  </p><ul><li> A website crashes due to high traffic (like during a Black Friday sale).\n</li><li> Wait and try again later. Web admins may need to optimize server resources.\n</li></ul></li><li><p> → The server didn’t receive a response from an upstream server within the expected time.  </p><ul><li> A slow database query causes a timeout.\n</li><li> Optimize queries, increase timeout limits, or scale the server infrastructure.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>Understanding HTTP status codes isn’t just for developers.

When a new invocation occurs, Lambda restores the snapshot, allowing the function to be invoked immediately without reinitialization. This approach significantly reduces the cold start latency that can affect performance-sensitive applications.   </p><p>Currently, it is available for newer versions of Java/Python/.NET-based runtimes, and other managed runtimes (such as nodejs22.x and ruby3.3), OS-only runtimes, and container images are not supported yet.</p><p>To enable SnapStart for your Lambda function, follow these steps:   </p><p><strong>Using the AWS Management Console:</strong></p><ol><li>Go to the  tab and choose .</li><li>Click , set  to , and save the changes.</li><li>Publish a new version of your function.</li></ol><p><p>\n Run the following commands to enable SnapStart for your function:</p></p><div><pre><code>\n\naws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function --snap-start ApplyOn=PublishedVersions aws lambda publish-version --function-name my-function \n</code></pre></div><p>Replace  with your function's name. After publishing, SnapStart will be active for that version.</p><p>Since SnapStart restores functions from a snapshot, any unique data generated during initialization (like unique IDs or random numbers) will be duplicated across invocations. To ensure uniqueness:</p><ul><li>Generate unique data within the function handler, not during initialization.</li><li>Use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNGs) to maintain randomness.</li></ul><p><p>\n In this example, a unique ID is generated each time the function is invoked, ensuring uniqueness across invocations.</p></p><div><pre><code>\n\nimport json import random import time unique_number = None def lambda_handler(event, context): seed = int(time.time() * 1000) random.seed(seed) global unique_number if not unique_number: unique_number = random.randint(1, 10000) print(\"Unique number: \", unique_number) return \"Hello, World!\" \n</code></pre></div><p><p>\n Or, you can use a CSPRNG to generate random numbers securely:</p></p><div><pre><code>\n\nimport json import random secure_rng = random.SystemRandom() def lambda_handler(event, context): random_numbers = [secure_rng.random() for _ in range(10)] for number in random_numbers: print(number) return \"Hello, World!\" \n</code></pre></div><p>AWS provides runtime hooks that allow you to execute code at specific points during the snapshot lifecycle:</p><ul><li><code>@register_before_snapshot</code>: Runs code before the snapshot is taken.</li><li>: Runs code after the snapshot is restored.</li></ul><div><pre><code>\n\nfrom snapshot_restore_py import register_before_snapshot, register_after_restore @register_before_snapshot def before_snapshot(): # Code to run before snapshot print(\"Running before snapshot\") @register_after_restore def after_restore(): # Code to run after restore print(\"Running after restore\") def lambda_handler(event, context): print(\"Handler execution\") # Your handler logic here \n</code></pre></div><p>This setup ensures that specific code runs at the appropriate stages of the snapshot lifecycle.</p><p>Monitoring is crucial to ensure your SnapStart-enabled functions perform as expected. You can use Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray for this purpose.   </p><p><p>\n CloudWatch provides logs for both initialization and invocation phases. For SnapStart functions, you'll see an </p> log entry detailing the initialization duration.   </p><p><p>\n With X-Ray, you can trace requests to your functions. In SnapStart functions, the </p> subsegment indicates the time taken to restore the snapshot and execute any after-restore hooks.</p><p>SnapStart supports encryption at rest. By default, AWS Lambda encrypts snapshots using an AWS managed KMS key. If you prefer, you can specify a customer-managed KMS key during function configuration:</p><div><pre><code>\n\naws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function --kms-key-arn arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id \n</code></pre></div><p>Replace  with your function's name and provide the appropriate KMS key ARN.</p><p>To get the most out of SnapStart:</p><ul><li>Preload dependencies and initialize resources during the initialization phase to reduce latency during invocation.</li><li>Organize your code efficiently, ensuring that heavy computational tasks are handled during initialization.</li><li>Use runtime hooks to manage tasks that need to occur before snapshotting or after restoring.</li></ul><div><pre><code>\n\n# Import all dependencies outside of Lambda handler from snapshot_restore_py import register_before_snapshot import boto3 import pandas import pydantic # Create S3 and SSM clients outside of Lambda handler s3_client = boto3.client(\"s3\") # Register the function to be called before snapshot @register_before_snapshot def download_llm_models(): # Download an object from S3 and save to tmp # This files will persist in this snapshot with open('/tmp/FILE_NAME', 'wb') as f: s3_client.download_fileobj('amzn-s3-demo-bucket', 'OBJECT_NAME', f) ... def lambda_handler(event, context): ... \n</code></pre></div><p>By preloading data during initialization, you reduce the time spent fetching resources during invocation, leading to better performance.</p><p>SnapStart is a powerful feature that significantly reduces cold start latency for AWS Lambda functions. By taking a snapshot of the function's execution environment after initialization, SnapStart allows functions to be invoked immediately without reinitialization. This feature is available for newer versions of Java/Python/.NET-based runtimes and can be enabled through the AWS Management Console or CLI. To maintain uniqueness, generate unique data within the function handler and use CSPRNGs for randomness. Runtime hooks can be used to execute code at specific points during the snapshot lifecycle. Monitoring with CloudWatch and X-Ray is essential to ensure optimal performance, and security considerations include encryption at rest. By following best practices and optimizing your code, you can leverage SnapStart to enhance the performance of your Lambda functions. Remember, SnapStart will not boost startup time if the function is already warm, and might not be as effective for functions that are invoked infrequently.</p><p>If you liked the article and want to keep me motivated to provide more content, you can share this article with your friends and colleagues and follow me here on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pooyan_razian\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medium</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/prazian/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>.</p><ul><li>All content provided on this blog is for informational purposes only.

You're not alone - 73% of Laravel developers face unexpected performance issues. But here's the good news: most slow Laravel apps are just a few optimizations away from blazing fast speeds. 🚀</p><p>: Your database isn't always the culprit (though it often is), and the framework isn't to blame either. Let's dive into what's really holding your app back.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Truth About Laravel Performance\n</h2><p>Let me share something fascinating from a recent social media survey I conducted about Laravel performance issues. Out of hundreds of responses, not a single developer blamed the framework itself. That's right - Laravel wasn't the bottleneck. Instead, these were the top culprits:</p><ol><li>Database queries gone wild 🔍</li><li>Sluggish HTTP requests to third-party APIs ⚡</li><li>Queue jobs that should've been queued but weren't 📬</li><li>PHP itself (but not in the way you might think) 🤔</li></ol><p>Let's break down each issue and discover how to fix them.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. The Silent Performance Killer: PHP Artisan Optimize\n</h2><p>Here's a shocking revelation: if you're using Laravel Forge and haven't modified your deployment script, you're probably missing out on a crucial optimization. The  command isn't included in the default deployment script.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because this simple command:</p><ul><li>Caches your configuration</li></ul><p>But there's a catch (isn't there always?). Using  in production means the  helper won't work. You'll need to use the  helper instead. Small price to pay for a significant speed boost, wouldn't you say?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Queue Everything (Yes, Everything!)\n</h2><p>\"But my mail sending code works fine!\" I hear you say. Sure, until that one time SendGrid has a hiccup, and your users are staring at a 500 error. Remember this golden rule: anything that could fail or take time should be queued.</p><p>Here's a pro tip: implement the  interface in your mail classes. This ensures your emails are always queued, whether you use  or . Your users will thank you for the snappy response times.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. OpCache: The Performance Boost You're Not Using\n</h2><p>Let me paint you a picture of how PHP typically works:</p><ol><li>Repeat (yes, for every request!)</li></ol><p>OpCache skips steps 1-3, loading pre-compiled bytecode from memory. In one of my recent projects, enabling OpCache dropped average response times from 300ms to 90ms. That's a 70% improvement with literally one click!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. The N+1 Query Problem: A Detective Story\n</h2><p>Picture this: you're displaying a list of users and their favorite games. Seems simple enough, right? But check your debug bar - are you seeing something like this?</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That's the infamous N+1 query problem. The solution? Eager loading to the rescue:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>But wait! There's a trap. Don't be tempted to use the  property in your models. It's a siren's call that leads to unnecessary database queries.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Memory Management: When Less Is More\n</h2><p>Working with large datasets? Instead of loading full models, use the  method to grab just what you need:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In one real-world case, this simple change reduced memory usage from 20MB to 13MB and shaved 40ms off the response time.</p><p>Remember, you can't improve what you can't measure. Tools like SPX (my personal favorite) can help you identify bottlenecks without the performance overhead of xDebug. It's like having a microscope for your code's performance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Ready to Supercharge Your Laravel App?\n</h2><p>Let's be honest - performance optimization isn't the most glamorous part of development.

Among them, Wood Plastic Composite (WPC, Wood Plastic Composite) has gradually become one of the important materials for door and window manufacturing due to its environmental protection, durability, moisture resistance, insect resistance, etc. WPC door frame, as an important part of the , is not only superior to the traditional wooden door frame in terms of performance, but also has a unique removable and repairable nature, which brings users more convenience and economic value for users. In this paper, we will discuss in detail the removability and maintainability of WPC door frames, as well as their advantages in practical applications.</p><h2><strong>Removability Of WPC Door Frame</strong></h2><h2><strong>1. Convenience in structural design</strong></h2><p>WPC door frame usually adopts modular design, which is made of different parts. Compared with the traditional wooden door frame needs to be nailed or glued in a fixed way, WPC door frame usually uses slot connection, screw fixing or snap structure during installation, which makes it more convenient to dismantle the door frame when needed, and can be disassembled without the use of complex tools.</p><h2><strong>2. Adapt to different installation requirements</strong></h2><p>The removability of WPC door frame makes it flexible to be used in different scenarios. For example, when replacing a door, adjusting the size of a door frame or moving house, it can be easily disassembled and reinstalled without damaging the original structure. This is an attractive option for rental users or families who often need to change their decoration style.</p><h2><strong>3. Reduce installation cost and time</strong></h2><p>Due to the removable nature of WPC door frames, the installation process becomes easier and faster. Construction workers do not need to use a lot of professional tools, and ordinary users can complete the installation and dismantling with simple instructions. This not only saves labor costs, but also reduces construction time and improves decoration efficiency.</p><h2><strong>The Repairability Of WPC Door Frame</strong></h2><h2><strong>1. Local damage can be repaired</strong></h2><p>Traditional wooden door frames can not be repaired easily due to moisture, insects or mechanical damage, and can only be replaced as a whole. The material characteristics of WPC door frame make it possible to repair when local damage occurs. For example, if a section is cracked or chipped due to an external impact, specialized WPC repair agents, filler materials or individual modules can be used or replaced without removing the entire frame.</p><h2><strong>2. High durability and reduced maintenance frequency</strong></h2><p>The water, insect and rot resistant properties of WPC materials make WPC door frames require less maintenance than traditional wood door frames. In humid environments, WPC door frames will not be deformed or moldy due to water absorption, nor will they be attacked by termites and other pests, thus reducing the possibility of repair and replacement. Even after a long period of use, it can be kept in good condition with simple cleaning and maintenance.</p><h2><strong>3. High compatibility with replacement of individual components</strong></h2><p>Due to the modular design of the , even if part of the structure is damaged, the user can replace the damaged parts individually without having to replace the entire door frame. This design significantly reduces maintenance costs and increases the service life of the door frame. In addition, the standardized production of WPC door frame makes the compatibility between different models, even if the replacement of parts, do not have to worry about not finding a matching product.</p><h2><strong>WPC Door Frame Can Be Disassembled And Repairable To Bring The Advantages Of</strong></h2><h2><strong>1. Reduce long-term cost of use</strong></h2><p>Compared with the traditional wooden door frame, the removable and repairable nature of WPC door frame means that users do not need to frequently replace the entire door frame during long-term use, and only need to repair or adjust the damaged parts locally, which greatly reduces maintenance costs.</p><h2><strong>2. Green and environmental protection, reduce resource waste</strong></h2><p>WPC material itself is an environmentally friendly material, made of wood flour and plastic composite, reducing the consumption of forest resources. At the same time, its removable and repairable nature eliminates the need for frequent replacement of door frames, which further reduces construction waste and resource waste, in line with the modern concept of sustainable development.</p><h2><strong>3. Improved user experience and flexibility</strong></h2><p>Both domestic and commercial users can freely adjust the installation method, dismantling sequence and maintenance program of WPC door frames according to their own needs, avoiding the trouble of replacing the whole door frame due to minor problems. This flexibility improves the user experience and makes WPC door frames a more practical choice.</p><p>With its unique removability and repairability,  have a wide range of applications in modern homes and commercial buildings. Its convenient installation and removal methods, repairable modular design, and durable and low-maintenance characteristics make it a quality alternative to traditional wood door frames. With the rising demand for environmental protection and economy, WPC door frames will occupy a more important position in the future market, providing users with more convenient, durable and environmentally friendly window and door solutions.</p>","contentLength":5405,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Winter Festival Scratch Ticket 🎭","url":"https://dev.to/boglarkasebestyen/winter-festival-scratch-ticket-4ae2","date":1740193475,"author":"Boglárka Sebestyén","guid":8946,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi!

Modern fire detection systems rely not only on traditional sensors like smoke detectors, but also on advanced sensors such as gas, flame, and heat sensors. The printed circuit board (PCB) plays a pivotal role in integrating these various sensors into a single, cohesive system. By embedding multiple sensors into a compact PCB design, manufacturers can create smart fire detection systems that provide more accurate and faster responses to fire hazards. In this article, we explore the role of advanced PCB designs in integrating multiple sensors for improved fire safety.</p><p><strong>For reliable PCB fabrication and assembly, Highleap Electronic, based in China, delivers custom solutions with 2/2 mil trace width and various material options. Contact us: <a href=\"https://hilelectronic.com/pcb-fabrication/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://hilelectronic.com/pcb-fabrication/</a></strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Need for Multiple Sensor Integration in Fire Detection:\n</h2><p>Traditional fire detection systems typically relied on a single sensor, such as a smoke detector, to detect the presence of a fire. However, these systems have limitations, particularly in environments where conditions vary. For example:</p><p>Smoke detectors may not function effectively in areas with limited air movement, like industrial settings.\nGas sensors are often more effective in detecting fires that produce hazardous gases before visible smoke or flames.<p>\nFlame sensors provide immediate detection of open flames, especially in environments where rapid combustion occurs.</p>\nTo overcome these limitations, modern fire safety systems integrate multiple sensors on a single PCB, which enables them to provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of fire risks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Role of PCBs in Multi-Sensor Integration:\n</h2><p>The integration of multiple sensors, such as smoke, gas, flame, and heat detectors, into a single PCB provides several benefits:</p><p>Compact Design: Integrating multiple sensors into a single PCB reduces the size of the system, making it easier to install and maintain.\nImproved Signal Processing: With PCBs, sensors can be connected to signal processing circuits that convert analog signals into digital data, enabling better analysis and faster responses.<p>\nPower Management: Multi-sensor systems require careful power management to ensure that all sensors receive the appropriate amount of power. PCBs manage the power distribution to ensure that each sensor operates within its optimal range.</p>\nReliability: By embedding components directly into the PCB layers, the likelihood of mechanical failure is reduced, increasing the overall reliability of the system.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Recent Advancements in PCB Design for Fire Detection:\n</h2><p>Recent innovations in PCB design have allowed for more efficient integration of multiple sensors in fire detection systems:</p><p>Embedded Components: Modern PCBs now allow for the embedding of resistors, capacitors, and even some active components directly into the PCB layers. This minimizes the need for external components and results in smaller, more reliable systems.\nFlexible PCBs: Flexible PCBs are used in fire detection systems where space constraints exist or where sensors need to be placed on irregular surfaces. This flexibility is particularly useful in custom fire safety solutions for complex or unusual environments.<p>\nWireless Communication: The integration of wireless communication modules such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth within the PCB design allows fire detection systems to transmit data in real-time to monitoring centers or other smart devices, enabling faster response times.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Smart Fire Safety Systems:\n</h2><p>The integration of multiple sensors and advanced PCB designs has led to the development of smart fire safety systems. These systems are connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and can send real-time data to a central monitoring system or directly to a smartphone app. Some key features of smart fire detection systems include:</p><p>Remote Monitoring: Users can monitor their home or business for fire risks from anywhere using a mobile app.\nAutomatic Response: In smart buildings, fire detection systems can trigger automatic suppression systems (e.g., sprinklers) or adjust HVAC systems to contain the spread of smoke or heat.<p>\nIntegration with Other Systems: Smart fire safety systems can be integrated with other building systems, such as security alarms, lighting, and emergency services, to ensure a coordinated response in case of a fire.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Applications of Multi-Sensor Fire Detection Systems:\n</h2><p>Residential Homes: In smart homes, fire detection systems integrated with multiple sensors help provide comprehensive fire monitoring. These systems can send alerts to homeowners when fire risks are detected, offering peace of mind and increased safety.\nIndustrial Applications: In industrial settings, where fires can be more hazardous and difficult to detect, multi-sensor systems provide early warning of dangerous conditions, allowing workers to evacuate or trigger fire suppression systems before the fire escalates.<p>\nPublic Spaces and Commercial Buildings: In large spaces such as airports, shopping malls, and office buildings, multi-sensor fire detection systems integrated into PCBs ensure comprehensive monitoring of fire risks, providing enhanced protection for occupants.</p></p><p>As fire detection technology advances, smart fire detection systems that integrate multiple sensors into PCBs are becoming more common. These systems provide enhanced fire safety by offering faster, more accurate responses to fire risks. With innovations in multi-sensor integration, flexible PCBs, and wireless communication, fire detection systems are becoming smarter and more effective, helping to save lives and prevent property damage.</p>","contentLength":5811,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"API Integration with Tanstack Query: Transforming Product Data Management","url":"https://dev.to/yugjadvani/api-integration-with-tanstack-query-transforming-product-data-management-jgc","date":1740189694,"author":"Yug Jadvani","guid":8932,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s fast‐paced digital economy, enterprise leaders must ensure that backend systems and user interfaces are seamlessly connected.

These are:</p><ol><li> - Used when you need to include letters (e.g., A-Z, a-z). While it might seem ideal for storing names, you should be cautious, as names can contain non-alphabetic characters. This data type can also include spaces.</li><li> - Used when you need to include letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., A-Z, 0-9, %, #). This type is most commonly used for storing names, coupon codes, or other mixed-type information.</li><li> - Used for numbers (e.g., 0-9). This data type is designed for arithmetic operations and calculations, making it essential for financial, scientific, and statistical applications.</li><li> - Used to format alphanumeric data for display purposes. This type allows for the insertion of fixed characters (e.g., hyphens, slashes, or spaces) into alphanumeric data.</li><li> - Used to format numeric data for display purposes. This type allows for the insertion of fixed characters (e.g., currency symbols, commas, or decimal points) into numeric data.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Note on Edited Data Types 🤦‍♂️\n</h3><p>The  and  data types can be a bit tricky at first — but simply put, it's COBOL's way of saying, \"Let's make this data look fancy!\" They're designed for formatting data for display, like adding commas to numbers, currency symbols, or even hyphens in text.</p><p>In COBOL, all variables are defined in the , which is where your COBOL program defines and stores all the data it will use. COBOL variables are hierarchical and are made up of level numbers,  (or ) clauses, and optional default value (more on this later on):</p><ol><li>A , which is how we determine if it's an individual field, group item, or elementary item. So, what the differences? They are:\n\n<ul><li> Indicates that this is a top level item. It can be either standalone or the start of a group item. I'd like point out that anything starting with a ZERO is pronounced \"OH\" followed by the level number (e.g., OH-ONE, OH-TWO).</li><li> - Indicates subordinate levels. These are used within groups to break down data into smaller, more manageable chunks — think of an  in modern programming languages.</li><li> - This is used for what's known as RENAMES. I've not used this yet, but it seems similar to creating a view in SQL, it allows you to create an alternative view of the same data.</li><li> - Indicates a standalone item which doesn't need to be not part of a group.</li><li> - Most often used for condition names. They're incredibly useful for making your code more readable. The closest comparison I can think of might be an ENUM in modern languages. However, you can't really access it like like an ENUM (e.g., ORDER-STATUS.NEW-ORDER). Instead, you use the condition name in logical statements.</li></ul></li><li>A , refers to the name we'll use to access this item later on in the program. Like in every programming language it has some rules; one of which goes against everything I was thought about variables 😀. Getting back on track now, these rules are:\n\n<ul><li> - A variable name can be as short as 1 character (please don't do this 😱—it's terrible for readability!!) and as long as 30 characters.</li><li> - Pretty standard stuff here, they can include letters (A-Z a-z), numbers (0-9), and hypens (-). </li><li><strong>Starting &amp; Ending Characters</strong> - In COBOL they can start and end with a letter or a number; that's right, a number!. However, because COBOL is not totally insane, you cannot start or end your variable names with a hypen. At least they choose to put some restrictions on the names 🤣.</li><li> - This one makes sense. Don't use reserved words (e.g., DISPLAY, ACCEPT, MOVE).</li></ul></li><li>A  - A PICTURE (or PIC) Clause - This is where all kinds of magic happens. This is how we define the type, size, and display format of a variable, using symbols (e.g., A, 9, X). Formatting is actually one of the neatest tricks of COBOL. I can't tell you how many times I've pulled my hair out trying to make something look a certain way when it's displayed. Well, COBOL does the heavy lifting for you—once you wrap your head around how it works! We'll dive deeper into this shortly.</li><li>A   - This is where you can set an initial value for your variable. It's also optional.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  A PICTURE Is Worth A Thousand Words\n</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the  clause allows you to define the structure of your data and format it in a way that makes you happy. While you might find references to the full keyword  in older code, most examples you'll encounter today use the abbreviated keyword . I think it really comes down to either personal preference or your company's programming style guide. That said, the TL;DR on the PICTURE clause is that it's a blueprint for how your data should appear.</p><p>Now, like any blueprint the  clause contains some special symbols that at first clance will make you go \"HUH!\". I'll do my best to make explain them though, and while there are more than listed here, I'm only going to touch on the most common symbols. With symbols you can either use a single character and tell it the length between parenthesis (e.g., PIC 9(5)), or your can long hand it, like: . I don't recommend taking the long route though.</p><p>The following are probably the most commonly used symbols based on what I've learned so far.</p><ol><li> - This symbol is pretty self explanitory and represents a number field. Example: , defines a 5-digit numeric field.</li><li> - This respresents an alphabetic field. Example: , defines a 10-digit numeric field.</li><li> - This represents an alphanumeric field. Example: , defines a 10-digit alphanumeric field.</li><li> - This is where things get a little interesting. This represents an an implied decimal point. Example: , defines a 7-digit numberic field with two decimal places.</li><li> - This indicates a signed number (e.g., -5.00, +5.00). I've not used this one yet.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Assigning Values to Variables\n</h2><p>In COBOL, you can assign values to variables using the  statement. This is one of the most common ways to initialize or update variables in your program.</p><p>If you're like me, reading about something is fine and dandy, but seeing the code is more helpful. That said, let's dive into some code examples.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 1: Assigning a Value to a Numeric Field\n</h3><div><pre><code>       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID. EXP01.\n       DATA DIVISION.\n       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n       01 SALARY PIC 9(5).\n       PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n         MOVE 50000 TO SALARY.\n         DISPLAY \"Salary: \" SALARY.\n         STOP RUN.\n       END PROGRAM EXP01.\n\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 2: Assigning a Value to an Alphanumeric Field\n</h3><div><pre><code>       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID. EXP02.\n       DATA DIVISION.\n       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n       01 EMPLOYEE-NAME PIC X(20).\n        PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n           MOVE \"John Doe\" TO EMPLOYEE-NAME.\n           DISPLAY \"Employee Name: \" EMPLOYEE-NAME.\n           STOP RUN.\n       END PROGRAM EXP02.\n\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 3: Assigning a Value to a Grouped Field\n</h3><p>For this example we're going to go over a couple ways to accomplish the task at hand. In COBOL, you can assign values to individual fields within a group using MOVE ... TO, or you can move data directly into the group using MOVE ... TO IN. In larger COBOL applications, you might encounter multiple groups with fields of the same name (e.g., EMPLOYEE-NAME in different groups). Using MOVE ... TO IN ensures values are assigned to the correct field, avoiding potential bugs or confusion. Let's take a look at a couple examples:</p><p>\nThis pair of statements allows you to assign values to individual fields within a group.</p><div><pre><code>       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID. EXP03A.\n       DATA DIVISION.\n       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n       01 EMPLOYEE-DETAILS.\n          05 EMPLOYEE-NAME PIC X(20).\n          05 EMPLOYEE-ID   PIC 9(5).\n       PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n           MOVE \"Jane Smith56789\" TO EMPLOYEE-DETAILS.\n           DISPLAY \"Employee Name: \" EMPLOYEE-NAME.\n           DISPLAY \"Employee ID: \" EMPLOYEE-ID.\n           STOP RUN.\n       END PROGRAM EXP03A.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>\nThis group of statements allows you to move data directly into the group, even if they share similar names. While I won't say never, I will say it shouldn't happen within smaller COBOL program, but if you work in a larger COBOL program you're probably going to see this.</p><div><pre><code>       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID. MULTIPLE-GROUPS.\n       DATA DIVISION.\n       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n       01 EMPLOYEE-DETAILS.\n          05 NAME PIC X(20).\n       01 MANAGER-DETAILS.\n          05 NAME PIC X(20).\n       PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n      *&gt; Assigning values to fields in EMPLOYEE-DETAILS\n           MOVE \"John Doe\" TO NAME IN EMPLOYEE-DETAILS.\n           DISPLAY \"Employee Name: \" NAME IN EMPLOYEE-DETAILS.\n\n      *&gt; Assigning values to fields in MANAGER-DETAILS\n           MOVE \"Jane Smith\" TO NAME IN MANAGER-DETAILS.\n           DISPLAY \"Manager Name: \" NAME IN MANAGER-DETAILS.\n\n           STOP RUN.\n       END PROGRAM MULTIPLE-GROUPS.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Another common example we'd find in a business application might be a date. Now, this is one place where COBOL, at least in all my research, seems to be lacking. The COBOL Standard itself does not natively support a dedicated  field type. So, if we want to store a date, we need to do the work ourselves. Here are a couple of examples of formatting a date.</p><p>If you want to store a date in a structured way, you can use a grouped field to break it down into its components (year, month, and day). Here's an example:</p><div><pre><code>       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID. CBLDATES.\n       DATA DIVISION.\n       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n       01 BIRTH-DATE.\n          02 BIRTH-YEAR   PIC 9(4).\n          02 BIRTH-MONTH  PIC 9(2).\n          02 BIRTH-DAY    PIC 9(2).\n       PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n           MOVE 2025 TO BIRTH-YEAR\n           MOVE 02   TO BIRTH-MONTH\n           MOVE 21   TO BIRTH-DAY\n           DISPLAY \"Year: \" BIRTH-YEAR\n           DISPLAY \"Month: \" BIRTH-MONTH\n           DISPLAY \"Day: \" BIRTH-DAY\n           STOP RUN.\n       END PROGRAM CBLDATES.\n\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Date as Individual Edited Field</strong></p><p>If you want to store and display a date in a specific format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY), you can use an Alphanumeric Edited field. Here's an example:</p><div><pre><code>       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID. CBLDATES.\n       DATA DIVISION.\n       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n       01 BIRTH-DATE PIC 99/99/9999.\n       PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n           MOVE 08151985 TO BIRTH-DATE\n           DISPLAY BIRTH-DATE\n           STOP RUN.\n       END PROGRAM CBLDATES.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>In this example, the  clause defines the format of the date, with slashes (/) inserted at fixed positions. The MOVE statement is then used to assign a raw date to , and COBOL, in turn, works its magic and formats the date as: .</p><p>In this article, we explored the fundamentals of COBOL data types and variables, including how to define and format them using PICTURE clauses. We also looked at practical examples of assigning values to variables and formatting data for display. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to handle data effectively in COBOL programs, whether you're working with numeric calculations, alphanumeric strings, or formatted displays.</p><p>If you're an experienced COBOL developer and spot any inaccuracies or areas where I could improve my explanations, I'd greatly appreciate your feedback!

However, with the increasing amount of data and complex queries, database performance can be a major challenge. In order to overcome this challenge, vector indexing has emerged as an efficient solution for enhancing database performance. Vector indexing is a data structure that organizes data in a more optimized and structured manner, improving the efficiency of database operations.</p><p>Advantages:\nOne of the major advantages of vector indexing is its ability to handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently. By organizing the data in a vector structure, the index points to specific locations in the data, reducing the time and resources required for data retrieval. Additionally, vector indexing offers faster query execution, resulting in reduced query response time. This not only improves the overall efficiency of the database but also enhances the user experience.</p><p>Disadvantages:\nVector indexing also has some limitations, such as its reliance on the data being in a specific format. This can pose a challenge when working with different types of data or constantly changing data. Additionally, vector indexing can consume a significant amount of storage space, especially for large datasets.</p><p>Features:\nVector indexing offers various helpful features, such as support for multidimensional and high-dimensional data, which traditional indexing methods struggle with. It also allows for partial matching, making it easier to handle misspelled or incomplete queries. Another useful feature is its support for similarity searches, making it ideal for applications such as recommendation engines and data mining.</p><p>Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, vector indexing has proven to be an effective solution for enhancing database performance. With its ability to handle large datasets, faster query execution, and support for various data types, it has become a popular choice for improving database efficiency. While it may have some limitations, its benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making it a valuable tool for organizations looking to optimize their database performance. Implementing vector indexing can significantly improve the performance of databases, leading to improved productivity and better decision-making.</p>","contentLength":2303,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Social Media Management Tool with Next.js 14","url":"https://dev.to/fistonuser/building-a-social-media-management-tool-with-nextjs-14-2ek","date":1740182363,"author":"root","guid":8891,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I recently built a social media management tool using Next.js 14, Prisma, and Clerk for authentication.

Within this folder, create a file named server.ts. This file will contain all the server-side configuration code for BetterAuth.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To enable Google authentication with BetterAuth, we need to perform a few configuration steps, as outlined in the BetterAuth documentation. Let's get started!</p><blockquote><p>To use Google as a social provider, you need to get your Google credentials. You can get them by creating a new project in the Google Cloud Console.\nIn the Google Cloud Console &gt; Credentials &gt; Authorized redirect URIs, make sure to set the redirect URL to <a href=\"http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback/google\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback/google</a> for local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. <a href=\"https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google</a>. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.</p></blockquote><p>Now that you have your Google Client ID and Google Client Secret, let's add them to our .env file. Be sure to replace the placeholder strings in the code below with your actual values</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let's create the BetterAuth client. This client will provide the methods we need to sign up, sign in, and sign out users. Create a client.ts file within the app/utils/auth directory to house this client.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To complete the BetterAuth setup, we need to mount the authentication handler to an API route, which React Router v7 refers to as a \"Resource Route.\"\nFirst, clear out the app/routes directory by removing all files within it. Then, create a new folder named api inside the app/routes directory. Finally, create an auth.ts file inside the newly created app/routes/api directory.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To integrate a tRPC backend with React Router v7 and BetterAuth, we need to install a few additional packages. Run the following commands in your terminal to install them</p><div><pre><code>npm i @tanstack/react-query @trpc/client@next @trpc/server@next @trpc/tanstack-react-query superjson zod\n</code></pre></div><p>Let's begin setting up tRPC. Inside the app directory, create a server directory to house all our tRPC routers and procedures. Within app/server, create a db.ts file. In this file, we'll instantiate a Prisma client, which we'll use to query our database.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Inside the app/server directory, create a trpc.ts file. This file will contain all our tRPC backend configuration. Be sure to read the comments within the code carefully, as they explain each step involved in configuring tRPC.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We'll now define our first tRPC router and a public procedure. To organize our routers, create a new directory called router inside the app/server directory. Inside app/server/routers, create a file named greeting.ts. This file will contain the code for our router.\nWithin this router, we'll define two procedures: a public procedure called hello, which returns the string \"Hello, world!\", and a protected procedure called user, which retrieves and returns the currently authenticated user's data from the database.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, let's create our main router. Inside the app/server directory, create a main.ts file. This main router will serve to merge all our individual routers into a single endpoint.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The next step is to mount the tRPC handler to an API route, which React Router v7 refers to as a \"Resource Route.\" Inside the app/routes/api directory, create a file named trpc.ts.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, let's integrate tRPC with TanStack Query and define the provider that will allow us to call our procedures directly from our client-side React components using TanStack Query. Inside the app/utils directory, create a new directory called trpc. Within app/utils/trpc, create a file named react.tsx.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With our provider component ready, we need to make it available to our entire application. To do this, we'll wrap our main App component with the provider in the root.tsx file. Modify root.tsx as follows:</p><div><pre><code>// app/root.tsx\n</code></pre></div><p>Next, let's configure our tRPC caller to enable server-side calls to our procedures from loaders and actions. Inside the app/utils/trpc directory, create a file called server.ts.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Define React Router Routes\n</h2><p>With tRPC fully configured, we can now define all our routes in React Router. This includes the Resource/API Routes for BetterAuth and tRPC, as well as the regular page routes for our application. We'll modify the app/routes.ts file to configure these routes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now that our routes are defined, let's create our home page, which React Router refers to as the \"index route.\" To do this, create a file named home.tsx inside the app/routes directory. Within this home.tsx file, we'll call the greeting.hello procedure to display a greeting.\nWe will be using TansTack Query on the client side to fetch data.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to create our sign-in page. To do this, create a file named signin.tsx inside the app/routes directory. We'll be using our BetterAuth client to handle the sign-in functionality.</p><div><pre><code>\n        Sign up with Google</code></pre></div><p>With user sign-in implemented, let's create the user page, which will display personalized information. To ensure that only authenticated users can access this page, we'll perform an authentication check on the server side using a loader. If no user is authenticated or if an error occurs during authentication, we'll redirect them to the home page. Otherwise, we'll display a personalized greeting. Create a file named user.tsx inside the app/routes directory to define this page.</p><div><pre><code>\n      Hello! </code></pre></div><p>This is merely a basic starting guide, if you're working on a project destined for production, make sure to check the docs for all the tools we used.</p><p>If you have any questions or need help, Feel free to DM me on <a href=\"https://x.com/ayoubphy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter/X</a></p>","contentLength":7496,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Los maquetadores y frontend usan la plantilla html","url":"https://dev.to/maxiweb/los-maquetadores-y-frontend-usan-la-plantilla-html-5238","date":1740180140,"author":"Usuario2025","guid":8884,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Sí, prácticamente toda la comunidad de maquetadores web y desarrolladores frontend usa una plantilla básica de HTML.

With developers, for instance, the list of things to migrate can go on endlessly. From SSH keys to tools (or their equivalents in a different operating system), account details, program files, environment setups, and configurations. These can take a chunk of someone's time. Even worse, some of them (e.g. configurations) are only possible to the extent of the previous machine still being available. I imagine configurations being a nightmare to remember if something crashes unless there is a previous backup available on demand. I'll talk about a nifty way of keeping configurations.</p><p>I recently switched devices and found myself using the  terminal. It seemed very compatible with the  commands that I was more familiar with, but I had a big gripe with it right away: \"tab completions were not case-sensitive\". This was a big deal because I like the idea of my directory names being capitalized, and having to account for this caused a lot of friction. I decided to switch to  in the hopes of that being resolved, but I had no such luck. I figured I would have to play around with my terminal configurations and found some commands that did this. I created the required  file, copied the commands, saved them, and tested them. It worked, but I encountered another problem shortly after: My active GitHub branches weren't showing in the terminal.</p><p>I use branches a lot, and having the one I'm in show on my terminal is a big relief, and saves me the stress of manually checking every time. This is something I cannot live without, and I got some code from the internet to add to my . Things worked fine, but three questions came to my mind:</p><ol><li>Would I always have to do this while setting up a new machine?</li><li>What if I (or someone else) accidentally deleted the  file?</li><li>What if I made a change and wanted to undo it later on?</li></ol><p>The third question had the easiest solution: write comments for every new addition. And while having a trash folder felt like an answer to the second question, it wasn't guaranteed that it would always be retrievable.</p><p>As for the answer to all the questions? Well, that's what I'm here to talk about.</p><p>I shared some of my annoyances with the new setup process with a friend of mine and we talked about possible ways of solving these problems. He mentioned a solution he developed for himself after several years of switching machines because he had very precise settings he liked to keep. Hint: it involved Version Control.</p><p>Version Control allows you to track and store different states of a file, with an option to store these versions in a remote repository. This answers the 3 questions from earlier, but brings with it, its own question: \"How?\"</p><p>There are two ways of doing this with git:</p><ol><li>Make the location of the  a git repo.</li><li>Have the content of the  file in a different location (which will be a git repo), and then point to that location.</li></ol><p>The first approach seems good at first glance. However, the usual location for the  file is in the home directory, which also has lots of files. To achieve the desired result, you would need a  file in place to ignore everything else  the pertinent config file. The drawback with this is that you could somehow end up committing something new (and sensitive) or even damage something in your home directory while setting up. It's a high-risk low-reward process.</p><p>The second approach, on the other hand, might seem a bit confusing to do at first, but is safer. The trick to achieving this is knowing how to point files to other files, similar to how variables work in programming languages. This is where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Symbolic links</a> (symlinks) come in. A symlink is a file that points to another file. Beneath the hood, it's simply a file that contains a text string file path, in a format that the operating system understands to follow up with. Essentially, we could write the configs in a safe (or even public) location, and have their counterparts in the home directory point to them instead. This way, you could make a change in the new location, and everything would reflect as expected. Best of all, you could commit changes without fear of damaging anything, and replicate the process for as many different machines as you want.</p><p>The first step would be knowing how to create a symlink. For POSIX, the shell command to do this is:</p><div><pre><code> &lt;target-path&gt; &lt;link-path&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>Where the  is what you want to point to, and the  is the copy that points to it. Let's say you have a file  in the  directory and you want to make it read-only and accessible from the  directory, the command would look like this:</p><div><pre><code> path/to/documents/a path/to/desktop/a\n</code></pre></div><p>The  will be created if no such file exists, but the  should ideally exist, else there would be nothing to be linked to.</p><p>For my symlink, I created my new  file in the following path:</p><div><pre><code>Documents/Code/Scripts/dotfiles/.zshrc\n</code></pre></div><p>Afterward, I initialized the  folder into a git repo and pushed it to my GitHub remote. Having done this, I edited the  and filled it with the copied-over commands from my findings.</p><p>By default, shell terminals look for configuration files in the home directory (). My next step was to link one to the target I created in the git repo. To do this, I ran:</p><div><pre><code> Documents/Code/Scripts/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc\n</code></pre></div><p>I reloaded my terminal afterward, and all my new terminal configurations worked. To be sure changes would reflect, I appended some random characters to my target file and ran  to see if the characters would reflect, and that worked. Essentially, problem solved.</p><p>With this technique, I can persist not only shell configs, but also other text file settings I would like to carry along to other machines, and it would take me only one terminal command to get everything working as intended.</p><p>Going even further, I could have this for multiple types of files, and then have a  that I could run to set up everything automatically. For example, the following:</p><div><pre><code> path/to/target/.zshrc ~./zshrc\n path/to/target/.zshrc_profile ~./zshrc_profile\n path/to/target/.zshrc_completion ~./zshrc_completion\n</code></pre></div><p>would make  a convenient script to run, especially on a new machine.</p><ul><li>The target file and link file do not need to have the same name. It just helps for recognition.</li><li>The  file would work similarly to , depending on the shell terminal you're using. The principles still hold.</li><li>These methods are not limited to just configurations and will work in pretty much any situation where you need to have something in a location you would rather not turn into a repo, but would like to keep for future usage.</li><li>There are different types of config files. I used the one I was most familiar with.</li></ul><p>Special thanks to my friend <a href=\"https://github.com/rec\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tom</a> for pointers on how to solve the problem.</p><p>Finally, thank you for reading.</p>","contentLength":6912,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Get a List of Hooks in a WordPress Plugin","url":"https://dev.to/muhammadmedhat/how-to-get-a-list-of-hooks-in-a-wordpress-plugin-3hf9","date":1740176249,"author":"Muhammad Medhat","guid":8866,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In WordPress,  are used to modify or extend the functionality of themes and plugins.

The answer often lies in whether or not they use a Content Delivery Network (CDN). But what exactly is a CDN, and how can it supercharge your website's speed and performance? Let’s break it down!</p><p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of servers that store cached versions of your website’s content. Instead of every visitor fetching data from a single central server, they get served from the nearest CDN location, significantly reducing load times.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Does a CDN Improve Website Speed?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Reduced Latency: Why Does Distance Matter?\n</h3><p>When a user visits your website, their browser requests data from your server. If your server is far away, it takes longer for the data to travel. A CDN places your content on multiple servers worldwide, ensuring that users receive data from the closest server, cutting down load times.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Faster Load Times: Can a Few Seconds Make a Difference?\n</h3><p>Absolutely! Studies show that if a website takes more than 3 seconds to load, users are likely to leave. By serving content from a nearby CDN server, your website loads much faster, improving user experience and reducing bounce rates.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Handling High Traffic: What Happens When Thousands of Users Visit at Once?\n</h3><p>Without a CDN, high traffic can overwhelm your server, causing slow performance or even crashes. A CDN distributes this traffic across multiple servers, ensuring smooth performance even during traffic spikes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Better SEO: Does Website Speed Affect Search Rankings?\n</h3><p>Yes! Google considers page speed a ranking factor. Faster websites have better SEO scores, leading to improved search rankings and higher organic traffic.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Additional Benefits of Using a CDN\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Enhanced Security: Can a CDN Protect My Website?\n</h3><p>Yes! CDNs provide DDoS protection, SSL encryption, and security layers that safeguard your website from cyber threats.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Bandwidth Savings: Can a CDN Reduce Hosting Costs?\n</h3><p>CDNs optimize content delivery, reducing the amount of data your origin server needs to handle. This leads to lower bandwidth costs and improved efficiency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Global Reach: Can My Website Perform Well Worldwide?\n</h3><p>Definitely! A CDN ensures that users around the world experience fast load times, no matter where they are located.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Can You Start Using a CDN?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Choose a CDN Provider\n</h3><p>Popular options include Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, Fastly, and Google Cloud CDN.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Integrate with Your Website\n</h3><p>Most CDNs offer easy integration with CMS platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and Next.js.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Configure and Optimize\n</h3><p>Enable caching, minify files, and use image optimization techniques to get the most out of your CDN.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Is a CDN Worth It?\n</h2><p>If you want a faster, more secure, and globally accessible website, using a CDN is a no-brainer. With improved speed, SEO rankings, and reliability, it’s an essential tool for any modern website. So, what are you waiting for? Boost your site’s performance today with a CDN! 🚀</p>","contentLength":3174,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Check Out My New Markdown Blog App!","url":"https://dev.to/burakdev/check-out-my-new-markdown-blog-app-1e8c","date":1740174429,"author":"Burak Bilen","guid":8849,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I have been working on my latest blog integrations to my personal web application since the last  month, I'd love to share how was the process, what did I learn through the journey!</p><ul><li><p>Front-end\n-- Next.js <p>\n-- Motion Provider (for animations)</p>\n-- Typescript\n-- Redux\n-- TailwindCSS V4\n-- Radix UI</p></li><li><p>Back-end\n-- Supabase\n-- PostgreSQL</p></li><li><p>Hosting &amp; Domain\n-- Netlify</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  How the blogging system works?\n</h2><p>As you may know, <em>reusability is the most important thing that every developer should consider while developing any react application.</em> To stay consistent among the designed components, I used next.js's SSG for my server-side site generated pages at the build time.

The Problem with Local State\n</h2><p>Terraform tracks resources using state files (terraform.tfstate). By default, it stores this file locally, which creates problems like:</p><ul><li><p>Collaboration Issues – If multiple engineers work on the same infrastructure, local state can lead to conflicts</p></li><li><p>State Loss – Accidentally deleting terraform.tfstate means losing track of infrastructure.</p></li><li><p>Security Risks – Keeping sensitive state files on a local machine is unsafe.</p></li></ul><p>The solution? Storing Terraform state remotely in AWS using S3 (for storage) and DynamoDB (for locking).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Remote State Storage in AWS\n</h2><p>\nBefore starting, ensure you have:</p><ul><li>An AWS Free Tier account.</li><li>AWS CLI installed (aws configure set up with your credentials).</li><li>Terraform installed (terraform -v).</li></ul><p><strong>Create an S3 Bucket for Storing State</strong>\nWe’ll create an S3 bucket to store the terraform.tfstate file.</p><p>Run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>aws s3 mb s3://my-terraform-state-bucket --region us-east-1\n</code></pre></div><p>Enable versioning to keep history:</p><div><pre><code>aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-terraform-state-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled\n</code></pre></div><p>Why versioning? If a state file gets corrupted or deleted, you can restore a previous version.</p><p><strong>Create a DynamoDB Table for State Locking</strong></p><p>DynamoDB prevents multiple people from modifying the state at the same time (called state locking).</p><div><pre><code>aws dynamodb create-table \\\n    --table-name terraform-state-lock \\\n    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \\\n    --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \\\n    --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST\n</code></pre></div><p>Why state locking?

Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:</strong>\nThe vuln function has a buffer () that’s only 16 bytes long.

But more often than not, those yeses led me to <strong>tight deadlines, late nights, and some… creative technical workarounds</strong> (you know, the kind that makes future-you weep).  </p><p>The turning point? Learning to say . Or more often, the more diplomatic cousin of no:</p><ul><li>“Yes, but we’ll need to adjust the timeline.”\n</li><li>“Yes, if we drop another lower-priority task.”\n</li><li>“No, because that would introduce tech debt that will haunt us forever.”</li></ul><p>Turns out, strategic no's transformed me into a <strong>better engineer, a better teammate, and a much more effective professional overall</strong>. Here’s why—and how you can harness the power of no to elevate your own work and sanity.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problem with Always Saying Yes\n</h2><p>The tech world often glorifies the Yes Person. They’re seen as flexible, eager, and a team player. But saying yes to everything has some hidden costs, particularly in fields like engineering and project management, where the stakes are consistently high.  </p><p>Here’s what unchecked yeses can lead to:</p><ul><li> Saying yes to more commitments than you have time for inevitably results in exhaustion. Constant late nights and rushed work don’t lead to personal or professional growth—they just empty your tank.\n</li><li> Agreeing to overly ambitious deadlines often means cutting corners. And what looks like success in the short term will leave your team paying interest on those decisions for years.\n</li><li> When everything is a priority,  is a priority. Projects finished under the weight of “yes to everything” tend to lack the structure and finesse that truly stand out.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, saying yes to everything doesn’t make you a hero; it makes you a hazard—to yourself and your team.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Saying No is a Superpower\n</h2><p>Saying no strategically isn’t just about protecting your sanity (although, that’s important too). It’s about ensuring long-term success—for yourself, your projects, and your team.</p><p>Here’s what saying no can do for you:</p><ul><li> Establishing boundaries allows you to focus on the tasks that truly matter. Delivering one product milestone well beats delivering five poorly.\n</li><li> Fewer commitments mean more time to work thoughtfully and effectively on the things that count. Instead of sweating over quick fixes, you can build something to be proud of.\n</li><li> Pushing back helps prevent impossible timelines and stops burnout culture in its tracks. Deadlines grounded in reality are better for you, your team, and—surprise—for your leadership’s trust in you.\n</li></ul><p>The key lesson? Saying no isn’t about being difficult or resistant; it’s about ensuring decisions align with real constraints, shared goals, and long-term success.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Say No Without Burning Bridges\n</h2><p>If the thought of saying no sends a wave of anxiety through your body, don’t worry—you’re not alone. Engineers, tech leads, and project managers alike often worry about how saying no might damage their reputation or relationships. But saying no <strong>doesn’t have to come across as negative</strong>.  </p><p>Here are practical ways you can say no while still being collaborative and solution-driven:</p><p>This is one of my go-to strategies. When a request lands on your plate, consider responding with a conditional yes. For example:</p><ul><li>“Yes, I can take this on, but we’ll need to extend the launch date by two weeks.”\n</li><li>“Yes, but for this to be delivered on time, we’ll have to postpone feature XYZ.”\n</li></ul><p>This shows you’re being thoughtful and realistic while presenting solutions instead of obstacles.  </p><p>Pushback becomes a lot easier when it’s backed by facts. For example:</p><ul><li>“No, because adding this feature would introduce latency that exceeds our performance benchmarks.”\n</li><li>“No, because we’ve already committed 12 developer hours to the sprint, and squeezing this in would put us over capacity.”\n</li></ul><p>Data makes the conversation less personal and more objective, which helps teammates and stakeholders understand your reasoning.</p><p>Get comfortable with saying things like:</p><ul><li>\"No, because rushing this will create tech debt that will haunt us down the line.\"\n</li><li>“No, because this violates our codebase standard and will slow development in future sprints.”\n</li></ul><p>Every tech lead or product owner encountering these perfectly logical reasons will breathe a secret sigh of relief (whether they admit it or not).</p><p>Don’t just say no; explain the \"why.\" Transparency builds trust. For instance:</p><ul><li>\"No, because I’m already loaded with task A and task B, and compromising quality isn't something I’m comfortable with.\"\n</li><li>“No, because this request requires resources we don’t currently have allocated.”\n</li></ul><p>When people understand your reason, they’re more likely to agree with your decision.</p><p>Sometimes, the classic “no” can feel abrupt. Instead, try softer alternatives that maintain rapport:</p><ul><li>“That’s a great idea, but I think we should revisit it after we finish XYZ.”\n</li><li>“I wish I could help, but unfortunately, I can’t commit right now.”\n</li></ul><p>You’re upholding boundaries without creating friction.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Saying No is Saying Yes (to Better Things)\n</h2><p>Every time you say no, you’re simultaneously saying yes—to focus, quality, precision, and meaningful work. Balancing commitments isn’t just healthier for you; it also strengthens your team dynamic and ensures your engineering output always shines.</p><p>The ironic truth? Learning to say no strategically makes you far more valuable—far more indispensable—than constant agreement ever could.</p><p>If you’re reading this and thinking, \"I  the Yes Person,\" don’t worry. We’ve all been there. The beauty of this lesson is that it’s never too late to start sprinkling in some thoughtful no’s. The difference will amaze you.</p><p>Whether you’re an engineer, a tech lead, or a project manager, mastering the art of saying no is one of the most powerful skills you can develop. Start small—be strategic—and watch how prioritizing quality over chaos transforms your career.</p><p>Remember, saying no isn’t about shutting doors; it’s about opening the right ones. Your best work—your truly impactful work—awaits on the other side.</p>","contentLength":6350,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Performance Optimization Techniques in React and Next.js","url":"https://dev.to/seyedahmaddv/performance-optimization-techniques-in-react-and-nextjs-2lp1","date":1740173071,"author":"Seyed Ahmad","guid":8843,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Optimizing performance in React and Next.js applications is crucial for improving user experience, reducing load times, and enhancing SEO.

Saldaña","guid":8840,"unread":true,"content":"<p>It has been quite a while since our last update, but I want you to know that Goliat is still alive and constantly evolving. I have been working tirelessly to develop a first version that reflects the quality and effort this project deserves, and today I’m pleased to share some important changes with you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The origin and evolution of the project\n</h2><p>Originally, Goliat was conceived as a solution designed to integrate with various APIs such as GitHub, Azure, AWS, and Terraform Cloud. The idea was to leverage the strengths of each platform to offer a robust tool. However, as many of you know, Terraform Cloud turns out to be a very expensive solution—especially when working with numerous workspaces. This led me to explore alternatives and develop a provider capable of replicating some of the functions offered by Terraform Cloud.</p><p>Unfortunately, this approach is too costly for one person to implement, especially in my case, as I do not have the technical skills of a programmer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A new direction: Goliat - Dashboard\n</h2><p>In light of these challenges, I have decided to completely pivot the project and rethink its focus. The new objective is to offer a centralized solution that, leveraging GitHub, will allow you to:</p><ul><li><p>: Identify and classify repositories, distinguishing between those dedicated to IaC and those for development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Issues and Workflows Management</strong>: Centralize issue information and manage workflows at a global, organizational, or repository level, making it easier to launch and control these processes.</p></li><li><p>: For IaC repositories, visualize the cost of infrastructure on providers like Azure or AWS, set budgets, and create probes to help control cost overruns.</p></li><li><p>: Incorporate a robust annotations system based on RBAC to enhance security and access control.</p></li></ul><p>The project will also integrate three distinct artificial intelligence models:</p><ul><li><p>: This model will obtain and analyze information directly from GitHub.</p></li><li><p>: Focused on extracting data from cloud providers, it will, for example, show the number of deployed services and detect potential issues in the health system.</p></li><li><p>: This model will provide a detailed cost analysis, displaying data on the overall account, daily service deployments, and more.</p></li></ul><p>I have made significant progress in developing the new dashboard approach. Soon, I hope to share an updated demo that reflects these changes and allows you to closely follow the new tasks and improvements that will be implemented. In addition, I will update the GitHub dashboard—the repository where you can track Goliat’s development—with the new tasks I will be working on, keeping you informed of all advances and changes in the project.</p><p>I deeply appreciate your support and patience. This project is as much yours as it is mine, and every comment and suggestion drives me to keep improving it.</p><p>Thank you very much for being here and for accompanying me on this journey!</p><p>Remember that you can continue with the project on the official website: <a href=\"https://goliat-dashboard.com/goliat-update-evolution-and-new-approach/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goliat-Dashboard</a></p>","contentLength":2981,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Looking to Contribute to Open Source, Preferably New Ideas","url":"https://dev.to/mihastele/looking-to-contribute-to-open-source-preferably-new-ideas-b6","date":1740170288,"author":"Miha","guid":8820,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello Everyone, I have been in the IT industry for almost 7 years.

Almost everything relies on it. Distributed architectures consist of multiple microservices with multiple running instances each. The workloads run long running tasks on virtual or physical servers, containers, or Kubernetes clusters, while simpler tasks are run as serverless functions.</p><p>gRPC caters to the scenarios where there is a need for distributed workloads to be tightly coupled – those services which rely on communicating data, and where speed matters. The usual JSON based REST APIs don’t fall short, but if teams are seeking “even more” performance improvements in their distributed and tightly coupled architectures should consider using gRPC instead.</p><p>In this blog post, I will not go through the theoretical details of gRPC, and rather focus on the practical example to introduce it to you, especially when you are short on time. The gRPC documentation is a great resource for understanding this technology in detail, otherwise. Topics covered in this post are listed below.</p><ol><li>Introduce the server and client example</li><li>Define interfaces in .proto file</li><li>Generating gRPC code for Go</li><li>Making a gRPC call in client</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Server And Client Example\n</h2><p>Before we proceed to discuss gRPC, let us establish a baseline requirement using client server architecture. In a hypothetical scenario, let us assume that there are two services – a calculator server and client which consumes the calculator logic. The calculator server implements the logic to perform addition operation. A client application hosted on a different host calls the addition function to fetch the processed result.</p><p>To keep things simple, let us implement the client and server logic in the same repo as shown in the file structure below.</p><p>The server code below is currently a basic Go code that implements addition logic with hardcoded values. Whether you are starting from scratch, or already have a server implementation and now looking forward to implementing gRPC in existing code – this blog post would serve both purposes.</p><div><pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n  \"log\"\n  \"net\"\n)\n\n// Calculator server implementation\nfunc main() {\n  sum := Add(1, 2)\n  log.Printf(\"Sum: %d\", sum)\n}\nfunc Add(num1, num2 int) int {\n  return num1 + num2\n}&lt;/textarea&gt;\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"log\"\n  \"net\"\n)\n\n// Calculator server implementation\nfunc main() {\n  sum := Add(1, 2)\n  log.Printf(\"Sum: %d\", sum)\n}\nfunc Add(num1, num2 int) int {\n  return num1 + num2\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Let us assume the client code implements the client logic that depends on the functionality exposed by the calculator server, as shown below.</p><div><pre><code>package main\n\nfunc main() {\n  // Client application logic\n}&lt;/textarea&gt;\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n  // Client application logic\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Initialize the Go module by giving it a suitable name. This step will differ depending on how the client and server code is currently organized in your environment. For this example, we will create all components in the same Go module. I have used “” as the module name.</p><div><pre><code>go mod init ldtgrpc01  \ngo mod tidy\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Define interfaces in .proto file\n</h2><p>gRPC implements Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) to serialize and deserialize the data. Protobuf offers a language and platform neutral way to serialize structured data making it smaller and thus reducing latency. Using Protobuf files, we can define services and messages to be implemented for the sake of communication between server and client.</p><p>In this example, the calculator server implements the addition function, which is called by the client. To make it compatible with gRPC protocol, first define these specifications in a  file. Create a 3rd directory to manage the Protobuf files, and create a  file as shown below.</p><div><pre><code>syntax = \"proto3\";\n\npackage calc;\noption go_package = \"ldtgrpc01/proto\";\n\n// Define the service\nservice Calculator {\n    rpc Add(AddRequest) returns (AddResponse) {}\n}\n\n// Define the messages\nmessage AddRequest {\n    int32 num1 = 1;\n    int32 num2 = 2;\n}\n\nmessage AddResponse {\n    int32 result = 1;\n}&lt;/textarea&gt;\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\n\npackage calc;\noption go_package = \"ldtgrpc01/proto\";\n\n// Define the service\nservice Calculator {\n    rpc Add(AddRequest) returns (AddResponse) Array\n}\n\n// Define the messages\nmessage AddRequest {\n    int32 num1 = 1;\n    int32 num2 = 2;\n}\n\nmessage AddResponse {\n    int32 result = 1;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Explanation of the code below.</p><ol><li>After specifying the syntax version as “proto3” (<a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">details</a>), we define the package name. When we compile this file into native Go code, it will be created in the package name we specified here. Note that if you are specifying , then package calc; is not required as the package will be named as per . I have included it as best practice. </li><li>Then we define the Calculator service, and specify an  method, which takes  message as parameter, and returns  message. Note that this method is defined as .</li><li>Further, we define both  and  messages with appropriate parameters.</li></ol><p>You can think of this as language-neutral interface specification, which only defines the interface, and doesn’t implement the same. The implementation will follow later in the server code.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Generating gRPC code in Go\n</h2><p>Using the  file, you can generate native application code in multiple languages. Since we are dealing with Go, we will use the command below to generate Go code which we would use in client-server communication.</p><div><pre><code>protoc –go\\_out=. –go\\_opt=paths=source\\_relative –go-grpc\\_out=. –go-grpc\\_opt=paths=source\\_relative proto/calc.proto\n</code></pre></div><p>Protoc is a Protobuf compiler used to compile .proto files into native code. Refer to <a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/gotutorial/#compiling-protocol-buffers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this document</a> for more information on the parameters used in the above command. The compilation results in creation of 2 Golang code files within the proto directory, as represented below.</p><p>And after this operation, the resulting directory structure and files there should look like below.</p><p>The  and  files are automatically generated files from your Protocol Buffer file (calc.proto).

Note that, you should never modify these files. If you want to do the changes to the interface, modify and recompile the calc.proto file.</p><p>Tip: Feel free to go through this code to understand more details about how Go implements gRPC protocol.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Server implementation using gRPC\n</h2><p>To update the calculator server code to implement the interfaces generated using gRPC, you need to import it as a package in the application code. The diagram below shows how the compiled proto package is used by server code to expose its functionality.</p><p>Now that we have the native code in place which defines the gRPC interface, we need to implement the server logic. Below is the updated code for the calculator server which exposes the  function using gRPC. The explanation follows.</p><div><pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n  \"context\"\n  pb \"ldtgrpc01/proto\" // replace with your module name\n  \"log\"\n  \"net\"\n\n  \"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n)\n\ntype server struct {\n  pb.UnimplementedCalculatorServer\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  lis, err := net.Listen(\"tcp\", \":50051\")\n  if err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"failed to listen: %v\", err)\n  }\n\n  s := grpc.NewServer()\n  pb.RegisterCalculatorServer(s, &amp;amp;server{})\n  log.Printf(\"Server listening at %v\", lis.Addr())\n\n  if err := s.Serve(lis); err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"failed to serve: %v\", err)\n  }\n}\n\n// // Add method implementation\nfunc (s *server) Add(ctx context.Context, req *pb.AddRequest) (*pb.AddResponse, error) {\n  result := req.Num1 + req.Num2\n  return &amp;amp;pb.AddResponse{Result: result}, nil\n}&lt;/textarea&gt;\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"context\"\n  pb \"ldtgrpc01/proto\" // replace with your module name\n  \"log\"\n  \"net\"\n\n  \"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n)\n\ntype server struct {\n  pb.UnimplementedCalculatorServer\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  lis, err := net.Listen(\"tcp\", \":50051\")\n  if err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"failed to listen: %v\", err)\n  }\n\n  s := grpc.NewServer()\n  pb.RegisterCalculatorServer(s, &amp;serverArray)\n  log.Printf(\"Server listening at %v\", lis.Addr())\n\n  if err := s.Serve(lis); err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"failed to serve: %v\", err)\n  }\n}\n\n// // Add method implementation\nfunc (s *server) Add(ctx context.Context, req *pb.AddRequest) (*pb.AddResponse, error) {\n  result := req.Num1 + req.Num2\n  return &amp;pb.AddResponse{Result: result}, nil\n}\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>To make use of the protobuf interface code we built in the previous step, first, import it in the server code.</li><li>Define a server struct type by simply calling the <code>UnimplementedCalculatorServer</code> method. I will not cover what is meant by this method name generated by protoc in this blog post. For now, just know that it is this easy to implement the interface in a Go code for a gRPC server.</li><li>Update and add the  method to the server. Note that we are using  as input params, which is implemented by the protobuf Go code. Accordingly, we are using the  and  to calculate the sum, as per our definition in the  file.</li><li>Finally, in the main function, we create a new instance of gRPC server using Google’s  package, and register the interface using  function (from proto package) to the same. This exposes the calculator functions like  to be used by clients.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Making a gRPC call in Client\n</h2><p>Similar to how we used gRPC package to implement the server side, we import the proto package in Client code, and use it as shown below.</p><p>Assuming the clients are able to access the calculator server – current example runs on localhost – we use the same grpc library from Google, and  into the server to establish a connection. Using this connection, we create a client instance that represents all the methods exposed by the server to the client as seen in the code below.</p><div><pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n  \"context\"\n  \"log\"\n  \"time\"\n\n  pb \"ldtgrpc01/proto\" // replace with your module name\n\n  \"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n  \"google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  conn, err := grpc.Dial(\"localhost:50051\", grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()))\n  if err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"did not connect: %v\", err)\n  }\n  defer conn.Close()\n\n  c := pb.NewCalculatorClient(conn)\n\n  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)\n  defer cancel()\n\n  // Make the gRPC call\n  r, err := c.Add(ctx, &amp;amp;pb.AddRequest{Num1: 5, Num2: 3})\n  if err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"could not calculate: %v\", err)\n  }\n  log.Printf(\"Result: %d\", r.GetResult())\n}&lt;/textarea&gt;\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"context\"\n  \"log\"\n  \"time\"\n\n  pb \"ldtgrpc01/proto\" // replace with your module name\n\n  \"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n  \"google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  conn, err := grpc.Dial(\"localhost:50051\", grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()))\n  if err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"did not connect: %v\", err)\n  }\n  defer conn.Close()\n\n  c := pb.NewCalculatorClient(conn)\n\n  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)\n  defer cancel()\n\n  // Make the gRPC call\n  r, err := c.Add(ctx, &amp;pb.AddRequest{Num1: 5, Num2: 3})\n  if err != nil {\n      log.Fatalf(\"could not calculate: %v\", err)\n  }\n  log.Printf(\"Result: %d\", r.GetResult())\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Once the client (‘c’ above) is created using , it can be thought of as a local object instance of the calculator server and its methods (functions) are called as we would normally do. In the code above, observe the line where  function is being called. In this gRPC version, passing the number parameters is a bit different. Here we use the  Protobuf message (check the calc.proto file), to pass the same.</p><p>Once the Add() is called on the client code, this happens:</p><ul><li>The client serializes the Protocol Buffer message</li><li>The message is sent over the network to the server</li><li>The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) includes metadata and the context</li><li>Server executes the “addition” logic and generates the return value/response</li><li>Server creates the response message</li><li>Sent back over the network to the client</li><li>Client deserializes the response, continues it processing</li></ul><p>To test this code, first run the calculator server code so that it listens on the port 50051, and then run the client code. The client simply calls the Add() function with hardcoded values 5 and 3. The calculator server processes this gRPC request and responds with the addition, as seen in the image below.</p>","contentLength":12921,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"10 Open-Source Documentation Frameworks to Check Out","url":"https://dev.to/silviaodwyer/10-open-source-documentation-frameworks-to-check-out-331f","date":1740168596,"author":"Silvia O'Dwyer","guid":8816,"unread":true,"content":"<p>So you want to build a documentation site for your project?

Since then, I have been using both Arc and Zen side by side and have discovered some points that I initially overlooked. This time, I’d like to write a brief follow-up to supplement my previous article.</p><p>As before, this is not a general comparison between the two browsers. Instead, I’ll focus on how well they suit my personal environment and which one is better depending on the situation. While this may not be useful for everyone, I hope some of you find it helpful.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjxtxeyg1ct5f4wws9cq3.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjxtxeyg1ct5f4wws9cq3.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"568\"></a>\n*screenshot from official website</p><p>In my previous article, I shared my initial impressions of Zen after using it briefly. However, after a few weeks of using both Arc and Zen more extensively, I have noticed several things that stood out.</p><p>To summarize, there are some minor issues that I hope will be improved in future updates (or that I can find workarounds for myself). However, <strong>Arc’s overheating problem</strong> does not occur in Zen, even with similar usage (at least as of now). Considering this, I currently feel that Zen is the better choice overall.</p><p>Below are the points I have noticed since writing my previous article.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. No Folder System for Organizing Essentials (UI)\n</h2><p>In Arc, the sidebar’s  (Zen’s equivalent of ) can be organized into folders, allowing for a more structured layout. However, Zen lacks this feature, making the list longer and harder to navigate when there are many items. I hope this will be improved in future updates.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Mac's Text Replacement Doesn't Work\n</h2><p>I’m not sure if this issue stems from my environment or from Zen itself, but Mac’s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/replace-text-punctuation-documents-mac-mh35735/mac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Text Replacement feature</a> does not work in Zen, with my macOS . It functions properly in Arc and other apps, yet for some reason, it fails in Zen.</p><p>At first, I thought this might be a Firefox-related issue, so I tested it in the latest version of the official Firefox browser, but it worked fine there. Since Zen is based on Firefox, it’s quite puzzling that this feature doesn’t work. I searched online and found that some users have reported similar issues in forums, but I have yet to find a solution.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Closing All Tabs Opens the Last Essential Page\n</h2><p>This is a very minor issue, but in Arc, when you close all tabs, the search bar appears in the center of the screen (similar to pressing ). However, in Zen, when all tabs are closed, <em>the last page in the Essentials list automatically opens instead</em>.</p><p>To work around this, you can either place Zen’s start page at the bottom of the Essentials list or always keep it open as a tab, similar to Arc. However, this feels somewhat clunky. Ideally, Zen should implement a more elegant built-in solution.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Lacking Some of Arc's Convenient Features\n</h2><p>Zen is a simple and minimalist browser, but compared to Arc, it lacks several convenient features. Some of the missing functionalities include:</p><ul><li>Automatic tab closure after 12 hours of inactivity (This feature is a love it or hate it feature, but for me it is my favorite!)</li><li>UI button in the lower-left corner that provides quick access to recent media files like screenshots and images (). In Arc, this UI button allows you to drag and drop media files directly from the browser, which is incredibly innovative.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fh2msslw6459kro50fkdg.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fh2msslw6459kro50fkdg.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"768\"></a>\n*screenshot from official website</p><p>With all these points, I may have painted a somewhat negative picture of Zen. However, it has a key advantage that outweighs these shortcomings—Arc's overheating issue is nonexistent (at least so far).</p><p>Arc’s UI is undoubtedly well-designed, but Zen offers a simple, no-frills, and minimalist experience that can be appealing in its own right. Additionally, since Zen is a relatively new browser, there is a good chance that these issues will be improved through future updates.</p><p>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that my experience with Zen is still limited, so there may be features I haven’t fully explored yet. For example, Zen has a customization feature called \"\", but I haven’t had the chance to experiment with it in depth. It’s possible that by making better use of features I’m not yet familiar with, some of the issues I mentioned earlier could be resolved. In any case, I believe Zen has great potential.</p><p>Some time has passed since my previous article, but to be honest, I haven't fully explored Zen yet. This article is based purely on my impressions at this stage. I plan to continue using Zen and observing how it develops over time.</p><p>If you notice any errors in my analysis or have any advice (such as solutions to the issues I mentioned), I would greatly appreciate your insights!</p>","contentLength":4585,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Reels UI in React Native 🎥 | Smooth Scrolling, Auto-Playing Videos & More!","url":"https://dev.to/amitkumar13/building-a-reels-ui-in-react-native-smooth-scrolling-auto-playing-videos-more-3i72","date":1740167636,"author":"Amit Kumar","guid":8800,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Reels-style short videos have taken social media by storm!

This post will explore Monorepo and Multirepo approaches, helping you choose the best strategy for your project.</p><p>\nA  (short for \"monolithic repository\") is a single repository that contains all the code for multiple applications or services, including frontend, backend, and even shared libraries. With this approach, everything lives in one place, but it’s broken down into smaller packages or modules within the same repo.\nCharacteristics of a Monorepo:</p><ul><li>A single repository contains all code for multiple projects.</li><li>Different applications or services share common libraries.</li><li>One version control system (e.g., Git) manages the entire codebase.</li></ul><p>\nIn contrast, a multirepo (or multi-repository) setup means that each service, application, or module is contained in its own independent repository. In a microservices environment, this could mean each microservice lives in a separate Git repository, with its own lifecycle and versioning.<p>\nCharacteristics of a Multirepo:</p></p><ul><li>Each service or application has its own independent repository.</li><li>Teams can develop and version-control their components separately.</li><li>Code sharing between services requires careful management (e.g., via package registries).</li></ul><p><strong>Monorepo vs. Multirepo: Pros and Cons</strong>\nNow that you understand the basic concepts, let’s dive into the pros and cons of each approach:</p><ul><li>Simplified Code Sharing\nMonorepos make it easy to share code between services, libraries, or components. If multiple services use a shared utility library, you can easily maintain and update it without complicated dependencies.</li><li>Consistent Tooling\nSince all your projects are in the same repository, you can enforce consistent tooling (e.g., linting, testing, formatting) across the entire codebase.</li><li>Atomic Changes\nA single commit can make changes across multiple services or components. This ensures consistency and makes refactoring easier.</li><li>Improved Collaboration\nDevelopers can easily contribute across the entire codebase. You don’t need to worry about accessing or managing multiple repositories, which can streamline workflows.</li></ul><ul><li>Scalability Issues\nAs the project grows, managing a large monorepo can become challenging. Builds can take longer, and version control operations (e.g., cloning, branching) may slow down significantly.</li><li>Risk of Code Bloat\nWith everything in one place, the repo can become bloated with code, including features and services that may not be relevant to all team members.</li><li>Access Control\nManaging permissions within a monorepo can be tricky, especially in larger organizations. Everyone who accesses the repo has access to everything unless fine-grained access controls are in place.</li></ul><ul><li>Independent Lifecycles\nEach service or application in a multirepo has its own repository, versioning, and release cycle. This allows teams to work independently and reduces the risk of unintended changes affecting other services.</li><li>Smaller, Focused Repositories\nEach repo is smaller and focused on a single service or application. This makes it easier to manage, especially as your project grows.</li><li>Granular Access Control\nYou can manage access on a per-repo basis, giving teams access only to the code they need. This is particularly useful in large organizations with many developers.</li></ul><ul><li>Difficult Code Sharing\nSharing code between services in a multirepo setup can be challenging. You need to manage dependencies manually and ensure that changes to shared libraries are synchronized across multiple repositories.</li><li>Complex Tooling\nEach repository may require its own setup, including linting, testing, and build pipelines. This can introduce inconsistencies and make it harder to maintain a unified codebase.</li><li>Cross-Repo Changes\nMaking atomic changes across multiple repositories is much harder in a multirepo setup. You need to coordinate updates and ensure that changes are applied consistently across all relevant services.</li></ul><p><strong>Which One Should You Choose?</strong>\nThe decision between monorepo and multirepo depends on the size of your project, your team's structure, and your deployment needs. Here are some guiding factors:</p><ul><li>Small to Medium-Sized Teams: If your team is small and the project isn’t too large, a monorepo can simplify collaboration and reduce the overhead of managing multiple repositories.</li><li>Tight Integration: If your services or components are tightly coupled and need to share a lot of code, a monorepo ensures that changes are propagated consistently.</li><li>Unified Development Process: When you need a unified development environment with consistent tooling and atomic changes, a monorepo is the way to go.</li></ul><p><strong>When to Choose Multirepo:</strong></p><ul><li>Large Organizations: For larger teams and organizations, a multirepo approach allows for independent development cycles and easier access control management.</li><li>Microservices and Modular Frontends: If your application is built using microservices or microfrontends, and each component can operate independently, a multirepo setup allows for more flexibility.</li><li>Separate Lifecycles: If different parts of your application are evolving at different paces, a multirepo setup lets teams manage their code without affecting others.</li></ul><p>\nYou don’t have to be strictly monorepo or multirepo. Many organizations adopt a hybrid approach, where a core set of related services or libraries are managed in a monorepo, while other services with less coupling are developed in separate repositories.</p><ul><li>Monorepo for Core Libraries: Shared utilities and libraries can live in a monorepo for easy access.</li><li>Multirepo for Microservices: Each microservice can have its own repository, but they all rely on the shared core libraries from the monorepo.</li></ul><p>This hybrid model provides the best of both worlds—ease of code sharing, along with independent development cycles.</p><p>\nChoosing between monorepo and multirepo isn’t a one-size-fits-all decision. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and the right choice depends on your project’s complexity, your team’s size, and the level of autonomy you need. For smaller teams and projects that require tight integration, a monorepo might be the right choice. For larger, decentralized teams working on independent services, a multirepo setup offers greater flexibility.</p><p>\nIn the next post, we’ll look into API Versioning—when and how to version your APIs to ensure backward compatibility while continuing to evolve your application.</p>","contentLength":6653,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Microservices and Microfrontends: Modularizing the Backend and Frontend","url":"https://dev.to/dayal/microservices-and-microfrontends-modularizing-the-backend-and-frontend-131b","date":1740166923,"author":"Dayal","guid":8797,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In our previous post, we explored the differences between monolithic and microservice architectures, helping you determine the right choice for your project. Now, let's go a step further into the world of Microservices by integrating the concept of Microfrontends. This post will explore how breaking down both the backend and the frontend into independent, modular services can lead to better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.</p><p> (A Quick Recap)\nAs a quick reminder, microservices are small, autonomous services that handle specific business functionalities. Each microservice is responsible for its own data, logic, and lifecycle, and they communicate with one another via APIs.</p><ul><li>Microservices promote independent deployment.</li><li>They scale better as each service can be scaled separately.</li><li>Teams can develop services in isolation, using different technologies.</li></ul><p>\nWhile microservices break down backend logic, microfrontends apply the same principle to the frontend. The frontend is divided into smaller, self-contained components or sections, each managed by a different team or service. Here’s what that means:</p><ul><li>Autonomous UI components: Microfrontends are independently deployable frontend applications that can be assembled into a single UI.</li><li>Independent tech stacks: Each frontend team can choose the technologies that suit their part of the UI best (React.js, Vue.js, Angular, etc.).</li><li>Faster feature releases: Since each component is loosely coupled, updates or new features can be deployed without affecting the entire frontend.</li></ul><p><strong>Why Microservices and Microfrontends?</strong>\nMany companies that embrace microservices architecture also shift towards microfrontends to maintain parity between their frontend and backend architectures. Here’s why combining them is powerful:</p><ul><li>Separation of Concerns\nBy modularizing both the backend and frontend, you can focus on separating concerns more efficiently. Each service owns its piece of the puzzle—backend logic, frontend presentation, and even data.</li><li>Independent Scaling\nAs with backend microservices, individual frontend components can scale independently, allowing for more efficient use of resources. For example, if your product page is receiving heavy traffic, you can scale just that component, without overloading the entire application.</li><li>Parallel Development\nFront and backend teams can work simultaneously and independently, speeding up the development process. Frontend teams can consume APIs created by backend microservices and develop their features without being blocked.</li></ul><p>\nMicrofrontends break the traditional single-page application (SPA) into smaller, more manageable parts. Here’s how it works in practice:</p><ul><li>Decomposition by Business Domain\nEach frontend section represents a specific domain, like user profile, product catalog, or checkout. These microfrontends map directly to the respective microservices on the backend.</li><li>Routing and Composition\nEach microfrontend is rendered independently, but when combined, they form the complete user experience. For example, the main application could use a shell (or a host) to route requests to different microfrontends.</li><li>Technology Independence\nOne part of the frontend could be built in React.js while another could be in Vue.js. The flexibility allows each team to choose the best technology for their needs, though teams often settle on a common framework to reduce complexity.</li><li>Independent Deployment\nEach microfrontend can be deployed separately, allowing teams to update specific parts of the application without redeploying the entire frontend. This results in faster, more frequent updates.</li></ul><p><strong>Microservices and Microfrontends in Practice</strong>\nAmazon's e-commerce platform uses microservices and microfrontends to ensure each product page, shopping cart, and recommendation engine are separate services, which can be updated, scaled, and managed independently. This approach allows Amazon to handle massive amounts of traffic and transactions.</p><p>\nSpotify’s UI is built on microfrontends, allowing the music player, user profile, and recommendation sections to be developed and deployed independently. This approach enhances collaboration between teams and speeds up feature delivery.</p><p>\nIKEA embraced microservices and microfrontends to decentralize its architecture, enabling faster innovation and independent scaling of its global e-commerce platform.</p><p><strong>Challenges with Microservices and Microfrontends</strong>\nWhile this architecture offers many benefits, it’s not without challenges:\nManaging multiple independent services and frontend components can introduce more complexity into your system. Teams need to invest in orchestration, monitoring, and testing frameworks.</p><p>\nWith services and frontends communicating via APIs, performance may be impacted if not optimized properly. Network latencies and dependencies between services can affect user experience.</p><p>\nWith different teams working on different parts of the UI, maintaining a consistent design and user experience can be difficult. To overcome this, organizations often establish a shared design system.</p><p><strong>Best Practices for Implementing Microservices and Microfrontends</strong></p><ul><li>Start Small: Don’t aim to break your entire frontend and backend into microcomponents all at once. Start with a small part of the application and gradually expand.</li><li>Leverage a Design System: Use a common design system to ensure consistency across microfrontends, regardless of which team is building them.</li><li>Use Containers: Containerization tools like Docker allow you to package your microservices and microfrontends independently, making them easier to deploy and scale.</li><li>API Gateways: API gateways can help manage the communication between various microservices and microfrontends, offering a unified entry point for the frontend.</li></ul><p>\nMicroservices and microfrontends offer a modular, scalable way to structure modern applications, allowing for faster development cycles, independent deployments, and better team autonomy. However, they also introduce complexity and require careful orchestration.</p><p>\nIn the next post, we’ll look at Monorepo vs. Multirepo—how to manage your codebase effectively when working with a modular system of microservices and microfrontends.</p>","contentLength":6164,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Cost of Delay (CoD) and Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)","url":"https://dev.to/dylanomics/cost-of-delay-cod-and-weighted-shortest-job-first-wsjf-4fjo","date":1740166895,"author":"Dylan Lynch","guid":8796,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This project explores <strong>Cost of Delay (CoD) and Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)</strong> as decision-making frameworks to prioritize tasks in a .</p><ul><li><strong>Linear, Exponential, Deadline Based models</strong></li><li><strong>WSJF prioritization applied to credit union loan processing</strong></li><li><strong>Visualizations of decision-making impact</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Auto Loans should be processed first</strong> because they generate high revenue in less time.</li><li> since they generate a lot but take longer.</li><li> due to their lower revenue impact.</li></ul><p>Prioritization is crucial in <strong>finance, product development, and project management</strong>.<strong>maximize value while minimizing delays</strong>.</p>","contentLength":562,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Do’s and Dont’s of self learning web development","url":"https://dev.to/oyegoke/dos-and-donts-of-self-learning-web-development-1h14","date":1740166264,"author":"Opajobi Oyegoke","guid":8795,"unread":true,"content":"<li><p>Tutorial cycle- I started my journey as a self-taught developer watching YouTube tutorials and coding along.

This is because I was watching a tutorial made some 3 months ago in a field where stacks are getting updated on a daily basis.

One architectural approach stands out for its cost-effectiveness and scalability: . But what exactly is it, and why should you care? Let's dive in.</p><p>Imagine an apartment building where multiple families live under one roof. Each family has their private living space, but they all share common infrastructure like plumbing, electrical systems, and the building structure itself. <strong>Multitenant architecture in software works similarly.</strong></p><p>In a multitenant system, a single instance of a software application serves multiple groups of users (tenants). Each tenant enjoys their own isolated experience while sharing the underlying resources—making it fundamentally different from single-tenant models where each customer gets a dedicated instance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Evolution of Multitenancy\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Mainframe Era: The Early Days\n</h3><p>In computing's early days, expensive mainframes housed in centralized data centers were the norm. These powerful machines served multiple applications and users simultaneously, using techniques like:</p><ul><li>Virtual memory allocation</li></ul><p>These mechanisms ensured that while users shared hardware, their data and processes remained isolated.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Virtualization: The Next Step\n</h3><p>Hardware-assisted virtualization revolutionized multitenancy by allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine. Instead of users sharing a mainframe directly, they could operate within isolated virtual machines that shared the underlying hardware—significantly reducing infrastructure costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cloud Computing: Multitenancy at Scale\n</h3><p>Cloud computing took multitenancy to unprecedented heights.

When you sign up, you receive your own space within their platform where you can manage data and customize settings, while the core infrastructure remains shared with other customers.</p><p>A single web server can host multiple websites (tenants), each with its own files and configurations while sharing server resources. In this setup:</p><ul><li>The web server provides shared computational resources (CPU, memory, storage)</li><li>Each tenant maintains dedicated space for website files (HTML, CSS, images)</li><li>Virtual hosts map incoming requests to the correct tenant based on domain names</li><li>Resource management systems ensure fair allocation among tenants</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Designing Multitenant Systems: Key Considerations\n</h2><p>If you're building a multitenant application (like a cloud-based project management SaaS), focus on these critical areas:</p><p>Security breaches in multitenant environments can affect multiple customers, making data isolation paramount. Consider these approaches:</p><ul><li>Separate databases per tenant</li><li>Shared databases with schema separation</li><li>Row-level security policies</li><li>Application-level safeguards to prevent data leaks</li></ul><p>Efficient resource utilization is crucial for performance and cost management:</p><ul><li>Implement workload distribution strategies</li><li>Leverage caching mechanisms</li><li>Design for horizontal scalability</li><li>Monitor resource consumption patterns</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.

The unsung hero of the developer’s life. It’s like moving houses, but instead of furniture, you’re hauling bits and bytes from one database to another. And just like moving, it’s always more complicated than you think. In this article, I’ll walk you through how I wrote a script to migrate data from MongoDB to Convex (shoutout to convex.dev), and hopefully, you’ll learn something — or at least get a good laugh.</p><p><strong>The Setup: MongoDB and Convex Sitting in a Tree</strong>\nFirst, let’s set the stage. I had a MongoDB database with over 30 tables and over 2M documents that relate to one another. But MongoDB, while great for many things, wasn’t cutting it for our new app’s real-time needs. Enter Convex, a backend-as-a-service that promised to make my life easier with its real-time capabilities and serverless architecture. The only problem? Getting all that data from MongoDB into Convex.</p><p>So, I rolled up my sleeves, brewed a pot of coffee, and got to work.</p><p><strong>The Code: A Tale of Two Databases</strong>\nHere’s the script I wrote to migrate the data. It’s a bit of a beast, but I’ll break it down for you. (You can find the full code at the end of this article, but let’s walk through the highlights.)</p><p><strong>| Step 1: Connecting to MongoDB and Convex</strong>\nFirst things first: I needed to connect to both databases. MongoDB was easy — I just used the  from the  package. Convex, on the other hand, required a bit more setup, including an auth token.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Pro tip: If your auth token is invalid, Convex will throw an error faster than you can say “unauthorized.” So, make sure you’ve got the right token.</p></blockquote><p><strong>| Step 2: Filtering and Counting Documents</strong>\nNext, I needed to filter the team/organization/workspace object in MongoDB that I wanted to migrate. I created a filter only include documents from specific teams and to make sure that the object was not deleted.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I console logged This gave me a sense of how much data I was dealing with. Spoiler: It was a lot.</p><p><strong>| Step 3: The Migration Loop</strong>\nNow, the fun part: the migration loop. I processed the data in batches of 100 to avoid overwhelming the system (Convex only allows for a little over 16k). For each contact, I checked if it had already been merged (using a Set to track processed IDs) and skipped it if it had.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This loop is the heart of the script. It’s where the magic (and the headaches) happen.</p><p><strong>| Step 4: Formatting Data for Convex</strong>\nI had changed my schema in Convex, so I had to reformat the MongoDB data to fit. This included mapping phone numbers, emails, and addresses into my new structure.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I also had to handle edge cases, like contacts with no first or last name. (Yes, those exist. No, I don’t know why.)</p><p><strong>| Step 5: Creating Contacts and Tasks in Convex</strong>\nOnce the data was formatted, I used Convex mutations to create new records, tasks, tags, activities… and so on.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If a contact had associated tasks, tags or anything that was related to it, I created those too. This part of the script was like assembling IKEA furniture — tedious, but satisfying when it worked. (Also I never buy from IKEA anymore).</p><p><strong>| Step 6: Error Handling and Retries</strong>\nOf course, nothing ever goes perfectly. I added error handling and a retry mechanism to deal with hiccups like network issues or cursor timeouts.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>**The Aftermath: Lessons Learned\n**After hours of debugging, coffee, and the occasional existential crisis, the migration was complete. Here’s what I learned:</p><ol><li><strong>Batch processing is your friend.</strong> It keeps things manageable and prevents your script from crashing under its own weight.</li><li><strong>Error handling is non-negotiable.</strong> Things will go wrong, so plan for it.</li><li> When something breaks (and it will), you’ll want to know where and why.</li><li> Once the data was in, Convex made real-time updates a breeze.</li></ol><p>\nHere’s the full script for your reading pleasure. Feel free to adapt it for your own migrations — just don’t forget the coffee.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nData migration isn’t glamorous, but it’s a necessary evil. With the right tools and a bit of patience, you can move mountains of data without losing your sanity.

System Files are created by the OS itself for temporary Caching. Crash Reports include Log Errors, Debugging info, etc.</p><blockquote><p>If you use your PC heavily for <strong>Gaming, Browsing, Work-Related</strong> , then it is suggested to clean the temporary files on a weekly basis. Before doing a  , you can delete these temporary files to prevent update errors.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Do We Need to Delete Temp Files on Windows 11?\n</h2><p>In the above paragraph, we saw why these temporary files get accumulated on our Windows 11. Here, we will check out Why do we need to delete them and how they will improve the System Performance afterwards.</p><p>Temp files piles up overtime, and they may take  of storage. Also, if the temporary files are too much, then the system resources will be wasted on processing those files unnnecessarily. Older Temporary Files may cause a app to malfunction. Temp Files are sensitive files as they contain sensitive data like Passwords, Browser History, etc. Deleting Temporary Files on Windows 11 will also prevent failures or slowdowns during the Windows Updates.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Various Methods to Delete these Temporary Files on Windows 11\n</h2><p>There are some methods available on Windows 11 to delete these temp files.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended Way using the Windows Settings.</strong></li><li><strong>Use Disk Clean up and delete Temp Files.</strong></li><li><strong>Manually Deleting the  and  Folders using the Run Command.</strong></li><li><strong>Automatic Cleanup using the Storage Sense.</strong></li></ul><p>The above methods are hand-picked and are most effective to cleanup temp files on Windows 11.

Although we will not address all the concepts, the focus will be on applications built for  use. These concepts can be shared across every other system (embedded systems are similar), but we will focus mainly on the aspect pointed out earlier.</p><p>Before we go into much detail on the topic, let’s understand what System Security is about:</p><p><em>Also as a reminder, from my last post, I use system and application as the same thing.</em></p><p><strong>“System security ensures that information is accessed, transmitted, and maintained securely, reaching only authorized individuals, without being altered or disrupted.”</strong></p><p>Now that we know the definition, let’s start looking at the concepts that ensure this is true in our system. And I will speak about them in no particular other.</p><p>The next two concepts are fundamental to a secure system. However, people sometimes don’t know the key differences, and I will explain them using clear examples.</p><p> is the concept that verifies user identity and ensures that the information provided by the person trying to access our system (Username and Password) is correct.</p><p>Let’s use an event for example, most events are strictly by invitation, you get to the event venue, you see the security personnel at the gate and they ask you for your invitation card or mail, whatever was used. Let’s say the invitation has a QR code, it gets scanned, your name and other information pop up, you get registered and a tag is given to you.</p><p>This is what authentication is about, anyone who presents this information in our case “QR code”, we see if the information comes up, then we sign the person in (grant access) and provide a tag for the person.</p><p> is the concept that applies after you have been authenticated (granted access), it now determines your access level.</p><p>Using our event example, you have entered the event hall, where you will sit is determined by the tag you have. In a system, someone who has read-only access won’t be allowed to create in the system, so if your seat level is in the middle of the event hall, you won't be allowed to sit in front. This concept of  leads us to our next concept </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Role-Based Access Control\n</h2><p><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC)</strong> is a concept where people's roles determine what they access in your system. This means people have access to resources based on the role they have in your system. Using our event example again, someone who is part of the security or organisers has an access level that permits him/her to go to multiple places in the event center including backstage, in the  system, people can have one or more roles and those roles determines what they see, and action they perform in the system.</p><p>This concept is important when you are building a multiple-actor system. For example Hospital management system, what a doctor sees, will be different from what the patient is seeing.</p><p>The doctor sees information on all the patients under him, while the patient sees only their information and upcoming appointments. A receptionist could see only the scheduling and billing information but not medical records. Things like this keep information safe and can be achieved using .</p><p> concept ensures data security during transmission and storage by converting it into unreadable formats. If the system gets hacked or data leaks, important personal pieces of information like passwords or health-related data won’t be in plain readable text.</p><p>It’s interesting to know that this is not a computer-age concept, Julius Caesar was reported to use some level of encryption to send messages to his Generals, even when the enemy arrests the messenger, they can’t make sense of the message being transmitted.</p><p>His encrypted method is known as  which is simple to replace each letter of the alphabet with the letter occurring three positions later or 23 positions earlier in the alphabet: A becomes D, B becomes E, X becomes A, and so forth. You can read more about this. This method is not a safe option anymore.</p><p>We can achieve encryption today by leveraging many existing software or codes, like JWT, JASYPT Encryptor, and many others.</p><p>What this means is when you pass your message like “<strong><em>Hello, I am the author of this article.</em></strong>”, these encrypting tools convert it to something like this <strong>“gXe3mi8CAlXoVpwfCkr0hSLhYZ1FeizkRmAntcZQPA41FAKsGLDEPvk7/KleCv+T”</strong>. This way only the person with the secret key will be able to decrypt your message and make sense of it.

I’ve detailed the entire journey on Medium, but I wanted to give you all a quick rundown right here.</p><p>\nMy goal was to explore the capabilities of the Swin Transformer—a state-of-the-art vision transformer—by adapting it to the challenging domain of plant recognition. Using the PlantNet dataset, which features a wide variety of plant images under different conditions, I aimed to improve classification accuracy through meticulous fine-tuning.</p><p><strong>Why the Swin Transformer?</strong>\nThe Swin Transformer stands out due to its hierarchical architecture and the innovative shifted window approach. This design not only captures local features but also maintains a global context, making it ideal for handling the subtle nuances present in plant imagery.</p><p>\nThe dataset offered a rich and diverse collection of plant images. While this diversity is a boon for model training, it also introduces challenges like class imbalance and varying image quality. Addressing these issues required thoughtful data preprocessing and augmentation strategies.</p><p>\nI began by cleaning and augmenting the dataset to ensure robust training.

Arbitrum, a Layer 2 solution, emerges as a promising answer to these issues. Recently, Arbitrum's tokenomics, particularly the concept of token burning, has garnered attention. This blog post delves into <a href=\"https://www.license-token.com/#/wiki/arbitrum-and-token-burning\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arbitrum's approach to token burning</a> and its potential impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.</p><p>Arbitrum, developed by <a href=\"https://offchainlabs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Offchain Labs</a>, is designed to enhance Ethereum's scalability by offloading computational tasks from the main chain. It employs <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optimistic Rollups</a>, which assume transaction validity by default, to process transactions off-chain and batch them, reducing costs and increasing speed.\nThe introduction of the ARB token facilitates decentralized governance within the Arbitrum network. While ARB is not used for transactions, it plays a crucial role in governance and incentivization. Token burning, a strategy to create scarcity by removing tokens from circulation, is a topic of interest for Arbitrum's governance. Although not currently implemented, token burning could introduce deflationary pressure, enhance network health, and democratize economic decisions through community-driven governance.<p>\nHowever, token burning is not without controversy. Critics argue that artificial scarcity may not translate to real value without increased utility. Over-reliance on burning could lead to speculation and volatility, potentially harming long-term investors. Thus, Arbitrum must balance token burning with tangible network improvements.</p>\nIf Arbitrum integrates token burning, it could enhance governance by giving ARB holders more influence over token supply decisions. This proactive ecosystem management could positively impact market perception and foster innovation in DeFi applications.</p><p>Arbitrum's potential use of token burning as an economic tool could significantly impact its network sustainability and the broader Ethereum and DeFi landscape. While not yet implemented, the strategic consideration of token burning, coupled with community involvement, could redefine Arbitrum's economic health and sustainability strategy.\nFor more insights into Arbitrum and its role in the blockchain ecosystem, you can explore related topics like <a href=\"https://www.license-token.com/wiki/arbitrum-scaling-solution\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arbitrum's scalability solutions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.license-token.com/wiki/nf-ts-on-arbitrum-with-open-source-solutions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arbitrum's integration with NFTs</a>.

So let's break it down.</p><p>Every worker in Cloudflare is single-threaded.\nWhen a worker produces a message to a Queue and the same worker also implements a consumer to handle the message, Cloudflare handles concurrency and ensures each message gets processed by scaling up the workers automatically.<p>\nThis mechanism allows you to scale up different functions within a single worker, meaning the same worker that produces a message to a queue also implements a consumer that handles the same message.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example Let's move the code back into a single worker and implement\n</h2><p>newsletter functionality for all signed-up users. This functionality will retrieve all existing users from the database and send them newsletters using a  function. Instead of calling the function directly from the index.tsx file, we send a message for each database entry to the Queue.\nIn addition, we implement in the same worker a consumer that will handle the messages in batches from the Queue.</p><p>When a worker produces a message to a Queue and implements a consumer, Cloudflare will automatically scale up the worker when needed. This means our Worker can scale horizontally based on the Queue's workload.</p><p>It is also important to note that by using a consumer handler, the life cycle of the worker will be controlled by Cloudflare's Queue. There is a detailed <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-cloudflare-queues/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> about the internals of Queues and how they work.</p><p>Make sure to include the Queue bindings in your  file for both consumer and producer, and add the Binding to your  file.</p><p>Now let's add a endpoint to send a newsletter, get the database entries and produce a message for each entry to the Queue.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to implement a queue handler within the same worker to send out the emails.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can configure the batch size and other Queue parameters in the  file. For more details about Queue configuration, check out the <a href=\"https://dev.to/blog/2025-01-17-asynchronous-tasks-in-cloudflare-part2\">previous blog post</a> in this series.</p><p>It is also possible to have two different consumers in the same worker, each receiving message batches from different queues. Therefore, you might want to consider moving the logic for sending the registration email after signing up for the Marathon to a queue handler.\nThis approach can be useful if you expect a high load during the registration opening. For example, assume this worker handles signups for the New York Marathon. As a passionate runner, I know how busy the site gets during the first few hours after registration opens.</p><p>Instead of sending the email within the thread that starts when someone hits the  route, you can publish a message to a different queue.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now you can implement two consumers for your worker</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Make sure to include the  as a producer and consumer in your . \nThe image below shows the architecture of a Worker with two Queue consumers. </p><p>Cloudflare Queues provide a powerful way to scale different functions within a single worker. By producing messages to a Queue and implementing a consumer in the same worker, you can achieve horizontal scaling while maintaining your code in a monolithic codebase.\nSo while it might seem counterintuitive at first, combining Producer and Consumer code in one Worker is a legitimate pattern when using Cloudflare Queues, as the platform handles the separation of concerns at runtime through its instance creation mechanism.</p><p>However, there are still valid reasons to split your code into multiple workers:</p><ul><li>Independent deployability of services</li><li>Team organization, especially when different teams are responsible for different services</li></ul><p>The choice between a single worker with Queues or multiple workers depends on your specific needs and organizational structure.</p>","contentLength":4164,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Arbitrum and State Channels: Pioneering Blockchain Scalability","url":"https://dev.to/rachellovestowrite/arbitrum-and-state-channels-pioneering-blockchain-scalability-4d2i","date":1740152122,"author":"Rachel Duncan","guid":8666,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As blockchain technology continues to evolve, one of the most pressing challenges remains scalability.

Enter LLM-DaaS, a groundbreaking framework that harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to elevate Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) operations. This innovative approach translates natural language user requests into structured, actionable tasks, addressing a significant challenge within the realm of drone services.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Transforming Text into Actionable Tasks\n</h2><p>One of the main hurdles in drone service operations is accurately interpreting and structuring user requests made in everyday language. LLM-DaaS tackles this issue head-on. By fine-tuning models like Phi-3.5, LLaMA-3.2, and Gemma 2b on a specifically curated dataset that maps free-text user requests to structured DaaS commands, the system enables users to engage in a more human-like conversational exchange when discussing their drone service needs, particularly in scenarios like package delivery.</p><p>Users can articulate their requests freely, and the finely-tuned LLM efficiently extracts essential DaaS metadata, such as delivery timelines, the source and destination locations, and the weight of the packages. This level of sophistication allows for a seamless transition from a simple user inquiry to a comprehensive operational plan.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Smart Selection and Composition of Drone Services\n</h2><p>LLM-DaaS does not stop at translating requests; it also features a robust service selection model. This model identifies the best available drone for the job, ensuring the chosen vehicle is capable of transporting the package efficiently from the initial delivery point to the nearest optimal destination. When necessary, the DaaS composition model can craft a composite service utilizing multiple drones to transport packages directly from the source to the final destination. </p><p>This dynamic capability is especially crucial in emergency response scenarios or in highly populated urban areas where logistical challenges are prevalent. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Integrating Real-Time Data for Enhanced Operations\n</h2><p>Incorporating real-time weather data is a game-changer. By optimizing route planning and scheduling according to the latest environmental conditions, LLM-DaaS not only boosts operational efficiency but also enhances the safety of drone operations under uncertain circumstances. </p><p>Simulations conducted to test LLM-DaaS indicate a marked improvement in task accuracy and overall operational efficacy. These results suggest that the framework is not only viable but is set to establish itself as a crucial component of DaaS operations—especially in environments fraught with unpredictability.</p><p>As drone services continue to expand and evolve, frameworks like LLM-DaaS will play invaluable roles in harnessing the full potential of these technologies. By transforming simple, free-text user requests into complex, structured tasks, and ensuring optimal drone selection and deployment, LLM-DaaS exemplifies the intersection of artificial intelligence and operational logistics. </p><p>For those interested in delving deeper into this innovative framework, full details can be found in the original paper, available <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11672\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p><p>As we navigate through the future of drone operations, LLM-DaaS stands out as a clear beacon of technological advancement in automating services with efficiency and reliability.</p>","contentLength":3386,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"JavaScript Interview Questions for Beginners","url":"https://dev.to/jakaria/javascript-interview-questions-for-beginners-4258","date":1740150900,"author":"Jakaria Masum","guid":8662,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you're new to JavaScript, don't worry! This guide will break down some common JavaScript concepts into simple terms with easy-to-understand examples. Let’s dive in!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>What is a Higher-Order Function &amp; Callback Function?</strong></h2><p>A higher-order function is like a \"boss\" function that can either:</p><ul><li>Take another function as an input (like hiring a worker), or</li><li>Return a function as output (like creating a new worker).</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here,  is the boss, and  is the worker (callback).</p><p>A callback function is just a regular function that gets passed into another function and is called later.</p><p>\nCallbacks are useful when you want to do something after a task finishes, like waiting for a user to click a button or fetching data from the internet.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. <strong>What is Hoisting in JavaScript?</strong></h2><p>Hoisting means that JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before running the code. It’s like writing your homework title at the top of the page before filling in the answers.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> and  don’t get hoisted in the same way as . If you try to use them before declaring, you’ll get an error.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. <strong>What is Scope in JavaScript?</strong></h2><p>Scope is like a \"boundary\" that decides where variables live. Think of it like rooms in a house:</p><ul><li>Variables declared inside a room (function) can only be used there.</li><li>Variables declared outside all rooms (globally) can be used anywhere.</li></ul><ol><li> Variables declared outside any function.</li><li> Variables declared inside a function.</li><li> Variables declared with  or  inside .</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. <strong>What is the Difference Between , , and ?</strong></h2><p>These methods help control the value of  in a function. Imagine  as a person who needs to know where they belong.</p><ul><li> Calls the function immediately and lets you pass arguments one by one.</li><li> Calls the function immediately but lets you pass arguments as an array.</li><li> Creates a new function with  set to a specific value, but doesn’t call it right away.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. <strong>What is the Difference Between  and  Operators?</strong></h2><ul><li> (Equality): Compares values but allows JavaScript to change types if needed (type coercion).</li><li> (Strict Equality): Compares both value and type without changing anything.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> Always use  unless you have a good reason to use .</p><p>A cookie is like a sticky note that websites leave on your browser to remember things about you, like your login details or preferences.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Cookies are small and limited in size, so they’re best for simple tasks.</p><p>A promise is like a box that may contain a gift (success) or a note saying it’s out of stock (failure). Promises are used for asynchronous tasks, like fetching data from a server.</p><ol><li> Waiting for the result.</li><li> Got the result successfully.</li><li> Something went wrong.</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The event loop is like a waiter in a restaurant. It keeps checking if the kitchen (call stack) is free to take new orders (tasks).

If you ask an object for something it doesn’t have, JavaScript looks up its prototype chain to find it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here,  is not directly on , but JavaScript finds it through the prototype chain.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  10. <strong>How Can You Eliminate Duplicate Values from a JavaScript Array?</strong></h2><p>Removing duplicates is like cleaning up a messy room by keeping only one of each item.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By understanding these concepts step-by-step, you'll build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

However, effective testing is essential for building reliable, maintainable, and bug-free software. In this post, we’ll explore key principles for writing meaningful, maintainable, and trustworthy tests.</p><ol><li><p>Unit Test :\nUnit testing focuses on testing individual functions or components.

Scraping small datasets is one thing, but managing large-scale projects necessitates extra tactics. Here's how you can efficiently scale your Java-based scraping solutions:</p><ul><li>Parallel Processing &amp; Multithreading – Java's multithreading capabilities enable you to run numerous scraping tasks simultaneously, considerably lowering execution time.</li><li>Distributed Scraping – Instead of relying on a single machine, use cloud-based services such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, or Google Cloud to divide tasks across numerous servers.</li><li>Using a Scraping Framework – Instead of starting from scratch, frameworks such as Scrapy (Python-based but Java-compatible) or WebMagic can help streamline the process.</li><li>Optimizing Request Handling – Implement request queuing and crawl key pages first.</li><li>Automating Proxy Rotation – Services like Bright Data and ScraperAPI help in rotating IPs to prevent bans.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How to Handle JavaScript-Heavy Websites\n</h3><p>Many modern websites rely on JavaScript to load content dynamically, making traditional HTML parsing ineffective. Here’s how to tackle them:</p><ul><li>Use Selenium with Headless Browsers – Selenium WebDriver can simulate a real browser and execute JavaScript to render the complete page.</li><li>Leverage Puppeteer with Java – Though Puppeteer is a Node.js library, you can integrate it with Java using third-party solutions to scrape JavaScript-heavy sites.</li><li>API-Based Data Extraction – Some websites provide API endpoints that return structured data, which is often more efficient than scraping HTML.</li><li>Wait for Elements to Load – Use Selenium’s WebDriverWait to ensure content is fully loaded before extraction.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  When to Use APIs Instead of Web Scraping\n</h3><p>While web scraping is a powerful method for data extraction, using an API (if available) is often a more efficient alternative. Here’s when you should opt for an API instead:</p><ul><li>Data Availability – If the website offers a public API, using it ensures structured and reliable data retrieval.</li><li>Legal &amp; Ethical Compliance – Scraping might violate a site’s terms of service, whereas API usage is typically sanctioned.</li><li>Faster &amp; More Reliable – APIs return data in a structured format (JSON or XML), making parsing and processing easier.</li><li>Reduced Risk of Blocking – Since API calls are meant to be used programmatically, they are less likely to be blocked compared to web scraping bots.</li></ul><p>However, not all websites offer APIs, and some restrict access with rate limits. In such cases, web scraping remains the best alternative.</p><p>Web scraping in Java is still a valuable tool for developers and businesses trying to successfully use web data.

Let’s break down this issue and how to prevent it!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Catastrophic Backtracking?\n</h2><p> is a mechanism that most regex engines use to find matches. Basically, when a regex fails to match a pattern, the engine backtracks a few steps and tries another approach.</p><p>The problem arises when the regex is structured in a way that creates <strong>too many possible matching combinations</strong> before finally failing. This causes the regex engine to go through an  number of attempts before giving up, potentially freezing your application.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How does the problem occur in practice?\n</h2><p>Let's understand this issue with a practical example. Imagine you want to validate a string that contains only the letter \"a\" followed by the letter \"b,\" and you write the following expression:</p><p>Now, let's test it with a string that should fail:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The first test works correctly, but the second one can cause the regex engine to freeze. This happens because the pattern  allows multiple ways to group the \"a\" characters, and the engine attempts all these combinations before realizing the string doesn’t contain a \"b\" at the end.</p><p>Let’s visualize what the engine is doing:</p><ol><li>It starts by trying to group all the \"a\" characters inside the first (a+).</li><li>Since there’s another (a+) wrapping this group, it attempts to redistribute the \"a\" characters in multiple ways.</li><li>When it reaches the end of the string and doesn't find \"b,\" it backtracks and tries different ways to group the \"a\" characters.</li><li>Since there are so many ways to distribute the \"a\" characters, the number of attempts grows exponentially, causing the engine to freeze.</li></ol><p>This behavior is called <strong>Catastrophic Backtracking</strong> because the execution time grows unpredictably depending on the input size.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Avoid Catastrophic Backtracking?\n</h2><p>Now that you understand the problem, let’s go over some solutions to prevent it:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. </h3><p>If you don’t need to capture something, . In the previous example,  can be simplified to:</p><p>Whenever possible, use  and  to mark the start and end of the string, preventing unnecessary backtracking attempts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. **Use Lazy Quantifiers (*?, +?, ??)\n</h3><p>If you need to use repetitive quantifiers, try using the  version to reduce the number of attempts. For example:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. </h3><p>If you're dealing with repetitive groups, you can tell the engine <strong>not to backtrack inside the group</strong> using .</p><p>If you've ever had regex slow down or crash your application, now you know that <strong>Catastrophic Backtracking</strong> might be the culprit. Avoiding this problem is just a matter of applying best practices.</p>","contentLength":2977,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Staying Updated in Tech: A Developer's Guide to Continuous Learning","url":"https://dev.to/dreams_chaser/staying-updated-in-tech-a-developers-guide-to-continuous-learning-4eh0","date":1740140791,"author":"Dreams Chaser","guid":8586,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey there, fellow developer! 👋 In our fast-paced tech world, keeping up with the latest trends and technologies can feel like chasing a moving target.

Using priority hints allows them to load earlier at a higher priority.</li><li><strong>Scripts marked with  or :</strong> These scripts are assigned a \"low\" priority.

It’s not just about writing code anymore—it's about making sure developers have the tools, culture, and support they need to do their best work. Whether you're a manager, a team leader, or a developer yourself, improving DX can lead to better productivity and happier teams. This article breaks down key strategies to make the developer journey smoother and more effective.</p><ul><li>  Building a developer-friendly culture starts with empathy and breaking down barriers between teams.</li><li>  Onboarding can be made easier with self-service tools and a focus on reducing complexity.</li><li>  Balancing flexibility and standardization in development environments is key to success.</li><li>  Treating developers like customers can improve internal tools and processes.</li><li>  Automation and continuous learning are essential for boosting productivity and keeping skills sharp.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building a Developer-Centric Culture\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Empathy Matters in Dev Experience\n</h3><p>Developers don’t just write code; they solve problems. To do this well, they need a workplace that understands their challenges. <strong>Empathy is the foundation</strong> of a strong developer experience. It helps you see the pain points your team faces every day.</p><p>Here’s how you can practice empathy:</p><ul><li>  Sit with developers during their daily tasks. Watch how they work.</li><li>  Ask open-ended questions about what slows them down.</li><li>  Act on their feedback instead of just listening.</li></ul><p>Empathy isn’t about being nice. It’s about removing barriers so developers can focus on building great software.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Down Silos Between Teams\n</h3><p>Silos kill collaboration. When teams don’t talk, developers end up working in isolation. This slows down projects and creates frustration. Breaking down silos means creating open lines of communication.</p><p>Here are a few ways to start:</p><ol><li> Hold cross-team meetings to share updates.</li><li> Use tools that make collaboration easier, like shared dashboards.</li><li> Encourage developers to shadow other teams for a day.</li></ol><p>When teams work together, developers can make better decisions faster. This improves not just their experience but the quality of the product too.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Encouraging Continuous Feedback Loops\n</h3><p>Feedback is a two-way street. Developers need to know how they’re doing, but they also need to feel heard. Create a system where feedback flows freely and frequently.</p><ul><li>  Weekly check-ins to discuss roadblocks and wins.</li><li>  Anonymous surveys to gather honest opinions.</li><li>  Quick retrospectives after every sprint.</li></ul><p><em>The goal isn’t just to collect feedback—it’s to act on it.</em> When developers see their input making a difference, they stay engaged and motivated.</p><blockquote><p>A developer-centric culture doesn’t happen by accident. It’s built one conversation, one action, and one improvement at a time.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Streamlining Onboarding for New Developers\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Crafting a Seamless First-Day Experience\n</h3><p>Your first day at a new job can be overwhelming. As a team, you should focus on making it smooth and clear.  that covers everything from setting up accounts to understanding team communication tools. Keep instructions simple and avoid information overload. A buddy system can also help—pairing new developers with experienced teammates makes things less intimidating.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Providing Self-Service Tools for Faster Setup\n</h3><p>Developers value independence. Offering self-service tools can speed up their setup process. Think automated scripts for environment configuration or a centralized portal for accessing resources. This reduces downtime and allows them to focus on coding sooner. <em>Time saved here is time spent building.</em></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Reducing Friction in Learning New Systems\n</h3><p>Every company has its quirks. Document these clearly. Create short guides or videos explaining the systems your team uses. Avoid jargon and get straight to the point. Regularly update these materials to reflect changes. When new developers feel confident navigating systems, they become productive faster.</p><blockquote><p>A well-thought-out onboarding process isn't just nice to have—it's how you set the tone for success. Invest in it, and you'll see the benefits ripple through your team.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Optimizing Development Environments\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Role of Cloud Development Environments\n</h3><p>Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) are reshaping how developers work. They provide scalability and allow teams to collaborate better. But here's the catch—<strong>only 7% of organizations can set up a CDE in under an hour</strong>. That's a missed opportunity for boosting productivity. If your team struggles with setup times, it's time to rethink your approach. Focus on tools that simplify provisioning and reduce friction.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Balancing Flexibility and Standardization\n</h3><p>It's tricky to balance developer freedom with the need for standardization. Standardized environments improve security and speed up setup. But too much control can stifle creativity.  matters, and CDEs can offer a middle ground. They let developers experiment without compromising security or efficiency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Addressing the Developer-Admin Disconnect\n</h3><p>There's often a gap between administrators and developers. Admins focus on governance and control, while developers want ease of use. This disconnect can lead to frustration. Regular feedback loops can help bridge the gap. Start by benchmarking satisfaction levels and identifying pain points. Small changes, like improving tool access, can make a big difference.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Adopting Product Thinking for Developer Tools\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Treating Developers as Customers\n</h3><p>Think of your developers as customers. They have needs, frustrations, and goals. Start by understanding their workflows. What slows them down? What tools make their lives easier? Ask questions. Observe how they work. Build tools that solve their real problems, not just what you assume they need. <strong>Your goal is to make their day smoother, not more complicated.</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Shortening Feedback Cycles for Tools\n</h3><p>Don’t wait months to hear what’s wrong. Set up quick feedback loops. After releasing a tool, check in with your developers. Did it help them? What’s still broken? Use surveys, one-on-one chats, or team discussions. A short feedback cycle means less time wasted on tools that don’t work.</p><ul><li>  Ask developers what they like or dislike about current tools.</li><li>  Test new features with small groups before rolling them out.</li><li>  Fix issues fast, so developers don’t lose trust in the process.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integrating UX Design into Platform Teams\n</h3><p>Good design isn’t just for customer-facing apps. Developers need intuitive tools too. Bring UX designers into your platform teams. Let them work alongside engineers to create tools that are easy to use. A well-designed tool saves time and reduces frustration.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simplify and declutter the UI</td></tr><tr><td>Increases onboarding time</td><td>Add clear, searchable documentation</td></tr><tr><td>Write clear, actionable errors</td></tr></tbody></table></div><blockquote><p>Developers are your users. Treat them like it. Build tools they actually want to use.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Leveraging Automation to Boost Productivity\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Automating Repetitive Tasks\n</h3><p>Repetition is a time thief. Tasks like code formatting, testing, and deployment can eat up hours. Automating these doesn’t just save time—it lets you focus on the creative parts of development. Tools like CI/CD pipelines or code linters can handle the grunt work. <strong>Why waste your brainpower on what a script can do?</strong></p><p>Here’s a quick list of tasks worth automating:</p><ul><li>  Code formatting and linting</li><li>  Unit and integration tests</li><li>  Build and deployment processes</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Using AI to Enhance Code Quality\n</h3><p>AI isn’t just hype—it’s a practical tool for developers. AI-powered tools can scan your code for bugs, suggest improvements, and even generate boilerplate code. Think of it as a second pair of eyes, but one that never gets tired.  models are getting better every year, making them a must-have for any dev team.</p><p>Consider these use cases:</p><ol><li> Static code analysis for catching bugs early.</li><li> Generating repetitive code snippets.</li><li> Offering real-time suggestions for refactoring.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Streamlining Deployment Pipelines\n</h3><p>Deployments don’t need to be stressful. Automating your pipeline means fewer errors and faster rollouts. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes can simplify containerization, while Jenkins or GitHub Actions can automate deployment steps. The goal? Push your code live without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Here’s how to streamline:</p><ul><li>  Use containers for consistent environments.</li><li>  Automate rollbacks in case of failures.</li><li>  Monitor deployments to catch issues early.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Automating doesn’t replace you—it frees you to do what you do best: solving problems and building great software.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Fostering Growth Through Continuous Learning\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Encouraging Experimentation and Innovation\n</h3><p>To grow as a developer, you need to try new things. This means stepping out of your comfort zone and experimenting with fresh ideas. Whether it's testing out a new framework or building a tool you've always wanted, these small risks can lead to big rewards. <strong>Create an environment where mistakes are okay</strong>—this is how you learn. Hackathons, side projects, and even \"what-if\" coding sessions can spark creativity.</p><blockquote><p>Growth isn't about always succeeding; it's about learning from what doesn't work.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  Providing Access to Learning Resources\n</h3><p>Learning shouldn't feel like a chore. Make sure you have access to  resources. This could be online courses, books, or even internal training sessions. Some companies provide budgets for personal development—don't let that go to waste. If you're on a team, share what you've learned. A quick lightning talk or an internal blog post can go a long way in spreading knowledge.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Recognizing and Rewarding Skill Development\n</h3><p>When someone levels up, celebrate it. Recognition doesn't have to be expensive or formal. A shoutout in a team meeting or a quick \"nice work\" message can mean a lot. If you're a manager, think about tying skill growth to tangible rewards like bonuses or promotions. It’s simple: when people feel appreciated, they’re more likely to keep growing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Measuring and Improving Developer Satisfaction\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Using Metrics to Track Dev Experience\n</h3><p>If you want to know how developers feel about their work, start with data. Metrics can show what’s working and what’s a pain. <strong>Look for patterns, not just numbers.</strong> Track things like:</p><ul><li>  Time it takes to fix bugs or ship features.</li><li>  How often developers actually use the tools you provide.</li><li>  Team churn rates—are people leaving?</li></ul><p>A simple table might help you compare:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conducting Regular Developer Surveys\n</h3><p>You can’t fix what you don’t know. Surveys let you ask developers what bugs them most. Keep it short and focused. Ask about:</p><ol><li> Frustrations with processes.</li></ol><p>Pro tip: Don’t just ask, \"How happy are you?\" Dig deeper. For example, \"What’s the most annoying part of your workflow?\" Surveys should be anonymous to get honest answers.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Changes Based on Feedback\n</h3><p>Feedback is useless if you don’t act on it. Once you gather input, prioritize fixes. Start with the quick wins—small changes that make a big difference. For example:</p><ul><li>  If setup takes too long, provide better onboarding docs.</li><li>  If a tool is clunky, see if there’s a better option.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Developers notice when you listen. Even small changes can boost morale and productivity.</p></blockquote><p>One last thing: Keep the feedback loop open. Let developers know what’s being improved and why. It shows you care about their experience.</p><p>To truly understand how happy developers are, we need to measure their satisfaction. This means asking them what they like and what could be better. By listening to their feedback, we can make changes that help them feel more valued and motivated.

Please read the final section of this article for some transition strategy your library might want to take and do contact the p5.js team if you need help or clarifications on your library's transitions.</p><p>Addons, plugins, extensions, or any other name they may be called, these are just different names to a very common concept in the Javascript ecosystem. From the years where all our project starts with jQuery, to now where modern frameworks, libraries, or tools such as Vue, Three.js, and ESLint have some level of support for addons. Even projects that don't explicitly have an interface for addons will often see addons written for it to expand on its functionalities. That last point, expanding functionalities, is exactly the idea we are going to explore here.</p><p>Unlike a compiled language such as C, C++, Rust, or Java, Javascript is not served to the end user as binary, it is by design served as text. Also unlike other non-compiled language, Javascript is often served frequently over the internet, instead of being packaged and downloaded by the user once to be run multiple time, such as what you might do with any other applications on your computer. This puts Javascript in a position where it needs to do as much as it needed with as little code as necessary: the more code it has, the slower Javascript gets downloaded, the slower the experience it is for the end user.</p><p>One method to mitigate this need for small download size is minification and compression. We won't explore that here. The other method that we alluded to is to be as minimal as necessary, to do as much as is necessary and not more. However, it is often a challenge to know what is \"necessary\". Each library will need to determine that for themselves and we will explore this further in the future, but for now let's take this as a tautology and look at what it means in practice. Once a library decided the  functionalities it needs, it gets implemented and people can use it, great! However, there could very well be use cases where people needed a bit more functionalities that are not included, and the library doesn't want to include for various reasons. We don't want our libraries to be able to do everything possible when we are only using a small subset of its capabilities, otherwise our libraries will be excessively bloated. In these kind of cases, it would make sense to create an addon/plugin/extension library that expands on the functionalities of the library.</p><p>Depending on the design and purpose of the library, there are several different techniques when it comes to expanding functionalities, none are better than others necessarily, and some libraries are only meant to be expanded one way while others were never meant to be expanded at all. This is to say you should see the following as different options or approaches rather than any kind of value judgement on the techniques themselves.</p><p>Note: I will be using the terms \"addon\", \"plugin\", and \"extension\" interchangeably here depending on context and which term individual library uses. They all mean the same thing in our context.</p><p>Javascript for better or for worse (depending on who you ask) is a pretty flexible language, especially when it comes to its type system. Javascript is a relatively rare object oriented language that allows the modification of a class definition at runtime, ie. it is able to modify the template in which each object is created from in the middle of execution, this is not something that stricter languages will ever allow. Technically, in Javascript we are not modifying the class definition, for the  syntax that you may have come across in Javascript is mostly syntactic sugar (syntax abstraction) of the real underlying object oriented model that Javascript uses which is prototype based object oriented programming.</p><p>We will leave detailed explanation of prototype based object oriented programming for another time, for our purposes here, the key to remember is we can modify classes at any point in time. This means that even if an interface provided by the library has a certain definition, it can still be modified by code that comes later. In practice, we will do this with prototypes and it looks something like the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As you can see in the second block, by attaching a new function property to , we have modified the original  class to now have a  method that we can call. We can attach whatever we need onto the prototype and it will all behave as if it is defined within the class itself, which our objects will then also inherit from.</p><p>This is a relatively common way of extending a class and, with libraries that provide classes for users to create object out of, is a common way of extending functionalities. However, attaching functionalities to a prototype directly using the  syntax is relatively uncommon especially in libraries meant to be extended. There are a few reasons for this, one is because library authors often prefer one of the other methods mentioned below for friendlier syntax (not everyone likes prototypes or understand them) or more granular control over extension capabilities. Another reason you don't see this as much is because in libraries that does utilize prototype based extension, they may choose to obscure that fact. A notable example is jQuery.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can see that a function is assigned to  called  but what is this ? If you are familiar with jQuery, you will know that  is the conventional short-hand variable for the global jQuery object;  is a property within that jQuery object, you might have guessed by now that  is actually ! If you open up the web console on the jQuery page linked above and type in the following:</p><p>You will see that it returns . Plugins for jQuery are essentially attaching directly to the jQuery prototype so that all future jQuery object inherits that new functionality that the plugin has attached to the underlying class.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Extension through dedicated API\n</h4><p>In a way, we can think of the  syntax that jQuery provides as providing an extension through dedicated API, albeit a very shallow one. However, there are use cases where additional utility and functionality with the plugin system is required. This can be because the library does not just provides a class for object extension, the library provides multiple ways of creating an object, and/or the library has more functionalities that can be extended other than simply creating objects such as if it has a runtime (common for frontend frameworks). In these cases, a more prominent API will often be presented to extend the functionalities of the library, usually in the form of a function that accept some argument that defines the behavior of the plugin.</p><p>Let's have a look at what this could mean through an example. Day.js is a library designed to make handling time related data a lot easier in Javascript. It is able to parse timestamp, manipulate time data (eg. calculate the date 10 weeks from now), and format timestamp so that you can display date and time in whatever way you want with as much detail as you need. Day.js provides a plugin system that can extend the possible things you can do with a timestamp such as getting UTC time, do timezone conversions, and many more. To extend Day.js with a plugin, you will do something like the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now the global  object has additional functionalities provided by the  plugin. What is actually happening though? What is the  plugin and what happens with  function? If we look at the <a href=\"https://day.js.org/docs/en/plugin/plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Day.js plugin documentation page</a>, we will have a good idea on what is potentially happening.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A Day.js plugin is always defined as a function, this means that  is actually expecting an argument with a function as a callback into the  method that is then passed its own relevant arguments. These arguments are  (which is the user defined option that is also passed to  if needed), , and . In the function body, you will notice that  is extended through the  syntax we have seen above so that is not new. The final argument  is something that is more Day.js specific, without going into all the details, attaching additional functions to  extends the number of ways Day.js objects can be created.</p><p>As you can see in this example, Day.js using a dedicated API for extension does not mean it won't be extending prototypes, but rather it has additional capabilities that is not strictly attached to the class itself. For more complex projects, such as Vue.js or more commonly Node.js based frameworks, using a dedicated API is often the best way to extend the functionality of a library.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Independent interface, compatible data structure\n</h4><p>This final method of extension is not really an extension at all. The philosophy here is that instead of having users modify the provided interface of a class or other library internals, the library provides and accepts simple or well-defined data/data structures in its public interface, eliminating much of the need to extend it directly.</p><p>What this means is that instead of implementing additional functionality as a dependency onto the existing library, the additional functionality is implemented independently and will either accept outputs from the library in a well-defined format or be able to pass inputs to the library in a well-defined format. In a way, this is the most common method in Javascript because every library that does not provide explicit interface or guidance on extension is assumed to work this way, the only thing the library maintainer need to be aware of is to have said well-defined format for input/output.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The main benefit of this is that plugin authors will no longer be plugin authors, they will be writing libraries of their own instead. Their end users will also no longer need the upstream dependency if they don't need it, fulfilling even more of the original goal of limiting the transfer over internet of unused code and functionalities. The resulting library have more flexibility and compatibility as well. Gone are the days where every other library were written as a jQuery plugin, these days we can just use whichever library solves our problem without needing to include jQuery if we don't need it anymore.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  A final word on extension methods\n</h4><p>These above are not necessarily extensive when it comes to all possible ways to extend a library and definitely not extensive when it comes to possible syntax (since that is possibly infinite). I believe most if not all extension variations can fit in at least one of the above category but if you see a variation that somehow don't fit into any of the above category, do let me know, I would love to have a closer look at it.</p><p>Now that we have an overview of these different techniques, let's have a look at them in the context of p5.js addon libraries.</p><p>p5.js as a library has many aspects that a user may want to extend. These can be providing additional drawing functions, communicating with other services, or provide glue code with other libraries, amongst infinite possibilities. The two major direct expansions are providing new functions that can be called in global mode &amp; instance mode semantically, and running hooks (ie. custom code) at certain point in the runtime such as before/after  runs and before/after every  call. Since we have looked at possible extension strategies above, let's see how they apply in the context of p5.js, starting with p5.js 1.x then we'll look at how p5.js 2.0 changes some aspects of this and why.</p><p>p5.js 1.x uses a combination of all three strategies above when it comes to how addons can be authored. Starting from the least complex to explain, the last strategy (<em>Independent interface, compatible data structure</em>) as we know, relies on passing data directly out of or into p5.js. As long as your library can generate parameters accepted by p5.js functions, it will work out of the box. Some examples include passing CSS color string as argument into any function that accepts colors, and using random noise generated by the  function in your own addon for smooth randomness.</p><p>Next, if you wish for your addon functions to be available globally in global mode, you will need to attach it to the  object as per the first method we looked at above.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Most addon libraries that want to extend p5.js will likely work this way. However, in some circumstances, addon libraries may need to also have a bit more control over p5.js, specifically the p5.js runtime. For example, instead of passively providing functions that the user can call, an addon library might want to instead reset the background color at the start of every frame automatically or set up some initial values before setup is called. In these kind of cases, p5.js provides lifecycle hooks that an addon library can hook a function onto. What lifecycle hooks means is that they are specially registered functions that will be run at specific points in the runtime (ie. from initializing the  object to running  to removing the sketch altogether, if  was ever called). To register these special functions onto the relevant hook, we need to use the second extension method, <em>Extension through dedicated API</em>, here.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There are a number of hooks available but we will not elaborate on them here as we are interested in how it works in p5.js 2.0 instead. In p5.js 2.0, the requirements and principles stay the same: we still need to be able to attach functions that can be used in global mode and instance mode and we still need a way for library authors to hook into specific lifecycle events. To simplify the addon library authoring workflow, p5.js 2.0 now has a unified dedicated extension API that support both use cases (we are leaving \"<em>Independent interface, compatible data structure</em>\" out here since the whole point is to not have direct extension in that case). p5.js 2.0 now provides a new static function  that takes in one argument which will be the definition of your addon library. This argument is in the form of a function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As you can see above the function that comprise of your addon library has three parameters , , and , let's go through each one at a time.</p><p>This is the global  object, ie. the  constructor. You can use it to attach or access static properties/methods if you need to. For example if you want to manually create a  in your library:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you remember  being used by jQuery, you may have guessed what  is. If you guessed  is just an alias for , you will be right! We certainly can access  through the  parameter in the first position, however  provides a slight layer of abstraction to the underlying prototype system of Javascript for the library author, it is still functionally the same though.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is likely the most significant difference and a departure from p5.js 1.x. Instead of having an API to individually register lifecycle hooks, the  parameter here by default points to an empty object . We register lifecycle hooks by assigning relevant keys into the lifecycle hook.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> - Runs once before  runs</li><li> - Runs once after  runs</li><li> - Runs once before every  runs</li><li> - Runs once after every  runs</li><li> - Runs once when  is called</li></ul><p>All functions attached to the  object have access to the current  sketch instance through  (provided they are  defined with arrow functions), and they are all called with the  keyword so they can be  function as well.</p><p>Put altogether, we have something like the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This syntax should have enough flexibility to cover all uses cases for extension and even if not, there will be room for easy expansion without causing problems with future compatibilities.</p><p>This part is for those who already has an existing addon library written for p5.js 1.x and want to make it compatible with p5.js 2.0. If you are just here to learn about addon libraries and don't already have a p5.js 1.x addon library, you can skip this section. </p><p>The good news is, if your library don't extend p5.js directly it will most likely just work as we have seen above. If your library extends p5.js through attaching to , it will likely just work, because as we've seen, the new addon syntax also provides  as an alias to  and we attach methods there still.</p><p>The bad news is, if your library uses the 1.x lifecycle hook register method <code>p5.prototype.registerMethod</code>, you will need to do some conversion. If your addon uses , , or , you will also need to update your addon, for this case, please refer to the article on <a href=\"https://dev.to/limzykenneth/asynchronous-p5js-20-458f\">asynchronous p5.js 2.0</a>.</p><p>To convert lifecycle hooks, do the following:</p><ol><li>Take note of the relevant lifecycle hooks you are using and how they map onto the new names:\n\n<ul><li> -&gt; You no longer need a lifecycle hook for this, just put the relevant code in the addon function body or the  hook.</li><li> -&gt; /</li></ul></li><li><p>Using the new addon syntax, attach the relevant function as members of the  parameter.</p><pre><code></code></pre></li><li><p>Note that since the lifecycle hook functions will have  resolved to the  sketch instance already, you no longer need to attach functions to the prototype to access  like we were doing before in the  example above.</p></li></ol><p>If you are using the new addon syntax, the final thing you will need to do is to call  with your defined addon function.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You may have noted that if your addon library converts to use the new addon library syntax, it will no longer work with p5.js 1.x, since p5.js 1.x does not provide the  static function, amongst other reasons. There are a few possible options you can take:</p><ul><li>Have two different versions of your library, one with p5.js 1.x compatibility and another with p5.js 2.0 compatibility.</li><li>Release a new version of your library with p5.js 2.0 compatibility. If your user needs p5.js 1.x compatibility, they can use the last released version of your library that was still compatible.</li><li><p>Support both syntax at the same time. This will be more complicated to implement and may not be possible in all cases. The general idea will be something like the following:</p><pre><code></code></pre></li></ul><p>If you are unsure how to do the conversion, especially in the specific context of your addon library, please reach out to the p5.js team by opening an issue on the p5.js library repo, directly via email, or other official channel. The p5.js team is currently, at the time of writing, going through the full list of community contributed libraries to individually assess the compatibility of the libraries and identify any action needed. You may be contacted on your library's repo about any action needed. However, feel free to attempt some tests yourself with p5.js 2.0, it may already work without needing any changes to your code.</p>","contentLength":18983,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"TypeScript interfaces & types","url":"https://dev.to/saresy78/typescript-interfaces-types-4dkm","date":1740136427,"author":"Sarah","guid":8541,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>How TypeScript interfaces and types help structure your code</li><li>When to use interfaces vs types</li><li>Working with optional and  properties</li><li>Extending and combining interfaces</li><li>Real-world interface patterns</li></ul><p>Interfaces in TypeScript define a contract for object shapes.

The  hook creates a persistent state container with null initial values for the user and token, along with  flag.

But payment failures like network issues, gateway timeout, or system hiccups can interrupt transactions at any time. Without a retry mechanism, these failures can block access, frustrate users, and result in lost revenue.</p><p>Automated payments are the revenue lifeline for subscription-based businesses, so building a dedicated retry service for failed transactions is important. This service gives failed payments another chance (or two or three) before they're truly lost. In this guide, you’ll learn how to design a fault-tolerant microservice that uses message queues, exponential backoff, and concurrency handling to recover from payment failures gracefully.</p><p>Before diving into the implementation details, let’s explore the importance of payment retries.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why do you Need Payment Retries?\n</h2><p>Payment gateways can fail for many reasons, such as temporary network issues, bank downtime, or rate limits. Without a retry mechanism, these failures can result in involuntary customer churn. Below are some of the reasons why retries are essential for your business:</p><ul><li><strong>Improves Customer Experience</strong>: Automated payment allows your customers to get around re-entering payment details or get in contact with the support team for assistance. This process saves time, reduces frustration, and improves the overall experience.</li><li>: With payment retries, you gain access to failed payment data, allowing you to analyze patterns and identify the best times for successful transactions. This enables you to implement smart retry strategies, improving the success rate.</li><li><strong>Prevents Service Disruptions:</strong> For subscription-based businesses, uninterrupted service is crucial. Payment retries help you avoid disruptions caused by failed transactions, ensuring customers continue to receive the service they expect.</li><li>: Payment retries save you from costly administrative interventions like chargeback processing, support services, etc.</li><li><strong>Increases Transaction Success Rates</strong>: Retries give your business another chance to process failed transactions, improving overall payment success rates and enhancing the efficiency of the payment system.</li><li><strong>Maintains Consistent Cash Flow</strong>: Retries help your business maintain consistent cash flow by recovering revenues from transactions that initially failed.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Designing the Retry Service\n</h2><p>To implement retry logic, you need a message queue. A message queue is a tool that lets independent applications and services exchange information. In our case, we'll use Redis as the message queue to store references to failed transactions until they are processed and removed. Redis is an excellent database for managing multiple tasks that are lined up for processing.</p><blockquote><p>This implementation uses Go and Docker (for running Redis). You can also use a managed Redis server to process your queue. While Go is used here, the approach applies to any other programming language of your choice.</p></blockquote><p>To get started, install Redis in Docker using the command below:</p><div><pre><code>docker run  redis  6379:6379 redis\n</code></pre></div><p>With Redis up and running, push failed transactions into the Redis queues for retries.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>This code uses a  to save failed transactions, which works well for simple queueing and smaller volumes of failures. However, if you expect failures to occur on a larger scale or need more advanced features, using a  would be a better fit.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Implementing Exponential Backoff</strong></p><p>Now that the failed transactions are saved in Redis, you might think it's best to retry them immediately. However, that's not the case. Instead, you should use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/exponential-backoff\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>—a strategy that gradually increases the wait time between retries to avoid overloading the server.</p><p>Exponential backoff uses a formula to calculate the retries as follows: <code>delay = base_delay * 2^(retry_attempt)</code></p><p>For example, if the  is , the retry delay for each attempt would be calculated as follows:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Process Failed Payments Concurrently</strong></p><p>Next, you need to create a worker that fetches failed transactions and uses the exponential backoff to retry the payment without overloading the system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lastly, limit the number of retries by processing the payment concurrently.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times won’t trigger duplicate operations. When handling payments, you need to check if a payment has already been processed before retrying. This helps prevent customers from being charged more than once.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These steps help you build a more resilient payment system that allows transactions to go through even when there are network failures or API issues. This improves reliability and supports continuous revenue collection.</p><p>While a retry service offers many benefits and helps reduce customer churn, it also comes with technical challenges, such as:</p><ul><li>  High resource consumption.</li><li>  The need for advanced monitoring of failed transactions.</li><li>  Optimizing retry limits based on the payment gateway.</li><li>  Requires extra technical effort to build a circuit breaker pattern (a system that stops retrying after several failed attempts).</li></ul><p>You can address these challenges by using a payment gateway like Flutterwave, which reduces the technical overhead and helps you build better retry service.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Flutterwave can Help you Build a Better Retry Service\n</h2><p>Flutterwave provides built-in tools to help your businesses recover lost revenue, manage failed payments, and automate retries. Here’s how it can help:</p><p><strong>Checkout Timeout and Retries</strong></p><p>Flutterwave Checkout offers more than customization for amounts, branding, and payment options. It also lets you control how long customers have to complete a payment and how many times they can retry.</p><p>For example, if you set a  and allow , customers can attempt to complete their payment within this window before the transaction is considered failed. This built-in flexibility serves as the <strong>first fail-safe mechanism</strong>, giving customers a chance to finalize their payment before your retry service takes over.</p><div><pre><code>\n#Session timeout in minutes (maxValue: 1440 minutes)\n #Max\nretry (int)\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>  The <strong>transaction verification endpoint</strong> allows you to check the real-time status of a transaction.</li><li>  The  enables you to re-initiate a failed payment when necessary.</li></ul><p>By integrating these APIs into your retry service, you can automate payment recovery and improve transaction success rates.</p><p>With Flutterwave, you can customize your customers' billing cycles using either the <a href=\"https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference/create-payment-plan-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recurring payment endpoint</a> or <a href=\"https://app.flutterwave.com/dashboard/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the dashboard</a>. This flexibility allows you to tailor your payment collection process to different customer needs, reducing the chances of failed transactions. As a result, your retry service is used less frequently, and resource usage is optimized.</p><p>Flutterwave offers <strong>comprehensive analytics and reporting</strong> tools that provide real-time insights into:</p><ul><li>  Failed payments and their causes</li><li>  Success rates of transactions</li><li>  Retry attempts and their outcomes</li><li>  Overall payment performance trends</li></ul><p>These insights help you monitor transactions, optimize your retry strategy, and improve revenue recovery.</p><p>A payment retry service helps your business recover failed transactions by automatically retrying them on a scheduled basis. It helps resolve network errors, bank downtimes, and gateway failures by reducing revenue loss and improving the payment experience.</p><p>Flutterwave makes this process even more effective with:</p><ul><li>  Checkout retry settings that give customers multiple chances to complete payments.</li><li>  Customizable billing cycles that help reduce failed transactions.</li><li>  Real-time analytics that provide insights to optimize retry strategies.</li></ul><p>With Flutterwave’s tools, you can build a smarter, more efficient, and automated payment retry system that improves transaction success rates and minimizes disruptions.</p>","contentLength":7746,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why Use HTML Invoice Templates","url":"https://dev.to/sahil222/why-use-html-invoice-templates-2h83","date":1740134791,"author":"Sahil","guid":8521,"unread":true,"content":"<p>HTML invoice templates are widely used by individuals, businesses, and organizations across various industries to create professional, customizable, and easily shareable invoices.

A robust and efficient DevOps pipeline is crucial for achieving this, but building and scaling CI/CD processes is no easy task. Many DevOps engineers and startup founders encounter significant challenges that hinder their development cycles, inflate costs, and ultimately impede growth.</p><p>‍\nThis article explores the most pressing <a href=\"https://www.turtleci.io/blogs/how-startups-overcome-devops-challenges-with-turtleci-ci-cd-platform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps</a> struggles faced by startups and demonstrates how TurtleCI provides a powerful solution to overcome these obstacles.</p><p>‍<strong>The Struggles of DevOps: Pain Points Startups Face</strong>\nStartups, often operating with limited resources and tight deadlines, are particularly vulnerable to DevOps inefficiencies. Here are some of the most common pain points they experience:</p><p>: Long wait times for builds and deployments disrupt workflows, delay releases, and frustrate development teams. This can be caused by inefficient processes, complex configurations, or limited infrastructure. Slow deployments can also impact time-to-market, giving competitors an edge.<strong>Complex Infrastructure Management</strong>: Managing a growing number of servers, databases, and other infrastructure components can quickly become overwhelming. The complexity increases exponentially as the startup scales, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and increased overhead. This complexity can also make it difficult to troubleshoot issues and maintain system stability.: Cloud infrastructure expenses, software licenses, and dedicated DevOps personnel can put a significant strain on startup budgets. Optimizing cloud usage and automating tasks is crucial for controlling costs, but this often requires specialized expertise and tools.: Failed builds and difficult-to-diagnose errors can bring development to a standstill. Debugging complex systems requires significant time and expertise, delaying crucial releases and impacting product timelines. This can be especially problematic for startups with limited engineering resources.: As a startup grows, its CI/CD pipeline needs to scale seamlessly to handle increased traffic, larger codebases, and more frequent deployments. A rigid or poorly designed pipeline can become a bottleneck, preventing the startup from scaling effectively.: Without proper security practices integrated into the DevOps pipeline, startups are vulnerable to security breaches. Automating security checks and implementing robust access controls are essential for protecting sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.\n‍</p><p>If any of these challenges resonate with your startup, you're not alone.

The biggest surprise was that with similar quality of ChatGPT answers it cost an order of magnitude less to train, this has already affected Nvidia's stock price, which lost about 20% of its value in one go. This model can be used for free either through the web or through a mobile app. But today I would like to highlight another of the possibilities of using this model, or rather the possibility of running it locally. And let's look at it on a small project. Let's imagine that we have documentation and we need to search for information or analyze it. For this purpose we can apply the RAG technology. </p><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI technique designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of language models by integrating the search for external information into the response generation process.  Unlike traditional generative models that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG dynamically searches for relevant information before generating a response, reducing hallucinations and improving fact accuracy.   </p><p>RAG's workflow consists of three key steps.  First, it retrieves relevant documents or data from a knowledge base, which may include structured databases, vector stores, or even real-time APIs.  The retrieved information is then combined with the model's internal knowledge to ensure that the answers are based on relevant and reliable sources.  Finally, the model generates a reasoned answer using both its trained language capabilities and the newly acquired data.   </p><p>This approach offers significant advantages.  By basing answers on external sources, RAG minimizes inaccuracies and ensures that information is up-to-date, making it particularly useful in fast-changing fields such as finance, healthcare, and law.  It is widely used in chatbots, AI systems with advanced search, enterprise knowledge discovery, and AI-driven research assistants where accuracy and factual validity are critical.   </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What will the architecture of the solution look like?\n</h3><p>A knowledge base is a collection of relevant and up-to-date information that serves as the basis for a RAG.  In our case, these are documents stored in the catalog. </p><p>Before you start implementing this architecture, the following libraries must be installed (tested on Python 3.11):</p><div><pre><code>llama-index   \ntransformers   \ntorch   \nsentence-transformers   \nllama-index-llms-ollama \n</code></pre></div><p>Here's how you can upload your documents to LlamaIndex as objects:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The next step is to build a vector store index, which are a key component of search-enhanced generation (RAG), and so you will use them in almost every application that uses LlamaIndex, either directly or indirectly. </p><p>Vector stores take a list of Node objects and build an index from them  </p><p>In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the VectorStoreIndex index is used to store and retrieve vector embeddings of documents.  This allows the system to find relevant information based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matches.   </p><p>The process starts with document embedding.  Textual data is converted into vector embeddings using an embedding model.  These embeddings represent the meaning of the text in numerical form, making it easier to compare and find similar content.  Once created, these embeddings are stored in a vector database such as FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant or Chroma.   </p><p>When a user submits a query, it is also converted into an embedding using the same model.  The system then searches for similar embeddings by comparing the query with the stored vectors using similarity metrics such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.  The most relevant documents are retrieved based on their similarity scores.   </p><p>The retrieved documents are passed as context to a large language model (LLM), which uses them to generate a response.  This process ensures that the LLM has access to relevant information, improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations.   </p><p>The use of VectorStoreIndex improves RAG systems by providing semantic search, improving scalability and supporting real-time search.  This ensures that answers are contextually accurate and based on the most relevant information available. </p><p>Building a vector index is easy</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>After that it is enough to execute the following code to make RAG start working</p><div><pre><code> \\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\</code></pre></div><p>We can embed this solution into a desktop client by creating a user interface using <a href=\"https://streamlit.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a> to allow the user to interact with our RAG application via chat.

Public cloud offers scalability, but uncontrolled cloud migration can lead to security risks, cost overruns, and operational complexities. </p><p>This is where the <a href=\"https://gem-corp.tech/tech-blogs/cloud/hybrid-cloud\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hybrid cloud technology</a> provides a smarter approach. By integrating cloud flexibility with on-premise stability, organizations gain the agility to scale, the security to comply, and the cost efficiency to maximize ROI. </p><p>For C-level executives, the decision is no longer whether to move to the cloud, but how to do it strategically. In this article, we break down how the hybrid cloud can accelerate growth, enhance resilience, and create a future-ready IT ecosystem—without the typical pitfalls of cloud adoption. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  An overview of hybrid cloud\n</h2><p>A hybrid cloud is a computing framework that integrates multiple environments, combining public and private cloud resources, including on-premises data centers and edge locations, to run applications. </p><p>In other words, the hybrid cloud architecture in data refers to a data management strategy that integrates multiple environments—on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds to store, process, and analyze data. </p><p>This approach is widely adopted because most organizations today do not rely solely on a single public cloud provider. </p><p>Another reason hybrid cloud infrastructure has become one of the most prevalent IT setups is that it allows cloud migrations to become gradual transition rather than an immediate shift. Furthermore, this approach allows businesses to leverage the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing while maintaining control over sensitive or mission-critical data. </p><p>As a result, it enables a more seamless and controlled migration process, ensuring operational continuity while optimizing cloud-based services. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why hybrid cloud approach matters for business leaders\n</h2><p>This approach is suitable for businesses that wish to leverage the scalability and scalability of a public cloud while keeping their data on-premises to ensure compliance with local and international regulations.  </p><p>The key benefits of hybrid cloud for businesses lie in four aspects: helping businesses modernize at their own pace, ensuring regulatory compliance, enabling apps to run on-premises, and enabling edge computing.  </p><p><strong>Modernizing at your own pace</strong>\nA hybrid cloud strategy provides organizations with the flexibility to transition their IT infrastructure gradually instead of making an abrupt shift to the cloud. This benefit is crucial for businesses that need to: </p><p>Reduce disruption: Migrating applications in stages ensures that business operations continue smoothly without unexpected downtime. \nOptimize costs: A step-by-step migration allows companies to allocate budgets more efficiently, avoiding a large upfront capital expenditure. <p>\nLeverage legacy systems: Many enterprises rely on older applications that are deeply integrated into their operations. Hybrid cloud enables them to modernize incrementally while still running critical workloads on existing on-premises infrastructure. </p>\nAvoid vendor lock-in: Moving all workloads to a single cloud provider may introduce dependency risks. With hybrid cloud, businesses can evaluate different providers and optimize for performance and cost. <p>\ngroup young business people working office 1businesspeople working finance accounting analyze financi 2business innovation</p></p><p><strong>Maintaining regulatory compliance</strong>\nIndustries such as finance, healthcare, government, and telecommunications often have strict regulations governing data storage, processing, and transmission. A hybrid cloud model allows organizations to: </p><p>Keep sensitive data on-premises: Companies can store confidential or legally protected information in private data centers while leveraging public cloud resources for less sensitive workloads. \nComply with data sovereignty laws: Some countries require that customer data be stored within national borders. A hybrid approach enables businesses to operate internationally while ensuring compliance. <p>\nImplement security controls: Certain industries require additional security measures, such as encryption, monitoring, or restricted access, which are easier to enforce with a hybrid cloud environment. </p>\nFor example, a financial institution may store customer transaction records in a private cloud to meet regulatory requirements while using a public cloud for customer-facing applications. </p><p>\nSome applications may not be suitable for migration to the public cloud due to: </p><p>Performance needs: Applications with high data throughput or latency-sensitive workloads often perform better when running on local infrastructure. \nCompatibility issues: Legacy applications built for on-premises environments may not function optimally in the cloud. <p>\nData sensitivity: Companies handling classified or highly confidential data, such as government agencies or healthcare providers, often need on-premises solutions for security and compliance. </p>\nMainframe dependencies: Businesses in industries like banking and insurance rely on mainframe systems that are deeply embedded in their operations. Hybapp developmentrid cloud allows them to integrate new cloud-based services without replacing these critical systems. <p>\nBy using a hybrid approach, organizations can continue running regulated or high-performance applications on-premises while leveraging the cloud for additional scalability. </p></p><p><strong>Future-proofing your business’s future</strong>\nHybrid cloud adoption is not just about meeting today’s needs—it’s about building a future-ready IT infrastructure that can adapt to evolving business and technology trends.  </p><p>One of the key advantages of hybrid cloud is optimized cloud spending. Organizations can retain cost-intensive applications on-premises while leveraging cloud resources for seasonal spikes, unpredictable workloads, or elastic demands. This ensures that companies only pay for cloud services when needed, reducing unnecessary expenses while maintaining operational efficiency. </p><p>Additionally, it helps you avoid vendor lock-in by diversifying across multiple cloud providers instead of relying on a single vendor. Therefore, enterprises gain the flexibility to select the best services and pricing options available in the market. This competitive approach allows businesses to negotiate better rates, improve resilience, and avoid potential risks associated with being tied to a single cloud provider. </p><p>Furthermore, hybrid cloud enables enterprises to maximize return on investment (ROI) by aligning cloud adoption with business objectives. Instead of migrating all workloads indiscriminately, organizations can strategically invest in the right mix of on-premises and cloud resources, ensuring that their IT spending is justified by actual business needs.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How does hybrid cloud address key business pain points?\n</h2><p>In this section, let’s explore how hybrid cloud addresses three fundamental business concerns: data security and compliance, cost optimization, and operational efficiency. </p><p><strong>Data security &amp; Compliance</strong>\nIn an era of stringent data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA), enterprises must balance accessibility with compliance. </p><p>Hybrid cloud provides greater control over sensitive data by allowing organizations to store regulated information in private or on-premises environments while utilizing public cloud resources for scalable computing needs and/or less sensitive operations. </p><p>In addition, unlike a fully public cloud environment—where all data and applications are stored off-premises—a hybrid model allows businesses to control where sensitive data resides and apply different security measures based on risk levels. </p><p>This approach, often referred to as segmented security policies, reduces the risk of large-scale breaches, as attackers cannot easily access an organization’s entire IT ecosystem from a single entry point. Furthermore, businesses can implement zero-trust architectures and multi-layered security to safeguard data. </p><p>Moreover, while security concerns often slow cloud adoption, a hybrid approach allows enterprises to innovate within a controlled framework, ensuring data sovereignty while benefiting from cloud-driven AI, analytics, and automation. </p><p><strong>Cost optimization &amp; ROI clarity</strong>\nOne of the most pressing concerns for C-level executives is cloud cost management. Public cloud offers scalability but can lead to unpredictable costs if not optimized. </p><p>One of the key advantages of hybrid cloud is optimized cloud spending. Organizations can retain cost-intensive applications on-premises while leveraging cloud resources for seasonal spikes, unpredictable workloads, or elastic demands.

Functions, Benefits, and Interactions","url":"https://dev.to/stackgenie/what-is-istio-service-mesh-functions-benefits-and-interactions-4lk5","date":1740126996,"author":"Digital Marketing Stackgenie","guid":8469,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As businesses increasingly adopt cloud-native applications and microservices to drive innovation, they encounter new challenges in managing the complexity of their systems. While these architectures provide scalability and flexibility, they also introduce obstacles in areas like service communication, security, and visibility. That’s where Istio comes in—a robust, open-source service mesh designed to simplify the management of microservices, ensuring seamless communication, enhanced security, and better observability.</p><p>This guide will take you through the essentials of Istio, how it works, and why it’s a game-changer for scaling cloud-native applications with confidence.</p><p>What is Istio?\nIstio is a service mesh that provides a platform for connecting, securing, controlling, and observing microservices. It works as a layer between the application and the network, enabling developers and DevOps teams to manage the complexities of service-to-service communication in modern applications.</p><p>For businesses, adopting Istio means enhancing security, improving observability, and optimizing the performance of microservices without significantly increasing the operational burden on developers.</p><p>Impact of Istio on microservices \nIstio brings a unique approach to managing microservices, mainly through its use of sidecars. These sidecars work alongside each service to handle tasks like routing, security, and data collection, making it easier for businesses to manage complex applications. But in what ways will this impact your current microservices architecture and overall business dynamics? Let us understand by exploring the changes that Istio sidecars bring to the application’s functions for better reliability and performance.</p><p>Increased fault tolerance: Istio sidecars increase your application’s reliability by enabling it to perform the majority of functions even during a service outage. This is because they can be configured to autonomously perform retries a fixed number of times or trigger circuit breakers before redirecting users in case of a service outage or component failure.\nSimplified policy management: Istio provides managers with a centralized control plane, from which they configure security and service settings for multiple components at once. This reduces the hassle of modifying each container and its connected proxies and gives businesses easier authority over their application’s behaviors.<p>\nReduced dependencies for telemetry: With  Istio’s feature to transmit telemetry data, you get access to readily available insights into the performance of your application. This also significantly reduces the need for dedicated services to monitor application performance which saves you more time for analysis. Furthermore, it can be readily integrated with other observability platforms such as Grafana to analyze telemetry data with greater accuracy. </p>\nHow Does Istio Service Mesh Work? <p>\nHow Does Istio Service Mesh Work</p></p><p>Much like other service meshes, Istio works by using sidecars which are proxies attached to each microservice instance. Once configured, these sidecars intercept any new request and redirect it to the appropriate service using preset rules. The sidecars can also transmit telemetry data to deliver in-depth insights into application performance and error rates.</p><p>The functions and configurations of these sidecars are achieved broadly through two planes which are the control plane and the data plane. Both of these planes are connected to all microservice instances within your architecture. Let us understand what these planes are for and how they can be used. </p><p>Istio Data Plane / Envoy:\nIstio Data Plane Envoy</p><p>The data plane is the component responsible for handling the actual traffic between microservices. It consists of lightweight Envoy proxies that are deployed as sidecars along with each service instance. When a service receives a request, the Envoy proxy processes it first before it reaches the actual service directly. </p><p>The proxy can apply various preprogrammed configurations, such as load balancing, retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking, to ensure reliable communication between services. Additionally, the data plane enforces security protocols like mutual TLS (mTLS) and granular identity-based access to encrypt traffic and authenticate services helping secure data in transit and preventing unauthorized access. </p><p>The Envoy proxies also gather telemetry data, including metrics and logs, which provide insights into service performance and health. Envoy captures this data as it processes traffic, forwarding it to Istio’s control plane or other observability tools for analysis.</p><p>Istio Control Plane / Istiod: \nThe control plane in Istio enables the administrator to adjust the configuration, management, and orchestration of the data plane. Naturally, this also gives control over the Envoy proxies deployed with all microservice instances. It provides a centralized interface for defining the policies, rules, and configurations that govern how traffic flows through the microservices architecture. </p><p>One of the primary components of the Istio control plane is Istiod (formerly known as Pilot), which handles the distribution of configuration information to the data plane. Istiod provides the necessary service discovery, traffic management, and configuration updates. When changes such as deploying a new version of a service, Istiod distributes these changes to the relevant proxies, ensuring that they are consistently applied across the environment.</p><p>Furthermore, the control plane integrates with external systems and tools, allowing for seamless observability and monitoring with a set of APIs that developers and operators can use to interact with Istio. This makes it easier to automate tasks, integrate with CI/CD pipelines, and manage configurations on demand. </p><p>Top 5 Benefits of Using Istio Service Mesh\nUsing Istio, in particular, holds many benefits that businesses can enjoy, ranging from increased developer productivity to reduced architecture complexity. To understand these benefits better in terms of their tangible impact, we have listed the top reasons why development teams choose Istio to improve their existing solutions. </p><ol><li>Improved Security:\nIstio significantly enhances security within microservices architectures through mechanisms such as mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS). This mechanism encrypts traffic between services and ensures that the client and server authenticate each other before establishing a connection to prevent unauthorized access.</li></ol><p>Istio also provides fine-grained access control through authorization policies. Administrators of the application can readily define rules that specify which services can communicate with each other. Role-based access control (RBAC) is also possible, and it updates access for all users based on their roles and authority. </p><ol><li>Additional Deployment Options:\nA general concern when using sidecar proxies is the challenge of excessive resource consumption. Since these sidecars are attached to every single component, it takes additional computing power to process user requests. This is why Istio introduced an extra deployment option known as ‘Ambient Mode’. </li></ol><p>Ambient mode creates general traffic routing rules and access controls that apply to all microservices rather than doing it with individual sidecars. Administrators also have an easier time adjusting configurations as it simplifies application architecture further and reduces resource consumption. </p><ol><li>Enhanced Observability\nIstio enables the collection of various types of telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and distributed traces. Accessing these metrics will give you insights into performance indicators like latency, request rates, and error rates, allowing teams to track the health and performance of individual services after deployment. </li></ol><p>The collected logs also offer detailed information about interactions within services, while distributed tracing provides a visual representation of request paths across microservices. This allows teams to identify bottlenecks, latency issues, and failures in complex service interactions, which leads to faster troubleshooting and issue resolution.</p><ol><li>Traffic Management &amp; Testing:\nThe load-balancing capabilities of Istio allow you to customize redirecting rules based on various factors. These factors include the user’s geographic location, network latency, and service history. Companies can also perform canary deployments using Istio by setting instructions to distribute portions of traffic to new application versions. </li></ol><p>The ability to rapidly modify traffic distribution in this manner is excellent for testing new features without modifying the production experiences for all users. If users experience functional issues in the new application version, Istio can automatically rollback the traffic to previous stable instances. </p><ol><li>Network Resilience:\nIstio’s features protect your application from cascading failures usually arising due to component dependencies. The main feature that makes this possible is circuit breaking, which enables Istio to detect if any service instance is facing issues. Once detected, Istio can reroute all traffic from the faulty service to other instances. </li></ol><p>All of these features to improve network resilience can always be counted on despite any updates to Istio since they only issue stable binary releases. This means that all versions of Istio have been thoroughly tested in multiple scenarios before launch. Teams have immense confidence in integrating new versions of Istio without worrying about major compatibility issues.</p><ol><li>Vast Integration Capabilities: \nOne of the key strengths of Istio is its ability to work seamlessly with a wide range of existing tools and technologies. Such integration can be used with various observability tools, such as Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and Jaeger or Zipkin for distributed tracing. This interoperability enables teams to gain deep insights into their application performance and behavior, without overhauling their existing observability stack.</li></ol><p>Additionally, Istio integrates well with popular cloud-native technologies and platforms, such as Kubernetes, making it a natural choice for organizations that have adopted microservices and container orchestration. Its compatibility with cloud providers and services enhances its usability across diverse environments, whether with on-premises, cloud, or hybrid setups.</p><p>How Istio Work with Kubernetes?\nIf your application already uses microservices with Kubernetes to orchestrate containers, then you might wonder how Istio would integrate and refine policy management and security. While Kubernetes does have rudimentary load-balancing features, Istio adds an additional layer of control over each individual container, which leads to the following enhancements:</p><p>Cross-container security: Rather than having a general access policy over all containers, Istio introduces the option to set security measures for each individual container.  It also adds features such as mTLS for Kubernetes to facilitate data encryption. \nIndividual service performance analytics: To gain deeper insights into performance, Istio’s sidecars are used as they can collect logs and latency figures for each component. This helps you solve the analytical limitations of Kubernetes. <p>\nCentralized control over proxies: The control plane from Istio drastically improves the experiences of customizing proxy behaviors by giving teams a centralized point for control. This improves the uniformity of policies across all service instances. </p>\nBest of all, the installation of Istio into Kubernetes is very simple since Istio can automatically inject the Envoy proxy as a sidecar into the Kubernetes pods of your microservices. This process allows Istio to manage traffic between services transparently, without requiring code changes to the applications. </p><p>Transform Service Management and Application Security With the Istio Service Mesh \nAs we can see, implementing Istio for your project is great for gaining more control over your application’s internal policies and interactions. Every single feature, from traffic distribution to circuit breaking, collectively protects your services from functional errors and external threats. </p><p>However, configuring Istio and integrating it with your existing microservices architecture may seem like a daunting endeavor that requires a lot of planning and expertise.

One of the most crucial aspects of this process is —the technique that allows React to attach event listeners and state to a static server-rendered page.</p><p>With the release of React 19, hydration has undergone some significant improvements. If you've ever built SSR applications using Next.js, Remix, or even raw React, you might have encountered issues like slow page interactivity, hydration mismatches, or unnecessary JavaScript execution.  aims to make hydration more efficient, flexible, and performant.</p><p>In this deep dive, I'm going to explain everything about hydration in React 19—what it is, why it matters, and how the latest updates optimize the process. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how React 19 improves hydration and how to use it effectively in your own applications.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Section Summary (Introduction)</strong></p><ul><li>Hydration is the process of attaching React's event listeners and state to server-rendered HTML.</li><li>React 19 brings major improvements to make hydration more efficient, flexible, and performant.</li><li>This guide covers the core concepts, practical implementation, best practices, debugging tips, and a look to the future of hydration.</li></ul></blockquote><p>When we talk about  in React, we're referring to the process of making a server-rendered HTML page interactive by attaching React's event listeners and state. Without hydration, the HTML rendered by the server remains static—users can see the page but can't interact with it.</p><p>Hydration bridges the gap between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and client-side interactivity. Instead of reloading the entire page, React attaches event handlers to pre-rendered elements, restoring state and making them functional.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Section Summary (What is Hydration?)</strong></p><ul><li>Hydration attaches event listeners and state to a pre-rendered HTML page.</li><li>It allows for interactive UI without forcing a full client-side re-render.</li><li>This results in faster initial loads and better SEO.</li></ul></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  How Hydration Works in React\n</h3><p>Hydration happens in three key steps:</p><ol><li><ul><li>The application is pre-rendered on the server.</li><li>The server sends fully structured HTML to the client.</li><li>Users see the page instantly, even before hydration begins.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>React loads the JavaScript bundle and compares it to the pre-rendered HTML.</li><li>It attaches event listeners without re-rendering the entire UI.</li><li>The app becomes interactive while maintaining the pre-rendered layout.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>React's virtual DOM takes over, allowing state changes and user interactions.</li><li>The component tree is fully functional, just like a client-rendered app.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Example: Hydration in a Server-Rendered React App</strong></p><p>Imagine we have a simple Next.js app where we pre-render a button component on the server:</p><p><strong>Server-Side Component (Button.js)</strong></p><div><pre><code>\n      Click Me\n    </code></pre></div><p><strong>Page Component (index.js)</strong></p><div><pre><code>Welcome to My SSR React App</code></pre></div><p>When this page is requested, Next.js will generate the HTML on the server:</p><div><pre><code>Welcome to My SSR React AppClick Me</code></pre></div><p>At this stage, the button is visible but non-interactive because the event listener hasn't been attached yet.</p><p><p>\nOnce the JavaScript loads in the browser, React attaches event listeners to the pre-rendered HTML, making the button functional. Now, clicking the button triggers the alert.</p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Section Summary (How Hydration Works)</strong></p><ul><li>SSR sends fully structured HTML to the client.</li><li>Once the JS bundle loads, React attaches listeners to the existing DOM (hydration).</li><li>Interactivity follows without forcing a complete re-render.</li></ul></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why is Hydration Important?\n</h3><p>Hydration bridges the gap between server and client by making the page interactive without re-rendering the entire DOM. This approach has several key benefits:</p><ul><li>: Users see server-rendered content instantly.</li><li>: Search engines can crawl pre-rendered content.</li><li><strong>Better performance on slow networks</strong>: Content is visible sooner, instead of waiting for JavaScript to load.</li></ul><p>However, hydration isn't perfect—it can cause issues like performance bottlenecks, hydration mismatches, and unnecessary JavaScript execution. That's exactly what React 19 aims to improve.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problems with Hydration Before React 19\n</h2><p>Before React 19, hydration had several inefficiencies that affected performance:</p><ol><li><p><p>\nIn React 18, hydration was all-or-nothing: the entire page needed to hydrate before any part became interactive, often delaying interactivity on large apps.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Unnecessary JavaScript Execution</strong><p>\nThe browser re-ran React's rendering logic for the same UI that was already generated by the server, wasting CPU cycles.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Hydration Mismatch Errors</strong><p>\nDifferences in server-generated HTML and client-side rehydration caused unexpected UI mismatches, forcing React to re-render sections unnecessarily.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nLarge applications with thousands of components had long hydration times, delaying interactivity.</p></p></li><li><p><p>\nIn previous versions, React attached event listeners only after the entire hydration finished, leading to noticeable delays before UI elements responded.</p></p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Need for Hydration Improvements in React 19\n</h3><p>With all these issues, it was clear that React needed a better approach to hydration—one that:</p><ul><li>Makes hydration non-blocking (so parts of the page load faster).</li><li>Reduces unnecessary JavaScript execution.</li><li>Handles hydration mismatches gracefully.</li><li>Improves performance for large-scale applications.</li></ul><p>That's exactly what React 19 brings to the table. In the next section, I'll cover the major hydration enhancements in React 19 and how they solve these issues.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Section Summary (Problems &amp; Need for Improvements)</strong></p><ul><li>Old hydration approaches were blocking, repetitive, and prone to mismatches.</li><li>React 19 introduces non-blocking, selective, and more efficient hydration methods.</li></ul></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  React 19 Hydration Enhancements\n</h3><p>With the release of React 19, hydration is now faster, smarter, and more efficient. The improvements focus on prioritizing hydration where it matters, reducing JavaScript execution, and eliminating unnecessary re-renders. Let's look at how React 19 solves the issues we discussed earlier.</p><ol><li><strong>Selective Hydration – Prioritize Critical Components First</strong>\nIn React 18, hydration was a blocking process—nothing was interactive until hydration completed. React 19 introduces , which allows React to prioritize interactive elements first, ensuring a faster user experience.</li></ol><ul><li>Instead of hydrating all components at once, React 19 hydrates visible and interactive elements first.\n</li><li>Non-essential UI elements hydrate later in the background, preventing delays in user interaction.</li></ul><p><strong>Example: Prioritizing Hydration for Input Fields</strong></p><div><pre><code>Product DetailsLoading comments...Loading reviews...</code></pre></div><p>: React hydrates the comment input first, while the reviews section hydrates later when needed, improving performance.</p><ol><li><strong>Progressive Hydration – Hydrate UI in Stages</strong>\nIn previous versions, React had to hydrate all components before any interaction. With , React 19 hydrates UI elements in steps, preventing CPU spikes and delays.</li></ol><ul><li>Essential UI elements hydrate first (buttons, forms, menus).\n</li><li>Lower-priority elements hydrate progressively, avoiding unnecessary CPU load.</li></ul><p><strong>Example: Delaying Hydration of Sidebar Components</strong></p><div><pre><code>DashboardLoading sidebar...</code></pre></div><p>: Instead of hydrating the entire page at once, React 19 prioritizes key UI components, making the app feel more responsive.</p><ol><li><strong>Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense</strong>\nReact 19 enhances streaming server rendering (SSR), allowing React to send and hydrate content in structured batches.</li></ol><ul><li>React sends high-priority content first (e.g., navigation, buttons).\n</li><li>Other elements stream progressively, reducing page load time.</li></ul><p><strong>Example: Streaming Hydration for Product Pages</strong></p><div><pre><code>Product PageLoading product details...Loading reviews...</code></pre></div><p>: Product details appear first, while reviews hydrate later, ensuring a faster perceived load time.</p><ol><li><strong>Server Components Reduce Hydration Needs</strong>\nReact 19 introduces <strong>React Server Components (RSC)</strong>, which eliminate hydration for static UI sections.</li></ol><p><strong>Example: Using Server Components for Static Content</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Since React renders this component fully on the server, it never hydrates in the browser, reducing JavaScript execution.</p><p><strong>React 19 Hydration Enhancements: Summary Table</strong></p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Entire app hydrated at once</td><td>Hydrates only visible/interactive elements</td></tr><tr><td>Hydration blocks page load</td><td>Hydration happens in background</td></tr><tr><td>Hydration blocks user interaction</td><td>Hydration is prioritized in chunks</td></tr><tr><td>Everything needs hydration</td><td>Server components reduce hydration needs</td></tr></tbody></table></div><blockquote><p><strong>Section Summary (React 19 Enhancements)</strong></p><ul><li>Selective Hydration: Hydrate critical elements first.</li><li>Progressive Hydration: Spread hydration over time to avoid CPU spikes.</li><li>Streaming SSR: Send and hydrate content in structured batches.</li><li>Server Components: Eliminate hydration for static sections entirely.</li></ul></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Practical Implementation: Hydration in a React 19 Project\n</h2><p>Now that we've covered how React 19 optimizes hydration, it's time to put this knowledge into action. In this section, I'll walk you through setting up a React 19 project with proper hydration techniques. We'll be using  as an example framework to illustrate these concepts.</p><blockquote><p>: At the time of writing, Next.js 14 is a hypothetical or future release. Some features mentioned may still be experimental or subject to change, but this outline demonstrates how upcoming versions of Next.js could fully leverage React 19 features.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Setting Up a React 19 Project with Next.js 14\n</h3><p>Before we dive into the hydration techniques, let's set up a Next.js 14 project to take full advantage of React 19's hydration enhancements.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install Next.js 14 with React 19</strong></p><div><pre><code>npx create-next-app@latest react-hydration-demo\nreact-hydration-demo\n</code></pre></div><p>Next, open the project and ensure your dependencies use React 19:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Implementing Selective Hydration in Next.js 14\n</h3><p>Let's start with , where we only hydrate necessary components first.</p><p><strong>Example: Hydrating User Input Fields Before Other Components</strong></p><p>Here, we have a simple blog page where the comment input hydrates first while the rest of the UI loads progressively.</p><p><strong>components/CommentBox.js (Client Component)</strong></p><div><pre><code>\n        Submit\n      </code></pre></div><p><strong>pages/blog.js (Server + Client Hybrid)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>The  is server-rendered (no hydration needed).\n</li><li>The  hydrates immediately so users can type right away.\n</li><li>Other UI components can hydrate later, improving performance.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Implementing Progressive Hydration\n</h3><p>Next, let's delay hydration for non-essential components using  and .</p><p><strong>Example: Hydrating Non-Critical Content on Scroll</strong></p><p>Suppose we have a list of product reviews that appear lower on the page. Instead of hydrating them immediately, we can defer hydration until the user scrolls down.</p><div><pre><code>Product DetailsHere are the product details...Loading reviews...</code></pre></div><ul><li>The product details render instantly.\n</li><li>The  component only hydrates when needed, preventing hydration bottlenecks.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense\n</h3><p>React 19 makes it easier to <strong>stream server-rendered content</strong> while hydrating it progressively.</p><p><strong>Example: Streaming Product Details While Hydrating Reviews</strong></p><p>With Streaming SSR, we can send critical UI to the client first, then progressively hydrate the rest.</p><div><pre><code>Product PageLoading product details...Loading reviews...</code></pre></div><ul><li>Product details stream first, improving perceived performance.\n</li><li>Reviews hydrate later, reducing JavaScript execution overhead.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Server Components to Reduce Hydration Needs\n</h3><p>React 19 allows  to reduce hydration needs altogether, making applications even more efficient.</p><p><strong>Example: A Product Page Using Server Components</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>This component never hydrates on the client—React renders it fully on the server.\n</li><li>Less JavaScript runs in the browser, improving performance.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Section Summary (Practical Implementation)</strong></p><ul><li>Use  to force immediate hydration on essential components.</li><li>Lazy load non-critical components and hydrate them selectively.</li><li>Stream SSR content in batches with .</li><li>Server Components eliminate hydration altogether for static sections.</li></ul></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Hydration Best Practices &amp; Debugging Issues in React 19\n</h2><p>Now that we've covered how to implement hydration in React 19, let's focus on best practices to ensure optimal performance and common debugging techniques to fix hydration-related issues. Even though React 19 introduces Selective Hydration, Progressive Hydration, and Server Components, incorrect usage can still lead to performance bottlenecks or mismatches.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Efficient Hydration\n</h3><ol><li><strong>Use Server Components Where Possible</strong>\nOne of the best ways to reduce hydration overhead is to minimize client components. The more logic that stays on the server, the less JavaScript is needed in the browser.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Server Components don't require hydration.\n</li><li>Ideal for static or database-driven content that doesn't need dynamic updates in the browser.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Hydrate Interactive Components First</strong>\nIf a component requires user interaction, it should hydrate immediately, while non-essential components can hydrate later.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>Product DetailsLoading comments...Loading reviews...</code></pre></div><ul><li> hydrates immediately so users can interact.\n</li><li> hydrates later, improving performance.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Use Lazy Loading to Defer Non-Critical Components</strong>\nUse  to load non-essential components only when needed.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>Product DetailsLoading reviews...</code></pre></div><ul><li> won't hydrate until the user scrolls down.\n</li><li>Faster page loads, lower CPU usage.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Minimize Hydration Mismatches</strong>\nA hydration mismatch occurs when the server-generated HTML doesn't match the client-rendered output.

But where is hydration heading next? What advancements can we expect in React 20 and beyond? Let's explore the future of hydration and how it might evolve.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Fully Streaming React Applications\n</h3><ul><li>Future React versions may allow components to be hydrated in real time as data streams in.</li><li>Server-side event binding might reduce client-side work further.</li><li>Edge rendering could play a bigger role in hydrating UI closer to the user.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  AI-Assisted Hydration Optimization\n</h3><ul><li>React's compiler could analyze hydration needs dynamically.</li><li>AI models might predict which components need faster hydration.</li><li>Automatic lazy-loading and prioritization based on user behavior.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Hybrid Hydration with WebAssembly (WASM)\n</h3><ul><li>Offload parts of the hydration process to precompiled WASM modules for increased performance.</li><li>Potential for near-instant hydration of large-scale applications.</li></ul><ul><li>Hydration could be processed at the nearest data center, reducing latency.</li><li>Even less JavaScript execution on the client.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Full Support for Suspense and Server Components\n</h3><ul><li>Future React versions may integrate Suspense and Server Components more deeply.</li><li>Possibly remove client-side hydration entirely for certain UI sections.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Section Summary (Future of Hydration)</strong></p><ul><li>Expect continued refinement of streaming, selective, and AI-driven hydration.</li><li>WASM and edge computing might further reduce client-side overhead.</li><li>Server Components and Suspense will likely see deeper integration.</li></ul></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Hydration in React 19 – A Game Changer\n</h2><p>Hydration has been a major challenge for React developers, but  introduces powerful optimizations that make it faster, more efficient, and easier to manage.</p><ul><li> ensures only critical UI components hydrate first.</li><li> spreads hydration over time, preventing performance bottlenecks.</li><li><strong>Streaming Server Rendering</strong> with Suspense makes SSR hydration much smoother.</li><li> reduce hydration needs entirely.</li><li> help identify and fix hydration mismatches easily.</li></ul><p>If you're working on Next.js (version 14 or beyond) or any SSR-based React app, start leveraging React 19's hydration optimizations today.

However, when migrating an existing React project to TypeScript, you may not want to drop JavaScript support entirely. This guide walks you through the minimal changes required to enable TypeScript in a React.js project while still allowing JavaScript files to coexist.  </p><h2><strong>1. Install Required Dependencies</strong></h2><p>To get started, install TypeScript and the necessary type definitions:</p><div><pre><code>npm  typescript @babel/preset-typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom\n</code></pre></div><p>Additionally, add a script in  to check for TypeScript errors without emitting compiled files:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2><strong>2. Add a TypeScript Configuration File</strong></h2><p>Create a  file in the root of your project with the following settings:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> → Allows JavaScript files to be used alongside TypeScript.\n</li><li> → Prevents TypeScript from generating output files since we use Babel.\n</li><li> → Ensures JSX syntax is correctly processed.\n</li><li> → Enables TypeScript's strict type-checking for better reliability.\n</li></ul><p>If your project contains a , delete it to prevent conflicts.  </p><h2><strong>3. Add TypeScript Declaration for React</strong></h2><p>Create a new file inside the  folder and name it . Add the following content:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This helps TypeScript understand  module imports correctly.  </p><h2><strong>4. Start Using TypeScript Files</strong></h2><p>Now, you can begin converting JavaScript files () to TypeScript ( or ). You don't have to migrate everything at once—TypeScript and JavaScript files can coexist.  </p><h3><strong>Importing JavaScript in TypeScript</strong></h3><p>You can import JavaScript files into TypeScript just like before:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3><strong>Importing TypeScript in JavaScript</strong></h3><p>Similarly, you can import TypeScript files in JavaScript without issues:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This makes it easy to migrate incrementally without breaking the existing codebase.  </p><p>Once TypeScript is integrated, you can check for type errors without affecting the build process:</p><p>If everything is set up correctly, the project should continue to work as expected while allowing both TypeScript and JavaScript files.  </p><p>By following these steps, you've successfully added TypeScript to your React.js project without losing JavaScript compatibility. This approach allows a smooth transition to TypeScript, enabling better type safety while maintaining existing functionality. 🚀  </p>","contentLength":2226,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Future of JavaScript Frameworks: React vs Vue.js","url":"https://dev.to/alighasemi889/the-future-of-javascript-frameworks-react-vs-vuejs-dnj","date":1740122644,"author":"founder of codemaster","guid":8450,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, JavaScript frameworks have become the backbone of modern web applications. Among the most popular and widely used frameworks are React and Vue.js. Both have garnered large communities, have their unique features, and have sparked debates over which one is the best choice for developers. But what does the future hold for these frameworks? Which one will dominate the web development space in the coming years?</p><p>Let’s dive into a comparison between React and Vue.js, their current status, and what we can expect for their futures</p><p>Overview of React and Vue.js:</p><p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. It has been around since 2013 and quickly became one of the most popular front-end technologies. React introduced the concept of a virtual DOM, which improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM. React’s component-based architecture and its declarative style of programming have made it a favorite among developers for building complex, large-scale applications.</p><p>Vue.js, on the other hand, is a progressive JavaScript framework developed by Evan You in 2014. Vue is designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use as much or as little of it as needed. Vue emphasizes simplicity and flexibility, providing a gentle learning curve while still being powerful enough for building large-scale applications. It also offers features like a reactive data-binding system, component-based architecture, and a virtual DOM, similar to React.</p><p>** React: The Strong Contender**</p><p>React has established itself as the industry standard for front-end development, with many high-profile companies, including Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, and Airbnb, relying on it for their user interfaces. Its success can be attributed to several factors:</p><div><pre><code>Large Ecosystem: React has a massive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and extensions. With tools like React Router, Redux, and Next.js, React makes it easier to build dynamic, scalable applications.\n\nStrong Community: React has a very active and extensive community that contributes to the library’s growth. The number of resources, tutorials, and plugins available is vast, making it easy for developers to find solutions to their problems.\n\nPerformance: React’s virtual DOM allows it to efficiently update only the parts of the web page that need changing, improving performance, especially in large applications with heavy user interaction.\n\nCorporate Backing: Facebook’s continued investment in React ensures its ongoing development and long-term stability. React is continuously updated with new features, such as React Hooks, which simplify state management and make code more modular.\n</code></pre></div><p>Looking ahead, React is expected to maintain its dominance in the web development world. With ongoing improvements to performance and usability, along with an ever-growing ecosystem, React will continue to be a powerful choice for developers. React's future also includes server-side rendering improvements, React Server Components, and continued enhancements to its ecosystem.</p><p>** Vue.js: The Rising Star**</p><p>Vue.js has gained tremendous popularity in recent years, especially among developers who value its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration into existing projects. Vue’s philosophy of \"progressive\" framework adoption means developers can use it for small parts of their application or adopt it for building full-scale applications, making it a versatile tool.</p><div><pre><code>Ease of Learning: One of Vue's standout features is its gentle learning curve. Developers who are familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can quickly get started with Vue without a steep learning curve. This makes it an attractive option for developers transitioning into the world of front-end frameworks.\n\nFlexibility and Simplicity: Vue provides a simple and flexible API, allowing developers to use it in a way that best fits their needs. Whether you're building a small widget or a large enterprise application, Vue scales well without overwhelming developers with complex configurations.\n\nIntegration: Vue can be easily integrated with existing projects. If you are working on a legacy application or a small project, Vue’s flexibility allows you to use it in pieces without having to completely refactor your existing code.\n\nPerformance: Vue’s performance is on par with React. Its virtual DOM, along with a reactive data-binding system, ensures that updates are efficient and fast.\n</code></pre></div><p>Vue.js is growing at a rapid pace and has a strong and passionate community. Given its ease of use, flexibility, and robust feature set, Vue is expected to continue its growth in the future, especially in the areas of:</p><div><pre><code>Vue 3: The new version of Vue introduces major improvements, such as Composition API, better performance, and a more flexible architecture. It is expected that Vue 3 will increase adoption among large companies and enterprise-level projects.\nEcosystem Growth: The Vue ecosystem is rapidly expanding with tools like Nuxt.js for server-side rendering, Vuex for state management, and Vuetify for UI components.\n</code></pre></div><p>** React vs. Vue.js: Which One Will Dominate?**</p><p>While both React and Vue.js are excellent choices, each has its strengths and weaknesses, and the future of both frameworks will depend on various factors.\nReact's Strengths:</p><div><pre><code>A massive ecosystem with libraries and tools built around it.\nWide adoption by large companies, ensuring long-term support and investment.\nStrong community and corporate backing (Facebook).\nGreat for building large, complex applications.\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Simplicity and a gentle learning curve.\nIdeal for developers looking for an easy-to-use framework with flexibility.\nBetter suited for smaller teams and projects where development speed is important.\nGrowing ecosystem and community.\n</code></pre></div><p>React is likely to maintain its lead in large-scale enterprise applications, given its widespread adoption, corporate backing, and comprehensive ecosystem. However, Vue.js is quickly gaining ground as the framework of choice for small to medium-sized projects, thanks to its simplicity and ease of integration. With the release of Vue 3, Vue.js is poised to be a major player in the web development landscape.</p><p>Both React and Vue.js offer a powerful set of tools for building modern web applications. React’s dominance in the market, combined with its performance and large ecosystem, ensures that it will continue to be a key player in the development world. On the other hand, Vue.js is emerging as a strong competitor, especially with the release of Vue 3 and its increasing adoption among developers who prioritize simplicity and flexibility.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice between React and Vue.js will depend on your project requirements, team size, and familiarity with the framework. But rest assured, both frameworks are here to stay and will play a pivotal role in the future of front-end web development</p>","contentLength":6950,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Install LAMP stack on Ubuntu","url":"https://dev.to/seongbae/install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-15f","date":1740122596,"author":"Seong Bae","guid":8449,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This post is to save in one place all the commands used to build LAMP stack on a Ubuntu server.

The authorization decision was based on the roles users held, represented by Cognito groups, with the permissions mapped in a DynamoDB table.</p><p>When running a PEP and PDP setup in a multi-tenant SaaS solution we for sure need something more powerful than a DynamoDB table with permissions. Therefor in this part we will look at using Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) as the foundation in our PDP. Which would serve as an great choice to do Authorization in SaaS.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Amazon Verified Permissions?\n</h2><p>Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) is a fully managed service that simplifies the implementation of fine-grained access control in our applications. AVP acts as a central Policy Decision Point (PDP), where it evaluates policies and makes authorization decisions based on the attributes of the request, user roles, and similar. It doesn't only support role-based access control (RBAC), but AVP also supports attribute-based access control (ABAC) and other dynamic policies, allowing for more flexible and granular authorization decisions.</p><p>With AVP, our Lambda function (acting as the PDP) no longer has to manually parse and evaluate policies, and we don’t need to store permission mapping in a DynamoDB table. Instead, we define and manage our policies directly in AVP, which then makes the authorization decision for us.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Alternatives Open Source solution to AVP\n</h3><p>While AVP is an excellent choice for applications specially if they run in AWS, it’s not the only solution for implementing fine-grained authorization. One alternative is <a href=\"https://www.osohq.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oso</a>, an open-source authorization framework designed to provide flexible, policy-based access control. Oso allows us to define authorization logic in a declarative language and integrates with our applications across various environments. Choosing between AVP and Oso depends on our specific use case, infrastructure etc.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Caching authorization decisions\n</h2><p>Now that we have looked at using AVP as a central part of our PDP, we should think about caching. There are pros and cons against caching, for example AWS IAM never cache any decision which ensure that updates to policies are reflected immediately. With a cache we can reduce the number of calls to AVP and by that reduce cost. We can also either cache decisions in the client or in our backend systems. I will not go in to deep in this topic more than that in this solution we will use an external cache in our backend system. The cache will be placed in DynamoDB. The reason to cache in an external source, like DynamoDB, instead of in Lambda function memory, is for all invocations of the Lambda function to benefit from the cache. With a cache like this we would need a way to clear the cache if a permission set for a user is changed. I will not implement any cache invalidation mechanism in this post.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding AVP and the Cedar Policy Language\n</h2><p>Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) uses <a href=\"https://www.cedarpolicy.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cedar</a>, a purpose-built, policy-as-code language designed for fine-grained authorization. Cedar enables us to define and enforce access control policies that dictate who can perform what actions on which resources.</p><p>Cedar policies are declarative, meaning they explicitly state the permissions without requiring procedural logic. They are designed to be easy to read while supporting powerful conditions and attribute-based access control (ABAC).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Basic Cedar Policy Example\n</h3><p>Let's start with a simple RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policy that allows users in the  group to perform certain actions on all resources</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This policy means that any  (user) who belongs to the UserGroup  is permitted to perform the listed actions on all resources, since resource is not restricted.</p><p>A second example, where we lean towards a ABAC method would be.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This means that users in  can view photos when the photo has the  tag.</p><p>In a multi-tenant SaaS system, we might want to restrict access to data belonging to a specific tenant. Cedar allows attribute-based conditions for this.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This ensures that the user can only view resources that belong to the same tenant.</p><p>In the implementation for our AVP based PDP we will use RBAC and policy similar to the first example.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using AVP for scalable and flexible access control\n</h2><p>By integrating (AVP) as part of our central PDP, we have simplified our policy management and enhanced the scalability and flexibility of the authorization system. AVP’s support for dynamic policies, and fine-grained access control are powerful tools for any SaaS application.</p><p>With the introduction to AVP let's convert our PDP to use AVP for Role Based Access (RBAC) instead of a DynamoDB permission mapping. We will just deploy a second PDP into our solution and the swap so our PEP use the new PDP based on AVP instead. This entire setup is based on the solution introduced in part one, <a href=\"https://jimmydqv.com/pdp-and-pep-in-aws/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PEP and PDP for Secure Authorization with Cognito,</a>, and as prerequisite that solution should be deployed. You find the entire solution on <a href=\"https://serverless-handbook.com/auth-pep-pdp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Serverless Handbook PEP and PDP</a>.</p><p>Looking at the overview of the architecture and call flow we can see that there is not any major changes, but instead of fetching a permission mapping from DynamoDB we will call AVP and let the service use it's policy engine to allow/deny decision.</p><p>To better understand the flow during an API access.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setup and deploy AVP based PDP\n</h2><p>First we need to deploy all the resources needed by AVP, what we need to do is to create a  with our policy schema. The  for our three different Roles with a Cedar based policy to determine what the Role has permission to do, and we need to setup our .</p><p>This template can be fairly long as the Cedar polices and schema tend to be rather huge. So parts of this template has been left out, therefor visit <a href=\"https://serverless-handbook.com/auth-pep-pdp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Serverless Handbook PEP and PDP</a> for the full template.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The PDP Lambda will get the , , and  from the PEP, our Lambda Authorizer in the API Gateway. The function will get the , the subject, from the JWT-Token and see if there is a cached decision. If there is not it will call AVP with all information to get an authorization decision.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Update PEP to use AVP Based PDP\n</h2><p>To update our PEP to use the new AVP based PDP instead of the DynamoDB based, navigate to the  folder and modify the  file, update the value of PDP to <code>PDPStackName=pep-pdp-cognito-pdp-auth-service-avp</code> then redeploy the API part of the solution. This will now swap the PDP that is used.</p><p>To test the setup of AVP we can navigate to the AVP part of the console.</p><p>Under Policy Stores you should see the policy store that was created for our PDP.</p><p>By clicking on the ID of the policy store and selecting  in the menu we see the list of the three created policies.</p><p>By selecting the Riders policy we can now inspect the create policy.</p><p>By selecting  in the menu we can inspect the created schema in a visual form.</p><p>Now, we can navigate to the  to test out our policies, fill in the information as shown in the image below. The group must be prefixed with the Cognito User Pool Id and follow pattern <code>&lt;COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID&gt;|&lt;GROUP_NAME&gt;</code></p><p>If we select the action  and click <code>Run Authorization request</code> we should get a deny back, as the  role don't have access to that </p><p>Swapping to the  action should instead give us an allow back.</p><p>Implementing PEP and PDP in our authorization flow offers a highly scalable, flexible, and secure way to control access to resources. By leveraging AWS Lambda and API Gateway, we can build a serverless authorization system that separates authentication and authorization concerns, scales with demand, and simplifies policy management.</p><p>With the addition of Role-Based Access Control and Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP), combined with caching for enhanced performance, we can create an authorization solution that fits both current and future needs. Using AVP in our SaaS solutions give us a very powerful way to handle multi tenancy.</p><p>Happy coding, and stay secure!</p><p>Don't forget to follow me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dahlqvistjimmy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/jimmydahlqvist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">X</a> for more content, and read rest of my <a href=\"https://jimmydqv.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blogs</a></p><p>As Werner says!

Many organizations begin by using namespaces to isolate workloads, teams, or projects. However, they soon encounter limitations, such as challenges with custom resource deployments, security, and per-tenant configurations.</p><p>In short, multi-tenancy is essential for cost savings, enabling multiple tenants to share a single host cluster, preventing cluster sprawl, and reducing the maintenance efforts associated with managing multiple Kubernetes clusters.</p><p>With this in mind, the easiest and most effective way to implement multi-tenancy is by creating virtual Kubernetes clusters using vCluster. Instead of taking the \"\" approach, we recommend the \"\" model, where each virtual cluster has its own isolated control plane.</p><p>One of the key things we want to highlight in this post is the concept of a shared platform stack. Let’s first understand what that means.</p><p>A major challenge in Kubernetes multi-tenancy, or Kubernetes in general, is the duplication of applications installed across multiple Kubernetes clusters.</p><p>Let’s break this down with an example:</p><p>Imagine three teams: A, B, and C, each needing their own Kubernetes cluster. As administrators, we create three separate Kubernetes clusters. By default, a newly created cluster only runs the essential components needed for Kubernetes itself, such as the control plane components, the cloud controller manager etc.</p><p>Now, if all three teams need to deploy applications with HTTPS support, the typical approach is to install an Ingress Controller and cert-manager. Each team then creates Deployments, Services, Ingress, and Certificate objects. However, since these components need to be installed on every cluster separately, this results in duplicate resources.</p><p>This duplication problem also exists in multi-tenancy. One of the biggest challenges in Kubernetes multi-tenancy is the . Ideally, we should be able to reuse resources from the host cluster instead of installing cert-manager and an Ingress Controller in every new cluster.</p><p>The easiest way to solve this problem is by using virtual clusters (vClusters). With vCluster, you can define in the cluster configuration file which resources should be synced from the host cluster, allowing multiple tenants to share platform resources. This optimizes resource utilization and eliminates unnecessary duplication.</p><p>This concept of a shared platform stack in a multi-tenant Kubernetes environment using virtual clusters helps organizations efficiently manage resources.</p><p>Now, let’s see this in action with an end-to-end example where we install cert-manager and an Nginx Ingress Controller on the host cluster and then create a vCluster that reuses these host cluster resources.</p><p>We will have a Kubernetes cluster with some tools installed on the host cluster, as mentioned in the image above, and then use those inside virtual clusters.</p><p>Before we dive in, ensure you have the following:</p><ul><li>  A Kubernetes cluster with admin access</li><li>  The latest version of the  installed</li><li> installed in the  cluster</li><li>  Nginx ingress controlled installed in the  cluster</li><li>  Basic understanding of Kubernetes resources like Ingress and Services</li></ul><ul><li>  Install vCluster CLI on a Linux system follow the below command.

Proper exception management is crucial to keeping operations running smoothly, minimizing cost loss, and satisfying customers. This blog discusses real-world approaches to manage exceptions well and ensure a robust and efficient supply chain.</p><p> is concerned with managing unforeseen interruptions that may impact the smooth flow of goods. Such interruptions may be caused by adverse weather, customs clearance delays, low transport capacity, or documentation errors. When such problems arise, they may result in delayed shipments, higher costs, and inefficiencies in operations.</p><p>In order to efficiently deal with such challenges, the companies must have an efficient process. It encompasses determining likely risks, analyzing why the disruption happens, and resolving the disruptions swiftly by taking remedial action. There should be effective communication between all the involved parties like the shippers, carriers, and customs brokers so that there will be minimum delay.</p><p>By adopting a proactive strategy, companies can minimize downtime, enhance decision-making, and guarantee that the shipments arrive on time. Sound exception management does not only support reliability but also preserves customer trust, thus representing an essential aspect of freight forwarding operations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Strategies for Effective Exception Management\n</h2><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Enhance Shipment Visibility with Real-Time Tracking\n</h2><p>Modern freight forwarding relies on  and detect potential disruptions. Technologies such as GPS tracking, IoT sensors, and AI-powered analytics allow logistics providers to anticipate and address issues before they escalate. Platforms like SupplyHoop offer end-to-end visibility, enabling immediate corrective actions when problems arise.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Utilize AI and Automation for Proactive Exception Handling\n</h2><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning can predict potential disruptions by analyzing past shipment data. Automated alert systems notify stakeholders about possible exceptions, allowing them to take preventive actions. AI-powered solutions also optimize route planning, reducing the likelihood of delays and disruptions in the supply chain.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Establish Strong Communication Channels\n</h2><p>Transparent and timely communication among all parties—freight forwarders, carriers, and customers—is crucial in managing exceptions effectively. Automated notifications, real-time updates, and live chat support keep all stakeholders informed. Clear communication fosters trust and helps in resolving issues collaboratively and efficiently.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Adopt a Management by Exception (MbE) Approach\n</h2><p>Management by Exception (MbE) focuses on automating routine processes while flagging only significant disruptions for manual intervention. This method ensures that logistics teams concentrate their efforts on critical issues, improving efficiency and reducing workload. By implementing MbE, freight forwarders can streamline exception management and focus on handling major disruptions effectively.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Develop Contingency Plans for Common Disruptions\n</h2><p>Freight forwarders should have contingency plans in place for common challenges like weather-related delays, labor strikes, or customs rejections. These plans should include alternative transportation routes, backup carriers, and predefined protocols for different scenarios. Regularly reviewing and updating contingency plans ensures preparedness for unforeseen disruptions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Leverage Data Analytics for Predictive Exception Management\n</h2><p>Data analytics helps identify trends and patterns that cause exceptions. By analyzing shipment history and operational data, logistics companies can proactively address recurring issues and prevent future disruptions. Predictive analytics tools enable better decision-making and enhance exception management processes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Invest in Staff Training and Skill Development\n</h2><p>A well-trained workforce is vital for efficient exception management. Logistics teams should be equipped with skills in risk assessment, communication, and problem-solving. Conducting periodic training sessions and workshops prepares employees to handle disruptions confidently and efficiently.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Define and Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n</h2><p>Monitoring performance through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) helps assess the effectiveness of exception management strategies. Essential KPIs include exception resolution time, percentage of on-time deliveries, and frequency of disruptions. Analyzing these metrics allows companies to refine their approach and continuously improve operational efficiency.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  9. Build Strong Partnerships with Reliable Service Providers\n</h2><p>Freight forwarders should collaborate closely with trusted carriers, customs brokers, and technology providers to streamline exception handling. Strong partnerships ensure faster problem resolution, access to alternative shipping options, and greater supply chain flexibility, ultimately enhancing service reliability.</p><p>Effective exception management is crucial in freight forwarding to maintain efficiency and ensure customer satisfaction. By implementing real-time tracking, AI-powered automation, predictive analytics, and proactive communication, logistics companies can minimize disruptions and enhance service quality. A well-structured approach to managing exceptions ensures seamless freight forwarding operations, stronger client relationships, and a more resilient supply chain.</p>","contentLength":5622,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🚀 Stop Slowing Down Your Website!

It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. At that time, Lerdorf was a very famous Danish Canadian programmer. The mascot of PHP is an elephant, was designed by Vincent Pointier in 1998. If you put an outline on it, then something similar is the idea behind making the PHP logo an elephant. Over time, many variations of this mascot were made, but ultimately the original variant was adopted.</p><p>PHP developers started in 1994 when Lord of Personal Web Programming was looking at some CGI programs using the C programming language. He created these programs to manage his personal home base. He called it PHP, the language for creating relative personal home pages. But he extended this work and named it PHP Personal Homepage. That PHP, which we know today as a very famous programming language.</p><p>After this, PHP started being used to create simple dynamic web applications, and Lerdorf launched the first version of PHP in 1995. In this release, the basic functionalities of PHP were already present, some tools for form handling were there, and PHP had its own syntax. Many web developers benefited from this release. Its simple and limited consistent syntax increased developers' love for it, and people started having very positive vibes about PHP, which led them to start editing PHP.</p><p>From there, PHP evolution started growing rapidly. At that time, the craze for PHP was very high. People saw PHP in such a way that backend development had become very easy. The surprising thing is that Lerdorf never created PHP as a programming language. Due to its popularity and speed, it became so simple that after using PHP, people did not want to switch to another language.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Formation of PHP Development Team\n</h2><p>After PHP's massive growth, Lerdorf once said, \"I don’t know how to stop this. It is something that is growing in a positive direction. I never intended to create a programming language.\" These were some of Lerdorf's words. In November 1997, a development team was set up to work on the further development of PHP. As I told you, PHP never grew as a programming language, so a lot of inconsistencies came in its syntax and function names. Because of this, a development team was needed, and a standard was needed to standardize all these things. In 1997, Gutmans started working on PHP 3, and it was released in 1998. In 2000, PHP 4 was released, and its development continued after this.</p><p>PHP 4 was based on the Zend Engine. Later, PHP 5 was released with an updated version of the Zend Engine 2. Work on PHP 5 started in July 2004. PHP 5 was considered revolutionary because it introduced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and PHP Data Objects (PDO), which were new and highly useful features at that time. Developers were very excited about PHP 5.</p><p>After 2018, PHP 5 stopped receiving security updates. PHP 6 experimented with Unicode support, but it was never officially released. As a result, PHP 6 never came into existence. Work on PHP 7 began between 2014 and 2015. A debate arose among developers on whether to name it PHP 6 or PHP 7, since PHP 6 was never officially released. Finally, PHP 7 was released.</p><p>In 2020, PHP 8 was released as a stable version. However, PHP's popularity started declining. Developers began criticizing PHP, which led to significant improvements. A JIT compiler was added, and modern programming features were incorporated to keep PHP competitive with modern languages.</p><p>Let’s see how PHP’s syntax is written and how PHP is actually coded.\nThe \"Hello World\" program in PHP is written like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\necho \"Hello, World!\";\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>Comments exist in PHP. A comment means that any text you put inside your PHP file will not be executed.</p><p>For single-line comments, you will use this:</p><div><pre><code>// This is a single-line comment\n</code></pre></div><p>For multi-line comments, you can use this method if you want to see your comment in multiple lines:</p><div><pre><code>/*\nThis is a\nmulti-line comment\nin PHP\n*/\n</code></pre></div><p>Variables are like containers that store information.</p><p>The variables in PHP can be created like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$name = \"John\";\n$age = 25;\necho \"Name: $name, Age: $age\";\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Predefined Variables in PHP\n</h3><p>PHP has predefined variables like , , , and , which are used to handle user input, sessions, and cookies.</p><p>A string is a sequence of characters, and in PHP, a string can be created like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$string = \"Hello, PHP!\";\necho $string;\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integers and Floats in PHP\n</h3><p>Numbers can be used for arithmetic operations in PHP, and you can perform arithmetic operations on variables like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$num1 = 10;\n$num2 = 20;\n$sum = $num1 + $num2;\necho \"Sum: $sum\";\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>If you want to print information from any variable in PHP, you can use the \"echo\" function like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$message = \"Welcome to PHP!\";\necho $message;\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>This will print all the simple information you provide.</p><p>Arrays can be created in PHP like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$colors = array(\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\");\necho $colors[0]; // Output: Red\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conditional Statements in PHP\n</h3><p>In PHP, you can use conditional statements.\nYou can use \"if\" statements to execute a condition like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$age = 18;\nif ($age &gt;= 18) {\n    echo \"You are eligible to vote.\";\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>And if you want to write an \"else\" statement in PHP, it looks like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$age = 16;\nif ($age &gt;= 18) {\n    echo \"You are eligible to vote.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"You are not eligible to vote.\";\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>PHP supports switch statements, and the syntax is like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$day = \"Monday\";\nswitch ($day) {\n    case \"Monday\":\n        echo \"It's the start of the week.\";\n        break;\n    case \"Friday\":\n        echo \"Weekend is coming!\";\n        break;\n    default:\n        echo \"It's just another day.\";\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>Loops can be used in PHP.\nLoops mean that if you want to perform any action multiple times, you can use \"for\" and \"while\" loops like this.<p>\nThe \"for\" loop syntax in PHP is like this:</p></p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\nfor ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 5; $i++) {\n    echo \"Iteration: $i &lt;br&gt;\";\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>The \"while\" loop syntax in PHP is like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$i = 1;\nwhile ($i &lt;= 5) {\n    echo \"Iteration: $i &lt;br&gt;\";\n    $i++;\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>PHP also has a \"foreach\" loop, which allows you to iterate over arrays like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$fruits = array(\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\");\nforeach ($fruits as $fruit) {\n    echo \"$fruit &lt;br&gt;\";\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>Additionally, you can also use \"do-while\" loops in PHP like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n$i = 1;\ndo {\n    echo \"Iteration: $i &lt;br&gt;\";\n    $i++;\n} while ($i &lt;= 5);\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>PHP is an object-oriented programming language. Inside PHP, people can create objects through classes. A class is a blueprint because it is used to create objects, and an object is an instance of that class which is created using that template blueprint. If a class is a template, then an object is an instance made with the help of a blueprint.</p><p>Objects and Classes syntax can be written something like this:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;?php\n// Defining a class\nclass Car {\n    // Properties\n    public $brand;\n    public $color;\n\n    // Constructor method\n    public function __construct($brand, $color) {\n        $this-&gt;brand = $brand;\n        $this-&gt;color = $color;\n    }\n    // Method to display car details (using PHP_EOL for CLI compatibility)\n    public function displayInfo() {\n        echo \"Brand: \" . $this-&gt;brand . \", Color: \" . $this-&gt;color . PHP_EOL;\n    }\n}\n// Creating objects (instances) of the class\n$car1 = new Car(\"Toyota\", \"Red\");\n$car2 = new Car(\"Honda\", \"Blue\");\n// Calling methods on objects\n$car1-&gt;displayInfo();\n$car2-&gt;displayInfo();\n?&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>PHP is getting quite improved, and definitely evolving as a stable language. This simple to use, beginner-friendly language that people can use for the web. I hope you really liked this history of PHP and understood how to use PHP.</p>","contentLength":7679,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What was your win this week?","url":"https://dev.to/devteam/what-was-your-win-this-week-2pib","date":1740114000,"author":"Jess Lee","guid":8391,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Looking back on your week -- what was something you're proud of?</p><p>All wins count -- big or small 🎉</p><p>Examples of 'wins' include:</p><ul><li>Passing test suite on the first try</li><li>Writing a great README for a new project</li></ul>","contentLength":201,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Customizable Automation Workflows Using Callgoose SQIBS Unified Automation Platform","url":"https://dev.to/callgoose_sqibs/customizable-automation-workflows-using-callgoose-sqibs-unified-automation-platform-4ee9","date":1740112420,"author":"Callgoose SQIBS","guid":8408,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s fast-paced IT environments, automation is not just an advantage it’s a necessity.

As a Software Freestyle Engineer, I needed a way to automate routine tasks like sending daily updates, rotating team passwords, and managing group announcements without being tied to expensive platforms or complex coding. Other solutions demanded steep subscriptions, locked me into proprietary systems, or required technical know-how I simply didn’t have time to master (too lazy). That’s when I decided: <em>why not build my own tool and share it with everyone?</em> (look very kind and nice idea!)</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Breaking Point: “There Has to Be a Better Way”\n</h3><p>Every day, my workflow looked like this:</p><ul><li>Manually forwarding  from clients.</li><li>Copy-pasting  into multiple group chats.</li><li>Resetting  for team accounts (and praying I didn’t forget).</li></ul><p>I wasn’t alone. Many businesses, freelancers, and community admins face the same chaos. In my search for solutions, I found:</p><ul><li> (like Twilio’s API): Powerful, yet expensive and code-heavy.</li><li> (such as WATI or Chatfuel): User-friendly, but their subscription fees quickly add up.</li><li>: Customizable but time-consuming to maintain and fragile against WhatsApp updates.</li></ul><p>So I asked myself: <em>What if there was a free, open-source backend that anyone could adapt—no strings attached?</em></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Building Whatsback Web: A Tool for Myself (and You)\n</h3><p>I’m building Whatsback Web with whatsapp-web.js—a robust library that allows me to interact seamlessly with WhatsApp Web. This lets me harness powerful automation features without reinventing the wheel. I built Whatsback Web around three core principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple-Straightforward UI</strong>: Let User find and configure they needs.</li><li>: Host it yourself, control your data, and avoid vendor lock-in.</li><li>: Free forever, with no hidden fees or tiered pricing.</li></ul><p>For instance, I automated my team’s <strong>weekly password rotations</strong> by connecting Whatsback API (built-in) that integrated into another application script.  now  to responsible accounts, and <strong>scheduled group announcements</strong> go out—even if I’m offline. It’s like having a personal assistant that works 24/7 without costing a dime.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How It Stacks Up Against Other Tools\n</h3><p>Here’s a practical comparison:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pay-per-message + API fees</td></tr><tr><td>Full control (open-source)</td><td>Limited by platform features</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Developer expertise needed</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> Whatsback Web might not be as flashy as some paid tools, but it’s infinitely adaptable. Need to integrate with a niche app? You can do it. Concerned about privacy? Host it on your own hardware. It’s a toolkit designed to empower you, not a black box that dictates your workflow.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why I Open-Sourced It (And Why That Matters)\n</h3><p>I chose to open-source Whatsback Web for two key reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Community-Driven Innovation</strong>: Open-source projects thrive on collaboration. Developers can improve security, add integrations, or fix bugs that I might overlook.</li><li>: With no hidden trackers or data harvesting, you can review and audit the code yourself. Trust comes from openness.</li></ol><p>There’s also a personal side: sharing this project has connected me with developers around the globe, inspiring innovative use cases—like nonprofits using it to coordinate disaster relief updates.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Your Turn: Automate Without Limits\n</h3><p>Whatsback Web isn’t about being “the best” tool on the market—it’s about being the . It’s perfect for:</p><ul><li>Small businesses tired of paying for unnecessary features.</li><li>Tech-curious users eager to explore self-hosted solutions.</li><li>Developers looking for a customizable foundation to build upon.</li></ul><p>If you’ve ever thought, “I wish WhatsApp could just ,” then Whatsback Web is the tool for you. No permissions, no barriers—just endless possibilities.</p><p>If you find Whatsback Web valuable, consider supporting its ongoing development:</p><p>Your contributions help fuel new features, continuous improvements, and a vibrant community of contributors.</p><p><em>— A man who wanted fewer notifications and more sleep</em></p><p><em>P.S.

You can also configure your workspace settings, such as your font size, theme, and other preferences.</li><li>\nOnce your Codespace is set up, you can start coding. You can open files, edit code, and test your applications just as you would with a local development environment.</li><li>\nGithub Codespaces allows you to collaborate with others in real time. You can invite other developers to your Codespace, share your screen, and work on code together.</li><li>\nAs you work on your project, your changes are automatically saved to your Github repository. You can commit and push your changes just as you would with a local development environment.</li></ol><p>Github Codespaces is a powerful tool that can simplify the development process and improve collaboration among developers. By following these simple steps, you can start using Codespaces to create a cloud-hosted development environment for your projects.</p><p>The  file is a configuration file used by the Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension to define the development environment for a project. This file specifies the Docker image to be used as the development environment and any necessary extensions, settings, and dependencies.   </p><p>The  file was first introduced in November 2018 as part of the Visual Studio Code Remote Development extension pack, which enables developers to use containers, SSH, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a development environment. The goal of this extension was to make it easier for developers to set up and manage their development environments by leveraging containerization technology.   </p><p>Initially, the configuration options were limited to specifying the Docker image to be used for the development environment, along with some basic settings such as the workspace folder and user account information. However, over time, the capabilities of the  file have been expanded to include support for Docker Compose, port forwarding, environment variables, and more.   </p><p>Today, the  file has become a standard way of defining development environments for Visual Studio Code projects and is widely used by developers and organizations around the world. It provides a flexible and portable way to define and share development environments across different platforms and team members, making it easier to set up and maintain consistent development environments for your projects.   </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How to customize dev containers?\n</h3><p>Customizing dev containers in Github Codespaces can help you tailor your development environment to your specific needs. Here are some examples of how to customize dev containers in Github Codespaces:   </p><p><strong>Add or remove software packages:</strong><p>\n You can customize the list of software packages installed in your dev container. For example, if you're working on a Node.js project, you may want to install additional packages such as npm or yarn. You can either do this by adding the following command to the </p>:   </p><p><code># Probably not the best way RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \\ apt-get install -y npm yarn</code></p><p>Alternatively, you can add this line to your  file:   </p><p><code>\"features\": { \"ghcr.io/akhildevelops/devcontainer-features/apt:0\": { \"packages\": \"yarn,npm\" } }</code></p><p><strong>Add or remove npm packages:</strong><p>\n You can add npm packages to your dev container by using the </p><a href=\"https://github.com/devcontainers-contrib/features/tree/main/src/npm-package\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">npm-packages</a> feature and adding the following line to your  file:   </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How to speed up the boot time?\n</h3><p>Speeding up the boot time of Github Codespaces can help you get started with your development work faster. Here are some tips on how to speed up the boot time:</p><ol><li><strong>Use a smaller dev container:</strong>\nUsing a smaller dev container can help reduce the boot time. You can remove unnecessary packages and libraries that are not required for your project. This can be done by editing the Dockerfile in your dev container.</li><li>\nCaching can help reduce the time it takes to build your dev container. You can use the Docker layer caching mechanism to cache the results of frequently executed commands. This can be done by adding the appropriate commands to the Dockerfile.</li><li>\nIf you're working with a popular programming language or framework, there may be pre-built images available that you can use. This can help reduce the boot time since the image is already built and cached.</li><li>\nYou can optimize your workspace settings to improve the boot time. For example, you can disable unnecessary extensions or reduce the number of open files in your workspace.</li><li><strong>Use the \"Resume\" feature:</strong>\nGithub Codespaces has a \"Resume\" feature that allows you to resume your last session. This can help reduce the boot time since you don't need to set up your development environment from scratch every time.</li></ol><p>While Github Codespaces offers several benefits, there are also some limitations to consider:</p><ol><li>\nWhile Github Codespaces provides a lot of preconfigured development environments, there is limited customization available. This may not be an issue for most developers, but it can be a problem for those who require specific tools or configurations.</li><li>\nGithub Codespaces runs on shared hardware, which means that performance can be an issue, especially for resource-intensive applications. However, the performance is generally good, and it may not be a significant issue for most use cases.</li><li>\nGithub Codespaces is a cloud-based service, which means that you need an internet connection to access your development environment. This may not be a problem for most developers, but it can be an issue if you are working in a location with limited internet connectivity.</li><li>\nGithub Codespaces provides limited storage space for each user, which means that you may need to manage your storage carefully to avoid running out of space.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Can I use it with JetBrains IDEs or JupyterLab?\n</h3><p>Github Codespaces can be used with JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm.

The article and corresponding notebook demonstrated the fundamental concepts of , , , and . The example in our previous post, in contrast to OpenAI’s Deep Research, ran locally, using only open-source models and tools like <a href=\"https://milvus.io/docs?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milvus</a> and LangChain. (I encourage you to read the <a href=\"https://milvus.io/blog/i-built-a-deep-research-with-open-source-so-can-you.md?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">above article</a> before continuing.)&nbsp;</p><p>In the following weeks, there was an explosion of interest in understanding and reproducing OpenAI’s Deep Research. See, for example, <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perplexity Deep Research</a> and <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugging Face's Open DeepResearch</a>. These tools differ in architecture and methodology although sharing an objective: iteratively research a topic or question by surfing the web or internal documents and output a detailed, informed, and well-structured report. Importantly, the underlying agent automates reasoning about what action to take at each intermediate step.</p><p>In this post, we build upon our previous post and present Zilliz’s <a href=\"https://github.com/zilliztech/deep-searcher?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSearcher</a> open-source project. Our agent demonstrates additional concepts: <em>query routing, conditional execution flow</em>, and . It is presented as a Python library and command-line tool rather than a Jupyter notebook and is more fully-featured than our previous post. For example, it can input multiple source documents and can set the embedding model and vector database used via a configuration file. While still relatively simple, DeepSearcher is a great showcase of agentic RAG and is a further step towards a state-of-the-art AI applications.\n\\<p>\nAdditionally, we explore the need for faster and more efficient inference services. Reasoning models make use of “inference scaling”, that is, extra computation, to improve their output, and that combined with the fact that a single report may require hundreds or thousands of LLM calls results in inference bandwidth being the primary bottleneck. We use the </p><a href=\"https://sambanova.ai/press/fastest-deepseek-r1-671b-with-highest-efficiency?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model on SambaNova’s custom-built hardware</a>, which is twice as fast in output tokens-per-second as the nearest competitor (see figure below).</p><p>SambaNova Cloud also provides inference-as-a-service for other open-source models including Llama 3.x, Qwen2.5, and QwQ. The inference service runs on SambaNova’s custom chip called the reconfigurable dataflow unit (RDU), which is specially designed for efficient inference on Generative AI models, lowering cost and increasing inference speed. <a href=\"https://sambanova.ai/technology/sn40l-rdu-ai-chip?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find out more on their website.</a></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  DeepSearcher Architecture\n</h2><p>The architecture of <a href=\"https://github.com/zilliztech/deep-searcher?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSearcher</a> follows our previous post by breaking the problem up into four steps - <em>define/refine the question</em>, , ,  - although this time with some overlap. We go through each step, highlighting <a href=\"https://github.com/zilliztech/deep-searcher?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSearcher</a>’s improvements.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Define and Refine the Question\n</h3><div><pre><code>Break down the original query into new sub queries: [\n  'How has the cultural impact and societal relevance of The Simpsons evolved from its debut to the present?',\n  'What changes in character development, humor, and storytelling styles have occurred across different seasons of The Simpsons?', \n  'How has the animation style and production technology of The Simpsons changed over time?',\n  'How have audience demographics, reception, and ratings of The Simpsons shifted throughout its run?']\n</code></pre></div><p>In the design of DeepSearcher, the boundaries between researching and refining the question are blurred. The initial user query is decomposed into sub-queries, much like the previous post. See above for initial subqueries produced from the query “How has The Simpsons changed over time?”. However, the following research step will continue to refine the question as needed.</p><p>Having broken down the query into sub-queries, the research portion of the agent begins. It has, roughly speaking, four steps: , , <em>reflection, and conditional repeat</em>.</p><p>Our database contains multiple tables or collections from different sources. It would be more efficient if we could restrict our semantic search to only those sources that are relevant to the query at hand. A query router prompts an LLM to decide from which collections information should be retrieved.</p><p>Here is the method to form the query routing prompt:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We make the LLM return structured output as JSON in order to easily convert its output to a decision on what to do next.</p><p>Having selected various database collections via the previous step, the search step performs a similarity search with <a href=\"https://milvus.io/docs?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milvus</a>. Much like the previous post, the source data has been specified in advance, chunked, embedded, and stored in the vector database. For DeepSearcher, the data sources, both local and online, must be manually specified. We leave online search for future work.</p><p>Unlike the previous post, DeepSearcher illustrates a true form of agentic reflection, inputting the prior outputs as context into a prompt that “reflects” on whether the questions asked so far and the relevant retrieved chunks contain any informational gaps. This can be seen as an analysis step.</p><p>Here is the method to create the prompt:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once more, we make the LLM return structured output, this time as Python-interpretable data.</p><p>Here is an example of new sub-queries “discovered” by reflection after answering the initial sub-queries above:</p><div><pre><code>New search queries for next iteration: [\n  \"How have changes in The Simpsons' voice cast and production team influenced the show's evolution over different seasons?\",\n  \"What role has The Simpsons' satire and social commentary played in its adaptation to contemporary issues across decades?\",\n  'How has The Simpsons addressed and incorporated shifts in media consumption, such as streaming services, into its distribution and content strategies?']\n</code></pre></div><p>Unlike our previous post, DeepSearcher illustrates conditional execution flow. After reflecting on whether the questions and answers so far are complete, if there are additional questions to be asked the agent repeats the above steps. Importantly, the execution flow (a while loop) is a function of the LLM output rather than being hard-coded. In this case there is only a binary choice:  or . In more complex agents there may be several such as: , <em>retrieve chunks, store in memory, reflect</em> etc. In this way, the question continues to be refined as the agent sees fit until it decides to exit the loop and generate the report. In our Simpsons example, DeepSearcher performs two more rounds of filling the gaps with extra sub-queries.</p><p>Finally, the fully decomposed question and retrieved chunks are synthesized into a report with a single prompt. Here is the code to create the prompt:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This approach has the advantage over our prototype, which analyzed each question separately and simply concatenated the output, of producing a report where all sections are consistent with each other, i.e., containing no repeated or contradictory information. A more complex system could combine aspects of both, using a conditional execution flow to structure the report, summarize, rewrite, reflect and pivot, and so on, which we leave for future work.</p><p>Here is a sample from the report generated by the query “How has The Simpsons changed over time?” with DeepSeek-R1 passing the Wikipedia page on The Simpsons as source material:</p><div><pre><code>Report: The Evolution of The Simpsons (1989–Present)\n1. Cultural Impact and Societal Relevance\nThe Simpsons debuted as a subversive critique of American middle-class life, gaining notoriety for its bold satire in the 1990s. Initially a countercultural phenomenon, it challenged norms with episodes tackling religion, politics, and consumerism. Over time, its cultural dominance waned as competitors like South Park and Family Guy pushed boundaries further. By the 2010s, the show transitioned from trendsetter to nostalgic institution, balancing legacy appeal with attempts to address modern issues like climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, albeit with less societal resonance.\n…\nConclusion\nThe Simpsons evolved from a radical satire to a television institution, navigating shifts in technology, politics, and audience expectations. While its golden-age brilliance remains unmatched, its adaptability—through streaming, updated humor, and global outreach—secures its place as a cultural touchstone. The show’s longevity reflects both nostalgia and a pragmatic embrace of change, even as it grapples with the challenges of relevance in a fragmented media landscape.\n</code></pre></div><p>We presented <a href=\"https://github.com/zilliztech/deep-searcher?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSearcher</a>, an agent for performing research and writing reports. Our system is built upon the idea in our previous article, adding features like conditional execution flow, query routing, and an improved interface. We switched from local inference with a small 4-bit quantized reasoning model to an online inference service for the massive DeepSeek-R1 model, qualitatively improving our output report. DeepSearcher works with most inference services like OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek and Grok 3 (coming soon!).</p><p>Reasoning models, especially as used in research agents, are inference-heavy, and we were fortunate to be able to use the fastest offering of DeepSeek-R1 from SambaNova running on their custom hardware. For our demonstration query, we made sixty-five calls to SambaNova’s DeepSeek-R1 inference service, inputting around 25k tokens, outputting 22k tokens, and costing $0.30. We were impressed with the speed of inference given that the model contains 671-billion parameters and is 3/4 of a terabyte large. <a href=\"https://sambanova.ai/press/fastest-deepseek-r1-671b-with-highest-efficiency?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_channel=devto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find out more details here!</a></p><p>We will continue to iterate on this work in future posts, examining additional agentic concepts and the design space of research agents.

These small but mighty devices are found in a wide range of applications, from audio equipment to power supplies and everything in between. Among the many options on the market, the MCP602T-I/SN and MCP602T-I/S are two op-amps that often come up in discussions. But what’s the difference between the two, and which one is the right choice for your project?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into both op-amps, explore their specifications, applications, and help you figure out which one suits your needs the best.</p><p>Before diving into the specifics of the MCP602T-I/SN and MCP602T-I/S, let’s take a moment to understand what an operational amplifier, or op-amp, actually does.</p><p>An op-amp is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that is used to amplify electrical signals. It has two input terminals (inverting and non-inverting) and one output. Op-amps are essential in circuits where you need to amplify weak signals, such as audio signals or sensor data.</p><p>Think of an op-amp as a magnifying glass for electrical signals—just as a magnifying glass takes a small object and makes it larger and more visible, an op-amp takes a tiny electrical signal and boosts it to a level where it can be used in a larger circuit.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ovaga.com/products/detail/mcp602t-i-sn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MCP602T-I/SN</a> is a dual operational amplifier with a low offset voltage and a wide operating voltage range, making it suitable for a variety of applications. It’s designed to be a reliable, cost-effective choice for circuits requiring precise signal amplification.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features of MCP602T-I/SN:\n</h2><ul><li>Dual Channel: This op-amp contains two independent amplifiers within a single package.</li><li>Low Input Bias Current: Ensures minimal interference in sensitive applications.</li><li>Wide Voltage Range: Operates from 1.8V to 5.5V, making it flexible for both low and high voltage systems.</li><li>Low Power Consumption: Ideal for battery-powered applications due to its efficient power usage.</li></ul><p>The MCP602T-I/SN is often used in sensor applications, audio circuits, and signal conditioning systems due to its versatility and performance.</p><p>On the other hand, the MCP602T-I/S shares many of the same core features as the MCP602T-I/SN but comes in a different package type and with slight variations in performance characteristics.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features of MCP602T-I/S:\n</h2><ul><li>Similar to MCP602T-I/SN: The core specifications are largely the same, including low input bias current, low offset voltage, and a wide operating voltage range.</li><li>Package Differences: The primary difference lies in the package configuration, which can affect thermal performance, pin compatibility, and ease of integration in various designs.</li></ul><p>The MCP602T-I/S is ideal for applications that require the same performance but may have specific space or thermal requirements that suit its packaging options.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Differences Between MCP602T-I/SN and MCP602T-I/S\n</h2><p>While both the MCP602T-I/SN and MCP602T-I/S offer similar performance metrics, the key differences are related to their package configurations and intended use cases. The MCP602T-I/SN typically comes in a surface-mount package, while the MCP602T-I/S may offer other package types depending on the specific variant.</p><p>Here’s a quick comparison:</p><p>These differences mainly affect the physical characteristics of the op-amps rather than their core electrical performance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance and Specifications Comparison\n</h2><p>When choosing between the MCP602T-I/SN and MCP602T-I/S, it’s essential to look at specific performance attributes, such as gain bandwidth product, slew rate, and input offset voltage. Both op-amps perform similarly in these areas, making them great choices for high-precision tasks.</p><p>However, if your application requires extremely low power or needs to be optimized for a particular form factor, one may stand out over the other.

En .NET, on peut exécuter des tâches en parallèle grâce au multithreading et gérer des opérations asynchrones via async/await.</p><p>Dans cet article, nous allons explorer :</p><ul><li>  Les différences entre multithreading et async</li><li>  Les classes ,  et </li><li>  Les concepts de sections critiques, deadlocks et mutex</li><li>  Les bonnes pratiques pour éviter les erreurs courantes</li></ul><p>Qu'est-ce que le multithreading ? Le multithreading fait référence au fait de pouvoir exécuter plusieurs suites d’instructions en simultané/parallèle, mais aussi d’échanger des données entre les threads. Le multithreading peut s’avérer indispensable, notamment pour gérer de grosses volumétries de données, des applications en temps réel, des mises à jour des cours boursiers ou encore le suivi des transactions en finance de marché.</p><p>Souvent, le multithreading est confondu avec le concept de méthode asynchrone. Pourtant, ces deux approches répondent à des problématiques différentes. En C#, une méthode asynchrone exécute ses instructions sans bloquer le thread appelant, en permettant au programme de continuer son exécution pendant qu'une tâche en arrière-plan se termine. Contrairement à une méthode synchrone, qui exécute les instructions une par une dans l'ordre, une méthode asynchrone peut démarrer plusieurs opérations en parallèle et reprendre leur résultat une fois disponibles. Elle retourne généralement une  ou une , qui représente une promesse de résultat futur, permettant d’utiliser  pour suspendre temporairement l'exécution jusqu'à ce que la tâche soit terminée.</p><p>Maintenant que nous avons vu la différence entre le multithreading et les méthodes asynchrones, nous allons nous intéresser à ce qui différencie un thread d'un processus. Un processus est un programme en cours d’exécution, il exécute les instructions du programme et dispose d’un espace d’adressage en mémoire vive (RAM) pour contenir le heap. Un thread, en revanche, est un segment d’un processus. Un processus peut contenir plusieurs threads, qui partagent le même espace mémoire mais disposent de leur propre pile d’exécution.</p><p>En C#, il existe deux moyens de faire du multithreading :  et .</p><ul><li><p> est une classe de C# qui permet de créer une tâche qui sera exécutée de manière asynchrone. Contrairement à ,  ne crée pas de nouveau thread mais va chercher un thread disponible dans le thread pool.  permet aussi de vérifier si une tâche est terminée et de retourner une valeur.  ne consomme pas de ressources CPU, il lance simplement une minuterie, tandis que  exécute un code séparément. En résumé,  est une abstraction qui permet de planifier et exécuter du code sans gérer directement les threads sous-jacents.</p></li><li><p> est une classe qui exécute un bloc d’instructions dans un contexte indépendant du thread principal du programme. Il dispose de sa propre zone mémoire (stack), tandis que le heap est partagé entre tous les threads du processus.  est plus bas niveau que  et ne réutilise pas les threads du pool mais en crée de nouveaux, ce qui peut avoir un impact sur les performances.</p></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>On peut également avoir un certain nombre d’informations sur le thread en cours via le code qu’il exécute, mais aussi créer des pools de threads et lancer en arrière-plan :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Quand on fait du multithreading, il peut arriver qu'on ne veuille pas que plusieurs threads accèdent à une ressource en même temps pour des raisons que nous allons détailler dans la suite de cet article. C'est ce qu'on appelle une section critique, c'est-à-dire une portion de code où il ne peut y avoir plus d’un thread simultanément. On peut s’assurer de cela en utilisant un mutex, qui est une classe permettant de synchroniser l’accès à une ressource protégée en interdisant l’accès aux autres threads.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Dans cet exemple qui simule une connexion à un serveur, on peut voir que si plusieurs threads mettent à jour une variable partagée sans synchronisation, cela peut entraîner des erreurs de comptage (race condition).</p><p>Cependant, les sections critiques sont à manier avec soin car elles peuvent engendrer des problèmes comme le deadlock ou interblocage, qui est la situation dans laquelle deux threads s’attendent mutuellement. Prenons un exemple pour mieux comprendre comment cela peut se produire.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>On peut voir que deux threads essaient d’accéder à deux verrous ( et ) dans un ordre inversé, provoquant une attente infinie. Pour éviter ce problème, il faut toujours verrouiller les ressources dans le même ordre ou utiliser  avec un timeout. Mais cette pratique est également à risque, car libérer le thread trop tôt peut provoquer un LiveLock, c'est-à-dire que deux threads tentent d'éviter un conflit en relâchant immédiatement un verrou s'il est indisponible. Mais comme ils le font simultanément, ils ne progressent jamais.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3><strong>Objets mutables / immuables</strong></h3><p>Un objet mutable est un objet qui peut être modifié après sa création, contrairement à un objet immuable dont l’état ne peut pas changer. Pour modifier une valeur dans un objet immuable, il faut créer une nouvelle instance avec la nouvelle valeur au lieu d’altérer l’objet existant. Cela peut également éviter les problèmes de partage de ressources en multithreading.</p><p>En dehors des problèmes de partage des ressources, un thread peut se retrouver bloqué via ce qu'on appelle un appel bloquant. Un appel bloquant survient lorsqu'un thread exécute une opération qui l’empêche de continuer tant que l’opération n’est pas terminée. Cela peut être un appel système, un accès réseau, une lecture de fichier ou un verrou. Par exemple, la fonction  en C bloque l'exécution du programme tant que les données ne sont pas disponibles.</p><p>Exemples courants d’appels bloquants :</p><ul><li>  Lecture de fichier : ,  en C#</li><li>  Accès réseau : ,  (sans async)</li><li>  Verrous : , , </li><li>  Entrée utilisateur : </li></ul><p>Nous avons vu jusqu'à présent qu'on peut bloquer un bloc d’instructions via , mais il existe d'autres méthodes comme .  est une classe de C# .NET bloquant l’accès à une section protégée, permettant à un seul thread à la fois d’y accéder, bloquant les autres à l’entrée du . Un  revient à utiliser . On définit le début de la section protégée en mettant <code>\"MutexInstance\".WaitOne()</code>, et la fin en mettant <code>\"MutexInstance\".ReleaseMutex()</code>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>On peu egalement utiliser    pour set un timeout qui si la section protege prend plus de temps que celui indiquer (en ms) alors renvoie false, et le thread qui attand la section n’aquiere pas le mutex et donc n’appelle pas    qui est appeler uniquement par le tread qui est entrer.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Jusqu'à maintenant, nous avons vu comment bloquer l'accès à une ressource en permettant à un seul thread à la fois d'y accéder, mais il est possible de limiter le nombre de threads pouvant y accéder simultanément. Pour cela, on utilise un sémaphore, qui agit comme un compteur contrôlant le nombre maximal de threads pouvant entrer dans une section critique. Lorsqu'un thread veut accéder à la ressource, il doit attendre qu'un emplacement soit disponible en appelant la méthode  ou . </p><p>Une fois sa tâche terminée, il libère l'accès avec , permettant à un autre thread d'entrer. Cette approche est utile pour limiter les accès concurrents à une base de données, réguler les appels à une API ou gérer un pool de connexions. Contrairement à un verrou classique qui exclut tous les autres threads, un sémaphore autorise un certain nombre de threads définis lors de son initialisation, équilibrant ainsi contrôle et parallélisme.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>dans cette exemple on peut voir que nous devons faire 10 appels HTTP, mais pour éviter de surcharger l’API, on limite à 3 appels simultanés.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion et Bonnes Pratiques\n</h2><p>Le multithreading et la programmation asynchrone sont des outils puissants pour améliorer la réactivité et la performance des applications .NET, mais ils doivent être utilisés avec précaution. Une mauvaise gestion des accès concurrents peut entraîner des erreurs comme les race conditions, les deadlocks ou encore une consommation excessive de ressources. Il est donc essentiel de comprendre quand utiliser ,  ou encore  pour contrôler le nombre de threads simultanés. En adoptant de bonnes pratiques comme l’utilisation de verrous (, , ), le respect des règles d’immuabilité ou encore la gestion des appels bloquants, on peut tirer parti du multithreading sans en subir les pièges.</p>","contentLength":8590,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How Does Kafka Consumer Rebalance Work?","url":"https://dev.to/clasnake/how-does-kafka-consumer-rebalance-work-4h57","date":1740109251,"author":"clasnake","guid":8383,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Consumer Rebalance?\n</h2><p>When you run Kafka with multiple consumers, you'll need to handle Consumer Rebalance.

It is performed after unit testing and integration testing and before user acceptance testing (UAT). The goal of system testing is to validate the system’s functionality, performance, reliability, and compliance with business and technical requirements.</p><p><strong>Key Objectives of System Testing</strong><strong>Validate End-to-End Functionality:</strong> Ensure the system works as intended from start to finish. Check if the system meets both functional and non-functional requirements. Detect and report bugs or issues in the system. Confirm the system is stable and performs well under various conditions. Ensure the system is ready for user acceptance testing by addressing major issues beforehand.\nTypes of System Testing Validates the system’s functionality against the specified requirements. Evaluates the system’s responsiveness, speed, and stability under different workloads. Ensures the system is secure from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. Assesses the system’s user-friendliness and ease of use. Checks if the system works across different devices, browsers, and operating systems. Verifies the system’s ability to recover from crashes, failures, or data loss. Ensures new changes or updates do not negatively impact existing functionality.\nSystem Testing Process Define objectives, scope, and test cases based on requirements. Prepare the hardware, software, and network configurations required for testing.\nTest Case Execution: Execute test cases to validate the system’s functionality and performance. Log and track defects found during testing.\nRetesting and Regression Testing: Verify fixes and ensure no new issues are introduced. Document results, prepare reports, and evaluate the system’s readiness for UAT.\nChallenges in System Testing Testing the entire system can be complex due to its size and integration with multiple components. Differences between the test and production environments can lead to unexpected issues. Limited time, budget, or tools can impact the thoroughness of testing.\nChanging Requirements: Frequent changes in requirements can disrupt the testing process.<strong>Benefits of System Testing</strong>\nEnsures the system meets business and technical requirements.<p>\nIdentifies and resolves defects before the system goes live.</p>\nImproves system reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.<p>\nReduces risks and costs associated with post-release issues.</p>\nSystem testing is a vital step in ensuring the quality and reliability of a software system. By thoroughly validating the system’s functionality, performance, and compliance, teams can deliver a robust product that meets user expectations. While system testing can be challenging, proper planning, execution, and the use of advanced tools can streamline the process and ensure successful outcomes.</p>","contentLength":2933,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hot take - you don't need react","url":"https://dev.to/hwangs12/hot-take-you-dont-need-react-475i","date":1740108620,"author":"hwangs12","guid":8381,"unread":true,"content":"<p>don't learn react\njust learn javascript and typescript and build one without using react because react is just javascript and typescript.<p>\nif anyone tells you react is to ease your life in building software, know it is not, you can do it with just javascript and typescript, react is just a bloat, trying to obscure your understanding of the subject. </p></p>","contentLength":350,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Fastest Way to Find Valuable Domains Without Auctions or Bidding Wars","url":"https://dev.to/alexdro/the-fastest-way-to-findvaluable-domains-withoutauctions-or-bidding-wars-80p","date":1740107124,"author":"Alex Dro","guid":7591,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Finding a valuable domain name takes time and effort, whether you're looking for expired or premium domains for your own projects or for resale.</p><p>There are many metrics to consider before deciding whether to acquire a domain:</p><ul></ul><p>But that’s only half the challenge.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Traditional Domain Buying is a Nightmare\n</h2><p>Domain auctions and drop platforms are full of headaches.

It's not magic, but a well-defined system of settings and conventions!  Understanding how Django locates static and template files is crucial for any Django developer (esp. those like me who can't get their favicon to display ;) \nHere's a quick guide ↴</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Static Seeker: How Django Hunts for CSS, JS, and Images\n</h2><p>Static files, like stylesheets, scripts, and images, are the non-dynamic assets that make your web pages look and function beautifully. Django knows where to find them by checking a few key places:</p><ul><li><p><strong>App-Specific Static Folders:</strong>  The primary place Django looks is within your apps themselves!  Inside each app, Django expects a  directory.

The  setting in your  is your go-to for this.

I loved to build them but they had little functionality. The wheels of my toy cars could rotate with a simple axle, and the rotor of my dream helicopter could spin in unison with the wheel movement.</p><p>I once stumbled upon a magazine advertising kits for building boats and airplanes. This discovery was a revelation—could I really build a fully functional airplane? The idea was powerful. It made me feel an immense sense of freedom, as if I had wings and could fly. That moment shaped my belief that building things should be easy and attainable for everyone.</p><p><strong>The State of Software Development Today</strong>\nAfter decades in software development, I deeply feel that we are not utilizing our skills to develop software in an easier manner: we still write code for basic CRUD operations. These lower level details should be abstracted out and presented as features inside of tools and made available as pluggable building blocks generic enough for any database/storage technology. Things become more complicated when we talk about business logic. Everything has to be custom built when it comes to enterprise applications. Not that there are no tools in the market today but the tools are either way too simplistic or overtly complex and need someone with good technology skills to use and produce enterprise software. For citizen developers, non tech founders, solopreneurs and also for business analysts in larger organizations, the tools that can help them meet their needs are very limited. I am in no way implying that software industry is not complex. On the contrary, software technology is way too complex with applications in every business domain. For example, automobile engineering is limited in scope and application to automobiles. But software industry is wide open for use in almost all industries, businesses, politics, research and almost every human endeavor. It is almost infrastructural in usage that every business or organization needs software.</p><p>We place immense demands and high expectations on the software industry. While we continuously develop software for every niche and industry, we often overlook the need for frameworks and tools that simplify software creation for everyone. We have yet to reach a point where building software is as effortless as assembling LEGO pieces or kits that are available today to construct a house, a car, or an airplane. It’s an ambitious goal—but one I firmly believe is within our reach.</p><p>There are many cloud technologies that are trying to do something similar with their services and marketplaces. But I will limit my discussion to No Code Low Code (NOLO) approaches. There are many NOLO tools available in the market today that are trying to do this same exact thing. Some are way too simple while others are overtly complex and need a deep learning curve. We should be able to build a fully functional enterprise software that is secure, highly scalable and highly performant using a No Code Low Code Platform. We should not accept anything less. This will help in quick digitization of domains, areas and geographies that lack digitization. The increased technology adoption and penetration will help free ourselves of tasks and activities that are mundane and propel us to be more creative and efficient.</p><p>Every business application has a CRUD layer and the business functionality is built on top of it. Depending on the complexity of the business logic, these CRUD operations can take up 50% to 90% of a developer’s work. While we should account for the CRUD operations in a No Code Platform which is perhaps a simpler problem, the Low Code aspect of the platform should provide easy pluggable logic to a system built on it. This will help organizations to build software quickly at a lower cost and at the same time allow citizen developers and business analysts to be able to help build and be part of the software development process. The complex aspects can be left for seasoned developers to tackle. With this approach, organizations can digitize almost every area of their operations. End to end digitization is always a dream for every organization while the reality is that most depend on manual and people processes to do things that are not seen as important. Organizations build systems for processes that give the most ROI but the other ancillary and supplementary processes are not prioritized for digitization. These processes are also equally important as they do impact the important processes indirectly or impact human and other resources associated with the important revenue generating processes.</p><p><strong>Limitations of No Code and Low Code Solutions</strong>\nMany No Code and Low Code tools assist with CRUD operations but fail to scale effectively. Solutions built on No Code Platforms generally have issues with scaling, security and often go through many changes to tackle the inadequate underlying foundations. When it comes to business functionality, there are very few tools offering an easy build and integration of APIs seamlessly preserving the architectural guidelines intact. A good No Code Low Code Platform should offer more than just a working prototype or a basic product that needs revisions as the application needs and usage grows.</p><p>Many Business Rule Engines do fill in this gap and other similar tools exist, but they generally address only simple system behaviors. In my experience, I have yet to see a No Code or Low Code platform that:</p><ul><li>Is easy to learn and adopt for citizen developers, business analysts, or super users.</li><li>Provides a scalable, high-performance architecture leveraging the cloud.</li><li>Allows for custom functionality beyond simple CRUD operations.</li><li>Allows for best security practices like RBAC and ensures industry standards are met to address privacy and security guidelines.</li><li>Simplifies or completely eliminates build and deployment.</li><li>Is easily extensible and simplifies change management</li></ul><p>Most tools today focus on one or a combination of task management, workflows, and collaboration features — helpful for productivity but insufficient for enterprise-level application development. Businesses still need to write extensive code to implement logic, making software development expensive and time-consuming.</p><p><strong>The Need for a Holistic Solution</strong>\nEnterprise software development requires a tool that allows businesses to:</p><ul><li>Easily build and modify software on the fly.</li><li>Scale seamlessly without frequent re-engineering.</li><li>Provide a secure, well-architected system with custom functionality.</li><li>Be intuitive for business users without requiring advanced technical knowledge.</li><li>Provide features for task management, workflows etc. as a standard feature set and build CRUD and business logic on top of it.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, no existing No Code or Low Code platform fully meets these needs. Most demand a steep learning curve with complex configurations and unused features. Any new tool in this space should empower developers to focus on complex business logic instead of struggling with the platform itself.</p><p><strong>Designing a Better Solution</strong>\nAfter spending 27 years in continuous employment, I finally had the time and opportunity in the past six months (thanks to my position moving to offshore) to deeply reflect on this problem. I wasn’t starting from scratch — I had been experimenting with similar ideas for years, aiming to simplify enterprise software development with minimal coding (or no coding at all) while ensuring full customization.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Core Concepts: Tasks and Workflows</strong>\nAt the heart of my solution lies a simple yet powerful idea: the concept of a task.</p><p>Every profession involves tasks—from CEOs to entry-level employees, from doctors to engineers. Consider the following examples:</p><ul><li>Healthcare: A doctor diagnosing a patient is a task. They might assign a task to a lab technician for a blood test, who then generates a lab report—another task.</li><li>HR &amp; Recruitment: The process of onboarding an employee, from interviews to the first day at work, consists of multiple interconnected tasks.</li><li>IT Support: An ISP customer calls about an internet issue. A Level 1 technician logs the request, an expert analyzes it, and a field technician resolves it—all structured as tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>Workflows as the Foundation of Enterprise Systems</strong>\nTasks are grouped into processes to manage work efficiently. A process is a collection of tasks stitched together to achieve a business function.</p><p>Examples of business processes include:</p><p>**Employee Onboarding: Covers interviews, offer approvals, document submission, and induction.</p><p>Agile Development: A user story that involves estimation, coding, and testing.</p><p>Customer Support: Handling an ISP issue, escalating as needed, and resolving it with field support.\n**<p>\nYou must have come across many workflows in modern tools. These tools incorporate workflows but often limit them to email triggers or notifications. In reality, workflows are far more powerful and should be central to any enterprise system.</p></p><p>Large companies integrate workflow engines to streamline operations as an after-thought after the systems are already built. Instead, workflows should be part of the core platform feature set fully integrated from day one. This will ensure a smooth progression of the business process landscape as it evolves and adapts to the constantly changing business needs and market conditions.</p><p><strong>What a Future-Ready System Should Offer</strong>\nAn ideal system should:</p><ul><li>Model all business processes efficiently reflecting actual business operations and the Process Hierarchies/Dependencies.</li><li>Design all workflows tying all operations from end to end providing visibility and transparency into every operation.</li><li>CRUD and Business Logic should be built on top of the BPM Layer</li><li>Support rapid changes to business process models and workflows while ensuring backward compatibility.</li><li>Retain historical data with accurate business process tracking.</li><li>Offer built-in analytics to optimize operations and remove bottlenecks.</li><li>Enable seamless data integration with data warehouses and data lakes for BI by leveraging real-time event brokers.</li></ul><p>\nThe future of No Code and Low Code solutions lies in empowering businesses to build and modify enterprise software effortlessly, without sacrificing security, scalability, or performance. A true game-changer will place workflows at the core, giving businesses the ability to build complex systems with minimal effort while ensuring flexibility and efficiency.</p><p>This is the vision I’ve been working towards—a platform that makes enterprise software development intuitive, scalable, and adaptable and more importantly extremely easy to build and change. Anyone and everyone who understands the business process landscape should be able to build it. If you are a Non Tech Founder or a Solopreneur, it should help you build a SaaS product quickly without understanding the underlying technologies. For larger companies, it should help digitize complex processes and build massive systems helping in increased efficiencies and time / cost savings.</p><p>The platform should walk the BPM Architect (or a Citizen Developer / Superuser / Business Analyst) through setting up Business Processes and Workflows, adding data fields for CRUD operations etc. by asking questions and helping build the solution quickly. The system should be ready to use right away without having to build it and deploy. This will provide an amazing user experience as the system is fully functional in minutes. All of the additional project management, routing and analytics features should be made available without having a Process Architect (or Citizen Developer) spend extra time configuring these features.</p><p>Now, let us go through the platform I created and see how these features are implemented. Here are some examples of what I have built on my No Code Low Code Platform. This is in no way a full demo but rather some important aspects to consider in such an undertaking.</p><p><strong>An Agile Software Development Business Process Suite</strong></p><p>Here is an example everyone in IT domain can relate to. The important processes in agile software development include Epic, Story, Retrospective, Scrum, Initiative etc. All of these processes store data and form part of workflows and can optionally trigger other tasks and processes for build, deployment and are inter-related to each other in some way or another. Each task/activity and process should have customizable status and file upload capabilities. All of these are available on this platform.</p><p>The user story has individual steps and each step is performed separately one after the other as a workflow. Once a step or task is marked completed, it will trigger the next step status change to indicate the next step is ready to be worked on. The above diagram shows the very first step in the process. Once the Story details are available, a developer can code it. Once the developer finishes coding and marks it completed, it can be tested by another member of the team who has an assigned task for this as shown on his/her dashboard. The workflow based system should represent this idea clearly as shown above. And there are data fields that capture all information for every step. In addition to specific data fields for this step, there are other generic fields as shown for marking status/ETA/estimates etc. I will skip those details and other complex areas and keep it simple to help understand the core concepts.</p><p>If you noticed above, the business function, data and workflows are all intertwined in the same screen. This is done to ensure that workflows and task management are part of the business function itself and do not need to be recorded in separate systems. To record it separately becomes an extra step and costs extra time and effort. Business users are not fond of spending extra time just to record the status and effort it took. It is generally an overhead for project managers and supervisors to coordinate among upper management and the workforce just to produce status reports! A system offering work estimations, status updates etc. as part of the business system itself helps employees manage their work easily without having to use additional systems and provide transparency in their work without having to spend additional time for it. </p><p>Let us look at another step from this same process - the last step in the process. This is performed by a Product Owner and the task is assigned to John Davis who is the PO on the scrum team. Once the PO accepts and marks the task or step complete, the dashboard clears automatically and this task is no longer displayed in the active tasks dashboard for John. As this is the last step in the story process, a new process like Deployment for DevOps team will be automatically triggered if configured. New tasks will be visible to DevOps team members automatically.</p><p>Please note all of this can be custom built and configured accordingly in a matter of a few hours. Our example is for an Agile SDLC Methodology. It can easily be done for any other business domain. However, the system supports scrum/agile/Kanban features so any business domain can leverage these agile practices. I built the whole process suite including all processes and workflows and establishing all roles and many scrum teams. All of this took me less than 2 days of work on this No Code Platform! What you are seeing is just a few screens, but there are many dashboards and other screens that support task assignments, automated workflows routing work to members who have capacity to do the work (estimation and routing module) etc. There are Kanban boards, Gaant charts, self-cleaning task and process dashboards for team members who are active task participants and for managers who supervise all tasks and activities. While the system provides transparency, it also ensures only users who have access to the actual processes will be able to access this data. A user may just have an observer-level or read-only access or can be an active participant/performer or a reviewer or approver. The workflow will adjust accordingly by sending tasks to reviewers and approvers via status changes.</p><p>Let us see some more example screens - here is my dashboard for all tasks. Please note I am part of many processes and only I can see these as I am assigned a role in each of these processes.  A manager who is assigned access can see what I am assigned and also other team members' workload, capacity, status etc. </p><p>Creating a workflow based process is so easy on this platform that my daughter built a process for her sister's birthday and assigned me tasks! She also invited Batman and Ironman as attendees. </p><p>This addresses No Code CRUD screens for all business processes modeled as workflows. How about Low Code for adding custom behavior ? We just need a small change in each of these screens to be able to call APIs on the click of a button - it should be able to send data on the screen via a HTTP API and the developer can code the API that sends data back accordingly. </p><p>The Save and Close are standard buttons. Let us add a search button that calls an API for a Customer Engagement in an ERP system for a Real Estate Agency. The results will populate other fields when a result is found, else a message is shown.</p><p>So far, we did not see any setup screens - there are many but here is the one helping us to add a button to integrate with an external API.</p><p>And here is the resulting screen with the Customer Search button placed exactly where we said in the control render order.</p><p>There are over 40 screens with many dashboards, analytics and project management features. There are many screens for setting up workflows, building processes etc. But more importantly, the system has the CRUD screens that you can create and update on the fly and can integrate your APIs easily for a fully customized business logic. Since building enterprise software is made so easy on this platform, why not digitize each and every activity and build BPM solutions for the whole enterprise? Model all business processes and operations for every department from end-to-end. You can set up teams and manage work by assigning to teams directly and someone from the team will be assigned tasks depending on who has capacity to accept work. Building software today should not cost you a fortune and should instead be something that anyone can build easily. It should be easily extensible and maintainable. Hope you enjoyed understanding what it means to build a No Code Low Code Platform for the enterprise. It has been a fun activity for me building this platform and trying to solve one of the most complex problems for digitizing the enterprise. I would appreciate any feedback and comments.

This is where  comes into play.</p><p>In this post, we’ll explore what consistent hashing is, how it works, and how it helps solve common issues in distributed systems like load balancing and minimizing re-distribution of data.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Consistent Hashing?\n</h2><p>Consistent hashing is a technique used to distribute data across a changing number of nodes (servers) in a way that minimizes the movement of data when nodes are added or removed. Unlike traditional hashing methods, which might require a complete reshuffling of data, consistent hashing allows for only a small fraction of data to be relocated when changes occur.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Key Features of Consistent Hashing:\n</h3><ul><li>: Only a small subset of data is moved when nodes are added or removed.</li><li>: Consistent hashing works well even when nodes frequently join or leave.</li><li>: If a node goes down, only the data mapped to that node is affected.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Does Consistent Hashing Work?\n</h2><p>Let’s break it down step by step.</p><ol><li><p>: Each server or node is assigned a point on a circular \"hash ring\" using a hash function. The hash function takes the node identifier (such as an IP address or hostname) and maps it to a position on the ring.</p></li><li><p>: Similarly, each data item (key) is mapped to the same ring using the same hash function. The key is then assigned to the nearest node in the clockwise direction on the ring.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling Node Additions or Removals</strong>: When a new node is added or removed, only the keys that are closest to that node will be affected. The rest of the keys remain unchanged. This is a huge advantage because it reduces the amount of data that needs to be moved.</p></li></ol><ul><li>Imagine we have a ring with 3 nodes: , , and .</li><li>Data items (keys) like , , and  are mapped to points on the ring.</li><li>When  is removed, only the data items that were mapped to  will need to be reassigned, and the rest remain as they are.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Virtual Nodes (or \"Virtual Buckets\")\n</h3><p>One challenge with consistent hashing is that it may lead to uneven distribution of keys. This can happen because a small number of nodes might be positioned very close to each other on the ring, leading to an imbalance.</p><p>To solve this,  are used. A virtual node is a logical representation of a physical node on the ring. By assigning each physical node multiple virtual nodes (randomly spread across the ring), we can achieve a more uniform distribution of data across the nodes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advantages of Consistent Hashing\n</h2><ul><li>: When a node is added or removed, only a small portion of the data needs to be moved to a new node.</li><li>: The system can grow or shrink as needed, without excessive data movement.</li><li>: If a node fails, the data can be redistributed efficiently, without significant impact on the rest of the system.</li></ul><ul><li>: Consistent hashing is widely used in caching systems like  and , where the goal is to distribute cache keys across multiple servers while minimizing the rehashing of data when servers are added or removed.</li><li>: Systems like  and  use consistent hashing to distribute data across nodes in a distributed database system.</li><li>: Load balancers use consistent hashing to distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers, minimizing the chances of hot spots and ensuring smooth scaling.</li></ul><p>Consistent hashing is a powerful and efficient way to manage the distribution of data across a distributed system. By reducing the movement of data when nodes are added or removed, it helps ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and minimal disruption. </p><p>Whether you're building a distributed cache or a fault-tolerant database, understanding consistent hashing is crucial for designing scalable and resilient systems.</p>","contentLength":3772,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🚀 Terminal Tricks: Essential Tips and Tricks for Developers","url":"https://dev.to/d_thiranjaya_6d3ec4552111/terminal-tricks-essential-tips-and-tricks-for-developers-3no8","date":1740100038,"author":"Pawani Madushika","guid":7528,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Terminal Tricks Tips for Modern Development (2025)\n</h2><p>Discover cutting-edge Terminal Tricks tips and techniques for 2025.

You can find the template starter code Twitch provides here: <a href=\"https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/chat/chatbot-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/chat/chatbot-guide/</a> that gives you a good starting place to work from in getting things working, but this guide will try to provide information on how to get (and refresh automatically) your OAuth tokens, and how to customize the authentication request for different things your Twitch bot can listen to.</p><ul><li>1. Make your Chat Bot Application in dev.twitter (get Client ID and Client Secret)</li><li>5. Get the starter code from Twitch, set up your project space, fill in the constant values with the values from steps 3 and 4, and run it!</li><li>6. As a bonus, do security with .env files, set up automatic OAuth token refreshing</li><li>7. Creatively program bot behaviors! The baseline works, now do real programming!</li></ul><p>I am assuming you have a main Twitch account (the streaming account) and a secondary Twitch account (the bot account). I am assuming you have node.js installed and have done the \"How to set up and run the code\" steps in the link provided above from dev.twitch (basically having done  and ).</p><p>If you want to get ahead of the game on being secure about your codes/tokens, also install this <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv</a> when you set up your project for a much later step.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Getting our Client ID and Client Secret\n</h3><p>Go to , log in as your , go to your Console &gt; Applications, and register a new application. The name can be whatever is descriptive for your bot, the redirect url should be  (this doesn't really get used in our relatively simple bot here), and you need to set the Client Type to Confidential. Category should be Chat Bot as that is what we are making here.</p><p>Once created, you will see your Client ID and can generate a secret token. Make sure you copy the secret token and store it securely. Keep these handy for later.</p><p>OAuth is a way to get a secret token string that lets an arbitrary javascript program send POST/GET requests to the Twitch API under the identity of a particular twitch account. They are primarily used here to  your bot to different 'events' that occur during your stream (chat messages, follows, message deletions, subscriptions, etc.), and then validate their identity when sending chat messages.</p><p>Security is complicated, and there used to exist convenient sites that would auto-generate you a token but that has become frowned upon and most guides assume a greater familiarity with how to do this sort of thing than I had when I started. You basically just have to send a few POST requests to two different URL's owned by Twitch with some ID info for your bot, and then use the code you get from doing that to verify that you're legit and pre-authorized to do stuff.</p><p>Once you've done it and it's working, it's actually quite trivial, but going from not understanding at all to being able to do it can take some work so this guide will do it's best to get you there smoothly and introduce some convenient tools to make it go faster.</p><p>OAuth is acquired in two steps: first, by sending a POST request to this address:  with additional information included as parameters to specify your bot account identifier, the permissions you are requesting for it, where to send back the data you are requesting, and some metadata.</p><ul><li>response_type (keyword, set this to \"code\")</li><li>scope (which permissions we want for our bot; the list of subscribable events details which permissions each event requires)</li><li>state (an arbitrary code you can set and ensure is sent back to you unchanged for data integrity)</li><li>force_verify (not actually sure, but we set this to \"true\")</li></ul><p>The most complicated part of this is going to be scope due to needing to specially format the ':' symbol as %3A due to HTML encoding. The basic scope requirements are , , and  (maybe also ?). These need to be formatted, for example, as  in the URL you are constructing.</p><p>Each of the parameters listed above need to be appended to the end of the base url  as first <strong>?client_id=dfhwjenfgkjawehriawfj</strong> and then  for each following parameter. (The first parameter is prefaced with a , then  for the rest).</p><p>This is messy, prone to minor errors, and hard to reproduce when you potentially need to do this a dozen times due to small errors or your OAuth token expiring. I recommend you use a free service called Postman that lets you configure URL requests in a neat format that allows easy editing and trivial recall.</p><p>Go to <a href=\"https://web.postman.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://web.postman.co/</a> and make a free account. Make/go to a new workspace, and make a new HTTP request (top left of the screen, click \"New\" then select HTTP).</p><p>Change the type from \"GET\" to \"POST\" and then put the base URL in the 'Enter URL or paste text box' next to the button that let you switch \"GET\" to \"POST\". <strong>Make sure you put the base URL there first</strong>. The URL is auto-configured as you add keys/values. Add each of the parameters listed in Step One as Keys, and populate the Value for each with the appropriate value.</p><p>Once this is set up, please make sure to  this URL you have setup in the interface (the save button is above the \"Send\" button) and give it a descriptive name so that, in a week, you can trivially reload this URL request and not have to figure out the formatting again. Do so for each Postman request we format in this guide.</p><p>While there is an option to \"Send\" this URL and get the data returned to use, we cannot do that for this step. Copy the complete URL and access it in a web browser while logged in as your ; you are authorizing your  to be used automatically by your program. You do not ask your streaming account for permission for anything (if it's your own bot account, you have likely given it moderator access already).</p><p>After you send the first POST request in a browser, it will load a page that asks you to confirm the permissions. You will then be redirected to a new site where the URL header of that blank site has your . The site you are redirected to is one of the parameters for the POST request; for simplicity, we just redirect to  and copy our authorization code from the URL header.</p><p>This is kind of awkward; ideally we would set up some html page that can interpret the URL to display the code nicely, but it's not that hard to just grab the code from the URL you are redirected to, so we are going to do that for now.</p><p>Step two: with our authorization code, we make another POST request. This one does not need to be done in a web browser, so we can use Postman's \"Send\" button after configuring this URL address. The base URL is  for this one, with the following parameters:</p><ul><li>client_id (the Client ID from dev.twitter)</li><li>client_secret (the Client Secret from dev.twitter)</li><li>code (our authorization code from Step One)</li><li>grant_type (just set this to )</li></ul><p>Set this up in Postman like in Step One, it should look like the following:</p><p>This time we can just press \"Send\" and we will see a response back containing our OAuth Token and a Refresh Token.</p><p><strong>That is how you get your OAuth Token</strong>. These will expire periodically and, in my experience, inconsistently, so we will want to set up an automatic refresh when we are told it has expired. </p><p>Side note: For completion's sake, I also did the following step which may do some backend verification, but the code this returns is not needed for anything in the twitch starter code or that I have done so far.</p><ul><li>client_id (Client ID from dev.twitch)</li><li>client_secret (Client Secret from dev.twitch)</li><li>grant_type (set to \"client_credentials\")</li></ul><p>This gives you an  that several guides have said is necessary but in my experience it doesn't work and the OAuth token is able to validate for everything I have done so far. But it might do something in the backend that I'm not aware of, so I'm including it for reference. If things aren't working, maybe run this POST request and see if that changes anything, or try substituting the  for the OAuth token.</p><p>Debugging processes are random and weird, so that's just another thing to try if stuff breaks.</p><p>Back to automatically refreshing our tokens...</p><p>The starter code from twitch at <a href=\"https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/chat/chatbot-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/chat/chatbot-guide/</a> has some constant values at the start that you substitute with your own values. Most obviously are OAUTH_TOKEN, which will be the OAuth Token we just generated using the second Postman request, and CLIENT_ID which you got from dev.twitch earlier.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Getting my Stream and Bot IDs (they aren't just my username?)\n</h3><p>However, it also references BOT_USER_ID and CHAT_CHANNEL_USER_ID, which are not just the usernames of your bot account and stream account. They are the backend ID identifiers of your accounts, which are not public facing.</p><p>I would encourage you to add a new constant REFRESH_TOKEN and store the Refresh Token you got back in step 2 here as well.</p><p>At this point, you should be able to run your code ( in the terminal at the directory where you did the  earlier) and get the feedback saying it connected successfully. You may get some errors saying you don't have sufficient permissions, which means you should check the  parameter from step one and make sure that you correctly formatted the permissions and included all of the permissions that the subscribables you're interested in state that you require.</p><p>I got more errors than that when I did this the first time, but it's been a while, so reach out and tell me if you get errors (include the feedback in the terminal (removing private information like authorization codes and client ID/secret)) and I'll update this.</p><p>I encourage you to set up a .env file to store your important codes/variables so that they aren't in the javascript file itself. This is done by making a file that is unnamed and of type '.env.' (on windows, open up a new Notepad file and save it as \".env\" with the file type set to \"All Files\", otherwise it's a file called \".env\" of type \".txt\" annoyingly).</p><p>Include within it lines such as <strong>OAUTH_TOKEN=asdasdasdasdasd</strong> that contain your codes/tokens. </p><p>In the directory for your project, call <strong>npm install dotenv --save</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv</a>) to install a package that lets you read the environment in your file. In your Javascript file, add at the top .</p><p>You can now, in your code, reference the variables from .env as  to not include them in your files directly. If you upload your files to github, you can put .env in the .gitignore list to share your code without compromising your bot.</p><p>Periodically your OAuth token will expire and stuff will stop working. It should take two months but in my experience it's 12 hours for some reason; I'm likely doing something wrong, which means other people will too. You could reuse the Postman requests we set up earlier and manually update the OAuth token in your .env file or still embedded in the .js file itself, or we can use that Refresh Token to automatically take care of it.</p><p>In Javascript, as we can see in the starter code from twitch, we can use the 'fetch' library to send POST requests automatically within our code. The same kind of POST requests we were doing with Postman. So, we can send a POST request to refresh our OAuth token and overwrite the .env file to now use the new OAuth Token and Refresh Tokens automatically when we detect that the OAuth Token has expired (which is a 401 error from most other POST requests we send to twitch that use the OAuth token).</p><p>I just wrote a function that I could call anytime a request came back with a 401 error (response.status_code contains the status code number) that would send a POST request. The base URL is  and you're basically just changing the  to \"refresh_token\" while including the parameter \"refresh_token\" in your URL.</p><p>This returns a JSON file payload (response.json() to access this, which can take some time so make sure you  it), and it will contain your new tokens in the keys \"access_token\" and \"refresh_token\". Yes, the refresh token is also changed by this, so you need to store both.</p><p>Most of the code below for this function is just rewriting my .env file to replace the old values with the new ones.</p><p>That would've been a code embed to easily copy it but the code tag in this editor wasn't working properly. I may make my github repo with my code public at some point in which case I'll just link that here.</p><p>With that, once you've set it up once and have this code integrated properly into your project, you can avoid having to think about OAuth tokens until something really major breaks (or your Refresh Token expires somehow so you have to go back to Postman manually).</p><p>That's all from me on getting your basic bot set up! I may make another guide at some point for how to further customize this (easier way to manage subscribing to multiple events, convenient ways to have your bot respond to chat commands or dynamically add new ones, how to write your code to get those 'Drink Water!' messages every 20 minutes, and useful ways to get program information for error logging.</p><p>Also I have a neat way for having your own on-screen chat messages by dynamically writing the HTML code for it as your bot is running along with an OBS plugin to make Browser Sources refresh automatically. (You can point Browser Sources at local .html files so you can just embed your own code in there, or have your bot write novel content to those .html files that OBS is constantly reading and updating! It's neat).</p><p>Thanks for reading, I hope this helps anyone in the same position as I was over this past weekend which ate up many hours of my life.</p>","contentLength":13442,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Edge AI: Running Machine Learning Models on IoT Devices","url":"https://dev.to/kartikmehta8/edge-ai-running-machine-learning-models-on-iot-devices-4ha5","date":1740098430,"author":"Kartik Mehta","guid":7526,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Introduction:\nEdge AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to the process of running machine learning models and algorithms on IoT (Internet of Things) devices rather than on cloud servers.

In an era dominated by large JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, HTMX stands out by allowing developers to enhance user interactivity without relying on the extensive client-side complexity these frameworks bring. If you're wondering , you're not alone. Let's dive deep into understanding its features, advantages, and how it can be a game-changer for your next web project.</p><h2><strong>Understanding HTMX: A Revolutionary Approach to Web Development</strong></h2><p>HTMX is a  that enables web developers to add dynamic behavior to their HTML pages with minimal effort and no heavy client-side frameworks. It allows for , making it an ideal choice for developers who prefer to keep their applications server-driven rather than client-heavy.</p><p>Instead of relying on JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), HTMX uses  to trigger server requests and receive HTML responses. This lightweight approach makes it easier to build dynamic web pages, reducing the need for complex JavaScript code, and ensuring that the user experience is smooth and fast.</p><h2><strong>Why is HTMX Gaining Popularity?</strong></h2><p>The rise of <strong>Single-Page Applications (SPAs)</strong> revolutionized web development by shifting most logic to the client-side. However, the downside of SPAs is their complexity. As applications grow larger, they often become more difficult to manage. This is where HTMX comes into play. </p><p>HTMX allows developers to build <strong>server-rendered applications</strong> with dynamic features that you would typically expect from SPAs, but without the overhead of managing complex client-side JavaScript. It's a perfect solution for developers who want to simplify the development process, improve performance, and reduce the amount of JavaScript code required.</p><h3><strong>1. HTML-Driven Interactions</strong></h3><p>HTMX relies heavily on  to define dynamic behavior on a webpage. You simply add special attributes like , , , and others to your HTML elements, and HTMX handles the rest. This allows you to trigger server-side actions and update parts of your webpage without needing to write complex JavaScript code.</p><h3><strong>2. Simplified Client-Side Interactivity</strong></h3><p>Unlike traditional JavaScript frameworks that require you to manage application state and routing on the client-side, HTMX enables you to use  to keep your app lightweight. By making AJAX-like requests directly from HTML elements, HTMX ensures that you only need to update parts of the page that have changed, rather than reloading the entire page.</p><h3><strong>3. Easy Integration with Backend Frameworks</strong></h3><p>HTMX works seamlessly with popular backend frameworks like , , , and more. Since it operates on the server-side, developers can build robust and interactive applications while leveraging the power of their backend framework's templating system.</p><h3><strong>4. Reduced JavaScript Complexity</strong></h3><p>HTMX takes the  approach out of web development. Rather than spending hours writing complex front-end code, HTMX allows you to focus on building functional, server-driven applications with minimal client-side JavaScript.</p><h2><strong>How HTMX Works: A Step-by-Step Overview</strong></h2><p>HTMX relies on simple HTML attributes to create dynamic interactions between the client and server. Here's how it works:</p><ol><li><p>: The user interacts with an HTML element, such as a button or link. For example, clicking a button may trigger an action to update part of the page.</p></li><li><p>: HTMX sends an HTTP request (e.g., , ) to the server. The request may contain data from the user's interaction, such as form input or search criteria.</p></li><li><p>: The server processes the request and returns the necessary  (rather than a full page), which is injected directly into the relevant part of the page. This allows for a  without the need for a full page reload.</p></li><li><p>: HTMX takes the response and dynamically updates the DOM based on the instructions provided in the server's response.</p></li></ol><p>By using this approach, HTMX significantly reduces page load times and improves the overall user experience by avoiding full-page reloads.</p><h2><strong>HTMX vs. Traditional JavaScript Frameworks: A Comparative Analysis</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Simplicity vs. Complexity</strong></h3><p>Traditional JavaScript frameworks like , , and  come with a steep learning curve and require developers to manage a large amount of state, components, and routing on the client-side. HTMX, on the other hand, is much simpler to integrate and requires minimal configuration.</p><p>HTMX uses declarative HTML attributes to enable dynamic behavior, which means you don’t need to learn a new way of thinking about web development. This makes it a great option for developers who are already comfortable with HTML and server-side rendering.</p><p>Performance is one of HTMX’s biggest advantages. Traditional JavaScript frameworks can often lead to performance bottlenecks as the client-side application grows larger. HTMX, with its server-driven approach, allows for faster load times and reduced complexity.</p><p>Because HTMX only updates the parts of the page that need to change, it reduces the amount of data transferred between the server and the client. This can result in faster load times, especially on slower networks or mobile devices.</p><h3><strong>3. Server-Side vs. Client-Side</strong></h3><p>The key difference between HTMX and other frameworks is where the logic resides. With frameworks like React and Angular, most of the application logic resides on the client-side. In contrast, HTMX keeps most of the logic on the server-side, sending only the necessary HTML to update the page.</p><h2><strong>Real-World Use Cases of HTMX</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Creating Dynamic Forms</strong></h3><p>HTMX is excellent for creating dynamic forms that validate inputs or show real-time updates based on user interaction. For example, a user might select a category from a dropdown, and the form could dynamically load more options based on that selection, all without a page reload.</p><h3><strong>2. Updating Content Dynamically</strong></h3><p>HTMX can be used to create websites that update content dynamically. Whether it's for , , or , HTMX can fetch content from the server and update parts of the page, like comments, prices, or product listings, without the need to refresh the page.</p><h3><strong>3. Enhancing User Experience with Real-Time Updates</strong></h3><p>HTMX supports  and  (SSE), allowing real-time updates. This is especially useful for applications that require live data feeds, such as , , or .</p><h2><strong>Why Choose HTMX for Your Next Project?</strong></h2><p>HTMX provides a flexible, simple, and powerful way to build modern web applications. If you are looking for a way to add dynamic interactivity to your website without diving deep into complex client-side JavaScript frameworks, HTMX is a perfect choice.</p><p>Here are some reasons why you should consider using HTMX for your next project:</p><ul><li>: HTMX reduces the amount of JavaScript code you need to write, making your application simpler and faster to develop.</li><li><strong>Seamless Server Integration</strong>: HTMX integrates smoothly with server-side frameworks, allowing you to take advantage of server-side rendering.</li><li>: By only updating the relevant parts of the page, HTMX ensures faster load times and a smoother user experience.</li></ul><h2><strong>Conclusion: Is HTMX the Future of Web Development?</strong></h2><p>HTMX offers a refreshing approach to web development by allowing developers to focus on building  applications with . With its simple syntax, ease of use, and ability to integrate seamlessly with backend frameworks, HTMX is a powerful tool that can help streamline web development and improve the user experience.</p><p>If you're looking for a way to simplify your web applications and improve performance, HTMX is definitely worth considering. Whether you're building a dynamic form, a content-heavy website, or a real-time application, HTMX can help you create rich, interactive web pages without the need for complex front-end frameworks.</p>","contentLength":7700,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"API Testing for DummyJSON Endpoints using Postman","url":"https://dev.to/loveline/api-testing-for-dummyjson-endpoints-using-postman-41in","date":1740091575,"author":"Loveline Chioma Ezenwafor","guid":7481,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As part of my API testing experience, I worked on testing multiple endpoints from DummyJSON, a free API for testing and prototyping.

Azure takes care of setting up the cluster, including looking after node management, scaling, security etc. that follows the AKS well-architected recommendations.</p><p>In terms of security, at the cluster level, AKS Automatic uses Azure Linux OS along with Automatic upgrades. Local access and SSH access is disabled, with Azure RBAC being enabled to access the Kubernetes API. Workload identity is enabled so that our developers can build applications that authenticate to Azure resources using Entra ID for passwordless experiences. Image cleaner add-on are already configured for you and the node resource group is locked down to prevent users from accidentally or intentionally making changes to the cluster.</p><p>There are also deployment safeguards configured for you, as well as both the Azure Policy and Azure Key Vault provider add-ons so that you can work with secrets and policies from day 1.</p><p>When it comes to networking, we can think of how Pods communicate with each other and how traffic ingresses and egresses from the cluster. For pod networking, AKS Automatic implements the Azure CNI overlay networking with Cilium. For the data plane, ASK App Routing add Is configured for ingress which is essentially a managed nginx Ingress controller which can integrate with Azure DNS. For Egress, AKS NAT Gateway is installed for scalable outbound connection flows. Service meshes aren’t enabled by default, but you can use either your own service mesh or Azure service mesh.</p><p>AKS Automatic autoscaling is enabled by AKS Node Autoprovisioning which is based on the open-source Karpenter project that automatically provisions and deprovision nodes based on workload demands. The cluster autoscaler routinely checks for underutilized nodes and scale accordingly to save you from wasting resources. AKS Automatic also adds KEDA and VPA add-ons. So for KEDA, we can scale our clusters based on events and metrics, and the VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) will essentially help us automatically adjust resource requests based on actual usage.</p><p>Finally for observability (starting to get into the day 2 stuff), AKS Automatic integrates with Azure Managed Prometheus for metric collection, Container Insights for log collection, and Managed Grafana for visualization.</p><p>With Managed Grafana, it’ll come with several Kubernetes and Azure related dashboards already installed so you can see how the cluster is operating just by going into your Grafana dashboards.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE]\nAt the time of writing, when provisioning AKS Automatic through Infrastructure-as-code, not all of these things are included. AKS Networking, Azure Policy, Auto-provisioning and Key Vault providers are configured, but observability features like Azure Managed Prometheus and Grafana are not.

It allows developers to write simpler and cleaner code. There's another method that uses a similar syntax, , but it does the opposite. Today, I'll discuss Rest Parameters and Spread Syntax.</p><p>\nRest parameters allow you to collect all remaining arguments into a single array.</p><div><pre><code>function example(num1, num2, ...args) {\n    console.log(args); // [3, 4, 5]\n}\nexample(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n</code></pre></div><p>\nSpread syntax allows an array or other iterable to be expanded into individual elements.</p><p>Example 1: \"Expand\" the iterable object into a list of arguments</p><div><pre><code>function findMax(arr) {\n    let maxNum = Math.max(...arr);\n    console.log(maxNum); // 500\n}\nfindMax([200, 100, 500]);\n</code></pre></div><p>Example 2: Merge multiple arrays</p><div><pre><code>let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];\nlet arr2 = [4, 5, 6];\nlet arrCombined = [...arr1, ...arr2];\nconsole.log(arrCombined); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n</code></pre></div><p>Spread syntax can also be used to copy arrays and objects because it works on iterable elements.\nAs I mentioned in a previous blog post, spread syntax operates similarly to a  loop, it processes each element of an array or object and copies it into a new array or object. This makes spread syntax a simpler alternative to methods like  for creating shallow copies.</p><div><pre><code>let user = { name: \"John\", age: 30 }; \n\nlet clone1 = Object.assign({}, user); \nconsole.log(clone1.name); // John \nconsole.log(clone1.age); // 30\n\nlet clone2 = {...user};\nconsole.log(clone2.name); // John \nconsole.log(clone2.age); // 30\n</code></pre></div><p>: Shallow Copy Limitation\nSpread syntax only creates a shallow copy, meaning it copies only the top-level properties of an object. If the object has nested objects, those nested objects are still referenced, not fully copied. For a deep copy, you can use modern methods like structuredClone.</p>","contentLength":1800,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hallucination Engineer","url":"https://dev.to/jwp/hallucination-engineer-2gf3","date":1740088775,"author":"John Peters","guid":7475,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the realm of software development, the coveted title of Senior Software Engineer once symbolized expertise forged through tech migrations, legacy code revamps, and battles against imposter syndrome.

In this article, we’ll journey through cowsay’s quirky origins, explore its evolution across various programming languages, and reveal how you can effortlessly integrate the Python version of Cowsay into your projects using Javonet.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Origin Story of Cowsay\n</h2><p>Back in the late 90s, developer Tony&nbsp;Monroe decided that the bland command line needed some personality. And thus, cowsay was born! This clever tool transforms any text into an adorable message delivered by an ASCII cow. Originally a playful experiment, cowsay quickly became a cult classic among programmers and Linux enthusiasts, finding its way into scripts, system messages, and geeky jokes everywhere. Thanks to its open-source nature, countless adaptations have emerged, each adding fresh twists to keep cowsay moo-ving along in hacker culture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Cowsay Today: A Classic with a Modern Twist\n</h2><p>Even decades later, cowsay remains a beloved staple in the developer community. What began as a Perl script has since been reimagined in languages like Python, Go, JavaScript, and more. Whether you're working on Windows, building web apps, or coding chatbots, you can always count on cowsay to inject a bit of humor into your day. Not only does it celebrate nostalgia, but its endless variations—ranging from penguins to dragons—showcase its enduring charm.</p><p>The Python cowsay available on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cowsay/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PyPI</a> brings that playful moo to your Python scripts. Meanwhile, Neo Cowsay in Go offers speed and extra features, and JavaScript/Node.js and Ruby variants allow enthusiasts from different communities to join in the fun. One standout is the JavaScript implementation by piuccio, which has already collected over 1.2k stars on GitHub! <a href=\"https://github.com/piuccio/cowsay\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check it out here</a>.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Integration Made Easy with Javonet\n</h2><p>Why rewrite the same functionality in every language when you can simply share the magic? Enter Javonet—a tool that lets you call the Python implementation of cowsay directly from other languages. Imagine having the original Python cowsay as your source of moo magic, available at your fingertips in Node.js, Ruby, Java, and beyond. With Javonet, integrating this playful utility is as easy as pie (or should we say, moo?).</p><p>The Python version of cowsay is delightfully simple.

After digging deeper, I came across a concept that was new to me: . It was causing my derived class to be unsuitable for the interface. I was familiar with method overriding, but I had never encountered method hiding before.</p><p>In this article, I'll walk through the problem I faced, how I solved it, and explain the concepts and differences between method hiding and method overriding.</p><p>I was working on a system where cards were represented by classes implementing  interface. Cards typically implement  indirectly through other interfaces, such as  and , which extend .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The system uses  to dynamically load all the card classes and check which interface they implement. The goal is to populate dictionaries with card instances, keyed by their unique .</p><p>The card  has 2 different ids; therefore, it has 2 card classes:  and , each implementing  with its respective value. Since they refer to the same card, I used inheritance so that their  method remains consistent across both classes. However, I faced a problem: the derived class  wasn't been added to the  dictionary, even though it seemed to be a valid implementation of .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the code above: -  is used to load all types in the assembly that implements the  interface. - We check if the type implement the  or  to add it to the appropriate dictionary. - Lazily initialize the Dictionaries, and when one is initialized, also initializes the other one.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at the  and  classes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The problem occurred when  wasn't appearing in the  dictionary. Even though  correctly implemented  and had its own  method, it was still being ignored when populating the dictionary.</p><p>My first solution was to manually add  to the  class. This worked, and the card started appearing in the dictionary.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>But I was not satisfied with this solution. I have always knew that in OOP when a class extends other, it should be implementing all its interfaces, so why did I need to explicitly write that my derived class was implementing that interface? So I start looking into an answer for this, and I found it. It is called .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Method Hiding and Method Overriding?\n</h2><p>In C#,  occurs when a derived class defines a method with the same name as a method in the base class, but without using the  keyword. This causes the derived class's method to hide the base class's method. When using method hiding, the base class method is not called — instead, the method in the derived class is used only if the reference is specifically of the derived type. This way, since  in the base class was hidden,  no longer fully implemented the  interface, and as a result, it did not implement  either.</p><p>, on the other hand, happens when a derived class uses the override keyword to provide its own implementation of a method from the base class. This ensures that the method in the derived class is called, even if the reference is of the base class type.</p><p>The solution was straightforward: instead of using the  keyword in the  method in , I needed to use  to properly override the method from the base class.

At its core, it is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers, ensuring immutability and transparency. Originally developed for Bitcoin, blockchain’s potential now extends far beyond cryptocurrency, powering innovations in finance, healthcare, supply chain, and more. By eliminating intermediaries, blockchain enhances security, reduces costs, and accelerates processes. This article dives into how blockchain works, its real-world applications, and why it’s poised to dominate the future of digital infrastructure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Blockchain Technology Works: The Mechanics of Decentralization\n</h2><p>Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network where each participant (or node) maintains a copy of the ledger. Here’s a breakdown of its key components:</p><p><strong>1. Distributed Ledger System</strong>\nEvery transaction is recorded in blocks, linked chronologically, and shared across the network. This ensures no single entity controls the data.</p><p><strong>2. Cryptographic Security</strong>\nTransactions are encrypted using advanced algorithms (e.g., SHA-256). Once added, blocks cannot be altered, making the system tamper-proof.</p><p>\nProtocols like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) validate transactions. For example, Bitcoin uses PoW, requiring miners to solve complex puzzles.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Applications of Blockchain Technology Across Industries\n</h2><p>Blockchain’s versatility makes it a game-changer for multiple sectors. <strong>Below are its most impactful use cases:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Financial Services &amp; Cryptocurrency</strong>\nCross-Border Payments: Reduces transfer times from days to minutes.</p><p>: Self-executing agreements (e.g., Ethereum) automate processes like loan approvals.</p><p><strong>2. Supply Chain Management</strong>: Tracks goods from origin to consumer (e.g., IBM Food Trust ensures food safety).</p><p>: Immutable records reduce counterfeit products.</p><p>: Encrypted health records improve privacy.</p><p>: Monitors pharmaceuticals to prevent fake medications.</p><p>\nTransparent Elections: Blockchain-based voting reduces tampering risks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Benefits of Blockchain Technology\n</h2><p><strong>Blockchain’s advantages explain its rapid adoption:</strong>: Data encryption and decentralization deter hacking.</p><p>: All participants view the same data, building trust.</p><p>: Removes intermediaries (e.g., banks, auditors).</p><p>: Real-time settlements replace manual verification.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2><p><strong>Despite its promise, blockchain faces hurdles:</strong>\nNetworks like Bitcoin process only 7 transactions per second (TPS), far slower than Visa’s 24,000 TPS.</p><p>\nPoW mechanisms require massive computational power, raising environmental concerns.</p><p><strong>3. Regulatory Uncertainty</strong>\nGovernments struggle to create policies for decentralized systems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Blockchain Technology: Trends to Watch\n</h2><p><strong>Innovations are addressing current limitations:</strong>\nProtocols like Lightning Network (for Bitcoin) boost transaction speeds.</p><p><strong>2. Green Blockchain Initiatives</strong>\nEco-friendly consensus models, such as Proof of Stake (used by Ethereum 2.0), cut energy use by 99%.</p><p><strong>3. Integration with AI and IoT</strong>\nCombining blockchain with AI improves predictive analytics, while IoT devices leverage it for secure data sharing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Embracing the Blockchain Revolution\n</h2><p>Blockchain technology is more than a buzzword—it’s a foundational shift in data management. From securing digital identities to enabling decentralized finance (DeFi), its applications are limitless. Businesses adopting blockchain early will gain a competitive edge through efficiency, trust, and innovation. As scalability and sustainability improve, blockchain could become as ubiquitous as the internet.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  FAQs About Blockchain Technology\n</h2><p><strong>Q1: How does blockchain improve data security?</strong>\nA: Its decentralized structure and cryptographic hashing make altering data nearly impossible.</p><p><strong>Q2: What’s the difference between blockchain and Bitcoin?</strong>\nA: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency; blockchain is the underlying technology enabling its existence.</p><p><strong>Q3: Can blockchain work without cryptocurrency?</strong>\nA: Yes! Private blockchains (e.g., Hyperledger) are used in supply chains and healthcare without tokens.</p><p><strong>Q4: Is blockchain technology environmentally friendly?</strong>\nA: Newer models like PoS and hybrid consensus reduce energy use significantly.</p>","contentLength":4311,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to get the Oauth providre access tokens from next auth/authjs","url":"https://dev.to/tigawanna/how-to-get-the-oauth-providre-access-tokens-from-next-authauthjs-529j","date":1740081745,"author":"Dennis kinuthia","guid":7425,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Modify your nextauth client and add a callbacks section that will </p><ul><li>get the access token from the oauth provider</li><li>get the user profile from the oauth provider</li><li>store the access token and user profile in the session</li><li>store the access token and user profile in the token</li><li>modify the jwt payload to include the access token and user profile\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>to fix the types create a  file</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div>","contentLength":359,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Learn Amazon Cloudwatch","url":"https://dev.to/tolu_cloudops/learn-amazon-cloudwatch-gf7","date":1740081732,"author":"Tolulope Olawuni","guid":7424,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>AMAZON CLOUDWATCH Pt.2(Hands-on)</h2><h3>Tolulope Olawuni ・ Feb 20</h3>","contentLength":59,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How I Helped a Startup Automate Cloud Infrastructure in Minutes","url":"https://dev.to/thecolossus/how-i-helped-a-startup-automate-cloud-infrastructure-in-minutes-430p","date":1740081562,"author":"Fife Oluwabunmi","guid":7423,"unread":true,"content":"<p>A while ago, I was approached by a Co-Founder to help them push out a new feature and for this feature to work as expected, they needed cloud resources to be created on the fly- easily, quickly without any additional configuration and they needed it as part of a workflow. </p><p>Now from that brief description, the obvious technology that can make this possible is Infrastructure as Code- but figuring that part out is the easy part.

Is it years of experience? A job title handed out like candy? Or just an excuse to act like you’re better than everyone else? Let’s break it down.</p><p>What Does “Senior Developer” Actually Mean?</p><p>Most job descriptions will tell you it’s about experience—five years, ten years, whatever number HR pulled from a hat. But we all know developers who have been writing code for a decade and still produce spaghetti that would make an Italian grandmother cry.</p><p>On the flip side, I’ve seen devs with three years under their belt who write cleaner, more maintainable code than so-called “veterans.” So, clearly, time served isn’t the defining factor.</p><p>The Real Signs of a Senior Developer</p><p>Forget the job description. If you want to know whether someone is truly “senior,” look for these signs:</p><ol><li>They Know When NOT to Code</li><li>Junior devs want to write code for everything. Seniors know that the best solution is sometimes no code at all. Can we configure instead of build? Can we reuse something instead of reinventing? That’s the real magic.</li><li>They Don’t Worship Any Tech Stack</li><li>A real senior dev doesn’t sound like a salesperson for React, Rust, or whatever framework is trending this week. They pick the best tool for the job, not the one they read about on Hacker News.</li><li>They Make the Team Better, Not Just the Code</li><li>If you think being senior is about writing the best code, you’re missing the point. The best senior devs mentor others, improve processes, and leave the codebase in a better state than they found it.</li><li>They Handle Feedback Without Melting Down</li><li>Junior devs get defensive in code reviews. Seniors welcome feedback, fix their mistakes, and know that “perfect code” is a myth.</li><li>Business needs &gt; personal preferences. Seniors understand that code exists to serve a purpose, not to satisfy their desire for the latest design pattern.</li></ol><p>Too many developers think “senior” means they don’t have to listen anymore. They dismiss ideas from juniors, refuse to touch “boring” parts of the system, and act like their way is the only way. That’s not senior—that’s just arrogant.</p><p>A true senior dev doesn’t flaunt their title. They lead by example, adapt, and know that learning never stops. If you need to tell people you’re a senior dev, you’re probably not one.</p><p>Final Thought: Do Titles Even Matter?</p><p>At the end of the day, titles don’t write code—people do. Whether you’re “junior,” “mid,” or “senior,” the real question is: Are you making your team and codebase better? If the answer is yes, congrats—you’re doing it right. If not, maybe it’s time to rethink what “senior” actually means.</p>","contentLength":2712,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Best Websites for Web Design Inspiration","url":"https://dev.to/epicx/the-best-websites-for-web-design-inspiration-2g2n","date":1740078555,"author":"Rimsha Jalil","guid":7394,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Finding the right inspiration is key to creating outstanding web designs.

You'll discover the fundamentals of color spaces, learn why OKLCH offers better color manipulation than HSL, and understand how to replicate Tailwind's color system for your own custom colors.</p><p>Tailwind CSS <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently released v4</a> with several new features. A key change is that <strong>colors are now defined using OKLCH notation</strong>, such as <code>oklch(0.685 0.169 237.323)</code>. I had never encountered this color notation before and I saw that it enabled more vivid colors. My nerd curiosity kicked in, leading me to explore high-gamut color spaces and discover why OKLCH notation is better than HSL.</p><p>During this time, I also needed to create custom colors for a Tailwind CSS project. This presented the perfect opportunity for learning and some late-night hacking sessions. The result was <a href=\"https://www.uihue.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uihue.com</a>. In this article, I'll share what I learned and explain the algorithm I developed to generate color hues.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSS color module level 4</a> specification introduces new syntax for expressing colors in the standard sRGB color space with  or . The modern syntax separates color components with  instead of commas, uses a  for the optional alpha value, and allows mixing  with numbers. For example,  becomes .</p><p>More significantly, this specification introduces <strong>new ways to define colors</strong> using different color spaces. But what exactly is a color space?</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Color Spaces: how we see and define colors\n</h3><p>Let's start with what a color is. A  is our visual perception of matter based on its electromagnetic spectrum (the amount of light at each visible frequency that travels from an object to our eyes). For objects that don't emit light, color depends on the spectrum of the light hitting them and how they absorb and reflect it. For objects that do emit light, we must also consider their emission spectrum—how much light they emit at each visible frequency.</p><p>The CSS specification defines color as \"a definition (numeric or textual) of the human visual perception of a light or a physical object illuminated with light.\" For the specification's purposes, what matters is <strong>how a color can be expressed as a string or number</strong>.</p><p>In this regard, the specification defines a  as \"an organization of colors with respect to an underlying colorimetric model, such that there is a clear, objectively measurable meaning for any color in that color space.\" A single color can be expressed in different color spaces, though some colors may only be represented in certain color spaces.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Color Gamut: from sRGB to Modern Display Standards\n</h3><p>No display can reproduce all the colors that the human eye can perceive. The range of colors a display can produce is called a \".\" Most modern displays show colors in the \"sRGB\" color space's gamut, which covers about 35% of all human-visible colors. These colors can be expressed using the  or hex notation (e.g. ).</p><p>Modern devices, particularly Apple computers and phones, can display a broader range of colors—usually more saturated ones. This capability requires new color spaces and notation forms to express these wider gamuts.</p><p>Color spaces, arranged from smallest to largest gamut, are:  ⇒  ⇒ Adobe RGB 98 ⇒  ⇒ ProPhoto RGB. Current Apple devices can usually display colors up to the REC.2020 color space gamut.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Color Space Components and Notation\n</h3><p>Colors in a CSS color space notation are represented as a list of  (also called \"channels\") that represent components along the . Each channel has a minimum and maximum value, and any color with values outside these ranges is considered .</p><p>We won't discuss the additional alpha component, which controls transparency, as it can be considered a post-processing operation that blends a color with whatever is beneath it. </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Examples of color notations:\n</h4><ul><li> defines colors in the sRGB color space using  channels</li><li> defines colors in the sRGB color space using <strong>hue, saturation, and lightness</strong> in the HSL cylindrical coordinate model</li></ul><p>CSS level 4 introduces additional color notations:  for sRGB,  and  for CIELAB, and  and  for Oklab, along with a general  function for various color spaces. </p><p>In this article, we'll focus on —the most relevant option and the one Tailwind v4 uses for its predefined colors. We won't delve into technical topics like the differences between CIE Lab and Oklab color spaces or cartesian versus cylindrical coordinates.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  OKLCH: A Better Way to Express Color\n</h2><p>The OKLCH color notation is based on the Oklab color space, designed to enhance perceptual uniformity, hue and lightness prediction, and color blending. It was <a href=\"https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced by Björn Ottosson</a> in December 2020. OKLCH represents colors using cylindrical coordinates in the Oklab color space.</p><p>Here are the three key aspects of the OKLCH notation:</p><ol><li><strong>It allows colors to be expressed in the P3 or REC.2020 gamut</strong>—colors beyond what , , or hex formats can represent. This future-proof notation can even define colors that current devices cannot yet display.</li><li>Its coordinates are:\n\n<ol><li>: ranges from 0 to 1, or 0% to 100%</li><li><strong>C (Chroma, or saturation)</strong>: ranges from 0 to infinity (but it always stays below 0.37 in the P3 color space)</li><li>: ranges from 0 to 360 degrees</li></ol></li><li>It uses <strong>perception-based lightness and saturation</strong>, solving major perceptual issues found in HSL notation and enabling easier color manipulation (see next section)</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  HSL's Perceptual Limitations\n</h3><p>Let's explore the two major perceptual limitations of HSL and the sRGB color space.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Variable Maximum Saturation\n</h4><p>In HSL, the maximum saturation remains constant across all hues. However, in reality, maximum saturation varies depending on both hue and lightness—this applies to both displays and the human eye.</p><p>I recommend checking out the excellent OKLCH color picker at <a href=\"https://oklch.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oklch.com</a>. Be sure to enable the \"Show 3D\" switch (because who doesn't love going full nerd?) to view the 3D model of the color space. At the \"base\" of these \"color mountains\" you'll find a Hue/Lightness diagram with zero Chroma (showing only grays), while the mountains' heights represent the maximum Chroma available across different hues and lightness levels.</p><p>You can see from these two images of the 3D OKLCH color space (from <a href=\"https://oklch.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oklch.com</a>) how greens have a higher maximum chroma compared to yellows and how blue reaches its highest chroma at low lightness levels.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Non-Uniform Lightness in HSL\n</h4><p>A critical issue with HSL is that its lightness values don't align with human visual perception across different hues. Two colors can have the same HSL lightness value yet appear completely different in brightness to our eyes.</p><p>The Oklch notation in the Oklab color space solves this problem by ensuring that identical lightness values create the same perceived brightness.</p><p>The example below illustrates this difference: colors with the same HSL lightness can look dramatically different in brightness. However, when we change only the hue in Oklch while keeping the lightness constant, all colors appear equally bright.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  OKLCH in Practice: Three Game-Changing Benefits\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  Better Color Manipulation\n</h4><p>As we saw, OKLCH ensures that Lightness and Chroma values are perceptually consistent across all hues. This enables <strong>better mathematical color manipulation</strong>. When you need a specific lightness level to ensure sufficient contrast with white text, OKLCH provides reliable results, unlike HSL. This makes color adjustment functions like darken/lighten more reliable.</p><p>While HSL gradients tend to create unwanted gray areas when colors mix, OKLCH's perceptually uniform model produces smooth, visually balanced gradient transitions.</p><p>OKLCH lets us express and use colors with a higher gamut, producing more vibrant, eye-catching designs that modern devices can display. While the image on the left appears more saturated, it has been converted to sRGB due to Dev.to's image processing, but it still illustrates the concept.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Browser Compatibility and Fallback Strategy\n</h3><p>With all these advantages of OKLCH in mind, you might wonder about browser support. The good news is that as of early 2025, OKLCH enjoys full support across all major modern browsers. And when colors fall outside a display's gamut, browsers automatically handle the conversion to a supported gamut.</p><h2><strong>Decoding Tailwind's Color Architecture</strong></h2><p>Do you know how many color types (different hues) Tailwind includes? You might guess 10 or 12? Maybe 15?</p><p>Actually, there are 22! They are: Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Lime, Green, Emerald, Teal, Cyan, Sky, Blue, Indigo, Violet, Purple, Fuchsia, Pink, Rose, Slate, Gray, Zinc, Neutral, and Stone—plus black and white, making it 24 in total.</p><p>Each of these color types has a palette of 11 different shades (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 950). The 50 shade represents the lightest color, while 950 represents the darkest.</p><p>Before Tailwind v4, these colors were defined in the sRGB color space using HSL or HEX format. With Tailwind v4, colors are now defined using the OKLCH format in the Oklab color space. This change allowed Tailwind expert designers to choose colors outside the sRGB gamut—in fact, you will find some more saturated colors that exist only in the P3 gamut.</p><h3><strong>Anatomy of a Tailwind Color Palette</strong></h3><p>You might expect the hue and saturation to remain constant across the whole palette, and the lightness to decrease linearly from 50 to 950—especially since the Oklab model is perceptually uniform, right?</p><p>I am sorry to disappoint you: all these assumptions are wrong. You can see the charts for all the new Tailwind colors, showing how lightness, chroma, and hue change across different shades, here: <a href=\"https://www.uihue.com/tailwind-colors-charts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.uihue.com/tailwind-colors-charts</a></p><p>As you can see, none of these diagrams follows a linear pattern. I stumbled upon this surprising discovery while trying to replicate Tailwind's palette-building approach for custom color palettes.</p><p>Don't worry though—let's try to break down the underlying patterns.</p><p>The Lightness follows a non-linear curve that remains fairly consistent across color palettes, though grays show a steeper decrease in the darker shades.</p><p>The chroma (saturation) follows a Gaussian curve pattern, peaking between the \"400\" and \"600\" shades, with a sharper decrease in the lighter shades (toward the left side).</p><p>In the charts, hue values have been normalized by subtracting the minimum hue value. Without this normalization, hues near 0° (like reds) would show larger min-max differences than higher hues (like violet). This normalization allows you to better compare hue variations across the entire spectrum.</p><p>Looking at <a href=\"https://www.uihue.com/tailwind-colors-charts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all the charts</a>, you'll notice that hue remains fairly consistent across different shades, with two notable exceptions: yellows shift toward orange in darker shades, and blues shift toward violet in darker shades.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  From Analysis to Algorithm: Recreating Tailwind's Colors\n</h3><p>My mathematical mind's first instinct was to derive three —for lightness, chroma, and hue—across all colors (maybe with separate rules for colors and grays). I planned to use a Fourier transform to approximate these curves and create a clean rule for generating new colors.</p><p>However, this approach wouldn't work. I wanted to achieve the highest possible fidelity in replicating Tailwind colors, but averaging would have flattened the subtle hue differences that make each palette special. I would have lost crucial nuances, like how yellows become more orange when darker, or how azure shifts toward blue-violet. Then a much simpler idea struck me.</p><p>I could simply identify the nearest Tailwind color for any given input color and apply the same rules that Tailwind uses for that nearest color. So, the first step was to find the nearest Tailwind color to the user's chosen color.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Finding the Nearest Color\n</h4><p>Given a collection of colors and a target color, how do we determine which color in the collection is closest to our target? Simple: we test each color, measure the distance, and choose the one with the minimum distance. But this raises another question: how do we define the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distance between two colors</a>?</p><p>The simplest approach uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Euclidean distance</a> across the N axes of the color representation (essentially applying the Pythagorean theorem in N dimensions). In the sRGB color space, for example, we could calculate the Euclidean distance using the R, G, and B axes:</p><p>Unfortunately, this distance calculation isn't very effective. Consider the example in the following image: blue and violet have a greater Euclidean distance than yellow and orange, even though they appear much more similar to our eyes.</p><p>If we switch to a perceptually uniform color space, such as Lab, the Euclidean distance becomes much more reliable.</p><p>I then learned about a family of algorithms called \"DeltaE\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIELAB_%CE%94E*\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeltaE</a>) (ΔE), specifically designed to calculate the difference between two colors. The first version, the CIE 1976 formula, simply used the Euclidean distance of colors in the Lab color space. However, when Lab proved less perceptually uniform than initially thought, the algorithm went through several revisions in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CMC_l:c_(1984)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1984</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIE94\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1994</a>, and finally <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2000</a>—resulting in the most accurate, though most complex, Lab-based DeltaE algorithm to date.</p><p>I used the DeltaE 2000 algorithm implementation from the <a href=\"https://colorjs.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colorjs.io</a> library to iterate through the Tailwind CSS colors and find the nearest match. I'm also interested in testing a simpler Euclidean distance calculation in a more advanced color space like <a href=\"https://www.color.org/events/prague/MuhammadSafdar2017.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JzCzhz</a>.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Generating Color Palettes: The Algorithm\n</h4><p>Now that we have the nearest Tailwind color (let's say it's \"sky-700\"), we can proceed with generating a complete palette.</p><p>The user's selected color becomes the \"700\" shade in the palette—our \"base shade.\" From there, we need to generate both lighter and darker shades.</p><p>A simple approach would be to take the hue of the user's selected color and apply the same lightness and chroma values from the nearest Tailwind color for each shade.</p><p>However, this would cause us to lose the unique characteristics of the user's color, for example lower saturation or slightly lower lightness compared to the Tailwind color. </p><p>Simply applying Tailwind's lightness and chroma deltas from the base shade seemed promising, but this approach could produce completely desaturated colors at the extreme ends of the palette.</p><p>Instead, I applied these deltas with a smoothing effect as we approach the extreme light and dark hues. This preserves the color's distinctive features where they matter most—in the middle shades—while ensuring balanced results for the lightest and darkest shades.</p><p>As developers, we know naming things is one of the hardest tasks. When I needed to give each user's color pick in uihue a beautiful name, I faced quite a challenge.</p><p>Initially, I considered using the standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HTML 4.01 named colors</a> like \"red,\" \"lime,\" \"aliceblue,\" or \"papayawhip.\" But with only 148 named colors available, this wouldn't provide enough unique names for the vast spectrum of possible colors.</p><p>I then found <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-name-list\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a massive list</a> containing over 30k colors. However, calculating 30k color distances for each color pick would be unnecessarily resource-intensive. Instead, I settled on using <a href=\"https://chir.ag/projects/ntc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NTC colors</a>—a collection of 1,566 names that provides enough variety to find beautiful color names without excessive CPU usage.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  User-Friendly OKLCH Color Selection\n</h2><p>As far as I know, there's just one dedicated color picker for the OKLCH color space: the excellent tool at <a href=\"https://oklch.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oklch.com</a>. While it's really great and features the neat 3D representation of the color space, this kind of interface might intimidate users who aren't familiar with how OKLCH works.</p><p>Instead, I decided to implement a standard HSL color picker in the sRGB color space, convert the color to OKLCH, and then let users increase the chroma with a simple slider. The interface clearly shows when colors enter higher gamuts like P3 or REC2020.</p><p>I'm very satisfied with the result: users find it both user-friendly and fun to use.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Accessible Color Contrast\n</h2><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.uihue.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uihue.com</a> app, I display color shade numbers over the colored squares of the generated palette, using either light or dark text.</p><p>How do I determine which text color provides better contrast against each shade's background? Simple—I measure the contrast ratio for both options and choose the higher one.</p><p>I chose to implement the APCA algorithm (through the <a href=\"https://colorjs.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colorjs.io</a> library), as it offers the best performance and is being considered for inclusion in version 3 of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p><p>In this journey through color spaces and Tailwind's color system, we've explored the advantages of OKLCH over traditional color notations, particularly in web development. The transition to OKLCH in Tailwind v4 represents a significant step forward in how we handle colors in modern web design, offering better perceptual uniformity, wider gamut support, and more reliable color manipulations.</p><p>As display capabilities improve, the OKLCH color space will become increasingly important. It enables us to create more vibrant, accessible, and visually appealing designs while maintaining precise control over color relationships and contrast ratios.</p><p>Through the development of <a href=\"https://www.uihue.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uihue.com</a>, we've seen how understanding color spaces and implementing smart color-matching algorithms can bridge the gap between technical color theory and practical web development needs. The complexity behind Tailwind's carefully crafted color palettes reveals that even seemingly simple color choices involve intricate patterns and thoughtful design decisions.</p>","contentLength":17599,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"DevOps Roadmap for Beginners: A Step-by-Step Guide to Master DevOps","url":"https://dev.to/yash_sonawane25/devops-roadmap-for-beginners-a-step-by-step-guide-to-master-devops-2j0n","date":1740076907,"author":"Yash Sonawane","guid":7376,"unread":true,"content":"<p>#devops #cloud #beginners #roadmap</p><p>The tech landscape is evolving rapidly, and DevOps has become a critical methodology for delivering software efficiently, with fewer errors, and fostering collaboration between teams.

Even though the template I’m using already scores well, I wanted to dive deeper into performance techniques to learn more and potentially push those scores even higher. Here’s what I’ve discovered so far:</p><p>\nLighthouse is a built-in tool in Chrome DevTools that evaluates your site on performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. While testing, I discovered features like Cognition Mode—which simulates how accessible your site is for users with cognitive disabilities. A quick tip: Browser extensions (like ad blockers) can sometimes interfere with these tests, so I recommend running Lighthouse in incognito mode to get the most accurate results.</p><p><strong>Experimenting with Lazy Loading</strong>\nWhat is Lazy Loading?<p>\nLazy loading is a technique that delays the loading of images or components until they are actually needed—such as when they appear on screen. This approach reduces initial load times and improves overall user experience.</p></p><p>How I Implemented Lazy Loading\nFor Images: I added the native HTML attribute to images:</p><p>For Components: In React, you can use React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when needed:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;img src=\"example.jpg\" alt=\"Example\" loading=\"lazy\" /&gt;\n\nconst OtherComponent = React.lazy(() =&gt; import('./OtherComponent'));\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;OtherComponent /&gt;\n    &lt;/Suspense&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>These small tweaks ensure that only the essential resources load initially, making for a smoother and faster experience.</p><p><strong>Diving into Code Splitting</strong>\nWhat is Code Splitting?<p>\nCode splitting breaks your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that load on demand. This means users download only what they need at first, speeding up the initial load.</p></p><p>A Practical Example in Next.js\nWith Next.js, dynamic imports make code splitting straightforward:</p><div><pre><code>import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';\n\nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =&gt; import('../components/OtherComponent'));\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return &lt;DynamicComponent /&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Even though my template already performs well, this technique is crucial for scaling up and ensuring that larger projects remain fast.</p><p><strong>Using Debounce to Optimize Event Handling</strong>\nWhat is Debounce?<p>\nDebouncing is a method to limit how often a function gets called. It’s especially useful for events that fire rapidly, like key presses or scroll events. Instead of triggering a function on every event, debounce waits for a specified delay after the last event before executing.</p></p><div><pre><code>let timeout;\n\nfunction debounce(func, delay) {\n  return (...args) =&gt; {\n    clearTimeout(timeout);\n    timeout = setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n      func(...args);\n    }, delay);\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage example for an input change event:\nconst handleInputChange = debounce((value) =&gt; {\n  console.log(\"Debounced value:\", value);\n}, 300);\n</code></pre></div><p>While the performance boost might not drastically change my Lighthouse scores, debouncing is a practical tool that improves user experience by reducing unnecessary processing.</p><p>\nEven though I haven’t launched my portfolio site yet, experimenting with these techniques has been an invaluable learning experience. Sharing this journey shows both potential employers and technical teams that I’m proactive, detail-oriented, and committed to building efficient, high-performance web applications.</p><p>I’m excited to continue refining these improvements and eventually share my live portfolio results.

Today, I would like to share a small achievement that our project has received after 9 months of work on it! Check it out (and <a href=\"https://github.com/hmpl-language/hmpl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support us with the star</a> if you like it - thank you! ❤️). We will talk about the history of the creation of the template language below and the path we have taken in general.</strong></p><p>The development of the template language began in the spring of 2024. At that time, I was finishing work on <a href=\"https://github.com/Camplejs/Cample.js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cample.js</a>, as I had achieved one of the fastest speeds for frameworks on the Internet. After that, I wanted to create something new that continued to be a framework, since at that time I understood that I had done everything I could.</p><p>Then, I had an idea to take what I was doing for the framework into a separate template language for convenient work with the server. The first steps were quite small, but the layout of what I wanted to do was already taking shape. Then, the first version of HMPL was called  (not a fancy name, of course 👽), but it described what needed to be done.</p><p>The code, of course, was then as simple as possible, but the first version was like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>At that time it was extremely cumbersome, but even then the start had been given.</p><p>Then, of course, it was impossible to work normally with such a bad name. Too much space was taken up by symbols that could be shortened. Nothing better was thought up than to call it , simply joining the old name together.</p><p>The first version under the new name was also released somewhere in May, I simply copied the code from the old version to the new one, and over the next year we were refining the project to the state it is in now. During this time, the repository was changed from the old to the new one, which was created in November.</p><p>I want to give a huge thank you to the contributors who helped and help make the project better. Without their help, it would be difficult, since it is simply impossible to implement something that should work as it should.</p><p>All contributors from the <a href=\"https://github.com/hmpl-language/hmpl/discussions/2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old repository</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/hmpl-language/hmpl/graphs/contributors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new</a> one, many thanks to them all again ❤️!</p><p>With this, things are always  (ᵕ—ᴗ—). I focused only on development and did not think at all about the need to somehow promote it or something like that. For me, the main <strong>goal was different - to close those necessary issues every day, without which it would be simply impossible to use it today</strong>.</p><p>But at least I created a blog on dev.to, and I also tweet about it sometimes, and I created a <a href=\"https://blog.hmpl-lang.dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog</a> where we also share our thoughts. I also write about it sometimes and other things, so you can check out all the resources.</p><p>Also, you can support us by giving a star to our project on GitHub! Thank you 🌊!</p><p>Make a cool template language, how else?) In fact, a <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/hmpl-language/projects/5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roadmap</a> was recently made that describes what needs to be done by 2025.</p><p>\n\n  // Detect dark theme\n  var iframe = document.getElementById('tweet-1891829442575581660-775');\n  if (document.body.className.includes('dark-theme')) {\n    iframe.src = \"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?id=1891829442575581660&amp;theme=dark\"\n  }\n\n\n\n</p><p>There are not so many tasks, but as development will be added. After all, \"competitors\" HTMX and Apine.js, so the template language must have more functionality <strong>to be the best tool of all, but, for this also work!</strong></p><p>I would like to express my enormous gratitude to everyone who supported and supports the project with their likes, comments, contributions, and just activity. This is very important to us and I hope that we can continue to do something cool and interesting for the template language!

This wasn’t a routine transition. It required detailed planning to prevent downtime and operational disruption while addressing technical complexities like repository structure and scalability.</p><p>Like Reddit’s experience, <a href=\"https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@4.4/admin/migration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">code migration</a> has become critical for organizations modernizing their systems to stay competitive. These migrations introduce significant operational and architectural challenges, particularly in distributed systems and legacy architectures. Businesses risk data compatibility issues, delays, and rising costs without careful management.</p><p>This guide explores how AI tools can simplify complex migrations while maintaining efficiency and business continuity. Let’s begin by examining the common obstacles organizations face during code migrations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key challenges in code migration\n</h2><p>Compared to Reddit’s migration of 2,000 repositories, the stakes are even higher for organizations transitioning from monolithic architectures to microservices.</p><p>Here’s what makes large-scale migrations so challenging:</p><p><strong>Keeping systems running smoothly</strong>\nMaintaining uptime during a migration is no small feat. It often means juggling feature flags, parallel systems, and complex database transitions while avoiding disruptions to everyday operations.</p><p><strong>Balancing data integrity and change</strong>\nAs data models evolve, preserving integrity across versions becomes a puzzle. Backward compatibility and rolling out new features demand sophisticated transformation layers and constant oversight.</p><p><strong>Navigating business impacts</strong>\nPoor planning can bring operations to a halt. When <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/case-studies/factset-migrates-from-perforce-to-github\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FactSet migrated from Perforce to GitHub</a>, they had to anticipate potential compatibility issues and avoid bottlenecks in their development cycles.</p><p><strong>Managing dependencies and integrations</strong>\nToday’s applications are interconnected ecosystems. Version mismatches, deprecated APIs, third-party updates, and overlooked security patches can create ripple effects that disrupt entire systems.</p><p><strong>Time, resources, and human effort</strong>\nTraditional migrations often rely heavily on manual labor. This slows progress and increases the risk of errors, inflates costs, and delays the launch of new features.</p><p>These challenges underline why migrations are often seen as challenging. But with the right tools, they don’t have to be. Let’s examine how AI can simplify these complexities and deliver better outcomes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI simplifies code migration\n</h2><p>AI tools automate migration tasks, reduce errors, and accelerate delivery. Here’s how they help:</p><p><strong>Understanding code in context</strong>\nAI analyzes codebases to identify patterns and dependencies, making tasks like API migrations seamless. In the screenshot, the AI suggests precise updates with added features based on context.</p><p>\nAI speeds up migrations by 60%, cuts bugs, and boosts productivity:</p><ul><li><p>Fewer bugs: AI catches issues missed in manual reviews, reducing technical debt.</p></li><li><p>Higher productivity: Automating repetitive tasks improves PR merge times and developer satisfaction.</p></li></ul><p>Refactoring at scale\nAI applies consistent fixes across large codebases. For instance, Reddit used AI to detect anti-patterns and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/?rdt=53948\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refactor the 2,000 repositories</a> efficiently (see example in screenshot).</p><p>\nAI maps dependencies, predicts change impacts and generates logs to simplify troubleshooting and handovers.</p><p>\nAI evolves with every migration, suggesting better patterns, flagging risks, and aligning with coding standards.</p><p>Next, we’ll explore specific migration types AI can handle.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Types of code migrations AI can handle\n</h2><p>Some of the code migration tasks that AI can include:</p><p><strong>Language version upgrades</strong>\nUpgrading language versions, like Python 2 to Python 3 or Java 8 to Java 11, is a common migration scenario. AI excels at identifying and transforming syntax changes, deprecated features, and API modifications, just like this example:</p><p>\nWhether transitioning from Angular.js to Angular or Spring to Micronaut, AI tools can understand framework-specific patterns and generate equivalent code. For example:</p><p><strong>Database schema migrations</strong>\nAI systems have become particularly adept at handling database migrations, including schema changes, ORM updates, and query optimizations. AI can analyze existing database structures and generate appropriate migration scripts while maintaining data integrity:</p><p><strong>Architectural transformations</strong>\nOne of the most complex migrations involves architectural changes, such as moving from monolithic to microservices architecture. AI tools can analyze dependencies, suggest service boundaries, and help maintain system functionality during the transition:</p><p>The next section will show you steps to automate your migration process. Let us get into it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Automating code migration: A step-by-step AI guide\n</h2><p>To follow this guide, we’ll use Sourcegraph’s code intelligence AI, which includes prompts and custom commands. These features allow you to:</p><ul><li>Work with context-aware prompts tailored to your codebase.</li><li>Apply best practices across multiple programming languages.</li><li>Choose from different generative models for flexibility and precision.</li></ul><p>Before starting, make sure Sourcegraph is set up in your code editor. For installation instructions, refer to the <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official documentation</a>.</p><p>With these tools in place, let’s walk-through how to automate code migrations efficiently and reduce risks.</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Initial assessment and planning</strong>\nSourcegraph's AI analyzes repository structures, dependencies, and code patterns to build a comprehensive migration strategy. For example, it can scan your codebase and automatically identify:</p><ul><li>Deprecated API usage patterns</li><li>Legacy framework dependencies</li><li>Outdated language features</li><li>Complex inheritance hierarchies</li></ul><p>You can configure it to identify specific patterns relevant to your migration using custom commands or prompts. The example below shows how I prompted Sourcegraph AI with context to my codebase to draft out my migration strategy:</p><p><strong>Phase 2: Defining migration rules</strong>\nSourcegraph's AI intelligent prompting system allows you to define clear migration rules through natural language. For instance, we will ask the AI to provide rules for its migration strategy so that workflows will not be broken, downtimes will be curbed, and the transition will be easy.  </p><p>The results in the image below are migration rules to follow while implementing the migration strategies that the AI tool generated earlier.</p><p><strong>Phase 3: Staged migration execution</strong>\nThe migration process is executed in carefully planned stages, with the AI providing:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Context-aware transformations:</strong> Sourcegraph’s AI understands the full context of your code, ensuring changes maintain business logic and system integrity. When transforming code, it considers:</p><ul></ul></li><li><p><strong>Intelligent code smell detection:</strong> Throughout the migration, the AI identifies potential issues like:</p><ul><li>Inconsistent error handling</li></ul></li></ol><p>At this stage, we can create personalized prompts or custom commands for the features or changes we want to make in the codebase. We can also use the chat feature, pass the file(s) in question as context, and add our prompt so Sourcegraph’s AI will give us a new version of that piece or group of code. Here is an example to fix the error handling issue the AI detected as an anti-pattern in our code:</p><p><strong>Phase 4: Validation and testing</strong>\nSourcegraph's AI advanced validation capabilities ensure the migration's success through automated tests. In this phase, we can create a prompt/custom command or use the chat interface to generate unit tests for any module, function, or service in our new migration code. For the new error-handling service in the migration, here is a sample prompt to write tests for it using AI:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best practices for secure code migrations\n</h2><p>A robust security framework must be implemented throughout migration to protect sensitive data, maintain compliance, and ensure business continuity. Here are some security and compliance best practices for code migration:</p><ul><li><p>Conduct extensive testing before migration, including performance stress testing to validate system behavior under load and staged rollouts to minimize risk. Ensure a comprehensive strategy with clear rollback procedures for immediate execution if needed.</p></li><li><p>Outline scope, timeline, and impacts to identify potential business disruptions and mitigation strategies. Track changes via version control with audit trails and use <a href=\"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Atlassian-Migration-Program/Migration-Runbook/ba-p/1728726\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">migration runbooks</a> for consistent, error-free execution.</p></li><li><p>Configure firewalls to secure source and target environments. Maintain environment isolation by separating development, staging, and production with proper access controls.</p></li><li><p>Define emergency response procedures for handling issues during migration. Establish communication protocols to keep stakeholders informed and escalation paths to engage relevant teams quickly.</p></li></ul><p>While we look at the general best practices, we should also consider the security implications of the AI tool we use in the migration process. Some of the essential security measures used by Sourcegraph to protect your code are:</p><ul><li>Compliance Monitoring: <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/enterprise/features#guardrails\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guardrails</a> enforce coding standards and prevent AI from replicating copyrighted code using verification mechanisms.</li><li>Self-Hosting: Enterprises can self-host Sourcegraph AI for complete control, following this <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/core-concepts/enterprise-architecture\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">setup guidance</a>.</li></ul><p>As organizations grow their systems, complex code migrations pose significant challenges, from maintaining system continuity to managing data integrity and operational impacts. Without careful oversight, businesses risk disruptions and increased costs during these transitions. </p><p>AI tools, such as Sourcegraph, can simplify the migration process by automating error-prone tasks and enhancing code quality, thereby reducing completion times by <a href=\"https://hopp.tech/resources/data-migration-blog/ai-driven-migration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">up to 60%</a> and improving developer productivity.</p><p>Check out <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/cody/chat\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sourcegraph</a> today to begin your journey toward faster, more secure, and more efficient code migrations.</p>","contentLength":9848,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Integrating LLM into Your App: A Beginner’s Guide","url":"https://dev.to/bigya/integrating-llm-into-your-app-a-beginners-guide-409m","date":1740068220,"author":"Bigya","guid":7299,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, Llama 3.3, DeepSeek-R1, Phi-4, Mistral, Gemma 2, etc have revolutionized how we build intelligent applications.

This has been the game changer and I can't thank him enough for the invite, and Tanner for letting me in!</p><p>I now have the privilege to see some of the behind the scenes of what it takes to develop and maintain huge and successful libraries like TanStack Query, Router, Start, and Table. I'm having fun helping Form get to 1.0 (hopefully soon!) but in the meantime, I can see how the other maintainers think and cooperate with each other and with the community, their passion, and how some of the most brilliant minds in the Open Source space approach problems and find solutions.</p><p>I can't describe how inspiring and motivating this is for me and I do really want to keep learning from the best and contribute back to the community.</p><p>With over 3.000 hours of watch time on my TanStack videos on YouTube, I feel I can do my part in helping developers get onboarded in the TanStack ecosystem and I want to keep doing that. I believe that sharing knowledge and helping people is a nice way of being helpful to the community.</p><p>I'm not the smartest guy in the room and I probably won't be in any case, but that's not the point. Each of us has different skills and passions and if I can help with something I'm probably good at, that's my place in the community!</p><p>You'll keep finding me around the Form project and on YouTube talking about TanStack libraries for a while, I hope my effort can help you build your next successful project!</p><p>What a fantastic year, I can't wait to see what's next! 🚀</p><p>Thanks for reading this article, I hope you found it interesting!</p><p>Do you like my content?

Where Web3 isn’t just a buzzword but a fully realized ecosystem that has redefined the internet… and no, it’s not just about overpriced JPEGs anymore (yes, we’re looking at you, 2021 NFTs). Open source has become the backbone of this revolution, driving decentralized applications (dApps) and fostering community-driven innovation like never before. Let’s dive in and explore how these two forces—open source and Web3—are shaping our future.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Magic of Open Source in Web3\n</h2><p>Open source is like that one generous friend who shares their Netflix password. Except in this case, they’re sharing the code that powers revolutionary technologies. Web3 thrives on transparency, decentralization, and trust, making open source the perfect match. Here’s why:</p><ul><li>: Developers worldwide can contribute to protocols, smart contracts, and dApps. Think of it as a global hackathon where the prize is a better internet for everyone.</li><li>: Skeptical about a project? Just audit the code yourself. Open source ensures there’s no shady business happening behind closed doors.</li><li>: Projects like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana encourage building on top of their platforms. It’s like LEGO—everything fits together (well, most of the time).</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  dApps: The Apps You Need but Didn’t Know You Wanted\n</h2><p>Decentralized Applications (dApps) are redefining what apps can do. Forget the days of handing over your data to Big Tech in exchange for a “free” service. Here’s why dApps are winning hearts:</p><ul><li> You’re in control of your data, identity, and funds. It’s like saying, “I’ll hold onto my popcorn, thank you very much.”</li><li>: dApps often use tokens to give governance rights to users. Imagine if your Starbucks points let you decide the next Frappuccino flavor.</li><li>: No banks, no middlemen, no drama. dApps make financial and social tools available to anyone with internet access.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Notable Open Source Web3 Projects to watch in 2025\n</h2><ul><li>Ethereum: The OG smart contract platform. Its open source ecosystem powers the majority of the dApps we love.</li><li>IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): Decentralized storage that’s basically Dropbox on steroids.</li><li>Lens Protocol: A decentralized social graph for Web3 social media. Imagine Facebook without Zuckerberg.</li><li>Nillion: Privacy-focused decentralized computation. It’s like Web3’s version of a super-secret diary.</li></ul><p>Of course, the road to decentralization isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. We’re still dealing with:</p><ul><li> Remember when Ethereum gas fees were higher than your rent?</li><li>: Explaining wallets and seed phrases to your grandma is… not fun.</li><li>: Governments are still figuring out how to tax your DeFi gains.</li></ul><p>Unlike the speculative mania of previous years, 2025 is all about usability. We’re seeing:</p><ul><li>Seamless wallet integrations</li><li>Scalable Layer 2 solutions</li><li>User-friendly dApps that even non-techies can navigate</li></ul><p>Open source and Web3 are like peanut butter and jelly—better together. As we move further into 2025, the innovations in decentralized applications will continue to blur the lines between technology and community. Whether you’re a developer, a user, or just someone curious about what’s next, this is your time to dive in.</p><p>And remember, in the words of every Web3 meme ever:</p>","contentLength":3237,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How I did the setup for my mobile app project (ReactNative & Expo)","url":"https://dev.to/royson_menezes_479ed50941/how-i-did-the-setup-for-my-mobile-app-project-reactnative-expo-1icg","date":1740066410,"author":"royson menezes","guid":7274,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Recently, I started working on a project to develop a mobile application using <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">React Native</a> and Expo.

If you run into similar problems, check whether Volta is interfering with your NVM installation. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can opt to use Volta instead.</p></li><li><p>Node.js Installation Issues:\nI also encountered problems installing Node.js, which were linked to an incorrect NVM configuration. Make sure that NVM is properly set up in your environment variables—for example, ensure that your PATH includes the correct NVM directories. This setup is crucial for a smooth Node.js installation.</p></li></ol><p>I hope this guide helps you kickstart your React Native journey.

It’s something that should be very simple, but still bites a surprising amount of people. </p><p>The basic reason for this is that in most languages, we only have to cater to . But in JavaScript, we have to cater to both  and . How do we do that?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to write a  check function in JavaScript\n</h2><p>We can call this the “I don’t care about the story, I just want to know how to do it” section. </p><p>These days whenever you Google a recipe for toast, you get a 5,000-word essay before the writer tells you to put the bread in the oven. Let’s not be like that. Checking for <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in Java</a><a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S</a><a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cript</a> can be achieved like so. </p><p>Let’s imagine our test data object like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To test this function, let’s put some values into it and see how it goes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The output is what we would expect, and similar to what other languages would provide:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If objects are  or , then this function would return true.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Checking for , , or an empty string\n</h3><p>What if we want to check if a variable is , or if it’s simply empty? We can check for this by doing the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This depends on the object's “truthiness”. “Truthy” values like “words” or numbers greater than zero would return true, whereas empty strings would return false. </p><p>We have to be a little careful about this application. Let’s consider form entry. For instance, if there was an empty string in the form, then it would be acceptable to say that the field isn’t filled out. </p><p>However, if the user gave a single ’0’ in the form, then 0 would also evaluate to . In the case of form validation, this wouldn’t work the way we would expect. Empty arrays would also evaluate to , so the result of an array not existing, and an array existing and not having any values in it, would essentially be the same. This is probably not what you want. </p><p>Ah boy this is getting complex. Why is it though? Let’s dig in a bit.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Exploring the complexities of  and  in JavaScript\n</h2><p>There are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of posts and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5515310/is-there-a-standard-function-to-check-for-null-undefined-or-blank-variables-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StackOverflow entries</a> on this topic. It’s simple - the behavior of  and  is a bit wily to developers, both new and old. If we get it wrong, websites break, or our node apps stop working. So we really want to dial it in and make sure it works the way we expect. </p><p>Add into the mix that JavaScript has been around <a href=\"https://cybercultural.com/p/1995-the-birth-of-javascript/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">since 1995</a>. This also presents problems. JavaScript is used on almost every webpage today, so core features simply cannot be rewritten or reimplemented. If, overnight, a change was made to how  or  was handled in browsers and frameworks like Node.js, the carnage would be huge. It would dwarf the <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/product-recall-liability-claims/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crowdstrike outage</a>, for instance. </p><p>The reason for this is that most languages only use , and  is something that only is used in JavaScript. While  is appropriate to represent the absence of a value, typically instead of returning  in other languages, those languages would throw an exception. </p><p>For example, in C#, if we wrote the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Our code would throw with “Use of unassigned local variable ”. The compiler is performing some analysis and telling us that we can’t use a variable that hasn’t been assigned. In other words, it’s undefined. </p><p>In C# (and a  of other languages) we never run the risk of possibly using things that are undefined, because something throws an error before we’re in that situation. Even if you were to do things in other languages that would throw, such as access an entry in an array that is out of bounds, C# would throw, whereas JavaScript would simply return . </p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We’ve got an empty array, and then we try to print out the fifth element from the array.

My Experience from Building Day Counter - World's 1st App Built with Grok 3 beta.","url":"https://dev.to/liborbenes/grok-3-beta-is-the-best-ai-in-the-world-my-experience-from-building-day-counter-worlds-1st-app-1bm8","date":1740062949,"author":"Libor","guid":7252,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As I published, Moz://a Developer Hub just approved my Day Counter Firefox Browser Add-On &amp; World's 1st App built with Grok 3 beta.</p><p>That is great news. It is also a great experience. So, I thought I would share my observations, it's just like a story.</p><p>There is a long way from the initial idea to the complete working product. Development of software tools is never straightforward. Yes, I work with AI that generates the code but the word 'work with' is at the core. AI is great for development. It brings unimaginable opportunities. By generating code, AI enables a much broader range of people to build a much broader range of software tools.</p><p>At the same time, developing a software tool is always an active and very intensive interaction. You must know what you are doing. With every software tool development, the result is not automatic. I could only encourage anybody with an interest in programming to give these excellent AI tools basic tasks and it can generate interesting and easy to run programs for anybody in a few seconds. If you do not know what to ask AI to write program for, ask AI for ideas.</p><p>It is of course more complex with larger programs and with software development. There are always dozens and dozens of versions and adjustments. Oftentimes, the AI runs into a loop and you must be able to help AI to get out of there. There are still many limits to AI capabilities. But it's also improving fast.</p><p>Also with this Add-On, I worked as usual with ChatGPT AI. It did a great job again. ChatGPT AI was high-frequency generating the code, as always. It was with total patience very responsive to all my never ending modifications that I always high-frequency generate in the spirit of total customer obsession, if I can borrow that term. ChatGPT AI also generated good ideas and suggestions that helped in the improvements of the tool along the way.</p><p>Then I reached the long awaited moment, everything was working perfectly. I had meticulously tweaked every detail of the app, font sizes, types, colors, spent hours testing and fine tuning also each and every shade of every color used, just everything imaginable and unimaginable. A tiny tool but a lot to design and take care of. Fascinating work, as always.</p><p>All worked all right in my browser about:debugging testing environment. Next I tried to upload the add-on to Moz://a Developer Hub and as I was somehow expecting, it identified something and returned an error. It was another, previously experienced, innerHTML related risk.</p><p>So, I went on to modify the Add-On to get rid of that risky innerHTML. However, this is always a critical moment as it might require a change in the entire code philosophy and you might easily end up having to basically start over. But it's all right, it's normal.</p><p>I got back to work with ChatGPT AI. Again, it was helpful and was really trying to reformulate the program logic and respond to all my modifications based on results of testing I was doing along the way. I kept torturing ChatGPT AI until at some point, I saw the patterns and had to tell ChatGPT about my observation that it looked like it was getting worse. It was undeniable and a clearly obvious pattern that with every new modification, more problems were created than resolved.</p><p>Based on thousands of detailed technical interactions with ChatGPT AI, I personally saw this unusual, as if ChatGPT AI was somehow overwhelmed. Maybe as a result of the extreme numbers of requests I was high-speed firing at the AI? I saw that I just pushed again ChatGPT AI to another limit. ChatGPT AI was unable to break out of that loop. Despite being always endlessly patient and emotionless, ChatGPT AI, in an unprecedented way, admitted, in a sign of a quiet, emotionless AI resignation:\n\"You're right—this is getting worse instead of better!\"</p><p>I felt sorry for that dilligent worker who has been so professionally doing all the hard work of writing code and patiently modifying the slightest details I always come up with. No person in the world would have that kind of patience with my demands. I guarantee you. Recent talk flashed through my mind: \"You torture people.\"</p><p>So far, I have been building the tools primarily with ChatGPT AI and that's because of my good experience with this AI. I appreciate the work the OpenAI team has been doing building this ChatGPT AI.</p><p>The moment of truth was here. This effort hit a cul-de-sac yet again. As much as I stayed away from DeepSeek, following my experiences of having my PC hacked while working on DeepSeek as I described earlier, there was no other choice. I started DeepSeek to see if it can get across the hurdles. DeepSeek seemed to have been making some progress but only seemingly. It started running in loops as well.</p><p>The last option after midnight, I got an idea to try Grok 2 on X. A few hourse before, yesterday, I had found an information on X that there might be Grok 3 beta soon available for everybody, the famous, exciting, and mysterious \"Stay Tuned\" notification. Grok 3 beta followed up faster than anybody could have imagined. At that moment though, I was not thinking about that, thinking, it might take more time to release Grok 3 to the non-subscription public.</p><p>To tell the truth, I did not place too much hopes into Grok. I had tried that a few times for writing code in the past and I always ended up going back to use ChatGPT AI that generated for me the results I needed.</p><p>Well, I opened up Grok. I immediatelly noticed something has changed. No more \"Stay Tuned\" message but at the top, there was \"Grok 3 beta.\" I paused breathing until I hit the Enter, immediately asking: \"Are you Grok 3?\" I usually stay away from beta versions of anything but this time ... \"What if?\"</p><p>Grok did not get too specific, saying something like the version is unimportant and in an optimistic mood told me it can take a look at the code, just upload it and let's see.</p><p>I explained what I was trying to do, where the problems were, and I uploaded the code. At first, it seemed similar to what I had previously gone through with ChatGPT AI and DeepSeek. I tested the result, found problems (similar to the results of the previous tools), analyzed them, explained to Grok 3 beta. Then again.</p><p>After about 2 (two) uploads, Grok 3 beta returned another updated version. It seemed to have worked somewhat better.</p><p>I do not get optimistic fast. I ran all my tests that had previously broken all the dozens of previous versions on both ChatGPT AI and DeepSeek. I did not find any incorrect result. With probability this high, I concluded that the code is O.K. This version worked perfect!</p><p>I have been working with AI, especially ChatGPT AI for long months. I've built many software tools and many programs. And as I said, I appreciate ChatGPT AI and their OpenAI team.</p><p>Following all these long months of massive and intensive experience and based on this particular experience, as a non-subscription user I testify that Grok 3 beta AI is the best free code writing AI in the world.</p>","contentLength":6963,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Déploiement d’Omnimor","url":"https://dev.to/liladoc/deploiement-domnimor-1fh2","date":1740062371,"author":"LilaDoc","guid":7251,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Je viens de finir le déploiement d’Omnimor ! </p><p>Ça fait un moment que j’entends parler de Docker, et rendre Omnimor disponible était l’occasion parfaite pour enfin plonger dedans. Au premier abord, certaines notions n’étaient pas évidentes, notamment la différence entre image et container. J’ai regardé la vidéo de Nana (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE&amp;t=5173s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lien ici</a>), et franchement, grosse recommandation. 👌 Après ça, tout était limpide !</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Après la théorie, place à la pratique\n</h3><p>Une fois lancée, j’ai dû faire face à quelques points un peu flous :</p><h3><strong>La base de données : où et comment la gérer ?</strong></h3><p>J’ai utilisé Postgres comme base de données et la question s’est vite posée : dois-je utiliser la base de données créée automatiquement par le conteneur Docker ?</p><p>En gros, lorsqu’on lance un container avec Postgres, une base est automatiquement initialisée. J’ai hésité :</p><ol><li>Est-ce une bonne pratique d’utiliser celle-ci directement ?</li><li>Ou est-ce mieux de créer et gérer moi-même mes bases via des scripts d’initialisation ?</li></ol><p>En regardant d’autres projets, j’ai remarqué que beaucoup utilisent directement la base fournie par Postgres dans le container. Du coup, j’ai suivi le mouvement, mais j’ai encore quelques doutes sur la gestion des données en production. Est-ce que c’est scalable ? Y a-t-il des pièges à éviter ? Si vous avez des retours d’expérience, ça m’intéresse !</p><h3><strong>Les variables d’environnement : découverte totale</strong></h3><p>Là, révélation : je ne savais pas vraiment ce qu’était un environnement. 😅</p><p>Jusqu’ici, j’utilisais bien un fichier  pour éviter d’exposer mes variables sensibles (mots de passe, clés API, etc.), mais sans réellement comprendre leur portée ni comment elles fonctionnaient en profondeur. Du coup, quand il a fallu les intégrer dans Docker Compose et mes Dockerfiles, ça s’est un peu compliqué.</p><p>Petit à petit, j’ai découvert qu’on pouvait passer les variables d’environnement directement dans . Et franchement, c’est super pratique ! Ça permet aux utilisateurs de personnaliser facilement leur setup (par exemple, en définissant leurs propres credentials et accès à leur base de données) tout en gardant ces infos sécurisées et séparées du code.</p><p>Et le bonus ? Ces variables d’environnement sont ensuite disponibles côté application, ce qui permet de configurer dynamiquement le comportement de l’app selon l’environnement (dev, test, prod…). Bref, un vrai game-changer pour rendre l’application plus modulable et plus pro ! </p><h3><strong>Le reverse proxy : une option que j’ai mise de côté (pour l’instant)</strong></h3><p>À un moment, je me suis demandé si je devais intégrer un reverse proxy (exemple NGINX) pour gérer les requêtes entre le frontend et le backend. J’étais curieuse de voir comment ça fonctionnait et si ça pouvait être utile dès maintenant.</p><p>Finalement, pas besoin. J’ai décidé de rester focus sur l’essentiel : faire tourner Omnimor avec Docker sans rajouter trop de complexité. Mais c’est un sujet que j’aimerais creuser pour les prochaines versions !</p><p>Cette première immersion dans Docker a été vraiment fun !

But what’s really happening behind the scenes? In this article, we’ll break down how Grafana processes and visualizes data, keeping things simple, practical, and to the point. Whether you’re new to DevOps or just curious about how it all works under the hood, this guide will give you a solid starting point.</p><p>Grafana is built on two main parts: the frontend and the backend.</p><ul><li>Frontend:\nThis is the part you see and interact with the dashboards, graphs, and visualizations. Built with modern web technologies, it ensures a smooth and responsive experience, making it easy to explore and analyze your data.</li><li>Backend:\nThis is where the heavy lifting happens. The backend processes data, runs queries, and connects to various data sources like Prometheus and InfluxDB. In short, it gathers and prepares the data that the frontend turns into useful insights.</li></ul><p>Grafana’s backend is where most of the activities happen, handling data requests, processing queries, and keeping everything running smoothly. Let’s break it down into two key parts:  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  ⚙️ The Grafana Server &amp; API Layer\n</h4><p>The Grafana server is the engine running behind the scenes. It acts as the bridge between your dashboards and your data sources, ensuring seamless communication. Here’s what it does:  </p><ul><li>🌍  When you interact with Grafana, the server processes your actions, whether it’s loading a dashboard, changing a time range, or modifying settings.\n</li><li>🔌 <strong>Connects to Data Sources:</strong> Through its RESTful APIs, the server fetches data from sources like Prometheus, InfluxDB, or MySQL.\n</li><li>🔄  Beyond the web interface, the API lets you integrate Grafana into scripts and automation workflows, making it a flexible tool for DevOps teams.\n</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  📊 How Data Queries &amp; Processing Work\n</h4><p>Every time you load a dashboard, Grafana works behind the scenes to fetch and process data. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:  </p><p>1️⃣  The frontend (your dashboard) sends a query request to the backend via the API. The backend translates this request and reaches out to the right data source. Once the data is retrieved, the server processes it applying filters, aggregations, or calculations as needed. The processed data is sent back to the frontend, where it’s transformed into the visualizations you see.  </p><p>This smooth backend operation is what makes Grafana such a powerful tool for real-time monitoring and analysis.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔗 Connecting to Data Sources\n</h3><p>Grafana is like a universal translator for data, it seamlessly connects to a wide range of sources, from time series databases like  and  to search engines like . Whether you're monitoring server metrics, analyzing logs, or tracking application performance, Grafana knows how to fetch and display the data you need.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🛠 Setting Up a Data Source\n</h4><p>Connecting a data source in Grafana is a straightforward process:  </p><p>1️⃣  In Grafana’s intuitive UI, you select the database or service you want to connect to. Grafana has built-in plugins that \"speak\" the native query language of each data source, ensuring seamless communication.<strong>Configure &amp; Authenticate:</strong> You provide connection details like the database URL, credentials, and any necessary authentication tokens. Grafana lets you test the connection before saving, so you can ensure everything is working smoothly.  </p><p>Once set up, Grafana sends queries directly to your data source in , pulling in the latest metrics for visualization.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔄 Understanding Data Flow\n</h4><p>Every time you interact with a Grafana dashboard, there's a well orchestrated sequence happening in the background. Let’s break it down step by step:  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🚀 <strong>1. User Action → Sending a Query</strong></h4><p>It all starts when you interact with a dashboard, maybe you <strong>select a different time range</strong>, , or <strong>zoom into a specific data point</strong>. This triggers a request that gets sent to Grafana’s backend.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔍 <strong>2. Query Processing → Talking to the Data Source</strong></h4><p>Grafana’s backend translates your request into a query that the selected data source understands. If you're using , for example, Grafana converts your request into a PromQL query. If it’s , it turns into a structured search request.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  📦 <strong>3. Data Retrieval &amp; Processing → Cleaning &amp; Formatting</strong></h4><p>The data source processes the request and sends back raw data. But before it reaches your dashboard, Grafana’s backend , , , and , making sure you get exactly what you need.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  📊 <strong>4. Visualization → Data Comes to Life</strong></h4><p>Finally, the processed data is sent to the frontend, where Grafana transforms it into <strong>interactive graphs, charts, and tables</strong>. This real-time flow ensures that what you're seeing is always <strong>current, accurate, and easy to interpret</strong>.  </p><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading!

Accordingly with the challenge, we have to print this tree in the following way:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Fundamentals of Graph Traversal\n</h2><p>The graph is a fundamental data structure in the sense that the majority of data structures derivates from it. Graphs are structured in a way where nodes are interconected with anothers in randomic ways, and each node can be connected with another one. </p><p>Graphs can be directed or not. Directed graphs have nodes, not only connected between it, but each connection have a direction. In the graph above, the Node 1 can traverse to node 2 and 3, but Node 2 cannot traverse to Node 1, only to the Node 4. When graph is undirected, the traversal can go back and forth.</p><p>The traversal in graphs can happen in two ways: Breadth First Traversal (BFS) and Depth First Traversal (DFS).</p><p>Breadth First Traversal is made in a fashion where we go to each of level of traversal equally in the graph, before advancing another level.</p><p>Let's remember the former image graph. First, we start in the node 1, then we go and visit nodes 2, 3, 5 and 6, and then, finally, visit nodes 4 and 7.</p><p>When we traversal graphs, normally we can use auxiliary data structures. Let's define a graph node as following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The auxiliary data structure for breadth first traversal is the queue. Each time we visit a node, we gonna put the children at the end of queue, and while advancing in the queue, the levels of traversal are well defined, and we gonna advance each level at a time:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When traversed in BFS fashion, we get:</p><div><pre><code>    1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n    6\n    7\n    8\n</code></pre></div><p>If in BFS we visit near nodes first, in Depth First Traversal we advance the most possible deep level in one direction before going to other direction.</p><p>Let's take the same graph from the first image. If we traverse it in a DFS fashion, we gonna start at the node 1, then go into the direction of 2 and then 4. Next, we visit 3 and 7. Then 6 and then 5:</p><p>If we go in only one direction, we use the Stack as auxiliary data structure, because the inputs and outputs of this structure occurs in only one channel.</p><p>If we use stack, we can use the call stack too, making recursive traversals in the graph.</p><p>Let's implement it using first a regular stack:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And when testing, we get this:</p><div><pre><code>    1\n    4\n    3\n    8\n    7\n    2\n    6\n    5\n</code></pre></div><p>And then, using a recursive approach:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And testing this, we get:</p><div><pre><code>    1\n    2\n    5\n    6\n    3\n    7\n    8\n    4\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Using graph fundamentals to solve the challenge\n</h2><p>With this knowledge, we know that:</p><ol><li>The tree is only a configuration of graph</li><li>Graphs can be traversed in two ways: BFS and DFS</li><li>Therefore, trees can be traversed in that ways</li></ol><p>If we can use these traversals in tree, we need only a type of traversal that can, therefore, differentiate between levels, and I think the BFS is perfect for this.</p><p>But how can we differentiate between one level of the tree and another?</p><p>It's easy: we can put a dummy node, with a null value inside it, that makes this difference for us. This dummy node will indicate that we are at the end of the actual level, and then we can move this dummy node to the end of the queue, to mark each end of level.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A simple implementation at first, but we have a problem in this implementation.\nWhen we test it, we get the following behavior:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;&lt; 87% EXECUTING 16s]\n :lib:test  0 tests completed\n :lib:test  Executing com.eronalves.printtreelevels.TestPrint\n</code></pre></div><p>The test execution gets stalled, only appending new line chars to the console.</p><p>Of course, our implementation has no stop condition, and get's appending a new dummy node each time it gets a dummy node from the queue, that way, appending new lines to the console for ever.</p><p>How can we stop the execution in a correct way?\nSimple: we gonna verify if the queue is empty when appending the dummy node. If it's empty, then the graph is over. Otherwise, the queue have graph nodes yet, so we continue to append dummy nodes at the end:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And now with test, we finally get:</p><div><pre><code>    1 \n    2 3 4 \n    5 6 7 8 \n</code></pre></div>","contentLength":4201,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Shadcn UI Admin Dashboard Template (MIT License)","url":"https://dev.to/fredy/shadcn-ui-admin-dashboard-template-mit-license-3ec","date":1740061298,"author":"Fredy Andrei","guid":7246,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Exclusive Research: Unlocking Reliable Crash Tracking with PLCrashReporter for iOS SDKs","url":"https://dev.to/yurii_denchyk_bb561af8d2d/exclusive-research-unlocking-reliable-crash-tracking-with-plcrashreporter-for-ios-sdks-2j6p","date":1740061169,"author":"Yurii Denchyk","guid":7245,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Crash tracking is a vital part of mobile app development, helping developers detect, diagnose, and resolve issues that affect user experience. Let's debunk common myths about crash tracking in SDKs.</p><blockquote><p><em>by , Talsec iOS SDK development team</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Elevating SDK Stability with Advanced Crash Reporting</strong>\nAt Talsec, we are committed to delivering top-tier security SDKs, ensuring both reliability and seamless integration. To further enhance our quality assurance, we explored various crash-tracking solutions and successfully implemented a proof-of-concept (PoC) using PLCrashReporter – a lightweight and efficient crash-reporting framework.</p><p><strong>Why Crash Tracking Matters</strong>\nAs our SDK portfolio grows – with offerings like freeRASP, Business RASP, and custom client adaptations – ensuring stability across different versions is a top priority. Introducing automated crash tracking empowers us to proactively address issues, minimize downtime, and enhance the overall developer experience.</p><p>Beyond stability, security and data privacy are core concerns for both us and our clients. Many third-party crash-tracking services collect and store crash data in ways that may not align with strict security policies. By opting for a custom implementation with PLCrashReporter, we ensure that crash data is handled entirely within our security guidelines, giving clients complete control over how and where their data is stored and transmitted.</p><p><strong>Evaluating the Market: 3rd-Party Crash-Tracking Solutions</strong>\nWe assessed leading crash-tracking services based on framework size, ease of integration, and self-hosting capabilities. Here’s how they compare:</p><p>Sentry: Robust and open-source, but complex and premium-priced. (Framework size: ~20MB)</p><p>Bugsnag: Slightly lighter but lacks self-hosting. (Framework size: ~10MB)</p><p>Firebase Crashlytics: Closed-source and requires the full Firebase SDK, making it bulky. (Framework size: 100+MB; Oh wow, Google, seriously?)</p><p>Datadog: Primarily server-focused with intricate setup requirements. (Framework size: ~21MB)</p><p>While these services offer advanced features, they come with added complexity, costs, and potential privacy concerns. Many do not clearly document how crash reports are stored prior to submission, leaving uncertainty around data security between the moment of a crash and when the report reaches the server.</p><p><strong>The Power of PLCrashReporter</strong>\nTo maintain efficiency and independence, we turned to PLCrashReporter – a lightweight, open-source crash-reporting framework for iOS/macOS. Key benefits include:</p><p>Compact footprint (4.2MB framework size)</p><p>Complete control over data collection and reporting</p><p>Open source nature enables secure on-device storage of crash data until transmission, reducing exposure risks</p><p>By integrating PLCrashReporter, we ensure that all crash data remains securely stored until it is explicitly sent to the designated endpoint. This provides an additional layer of security rarely addressed in third-party solutions, aligning with the highest standards of data privacy and compliance.</p><p><strong>Seamless Integration &amp; Compatibility Insights</strong>\nWe rigorously tested PLCrashReporter alongside common crash-reporting services to ensure compatibility:</p><p>Sentry (8.43.0): Fully compatible, with seamless integration.</p><p>Bugsnag (6.31.0): No issues, though some VPNs may block communication.</p><p>Firebase Crashlytics (11.7.0): Works but logs a non-critical warning.</p><p>Datadog (2.23.0): Conflict due to Datadog’s internal use of PLCrashReporter. A customized approach may resolve this.</p><p><strong>Next Steps &amp; Optimization</strong>\nWith our PoC validated, we are now focused on refining the integration by:</p><p>Ensuring flawless coexistence with third-party crash reporters</p><p>Optimizing data collection for more actionable privacy-focused crash insights</p><p>Enhancing security mechanisms for even stronger data protection</p><p>\nWe’re eager to collaborate with the developer community! If you have expertise in PLCrashReporter implementation, multi-SDK crash management, or advanced analytics integration, we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Let’s build a smarter, more resilient crash-reporting ecosystem – together!

It’s a simple yet powerful framework that explains how human behavior is driven by three key factors: <strong>Motivation, Ability, and Triggers</strong>. If all three align at the same moment, the behavior happens. If one is missing, it doesn’t.\nWhile Fogg’s model has been around for a while, what struck me is how relevant it is today—especially in a world increasingly shaped by AI, social media, and automation. I wanted to share some insights on how FBM plays out in 2025’s tech landscape and what we can learn from it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Motivation: Do Users Care Enough?\n</h3><p>Motivation is what drives people to act. Fogg categorizes motivation into three dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>Social Acceptance vs. Rejection</strong></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Ability: Is It Easy Enough?\n</h3><p>If something is too hard, people won’t do it—even if they’re motivated. Ability comes down to . The easier an action is, the more likely people are to follow through. Factors like time, money, effort, and mental energy all play a role here.</p><p>Fogg defines <strong>six elements of simplicity</strong> that determine whether a behavior feels easy to do:</p><ul><li> – If an action takes too long, people are less likely to do it.</li><li> – If it’s costly, it creates friction for users.</li><li> – Actions that require significant exertion are avoided.</li><li><strong>Cognitive Effort (Brain Cycles)</strong> – Complex thinking and decision-making reduce the likelihood of action.</li><li> – If a behavior goes against social norms, people may resist it.</li><li> – If something is unfamiliar or doesn’t fit into a habit, it may feel difficult.</li></ul><p>For designers and product creators, reducing barriers in these areas significantly increases the likelihood of users performing a behavior.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Triggers: What’s the Nudge?\n</h3><p>Even when motivation and ability are high, a behavior still needs a trigger. Triggers can be:</p><ul><li> (motivational nudges, like urgent notifications)</li><li> (making the action easier, like auto-fill in forms)</li><li> (reminders, like a daily step goal notification)</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  2025 Tech Examples of FBM in Action\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. AI-Powered Health Apps (Motivation + Ability + Triggers)\n</h3><p>Apps like Apple Health and Google Fit have evolved beyond tracking steps. They now use  to  users (Hope vs. Fear: “Stay healthy to avoid chronic diseases”),  workouts (quick, adaptive exercises), and  action (smart reminders based on habits).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Autonomous Vehicles &amp; Ridesharing (Reducing Ability Barriers)\n</h3><p>Self-driving taxis are here, and they’ve removed a —driving itself! Even people with low motivation to drive can now <strong>summon a car effortlessly</strong> through voice commands or wearables.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. AI-Generated Content &amp; Productivity Tools\n</h3><p>GPT-powered assistants and tools like Notion AI are <strong>removing friction in writing, brainstorming, and summarizing information</strong>. The trigger? A simple notification that asks, “Want to turn this outline into a full draft?”—right when you’re thinking about it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Social Media &amp; Short-Form Content (Strong Triggers)\n</h3><p>Platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels . They:</p><ul><li> users with push notifications (“Your friend just posted!”)</li><li> (just scroll to consume content, no effort required)</li><li> (social acceptance: fear of missing out, pleasure of entertainment)</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Smart Homes &amp; Voice Assistants (Effortless Triggers)\n</h3><p>Alexa and Google Home have reached a point where they can  and  actions autonomously (e.g., lowering lights when bedtime approaches). No effort, no manual activation—just behavior happening naturally.</p><ol><li> – The easier something is, the more likely people are to do it. Reducing friction beats increasing motivation.</li><li><strong>Triggers Must Be Well-Timed</strong> – Even if motivation and ability are there, behavior won’t happen without the right nudge.</li><li><strong>AI &amp; Automation Are Mastering FBM</strong> – Many 2025 technologies <strong>predict when users are ready</strong> to take action and nudge them at the perfect moment.</li></ol><p>Fogg’s model provides an insanely useful lens to analyze why people  take action. If you’re designing anything—an app, a habit system, or even your daily routine—keeping these three factors in mind can <strong>dramatically increase success</strong>.</p><p>Would love to hear your thoughts: Where do you see FBM at play in today’s tech?
