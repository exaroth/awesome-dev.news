First things first, I was interested in showing how easy automated testing was when the underlying design is good. Hence, I got it to a point of full meaningful testing coverage after a short time, enlisting the help of AI to write unit tests. Yeah I know, TDD right?</p><p>By then, I had also achieved a good understanding of microservices, not least because I have been managing the Kubernetes-based Commonplace platform, and decided to apply these learnings to the CSV project.</p><p>As a prerequisite, I had to decide how I was going to do the breakup of the system into smaller services. This merits a blog post on its own but, long story short, I decided to breakup the application more or less into </p><ul><li>An input streaming service (parse CSV files)</li><li>An output streaming (write CSV results)</li><li>A number of pipeline steps (send payment, polling, produce output).</li><li>An orchestrator (read folder, orchestrate pipeline steps, handle errors), inspired by <a href=\"https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Saga pattern</a>.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Migrating from Springboot to Quarkus 3\n</h2><p>Originally, the project started as a Springboot CLI app, classic. Again enlisting the help of ChatGPT, I managed to refactor a Springboot CLI application into a multi-module microservices architecture over the course of a few intense sessions. </p><p>This was no copy-paste exercise. Along the way, I uncovered a treasure trove of lessons in Quarkus configuration, build systems, dependency management, and inter-service communication. A part of me knew I had started my journey into The Rabbit Hole though, so let's start from the beginning: Maven dependencies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Build Mayhem: Maven vs. Gradle\n</h3><p>I considered switching to Gradle for its composite build capabilities but stuck with Maven for simplicity and IntelliJ IDEA support. Quarkus works well with Maven multi-module projects, and IDEA recognizes and manages them cleanly—even when all modules live in a single Git repo.</p><p>Still, Maven wasn’t always smooth sailing. Issues included:</p><ul><li>Mojo execution errors due to conflicting plugin configurations</li><li>Obsolete Java version warnings ()</li><li>Javadoc plugin failures due to undocumented interfaces</li><li>Lombok not being picked up by the Maven compiler (even though it worked in the IDE)</li></ul><p>Each problem required its own fix—from upgrading plugin versions to tweaking  settings and suppressing irrelevant warnings.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Toward Microservices: Structuring and Sharing Code\n</h3><p>The monolith eventually gave way to a structured microservice approach. Early on, I realised it was going to be far easier to share a \"common\" domain module as I wasn't going to get things right on the first attempt. So, I created such common/shared module, which housed reusable domain classes and interfaces shared across services.</p><p>Here I faced a critical architectural decision: <strong>how should services communicate?</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Thoughts on synchronous and asynchronous communication\n</h3><p>Async communication seems to be the preferred method of communication between microservices. But, I see async as a higher-level tier wrapping or adapting the tier of sync APIs. I see a microservice taking gRPC and REST calls now, and responding to asynchronous events in the future. Naturally then, I decided to go with a synchronous model first.</p><p>The sync vs async topic is quite interesting. Adding a constellation of message queues as the \"glue\" between microservices needs justification in my opinion. SQS or Kafka are nice, but they are also complex.</p><p>If you take Project Loom's virtual threads (=compute density), structured concurrency, Quarkus, Kubernetes high availability, and Mutiny streams (with back pressure and retry w/backoff), you have pretty much solved the issue of availability of distributed services running remotely on heterogeneous hardware capacity (and therefore, varying availability).</p><p>Is it too foolish to think that async comms might become irrelevant in the future, in cases like a greenfield internal project? If sync comms get much better, it might just become the preferred choice.</p><p>But as I said: the two comms models are not mutually exclusive in my humble opinion. For me, it was absolutely fine to do sync comms at the beginning, and leave async for phase 2 when the services are deemed robust enough. Of course, I expect asynchronous to require some re-factoring, but it should mostly be a \"wrapper\" of the existing stuff, plus the addition of the feature itself. </p><p>Very curious to hear comments on this topic! </p><p>REST felt unnecessarily heavyweight for intra-service communication within the same organization, especially when services live on the same cluster or host. I settled on  for its:</p><ul><li>Efficient binary protocol</li><li>Built-in support for streaming</li><li>Strong API contracts via  files</li><li>Mature integration with modern dev stacks and Kubernetes</li></ul><p>It was clear that gRPC offered the best mix of performance and developer productivity—especially when paired with Quarkus’s excellent Protobuf tooling.</p><p>Later on, I'd learn about Vertex and its dual support for gRPC and REST. Again, another non mutually exclusive choice! Happy days!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Kicking things off: A CLI App with Quarkus and Picocli\n</h3><p>The CLI tier shifted to a Quarkus-based CLI tool using  and  to bootstrap logic. Added some much needed conveniency features along the way though. Early challenges included:</p><ul><li>Passing command-line arguments (e.g., ) via Picocli</li><li>Getting  to work properly within CLI apps</li><li>Managing configuration overrides for testing without relying solely on </li></ul><p>Eventually, I settled on combining Quarkus's DI with  and Picocli’s . It took several iterations to get the CLI runtime and testing environment to coexist without interfering.</p><ul><li><strong>Quarkus apps are powerful</strong>, but require careful setup when combining dependency injection, Picocli, and testing.</li><li><strong>Multi-module Maven setups scale well</strong>, especially with good IDE support. But be ready to fight your tooling when things go wrong.</li><li><strong>Code sharing needs structure</strong>: create clean interfaces and use tools like Lombok and config mapping to reduce boilerplate.</li><li><strong>gRPC is ideal for internal microservice communication</strong>, offering the speed and contract-first development REST often lacks.</li></ul><p>I was much impressed with Quarkus, its capabilities and ease of use. Having broken up the Springboot app into these new foundational modules, I felt excited and wanted to keep on going at a steady pace. </p><p>Next steps involve things like defining proper  APIs, building mapper classes (MapStruct), redefine concurrency processing, and more.</p>","contentLength":6964,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What is Data Enrichment ＆ How AI Enhances Its Power","url":"https://dev.to/powerdrill_ai/what-is-data-enrichment-how-ai-enhances-its-power-3m8m","date":1751539806,"author":"Powerdrill AI","guid":183057,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Data is one of the most valuable assets for businesses.\n</h2><p>While raw data in its original form is often incomplete, fragmented, or lacks the context needed to drive meaningful decisions, data enrichment — a process that enhances raw data by adding external information, makes it comprehensive and actionable.  </p><p>This article will dive into the basics of data enrichment, the transformative impact of this technology and explore how it blends with AI under today's AI-powered platforms to offer greater accuracy, scalability, and predictive capabilities, making it easier for businesses to make smarter decisions and stay ahead of the competition.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Data Enrichment\n</h2><p>Data enrichment is a pivotal process in data management aimed at enhancing the utility, accuracy, and depth of raw data. It involves merging external data sources with an existing database to refine and expand the original dataset. This process is vital for businesses and organizations that rely on data for decision-making, strategy development, and maintaining a competitive edge. By enriching data, companies can gain a more comprehensive view of their operations, customers, and markets.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is the Purpose of Data Enrichment?\n</h3><p>The primary goal of data enrichment is not simply to add more data but to enhance its context and usefulness. Key objectives of data enrichment include:  </p><ul><li><strong>Standardizing Data Formats</strong>: Ensuring that different datasets are in consistent formats for easier integration and analysis.\n</li><li>: Supplementing raw data with new insights that make it more actionable and relevant.\n</li></ul><p>For instance, enriching customer data might involve adding demographic details, purchase history, or even social media activities to create a more complete customer profile. This enriched data allows businesses to craft more targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer service, and tailor product offerings to specific segments.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How Data Enrichment Differs from Data Cleansing\n</h3><p>While data enrichment and data cleansing are closely related, they serve different purposes:  </p><ul><li> focuses on enhancing data by integrating additional information to make it more valuable and comprehensive.\n</li><li> is a foundational process that prioritizes improving the quality of existing data, addressing issues like duplicate records, outdated information, formatting inconsistencies, and data entry errors.\n</li></ul><p>In essence, data cleansing ensures that your data is \"clean,\" whereas data enrichment takes that \"clean\" data and adds new layers of context to make it more valuable for decision-making.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Data Enrichment Process: How It Works\n</h3><p>Data enrichment is a structured process that involves several key steps:  </p><ol><li>: Analyze existing data to identify missing information (e.g., location, age, purchasing habits).\n</li><li><strong>Identify Internal and External Sources</strong>: Determine the best external data sources (third-party providers, public datasets, social media, etc.) to fill gaps.\n</li><li>: Remove inaccuracies and ensure consistency in the existing dataset before integration.\n</li><li>: Merge external data with existing data (e.g., match customer profiles with behavioral/demographic data).\n</li><li>: Ensure the enriched data is accurate, complete, and relevant.\n</li><li>: Regularly refresh data to maintain relevance as external factors change.\n</li><li><strong>Deploy to Business Systems</strong>: Implement enriched data into marketing, customer service, sales, and other strategic tools.\n</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Benefits of Data Enrichment\n</h3><p>Data enrichment offers numerous advantages for businesses across industries:  </p><ul><li>: Filling gaps and adding context enhances data reliability and actionability.\n</li><li>: Gain a 360-degree view of customers to understand preferences, behaviors, and needs.\n</li><li>: Richer data supports accurate decisions for marketing, product development, and retention.\n</li><li><strong>Streamlined Risk Management</strong>: Enriched data aids in fraud detection, regulatory compliance, and financial stability.\n</li><li>: Automation saves time and resources spent on manual data entry or research.\n</li><li>: Up-to-date data helps meet requirements like GDPR or CCPA.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI Powers Data Enrichment\n</h2><p>AI technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Generative AI play crucial roles in enhancing data enrichment by providing more nuanced, predictive, and scalable capabilities.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n</h3><p>NLP is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It can analyze vast amounts of unstructured data — such as social media posts, customer feedback, and emails — to extract meaningful insights, including sentiment, intent, and trends.  </p><p>: A marketing team can leverage NLP to scan customer feedback or social media interactions to gain insights into consumer preferences. This NLP-derived data can be integrated into customer profiles to better personalize marketing campaigns, predict future needs, and build stronger customer relationships.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Machine Learning (ML) Models\n</h3><p>ML algorithms can take data enrichment to the next level by enabling predictive enrichment. By analyzing historical data and recognizing patterns, ML can provide forecasts about future behaviors or trends. For example, businesses can predict customer churn or lifetime value using ML models that analyze customer interactions, purchase history, and other factors.  </p><p>Additionally, ML algorithms can automate repetitive data enrichment tasks, such as deduplication (removing duplicate records) or data cleansing, significantly improving data quality and saving time.  </p><p>: An e-commerce company might use ML to predict which customers are at risk of churn based on past behavior, then enrich those customer profiles with additional information such as service interactions or social sentiment to better target retention strategies.  </p><p>Generative AI goes beyond simple data enrichment by creating synthetic data to fill gaps in existing datasets, particularly in situations where data is sparse. For example, when conducting A/B testing, businesses can use generative AI to synthesize customer behavior data, allowing them to test multiple scenarios without requiring massive amounts of real-world data.  </p><p>Generative AI also enhances data diversity while ensuring privacy protection. It can generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world patterns without exposing sensitive personal information, ensuring businesses can test their models or make decisions based on enriched yet privacy-compliant data.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of AI-Driven Data Enrichment\n</h2><p>AI-enhanced data enrichment offers a wide range of benefits, including:  </p><ul><li>: AI algorithms reduce human error in data integration and deduplication, ensuring higher-quality insights.\n</li><li>: AI handles large data volumes in real-time, from IoT sensor data to transaction records.\n</li><li>: ML models uncover hidden patterns, enabling decisions based on forecasts, not just history.\n</li><li>: Automation of manual tasks (e.g., data cleansing) saves time and resources for strategic work.\n</li><li>: NLP extracts info from unstructured data (emails, social media) to enrich profiles.\n</li><li>: ML models adapt to new patterns and feedback, keeping data up-to-date.\n</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Considerations\n</h3><p>While AI-driven data enrichment is highly beneficial, there are challenges that organizations need to consider:  </p><ul><li>: Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, especially with external or unstructured data containing PII.\n</li><li>: AI models trained on incomplete data may produce skewed insights; prioritize diverse, balanced training datasets.\n</li><li>: Align AI tools with existing data pipelines (e.g., AWS, Azure, Matillion) for seamless workflows.\n</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Tools and Platforms for AI-Driven Data Enrichment\n</h2><p>Several AI-driven platforms are making it easier for businesses to implement data enrichment:  </p><ul><li>: Automates data integration and enrichment, streamlining workflows with AI and offering automatic data exploration via Q&amp;A.\n</li><li>: Provides AI-driven tools to blend, cleanse, and analyze data in real-time.\n</li><li>: A fully managed ETL service that integrates with AI to enrich and process large datasets.\n</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Future Trends: AI and Data Enrichment\n</h2><p>As AI technologies evolve, so too will their impact on data enrichment:  </p><ul><li>: Enables privacy-preserving enrichment by training AI models on decentralized data without accessing personal info.\n</li><li><strong>Autonomous Data Enrichment</strong>: Self-optimizing systems will continuously refine datasets without manual intervention, enhancing automation and efficiency.\n</li></ul><p>The fusion of AI and data enrichment is transforming the way businesses interact with and utilize their data. By enhancing accuracy, scalability, and predictive power, AI-driven data enrichment enables smarter decision-making, improved customer insights, and more efficient operations.  </p><p>To stay competitive in an increasingly data-driven world, businesses must embrace AI-powered tools and integrate them into their data strategies. The future of data enrichment is not just about adding more information—it’s about unlocking the true potential of data to drive innovation and business success.</p>","contentLength":9054,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Add Internationalization (i18n) to a React App Using i18next [2025 Edition]","url":"https://dev.to/anilparmar/how-to-add-internationalization-i18n-to-a-react-app-using-i18next-2025-edition-3hkk","date":1751539788,"author":"Anil Parmar","guid":183062,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s digital landscape,  is critical for delivering personalized, accessible content to users around the world.

For example, let’s say you're building a small e-commerce site for a local business. How much does it really need to scale? Is it necessary to handle millions of requests per minute? Probably not.</p><p>But now imagine you're working on a platform like Facebook or Google — you're dealing with millions of simultaneous requests, users, services, and data. At this level, your system must be prepared to scale reliably and efficiently.</p><p>Start Simple\nBelow is a very simple example of a common architecture pattern:</p><p>This represents a basic flow: a client sends a request to an API, which processes business logic, validates data, and interacts with the database.</p><p>This kind of architecture is fine for small or personal projects — it's easy to understand, quick to deploy, and sufficient for limited traffic.</p><p>Scaling Up: What Changes?\nWhen we move toward a robust and scalable architecture, several new concerns come into play — especially around availability, performance, and security.</p><p>Some critical components to consider:</p><ul><li><p>Load Balancer – Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.</p></li><li><p>Cache – Reduces database load by storing frequent responses (e.g., Redis, CDN).</p></li><li><p>Observability – Monitoring, logging, and tracing to understand system behavior.</p></li><li><p>Security – Protecting data and services at all levels of the stack.</p></li><li><p>Latency – Physical server location matters. Regional distribution reduces delay.</p></li><li><p>Availability – Ensuring the system is always accessible through redundancy and backups.</p></li></ul><p>A More Scalable Architecture\nHere's what a more advanced setup might look like:</p><p>With more components in place, the complexity increases significantly. You’ll need to:</p><ul><li><p>Analyze request times and performance bottlenecks.</p></li><li><p>Identify content that can be cached to reduce database hits.</p></li><li><p>Ensure databases have replication and automated backups.</p></li><li><p>Set up monitoring systems to catch failures before users notice them.</p></li><li><p>Plan for failure: a good architecture expects components to break and handles it gracefully.</p></li></ul><p>But Here's the Catch: Trade-Offs\nScaling a project isn't just a technical challenge — it's also about managing compromises. Every decision adds complexity, cost, or both.</p><p>Here are some common trade-offs:</p><p>🧠 Complexity vs Simplicity:\nA scalable system is harder to build, test, and understand. More moving parts = more potential points of failure.</p><p>💸 Performance vs Cost:\nHigh availability, redundancy, and distributed regions all add cloud costs. You need to ask: Is it worth it at my current scale?</p><p>🧪 Speed vs Reliability:\nIntroducing caching or async processing improves speed but can introduce eventual consistency issues.</p><p>🔐 Access vs Security:\nScaling often means exposing more APIs, services, and endpoints — all of which need proper access control and protection.</p><p>These trade-offs mean that scaling should be intentional, not automatic. Just because you can build a system like Netflix doesn’t mean you should — especially if your needs are much simpler.</p><p>This is just a glimpse of how quickly software systems can become complex as they grow. Starting simple is fine — but as your application gains users and responsibilities, so must your architecture evolve.</p><p>Next time you’re starting a project, ask yourself:</p><p>“What would it take for this to scale 10x? 100x?”</p><p>“What am I willing to trade to make that happen?”</p>","contentLength":3497,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Project KARL","url":"https://dev.to/theaniketraj/project-karl-4m7b","date":1751536252,"author":"Aniket Raj","guid":182990,"unread":true,"content":"<p>It's day #69 of building KARL - AI.</p><ul><li>Update: Project is in Development Stage.</li><li>We're close to first public preview.</li><li>More updates to follow soon.</li></ul>","contentLength":139,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"6 Offline Practices for Sharper Coding and Design Thinking 💡","url":"https://dev.to/manukumar07/6-offline-practices-for-sharper-coding-and-design-thinking-el6","date":1751536166,"author":"Manu Kumar Pal","guid":183000,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>👋 Hey community! We all love our digital tools, but sometimes the best way to sharpen your coding and design thinking is to unplug for a bit. Here are 6 offline practices every developer and designer should try to boost clarity, creativity, and problem-solving skills</em>:\n_<strong>Sketch Your Ideas by Hand</strong></p><p>Before jumping into your IDE or Figma, grab pen and paper. Sketching UI mockups, system diagrams, or flowcharts forces you to think through problems carefully. It helps you catch issues early and makes abstract ideas concrete—no AI autocomplete can replace that moment of clarity you get from drawing it yourself!</p><p>2️⃣ 📚 <strong>Read Physical Books on Design, Algorithms, or Architecture</strong></p><p>Reading a book without notifications popping up is a superpower these days. Whether it’s Clean Code, Design of Everyday Things, or Algorithms Unlocked, deep reading helps you internalize concepts and think critically—skills that tutorials or AI-generated summaries can’t fully teach.</p><p>3️⃣ 🤝 <strong>Pair Programming or Whiteboarding with a Colleague</strong></p><p>Grab a friend or teammate, a whiteboard, and tackle a challenge together. Explaining your thought process out loud clarifies your ideas, and your partner’s perspective can spark creative solutions. Plus, this real-time human interaction is a better creativity booster than a chat with your favorite chatbot.</p><p>When you’re stuck on a bug or design problem, step outside. Research shows walking increases creative output by up to 60%. Fresh air, a change of scenery, and letting your subconscious chew on the problem can do wonders for breakthroughs.</p><p>5️⃣ 🗂️ <strong>Organize Ideas with Mind Maps or Sticky Notes</strong></p><p>Brainstorm features, user stories, or architecture by spreading sticky notes on a table or wall. Rearranging physical notes helps you see connections you might miss on a screen. It’s also great for team workshops or solo planning.</p><p>6️⃣ 📝 <strong>Journal Your Coding Struggles and Wins</strong></p><p>Keep a daily or weekly dev journal. Note what went well, what challenges you faced, and how you solved them. This reflection deepens your understanding, helps you avoid repeating mistakes, and documents your growth—like version control for your brain.</p><p><em>💬 Your turn!\nwhat offline techniques do you use to stay sharp or get unstuck?

This error is frustrating for developers, especially when you’re demoing, testing webhooks, or collaborating remotely. In this article, we’ll break down what causes , why ngrok shows this splash page, and how you can avoid it entirely by switching to Tunnelmole—an open source, no-splash alternative for public URLs.</p><p>The  error is not a traditional error code, but rather a user-facing splash page that ngrok displays when you access a public URL generated by their service. According to the ngrok documentation, the page typically says:</p><blockquote><p>You are about to visit&nbsp;. This website is served for free through ngrok.com. You should only visit this website if you trust whoever sent the link to you</p></blockquote><p>This splash page acts as a warning and a gatekeeper, requiring the user to click through before accessing your local app. For developers, this is a major annoyance—especially when you need seamless, automated, or user-friendly access to your local server.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Does ngrok Show a Splash Page (err_ngrok_6024)?\n</h2><p>ngrok’s splash page is a security and branding measure. It appears for several reasons:</p><ul><li> ngrok wants to warn users that the site is being served from a developer’s machine, not a production server.</li><li> The splash page advertises ngrok’s service and encourages users to sign up for a paid plan.</li><li> The splash page is enforced on free ngrok tunnels, especially for HTTP/HTTPS URLs, to discourage abuse and promote upgrades.</li></ul><p>While ngrok's stated intention is to protect users, it often gets in the way of legitimate development workflows.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Scenarios Where err_ngrok_6024 Appears\n</h2><p>The splash page often gets in the way in the following scenarios:</p><ul><li> Services like Stripe, GitHub, or IFTTT can’t click through splash pages, so webhook requests fail.</li><li><strong>Sharing with Clients or Colleagues:</strong> Non-technical users may be confused or alarmed by the warning.</li><li> End-to-end tests or CI/CD pipelines break because the splash page interrupts the flow.</li><li> Accessing your local app from a phone or tablet requires extra steps.</li></ul><p>If you’re using ngrok’s free plan, the documentation states that the only way around this is to make the client application (e.g. the browser) set special headers. In alot of situations that requires a code change and depending on what you are using ngrok for, you may not be able to control client headers i.e. if you are just running the backend or server side.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Fix or Bypass the ngrok Splash Page\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>Upgrade to a Paid ngrok Plan</strong></h3><p>ngrok allows you to remove the splash page if you pay for a Pro or higher plan.

I meticulously added them to my  file, so as not to remember their IP. Something puzzled me, though: my Synology NAS was readily available as  on the network, without doing anything. I have close to zero skills in system administration, so here are my findings.</p><p>We can learn more about  domain from Wikipedia.</p><blockquote><p>The domain name  is a special-use domain name reserved by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) so that it may not be installed as a top-level domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. As such it is similar to the other special domain names, such as .localhost. However, .local has since been designated for use in link-local networking, in applications of multicast DNS (mDNS) and zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) so that DNS service may be established without local installations of conventional DNS infrastructure on local area networks. </p></blockquote><p>The next step is obviously checking the Multicast DNS definition:</p><blockquote><p> is a computer networking protocol that resolves hostnames to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server. It is a zero-configuration service, using essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as unicast Domain Name System (DNS). It was designed to work as either a stand-alone protocol or compatible with standard DNS servers.\nIt uses IP multicast User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets and is implemented by the Apple Bonjour and open-source Avahi software packages, included in most Linux distributions.<p>\nAlthough the Windows 10 implementation was limited to discovering networked printers, subsequent releases resolved hostnames as well. mDNS can work in conjunction with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), a companion zero-configuration networking technique specified separately in RFC 6763.</p></p></blockquote><p>In short, when you send a request to a  domain, you sent it to a special multicast IP–. Devices can join the multicast group associated to this IP. From this point on, the router forwards the request to all devices in the group.The one with the corresponding host will respond, others will ignore it.</p><p>Here's the result of pinging the above IP on my local network:</p><div><pre><code>PING 224.0.0.251 (224.0.0.251): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.73: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.251 ms\n64 bytes from 224.0.0.251: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=13.876 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.36: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=127.181 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.71: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=128.267 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.80: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=128.588 ms\n</code></pre></div><p>Notice that I get responses from other IPs.</p><p>With this approach, local networks can avoid the burden of setting up an internal DNS and the configuration that goes with it on each device.</p><p>For my own local network, I prefer the  domain to a full-fledged DNS  configuring every device. As I mentioned above, my Synology NAS does it automatically.</p><p>Let's set it up for my Raspberry Pi. It works for any Linux-based distribution. I'll use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_(software)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avahi</a>, which implements mDNS.</p><div><pre><code>apt-get update\napt-get avahi-daemon\n</code></pre></div><p>We also need to update the  to plugin in into the host resolution system.</p><div><pre><code>...\nhosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n...\n</code></pre></div><p>The above configuration tries to resolve host in order:</p><ol></ol><p>If the host hasn't been resolved at this point, return. Note that options after this stage are for documentation only: you can remove them with no side-effect, but it allows admins what options are available.</p><p>Since I started using Ansible to manage my Pi, here's the corresponding playbook:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you operate a small local network that only a few trusted people have access to, you can benefit from multicast and the  domain instead of full-fledged internal DNS server. We only had to install the Avahi daemon locally and tweak the  file. For Infrastructure-as-Code purposes, I used an Ansible playbook.</p>","contentLength":3888,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to test signup flows with Playwright and real email verification","url":"https://dev.to/rodion_3389008d3dc9f14749/how-to-test-signup-flows-with-playwright-and-real-email-verification-2ki7","date":1751533016,"author":"Rodion","guid":182926,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Email confirmation is a critical step in many signup flows — but it’s often left out of automated testing due to complexity or slow third-party tools.

We've entered an era where AI testing has evolved from a specialized niche to an absolute necessity for any organization deploying intelligent systems at scale.<p>\nThe year 2025 marks a pivotal moment in software quality assurance. Modern QA teams are confronting unprecedented challenges as they adapt their methodologies to handle systems that think, learn, and evolve. This shift demands not just new tools, but an entirely different mindset about what it means to verify that software works correctly and safely.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Fundamental Differences in AI Testing\n</h2><p>Unlike traditional software systems that follow deterministic logic with predictable input-output relationships, AI systems operate in a realm of uncertainty and probability. These systems are inherently probabilistic, making decisions based on statistical patterns rather than explicit rules. They're driven by data rather than code, continuously learning and adapting their behavior based on new information. Perhaps most challenging of all, they often function as \"black boxes,\" making it nearly impossible to understand exactly how they arrive at their conclusions.\nThis probabilistic nature makes AI systems highly sensitive to variations in input data, environmental noise, and hidden biases present in training datasets. A slight change in input formatting, an unexpected data distribution, or a subtle bias in historical data can dramatically alter system behavior in ways that traditional testing approaches simply cannot capture or predict.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Critical Areas of Focus for AI System Testing\n</h2><p>Model accuracy and performance testing forms the foundation of AI validation. This involves rigorously comparing predictions against known ground truth data, utilizing sophisticated metrics like precision, recall, F1 scores, and area under the curve (AUC) measurements. Teams must benchmark their models against expected behavior in carefully crafted scenarios, ensuring that the AI performs within acceptable parameters across diverse use cases.\nBias and fairness testing has become equally crucial, particularly as AI systems make decisions that affect real people's lives. This involves detecting unintended discrimination in outputs based on protected characteristics like race, gender, or age. Teams perform detailed subgroup analysis and employ fairness indicators to evaluate whether their systems comply with ethical standards and regulatory requirements.<p>\nAdversarial testing pushes AI systems to their limits by feeding them deliberately crafted \"tricky\" or manipulated inputs. This approach helps identify brittleness in models and surfaces potential security vulnerabilities that malicious actors might exploit. It's essentially stress testing for intelligent systems, revealing weaknesses that normal operational data might never expose.</p>\nRobustness testing ensures that AI systems maintain consistent performance despite small variations in input data. This includes evaluating how well models generalize across edge cases and unexpected scenarios that weren't present in training data. A robust AI system should handle slight changes in input format, lighting conditions, or data quality without dramatic performance degradation.<p>\nExplainability and transparency testing becomes critical, especially in regulated industries where decision-making processes must be auditable. Teams validate the effectiveness of interpretation techniques like LIME, SHAP, or other explainable AI methods, ensuring that when the system makes important decisions, stakeholders can understand the reasoning behind them.</p>\nData drift and model decay monitoring addresses the reality that AI systems operate in dynamic environments where data patterns change over time. This involves continuously monitoring incoming data for distributional shifts and automating the revalidation of models to ensure they remain accurate and relevant as conditions evolve.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Modern Tools and Technologies\n</h2><p>The AI testing landscape has spawned a new generation of specialized tools designed specifically for these challenges. DeepChecks provides comprehensive validation, fairness assessment, and robustness testing capabilities. WhyLabs offers real-time AI observability and drift detection, allowing teams to monitor their systems continuously. Fiddler AI focuses on explainable AI testing, helping teams understand and validate their models' decision-making processes.\nOpen-source solutions like Alibi Detect provide sophisticated outlier, drift, and adversarial detection capabilities. Great Expectations brings data validation and testing frameworks specifically designed for AI pipelines. Google's Facets offers powerful data visualization and bias testing tools, while IBM's AI Fairness 360 provides a comprehensive open-source toolkit for bias detection and mitigation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Comprehensive Testing Scope\n</h2><p>Effective AI testing requires a holistic approach that encompasses multiple layers of the system. Input data quality, bias, and completeness must be validated before it even reaches the model. Feature engineering pipelines need testing to ensure they transform raw data correctly and consistently. Machine learning model behavior must be evaluated under both expected and unexpected scenarios to identify potential failure modes.\nIntegration testing becomes crucial as AI components interact with APIs, user interfaces, and other systems. Security and compliance testing ensures that model usage adheres to privacy regulations and data protection requirements. Finally, comprehensive logging and audit trail testing provides the documentation necessary for regulatory compliance and system accountability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Modern Development Practices\n</h2><p>Forward-thinking organizations are seamlessly integrating AI testing into their DevOps workflows. This involves automating model validation on every model update, using sophisticated model versioning tools like MLflow or DVC to track changes and dependencies. Teams are implementing comprehensive model lineage tracking to understand how data flows through their systems and implementing revalidation processes in staging environments before deployment.\nCritical to this integration is the establishment of clear thresholds for accuracy, latency, and fairness that serve as gating conditions for deployment. These quantitative guardrails ensure that only models meeting predetermined quality standards make it to production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Overcoming Unique Challenges\n</h2><p>AI testing faces several fundamental challenges that don't exist in traditional software testing. There's often no single \"correct\" output for a given input, making it difficult to establish clear pass/fail criteria. The lack of comprehensive test oracles—expected output sets—means teams must rely on statistical validation rather than deterministic verification. Dynamic models that change over time add another layer of complexity, as yesterday's correct behavior might be today's bug.\nHidden and systemic bias presents perhaps the most insidious challenge, as it can be embedded deep within training data and manifest in subtle ways that traditional testing approaches might miss. Standard test case creation methodologies simply don't apply when dealing with systems that learn and adapt.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Success\n</h2><p>Successful AI testing requires a combination of manual exploration and automated validation. Teams must test models across wide spectrums of inputs, evaluating results statistically rather than relying on simple boolean pass/fail criteria. Explainability tools become essential for understanding model rationale and identifying potential issues before they impact users.\nPrivacy and data leakage testing ensures that models don't inadvertently expose sensitive information from their training data. Perhaps most importantly, continuous post-deployment monitoring for drift and ethical lapses ensures that AI systems remain reliable and trustworthy throughout their operational lifetime.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Quality Assurance\n</h2><p>As we advance through 2025, AI continues its expansion into HR systems, financial services, marketing platforms, healthcare applications, and customer service tools. The role of software testers has fundamentally evolved from asking \"Does it work?\" to asking \"Is it fair, safe, and understandable?\" This expanded mission makes AI testing not just a technical necessity, but a critical component of ethical technology deployment.\nAI testing has become the quality gatekeeper of our increasingly intelligent world, ensuring that the systems we depend on are not only functional but also trustworthy, fair, and aligned with human values. The tools, strategies, and guardrails we establish today will shape the future of ethical AI development and deployment for years to come.</p>","contentLength":9103,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Database Connection Management（1751528329592500）","url":"https://dev.to/member_57439f86/database-connection-management1751528329592500-25ok","date":1751528331,"author":"member_57439f86","guid":182865,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

Hosting protects the server while security plugins protect your WordPress installation specifically. They work together for complete protection.</p><p>Many hosting providers offer basic security but it’s not enough for WordPress-specific threats. Security plugins understand WordPress vulnerabilities that generic server security might miss.</p><p><strong>Will security plugins slow down my website?</strong></p><p>Some security plugins affect performance while others don’t. Cloud-based solutions like Sucuri have minimal impact because they work from external servers. Server-based plugins like Wordfence can slow down scans but protect better against certain attacks.</p><p>Choose based on your priorities. High-traffic sites benefit from cloud protection while smaller sites can use server-based plugins effectively.</p><p><strong>How often should I scan my website for malware?</strong></p><p>Daily scans work well for most websites. Business sites handling sensitive data should scan more frequently, even every few hours.</p><p>The scan frequency depends on:</p><ul><li>How often you update content</li><li>Your website’s traffic volume</li><li>The sensitivity of your data</li><li>Your industry’s threat level</li></ul><p><strong>What should I do if my website gets hacked?</strong></p><p>Take immediate action if you discover a hack:</p><ul><li>Change all passwords immediately including WordPress, hosting, and email</li><li>Activate your security plugin’s cleanup features</li><li>Restore from a clean backup if available</li><li>Contact your security plugin’s support team</li><li>Consider hiring professional cleanup services for complex infections</li><li>Notify customers if their data might be compromised</li></ul><p><strong>Free vs paid security plugins – which should I choose?</strong></p><p>Free versions provide basic protection suitable for personal blogs and small websites. They typically include:</p><ul><li>Basic firewall protection</li></ul><p>Paid versions offer advanced features needed for business websites:</p><ul><li>Real-time threat intelligence updates</li><li>Professional malware removal</li><li>Priority customer support</li><li>Advanced reporting and monitoring</li><li>Guaranteed response times</li></ul><p><strong>Can I use multiple security plugins together?</strong></p><p>Generally, you should use only one comprehensive security plugin to avoid conflicts. However, you can combine specialized plugins safely:</p><ul><li>One main security plugin for firewall and scanning</li><li>A separate backup plugin if needed</li><li>Spam protection plugins like Akismet</li><li>SSL plugins for certificate management</li></ul><p>Always test plugin combinations on a staging site first to check for conflicts.</p><p><strong>How do I know if my security plugin is working?</strong></p><p>Monitor these indicators to verify your security plugin is functioning:</p><ul><li>Regular scan completion notifications</li><li>Security log entries showing blocked attacks</li><li>Alert emails for suspicious activity</li><li>Dashboard showing plugin status as active</li><li>Performance metrics staying within normal ranges</li></ul><p>Test your security periodically by checking if the plugin detects known issues or blocks simulated attacks.</p><p>WordPress security is not optional in 2025. Hackers use advanced tools and target websites of all sizes. The right security plugin protects your hard work and keeps visitors safe.</p><p>For most websites, I recommend starting with Wordfence for comprehensive protection. Business owners who want simplicity should choose Solid Security. High-traffic sites benefit from Sucuri’s cloud protection.</p><p>Remember that security plugins work best when combined with good practices. Keep WordPress updated, use strong passwords, choose reliable hosting, and backup your site regularly.</p><p>Don’t wait until your site gets hacked. Install a security plugin today and sleep better knowing your website has professional protection working around the clock.</p><p> ServerAvatar is powerful and user-friendly server and application management panel and hosting platform.

But the success of your app depends not just on what it does, but on how it’s built. One of the first decisions any business faces is whether to go with native or cross-platform development.</p><p>So, what’s the difference? Which one aligns better with your business goals? Let’s break it down in simple terms.</p><h2><strong>What is Native App Development?</strong></h2><p>Native apps are developed specifically for one platform—iOS or Android—using platform-specific programming languages. For iOS, it's typically Swift or Objective-C; for Android, it's Kotlin or Java.</p><p>Top-tier performance: Apps run smoother and faster.</p><p>Better user experience: Native design and interactions feel seamless to users.</p><p>Full access to device features: Camera, GPS, push notifications, sensors, and more.</p><p>Apps requiring high performance (like gaming or AR)</p><p>Apps targeting a specific user base (iOS or Android)</p><p>Long-term, scalable products with larger budgets</p><h2><strong>What is cross-platform app development?</strong></h2><p>Cross-platform apps are built using a single codebase that works across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, and Web). Tools like Flutter, React Native, or Xamarin are commonly used.</p><p>Uniform experience across platforms</p><p>Startups and MVPs looking for a quick launch</p><p>Budget-conscious businesses</p><p>Apps with basic or moderate performance needs</p><h2><strong>Key Comparison: Native vs Cross-Platform</strong></h2><p>Native apps win here. Because they’re built for a specific platform, they offer optimized speed, responsiveness, and integration. Cross-platform apps are improving in performance, but for high-end needs like 3D graphics or complex animations, native is still king.</p><h3><strong>2. Development Cost and Time</strong></h3><p>Cross-platform saves time and money. A single development team can create apps for both iOS and Android. Native apps, on the other hand, require separate teams, doubling cost and effort.</p><p>Native apps provide a smoother and more intuitive user experience. They follow platform-specific design guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS), which users subconsciously appreciate.</p><h3><strong>4. Maintenance and Updates</strong></h3><p>With cross-platform, updates can be rolled out simultaneously across platforms—making ongoing maintenance easier and more cost-effective. Native apps require platform-specific updates, which can be time-consuming.</p><h3><strong>5. Third-party Integration and Device Features</strong></h3><p>If your app needs deep integration with hardware (like Bluetooth, camera, fingerprint sensor), native is the safer bet. Cross-platform frameworks sometimes struggle with accessing advanced device features, though plugins and custom bridging can fill the gap.</p><h2><strong>Which One Should You Choose?</strong></h2><p>Here’s a quick recommendation based on your business profile:</p><p>You’re building a high-performance, graphics-intensive app</p><p>Your user experience needs to feel flawlessly native</p><p>You’re targeting either iOS or Android exclusively</p><p>You have the budget to invest in two separate codebases</p><p>You’re launching an MVP or early-stage product</p><p>You want to reach both iOS and Android users quickly</p><p>Your app doesn’t require complex hardware-level integration</p><p>You’re looking for a cost-effective solution</p><ul><li><p> WhatsApp, Spotify, and Instagram started as native apps to ensure high performance and scale gradually.</p></li><li><p> Alibaba, Google Ads, and Reflectly use Flutter or React Native to serve a wide audience faster.</p></li></ul><p><strong>How We Help at Weetech Solution</strong></p><p>At Weetech Solution, we don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach.

But I often asked myself, “What makes the best truly stand out?” I want to share what I’ve learned in hopes it helps you the way I wish it helped me when I was starting.</p><p>\n\"Don’t guess, read the manual. The answers are already there.\"</p><p>One habit of great programmers is going directly to the source, the official documentation. Whether it’s the Python Standard Library, Apache Docs, or a configuration spec, they read it. They don’t jump to Stack Overflow or chatbots first.</p><p><em>Why?\nBecause reading the reference gives you a full understanding, not just quick fixes. It helps you learn the “why,” not just the “how.”</em></p><p>\n\"Know your tools so well that they feel like an extension of your hands.\"</p><p>It’s not enough to “use” a tool. The best devs understand it deeply. They know:</p><p>Its current maintainers and limitations.</p><p>The entire ecosystem around it.</p><p>If you're using Kafka daily, don’t just copy-paste snippets. Learn Kafka inside out. That’s what separates users from experts.</p><p><strong>3. Read the Error Messages</strong><em>\"Your computer is trying to talk to you. Listen.\"</em></p><p>Great engineers read every error message carefully. They don’t panic, they pause and analyse. Many bugs solve themselves once you understand what the system is telling you. It’s almost magical.</p><p><strong>4. Break Down the Problem</strong><em>\"If it looks too big, make it smaller.\"</em></p><p>Big problems overwhelm everyone. The best devs break them down into smaller, bite-sized steps. That’s their secret weapon. Complex systems are just a bunch of simple problems stacked together.</p><p>Pro Tip: If you're stuck, you're probably trying to solve too much at once. Simplify.</p><p><strong>5. Don’t Be Afraid To Get Your Hands Dirty</strong><em>\"Code is just code. Dive in.\"</em></p><p>Elite devs don’t shy away from unknown or messy codebases. They explore, read, refactor, and make sense of things others avoid. That’s how they grow. They learn by doing.</p><p>When others hesitate, they get started.</p><p><em>\"Helping others helps you grow.\"</em></p><p>The best devs are also generous. They’re busy, yet they make time to help teammates. They listen, support, and teach. Not because they’re forced to — but because they care.</p><p>Being curious, humble, and helpful is a superpower.</p><p><em>\"Clear writing reflects clear thinking.\"</em></p><p>Great programmers also write well. Blogs, tutorials, or open-source documentation — they love sharing. Good writing forces you to think clearly and structure your knowledge.</p><p>Bonus: Better writers often become better coders too.</p><p><em>\"Stay curious, stay young.\"</em></p><p>Some of the best devs I know are over 60, yet still learning every day. Why? Because they love it.</p><p>Bad devs think learning ends with a degree. Great ones know it never ends. They embrace every new tool, language, or framework with joy and a learner’s mindset.</p><p><strong>9. Stay Humble — Status Doesn’t Matter</strong><em>\"Everyone has something to teach you.\"</em></p><p>Whether it’s an intern or a senior architect, the best devs treat everyone equally. They know fresh ideas can come from anywhere. Hierarchy doesn’t block learning.</p><p><em>\"Let your work speak louder than your title.\"</em></p><p>To be truly great, others must know you're great. Not for fame, but for impact.</p><p>Ways to build a strong reputation:</p><p>Write useful tools or libraries.</p><p>Speak, write, or contribute to the community.</p><p>Your name becomes your brand. Build it slowly and intentionally.</p><p><em>\"Good things take time — and so does good code.\"</em></p><p>Patience is underrated. Software breaks, people misunderstand, things move slow. Without patience, frustration takes over.</p><p>Patience gives you the power to debug, to teach, and to learn. It helps you stay focused and committed.</p><p><strong>12. Never Blame the Computer</strong><em>\"There is always a reason — find it.\"</em></p><p>When things break, bad devs blame the system. Good devs dig deeper. Computers aren’t random — there's always logic behind the chaos.</p><p>The best never stop until they uncover the cause.</p><p><em>\"Saying ‘I don’t know’ is the first step to knowing.\"</em></p><p>Smart devs admit what they don’t know. They don’t pretend or guess. They pause, think, and explore.</p><p>This honesty builds trust. It also unlocks curiosity and growth.</p><p><em>\"If you’re unsure, don’t assume — find out.\"</em></p><p>One of the biggest mistakes is guessing under pressure. Guesses become false foundations.</p><p>When something is unclear, pause. Go back. Read more. Test.</p><p><em>\"In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\"</em>\n— The Zen of Python</p><p><em>\"Your journey as a developer is not a race, but a climb. Step by step, day by day.\"</em></p><p>You don’t have to master all these overnight. Pick one, grow from it, and slowly become the kind of developer others admire and rely on.</p><p>Keep showing up.

Specifically, I used <code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17</code> for its speed in enhancing user prompts and  for its stunning image quality.</p><p> The design process was iterative. I started with a basic layout but quickly moved towards a more modern and immersive \"glassmorphism\" aesthetic. The animated gradient background and the mouse-following spotlight effect were added to make the experience feel more dynamic and magical, contrasting with the often-static nature of office work.</p><p> One of the most interesting challenges was crafting the system instruction for Gemini. It took several tries to perfect a prompt that could consistently transform a simple user idea (e.g., \"sad desk lunch\") into a detailed, cinematic, and emotionally resonant prompt suitable for Imagen. This felt like teaching the AI to be a creative director.</p><p> The desk scene was built with pure CSS and Tailwind utility classes. I wanted it to feel like a part of the application, not just a static image. Adding the subtle hover animations—the steaming coffee, the wiggling sticky notes—was my favorite part, as it brought a little bit of life and whimsy to the scene.</p><p> I'd love to expand this by adding more CSS art scenes (perhaps a break room or a server room?) and allowing users to choose different artistic styles for their generated images.</p><p>This was an incredibly rewarding project to build, blending my passion for clean UI/UX design with the limitless possibilities of generative AI.

For developers working on complex problems, this recovery time can be even longer.</p></blockquote><p>When you're juggling multiple programming languages, frameworks, and project contexts simultaneously, your brain becomes a overloaded CPU, constantly swapping between different mental \"threads.\"</p><h2><strong>Why Developers Are Particularly Vulnerable</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F594vbn67p0a1av8sc8ca.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F594vbn67p0a1av8sc8ca.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"732\"></a>\nSoftware development is inherently complex work that requires:</p><ul><li>: Understanding intricate system architectures and debugging complex issues</li><li>: Keeping track of multiple variables, functions, and data flows</li><li>: Designing elegant solutions and innovative approaches</li><li>: Catching subtle bugs that could break entire systems</li></ul><h3><strong>Each context switch forces your brain to:</strong></h3><ol><li>Save the current mental state</li></ol><p>This process is mentally exhausting and significantly reduces both the quality and quantity of your output.</p><h2><strong>The Science Behind Developer Focus: What Research Tells Us</strong></h2><p>Neuroscience research has revealed fascinating insights about how our brains handle complex cognitive tasks like programming. When developers enter a state of deep focus, several brain regions work in harmony:</p><h3><strong>1. The Prefrontal Cortex: Your Mental Workspace</strong></h3><p>The prefrontal cortex acts as your brain's working memory, holding all the relevant information about your current coding task. When you're debugging a function, this region maintains:</p><ul><li>Variable states and values</li><li>Potential solution pathways</li></ul><p>Context switching forces this region to constantly clear and reload information, creating what researchers call \"cognitive residue\"—mental remnants from previous tasks that interfere with current performance.</p><h3><strong>2. The Default Mode Network: When Focus Breaks</strong></h3><p>When you're interrupted, your brain's default mode network activates, shifting attention to internal thoughts and external distractions. This network is useful for creativity and problem-solving during downtime, but it's the enemy of sustained focus during active coding sessions.</p><h3><strong>3. Flow State: The Developer's Sweet Spot</strong></h3><p>Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's research on flow states shows that developers perform best when they achieve a balance between challenge and skill level. Flow states are characterized by:</p><ul><li>Complete absorption in the task</li><li>Loss of self-consciousness</li></ul><p>Context switching is the antithesis of flow state, fragmenting attention and preventing the deep immersion necessary for optimal performance.</p><h2><strong>Real-World Impact: How Context Switching Destroys Developer Productivity</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs13mbkz4kc7t1hj8cyce.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs13mbkz4kc7t1hj8cyce.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"770\"></a>\nLet's examine how context switching manifests in typical developer workflows and its measurable impact on productivity.</p><p>Many developers pride themselves on being able to juggle multiple projects simultaneously. However, research consistently shows that multitasking is actually \"task-switching\"—rapidly alternating between different activities. This creates several problems:</p><p>: A study by the University of California, Irvine found that interrupted work contains 25% more errors than uninterrupted work. For developers, this translates to:</p><ul><li>More bugs introduced during coding</li><li>Higher likelihood of security vulnerabilities</li><li>Reduced code maintainability</li></ul><p>: While it feels like you're accomplishing more by switching between tasks, research shows that multitasking can reduce productivity by up to 40%. Developers who attempt to work on multiple features simultaneously often experience:</p><ul><li>Longer completion times for individual tasks</li><li>Reduced creative problem-solving ability</li></ul><h2><strong>Common Context Switching Triggers in Development</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmv5974wqv8j0do7wtywk.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmv5974wqv8j0do7wtywk.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"775\"></a>\nUnderstanding what causes context switching is crucial for developing countermeasures.

Understanding the Bedrock: The PHP-FPM Architecture\n</h2><p>Before we can appreciate what Octane brings to the table, we must first have a solid understanding of the architecture it seeks to improve upon.</p><p>PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is the de facto standard for running PHP applications in production. It is an advanced implementation of the FastCGI protocol. In a typical setup (like Nginx + PHP-FPM), the web server (Nginx) handles the incoming HTTP requests and acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding the request to the PHP-FPM service. FPM then manages a pool of PHP worker processes to execute the application code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Classic Request Lifecycle\n</h3><p>The \"shared-nothing\" architecture of PHP-FPM is its defining characteristic. For every single incoming request, the following sequence of events occurs:</p><ol><li> The web server (e.g., Nginx) receives an HTTP request.</li><li> The web server determines that the request is for a PHP application and proxies it to the PHP-FPM master process via a socket.</li><li> FPM selects an idle worker process from its pool. If none are available, the request may be queued or a new worker may be spawned, depending on the configuration.</li><li> This is the most critical and expensive step. The PHP worker process starts from a clean slate. It must:\n\n<ul><li>  Initialize the Composer autoloader.</li><li>  Bootstrap the entire Laravel framework: create the application container, load all configuration files, register all service providers, boot the providers, and resolve core dependencies.</li><li>  The request is passed through the middleware stack.</li><li>  The router dispatches the request to the appropriate controller.</li></ul></li><li> Your application logic runs—a controller method is executed, a database query is made, a view is rendered.</li><li> The application generates an HTTP response.</li><li> The response is sent back to the web server, and then to the client. The PHP process, along with all its memory (the bootstrapped framework, objects, variables), is completely destroyed. The worker process is returned to the pool, ready for the next request, with no memory of the previous one.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Simplicity &amp; Reliability:</strong> This model is incredibly robust. A memory leak or an unhandled exception in one request will not affect subsequent requests because the process is terminated. This isolation makes applications highly stable.</li><li> The setup is universally understood and supported by virtually all hosting providers and deployment tools.</li><li> Developers rarely have to worry about application state persisting between requests, which simplifies development logic.</li></ul><ul><li> The primary drawback is the . For every single request, your entire Laravel application must be booted from scratch. While modern hardware and PHP's JIT compiler have made this faster, it's still a significant amount of redundant work, especially for small, fast API requests. This latency floor limits the maximum number of requests per second (RPS) a server can handle.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. The New Contender: Introduction to Laravel Octane\n</h2><p>Laravel Octane was created to directly address the performance bottleneck of the FPM model. It's not a replacement for PHP, but rather a new way to serve your Laravel application.</p><p>Octane is an application server that boots your Laravel application , keeps it in memory, and then feeds it requests at high speed. It achieves this by integrating with modern, asynchronous application servers written in other languages (like Go for RoadRunner) or using PHP extensions built for this purpose (Swoole).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Octane Request Lifecycle: A Paradigm Shift\n</h3><ol><li> You start the Octane server from the command line ().</li><li><strong>Master Process &amp; Worker Spawning:</strong> Octane starts a master server process. This process then spawns a pool of Octane workers.</li><li> Each worker process bootstraps the Laravel framework  and holds the application container, service providers, and other framework structures in memory.</li><li> The Octane master server receives an HTTP request directly.</li><li> The request is passed to an available worker.</li><li> The worker, which already has the framework booted, creates a sandboxed copy of the request/response objects. It passes the request through the middleware and router to your controller.</li><li> Your application logic runs.</li><li> A response is generated.</li><li> Here's the crucial difference. Instead of tearing down the entire application, Octane intelligently \"cleans up.\" It resets certain framework components (like the request object, configuration, etc.) to their original state, preparing the worker for the next request. The core framework, however, remains in memory.</li><li> The worker is immediately available to handle another request, skipping the expensive bootstrap process entirely.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Engines Behind Octane\n</h3><ul><li> A powerful PHP extension written in C++. It provides an event-driven, asynchronous, coroutine-based networking framework for PHP. It's incredibly fast and feature-rich, even offering built-in support for things like WebSockets, timers, and concurrent task processing.</li><li> A high-performance PHP application server, load balancer, and process manager written in Go. It communicates with PHP workers over pipes. It's generally easier to set up than Swoole (as it doesn't require a custom PHP extension) and is extremely fast and robust.</li></ul><ul><li> By eliminating the bootstrap overhead, Octane can handle thousands of requests per second on modest hardware, an order of magnitude more than a typical FPM setup.</li><li> The time to first byte (TTFB) is dramatically lower because the framework is already waiting in memory.</li><li> While the baseline memory usage is higher, the CPU usage under load is often lower because it's not constantly re-compiling and re-executing the same bootstrap code.</li></ul><ul><li> This is the single biggest challenge. Since the application lives on between requests, developers must be extremely careful about not leaking state from one request to the next (e.g., via static properties or long-lived singletons).</li><li> Poorly written code can now cause memory leaks that will accumulate over time, eventually requiring a worker to be restarted.</li><li> You can't just  and be done. You need to manage the Octane server process itself. Deployments require restarting the server (<code>php artisan octane:reload</code>) to load the new code. This requires a more sophisticated deployment process and process management tools like Supervisor.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  3.

Practical Implications &amp; Code Examples\n</h2><p>The shift to an in-memory model has real-world consequences for your code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Singleton Problem: A Common Pitfall\n</h3><p>In a normal FPM application, a singleton service is resolved once per request. In Octane, it's resolved once and then <strong>re-used for all subsequent requests</strong> handled by that worker.</p><p>Consider this simple service that caches some data:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you register this as a singleton, the  array will persist across requests. The first user's data will be served to the second user if they share the same worker and the logic isn't designed to handle this. This is a classic state leak.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cleaning Up: Managing State Between Requests\n</h3><p>Octane provides tools to mitigate these issues. You can use the  method or bind objects to the container in a way that they are re-resolved on each request.</p><p><strong>Solution 1: The Octane  Hook</strong></p><p>You can register a callback in your  to flush the state of your singleton.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Solution 2: Re-think the Singleton</strong></p><p>The best solution is often to not make the service a singleton in the first place if it contains request-specific state. Let the container resolve a fresh instance when needed, or use a dedicated, request-aware cache.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Benchmarking: A Realistic Perspective\n</h2><p>Simple \"Hello, World\" benchmarks are impressive but not representative of real-world applications. A more realistic test involves:</p><ul><li>  A route that accepts parameters.</li><li>  Middleware execution (auth, etc.).</li><li>  A database query (e.g., fetching a user model).</li><li>  Eloquent model serialization to JSON.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Hypothetical Benchmark Scenario\n</h3><ul><li> A modest 2-core, 4GB RAM cloud server.</li><li> or  (ApacheBench).</li><li> which fetches a user and returns it.</li><li> 100 concurrent connections for 30 seconds.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Expected Results and Analysis\n</h3><ul><li> Might handle . The primary bottleneck will be the CPU, as it constantly works to bootstrap the framework. Latency will be higher and more variable.</li><li><strong>Laravel Octane (RoadRunner):</strong> Will likely handle . The performance is dramatically better because the only work being done on each request is the database query and JSON serialization. The framework overhead is virtually gone. Latency will be extremely low and consistent.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Making the Right Choice: When to Use Octane vs. FPM\n</h2><p>This is not a question of which is \"better,\" but which is \"fitter for the purpose.\"</p><ul><li><strong>You are on shared hosting.</strong> You don't have the shell access required to run and manage the Octane server process.</li><li><strong>Your application is low-to-medium traffic.</strong> If your app serves a few hundred users an hour, the performance benefits of Octane may not justify the added complexity.</li><li><strong>Simplicity and stability are your top priorities.</strong> FPM is battle-hardened and easier to debug.</li><li><strong>Your team is not yet comfortable with the concepts of state management and memory leaks.</strong> Octane requires a higher level of developer discipline.</li><li><strong>You have a large, legacy codebase.</strong> Refactoring a large application to be \"Octane-safe\" can be a significant undertaking.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Switch to Laravel Octane If...\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Performance is a critical business requirement.</strong> For e-commerce, ad-tech, or any service where latency impacts revenue, Octane is a game-changer.</li><li><strong>You are building high-traffic APIs.</strong> Octane allows you to serve significantly more API traffic from the same hardware, reducing infrastructure costs.</li><li><strong>You need real-time features.</strong> The Swoole server for Octane has first-class support for WebSockets, making it ideal for building chat applications, live dashboards, and more.</li><li><strong>You have control over your infrastructure.</strong> You are comfortable using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or Supervisor to manage long-running server processes.</li><li><strong>Your team is prepared for the new development paradigm.</strong> They understand the risks of stateful services and are ready to write clean, Octane-compatible code.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Conclusion: The Future is Fast, But Context is King\n</h2><p>Laravel Octane represents a significant evolution in the PHP world, pushing the language into the realm of high-performance, asynchronous applications previously dominated by Node.js and Go. The performance gains are not just incremental; they are transformative. By shedding the repetitive weight of the framework bootstrap, Octane unlocks a new level of efficiency and speed for Laravel applications.</p><p>However, this power comes with new responsibilities. The shift from the stateless, isolated world of PHP-FPM to the stateful, in-memory world of Octane requires a mental model adjustment from developers and a more sophisticated approach to deployment and process management from operations teams.</p><p>PHP-FPM is not obsolete. It remains the perfect choice for a vast number of web applications where its simplicity, stability, and ease of use are more valuable than raw, top-end performance. It is the reliable workhorse that continues to power a massive portion of the web.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice is not about abandoning the old for the new. It's about understanding the trade-offs and choosing the right tool for the job. For your next high-traffic API, real-time service, or performance-critical endpoint, Laravel Octane should be a primary contender. For your company's internal CRUD app or your personal blog, the venerable PHP-FPM is still an excellent and perfectly sensible choice. The future of PHP is not just one thing; it's a rich ecosystem with powerful options for every use case.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  8.

Yet somehow, you're expected to speak fluent \"engineer\" while translating complex technical concepts into something your stakeholders can understand.</p><p>Of all the technical jargon floating around your organization, APIs seem to be the buzzword that refuses to stay in the engineering department. When was the last time your marketing director enthusiastically discussed database normalization? Probably never. But APIs? They're mentioned in every other meeting.</p><p>We've explored APIs in depth before, but today we're focusing on a critical skill that can make or break your product integrations: understanding API documentation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Bother with API Documentation?\n</h3><p>Let's face it - without APIs, many of today's most valuable products would be islands of isolated functionality.</p><p>Picture a CRM that can't sync with Gmail.</p><p>Imagine accounting software that can't access your bank transactions.</p><p>Think about an e-commerce platform that can't calculate shipping costs.</p><p>APIs are the invisible connective tissue of modern software, and as a PM, you'll inevitably find yourself evaluating potential integrations or partnerships.</p><p><strong>Four compelling reasons to master API documentation:</strong></p><ul><li> – Gone are the days when API docs were engineer-exclusive territory. Today's product teams expect PMs, designers, and QA specialists to understand how APIs function</li><li><strong>You'll spot deal-breakers early</strong> – Documentation that hasn't been updated since 2020? That's a massive red flag worth identifying before you're knee-deep in integration work</li><li> – Documentation serves as your reference guide when verifying API behavior. Without understanding it, you're flying blind</li><li><strong>You'll discover hidden opportunities</strong> – Thorough documentation review often reveals functionality you didn't know existed, potentially inspiring new roadmap items</li></ul><p>I learned this lesson the painful way. During partnership discussions, I skipped reading the API documentation thoroughly. Only later did we discover the API used an outdated SOAP/XML format that made integration practically impossible. Not my finest moment! 😬</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Anatomy of API Documentation\n</h2><p>REST API documentation typically contains these essential elements:</p><ol><li> – How to securely connect to the API</li><li> – What data objects you can access</li><li> – Pre-packaged integration tools for different programming languages</li><li> – The specific URLs your requests target</li><li> – How to structure your API calls</li><li> – What data you'll receive back</li><li> – Status indicators that tell you if things worked</li></ol><p>Let's break these down using real-world examples.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Authentication: Your API Access Pass\n</h2><p>Think of API authentication like a VIP pass at an exclusive event. Without it, you're not getting in.</p><p>Most modern APIs use token-based authentication. In Shippo's case (a shipping API provider we're using as an example), you need a production token to make live requests for shipping labels or address validation.</p><p>Your token is generated based on your account credentials and must be included with every API request. If your token expires or is invalid, your access is immediately cut off.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Resources: The Building Blocks\n</h2><p>APIs give you access to resources - pre-defined collections of data that represent the core value of the service.</p><p><strong>Real-world resource examples:</strong></p><ul></ul><ul></ul><p>As a product manager evaluating an API, understanding available resources is crucial. If you need to mark Shopify orders as fulfilled, you must first confirm the API supports that operation. If you want to pull campaign statistics from Mailchimp, you need to verify a campaign resource exists.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Client Libraries: Ready-Made Integration Tools\n</h2><p>API documentation often includes examples in multiple programming languages. Shippo, for instance, provides implementation samples for:</p><p>These are pre-packaged libraries that simplify API integration for developers working in specific languages. While the core API functionality remains identical, the interface varies by programming language.</p><p>For Ruby developers, these packages often come as \"Ruby Gems\" - bundled code and documentation that streamline integration. Your engineering team will appreciate these shortcuts, though as a PM, you're more concerned with available functionality than implementation details.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  API Endpoints: Where Requests Go\n</h2><p>Third-party integration testing happens endpoint by endpoint. But what exactly is an endpoint?</p><p>When testing an API integration, you need:</p><ol><li>Documentation showing available endpoints</li><li>Knowledge of request/response patterns</li></ol><p>An endpoint is simply the destination for your API request - like an address on the internet. API requests combine methods (verbs) with resources (nouns).</p><p>Consider this analogy: asking your dog to fetch the remote control.</p><p>\"Go fetch the remote control\" translates to:\nGET the RemoteControl</p><p>Here, GET is the method, RemoteControl is the resource, and your dog's ears are the endpoint receiving the request.</p><p>Let's look at real examples:</p><p>Mailchimp's documentation explains that all API requests start with a root URL that includes your data center:</p><p>To access campaign reports, you'd send a request to:</p><p>The endpoint is \"reports\" and requires a campaign ID parameter.</p><p>Spotify's API offers endpoints for accessing music-related resources. To get album information, you'd call the \"albums\" endpoint with a specific album ID.</p><p>As a non-engineer involved in API testing, you'll verify that responses match documentation expectations - a process that requires understanding both requests and responses.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Request Format: What You Send\n</h2><p>Every API interaction involves sending a request to an endpoint and receiving a response.</p><p>Documentation specifies exactly what the API expects in your request.</p><p>In this Shippo example, creating a shipment requires:</p><ul></ul><p>Your request must follow the correct format for each field and use the appropriate HTTP method.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Creates new resources (e.g., creating a text message via Twilio)</td></tr><tr><td>Retrieves data without changing it (considered \"safe\")</td></tr><tr><td>Updates existing data (e.g., changing a user's email)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Response Format: What You Receive\n</h2><p>Quality API documentation always includes examples of expected responses.</p><p>If responses don't match documentation, that's concerning. Sometimes it's just outdated documentation, but it could indicate poor API maintenance - a red flag if you're building critical functionality on this API.</p><p>Shippo's response to a shipment creation includes:</p><ul><li>Success status confirmation</li><li>Recipient address details</li></ul><p>Responses also include status codes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Response Codes: The Status Indicators\n</h2><p>Response codes are numeric indicators that tell you what happened with your request:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Success - everything worked</td></tr><tr><td>Resource moved permanently</td></tr><tr><td>Client-side problem (404 is the famous \"not found\" error)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>While we've focused on REST APIs, GraphQL has emerged as a powerful alternative.</p><p>GraphQL uses a different approach:</p><ol><li> - All requests go to one URL, with the request itself specifying what you want</li><li> - Similar to SQL database queries, you specify exactly what data you need</li><li> - You can request multiple resources in one query, getting only what you asked for</li></ol><p>Notice how the query requests \"products(first: 3)\" - allowing precise control over what's returned.</p><p><strong>REST vs. GraphQL at a glance:</strong></p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Architectural style, industry standard</td><td>Query language offering flexibility and efficiency</td></tr><tr><td>Multiple endpoints for different resources</td><td>Single endpoint for all queries</td></tr><tr><td>May require multiple requests for complex data needs</td><td>Constructs complex queries to get everything in one response</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Generate API Documentation Using Apidog\n</h2><p>In today's development landscape, clear API documentation is non-negotiable.

Maintaining a stable, secure, and efficient infrastructure requires more than just automated provisioning; it demands rigorous code quality checks  changes are applied. While Terraform provides a declarative approach to infrastructure, it doesn’t inherently prevent bad configurations. This is where static analysis tools become critical. AWS CodeGuru Reviewer, when integrated into a Terraform workflow, provides automated code reviews focused on identifying critical issues, improving performance, and reducing operational risk. It fits squarely within a modern IaC pipeline, acting as a gatekeeper before changes reach Terraform Cloud/Enterprise or are applied directly. It’s a key component of a platform engineering stack, enabling self-service infrastructure with built-in guardrails.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is CodeGuru Reviewer in a Terraform Context?\n</h2><p>CodeGuru Reviewer isn’t a Terraform provider in the traditional sense. It doesn’t define new resource types. Instead, it’s an AWS service that analyzes code committed to repositories (AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket) and provides intelligent recommendations.  The integration with Terraform happens through the AWS provider’s ability to trigger CodeGuru Reviewer analyses via a dedicated resource: <code>aws_codeguru_reviewer_repository_association</code>. </p><p>There isn’t a Terraform module specifically  CodeGuru Reviewer, but several community modules exist to simplify the association process.  The core behavior is event-driven. When Terraform applies a change that commits code to a supported repository, CodeGuru Reviewer automatically scans the Terraform configuration files (identified by file extensions like  and ).</p><p>A key caveat: CodeGuru Reviewer operates on the , not the Terraform plan. This means it won’t catch issues related to state inconsistencies or dynamic values resolved during plan execution. It focuses on static analysis of the HCL code itself.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Use Cases and When to Use\n</h2><p>CodeGuru Reviewer isn’t a silver bullet, but it excels in specific scenarios:</p><ol><li><strong>Large Teams &amp; Complex Infrastructure:</strong> When multiple engineers contribute to a shared Terraform codebase, consistent code quality is paramount. CodeGuru Reviewer enforces standards and catches errors that might slip through peer review.</li><li><strong>Security-Sensitive Environments:</strong> Identifying potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., overly permissive IAM policies, exposed secrets) early in the development cycle is crucial. CodeGuru Reviewer’s security checks are invaluable.</li><li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong>  CodeGuru Reviewer can detect inefficient resource configurations (e.g., undersized instances, unoptimized storage) that could lead to performance bottlenecks and increased costs.</li><li><strong>Onboarding New Engineers:</strong>  Provides automated feedback on Terraform best practices, accelerating the learning curve for new team members.</li><li>  Helps enforce organizational policies and compliance standards by identifying deviations from approved configurations.</li></ol><p>Here are eight relevant Terraform resources, with examples:</p><ol><li><strong><code>aws_codeguru_reviewer_repository_association</code></strong>:  Associates a repository with CodeGuru Reviewer.\n</li></ol><ol><li><strong><code>aws_codecommit_repository</code></strong>: Creates a CodeCommit repository (if using CodeCommit).\n</li></ol><ol><li>:  Creates an IAM role for CodeGuru Reviewer to access the repository.\n</li></ol><ol><li>:  Attaches a policy to the CodeGuru Reviewer role.\n</li></ol><ol><li><strong><code>aws_iam_role_policy_attachment</code></strong>: Attaches the policy to the role.\n</li></ol><ol><li>:  Retrieves information about the current AWS account.\n</li></ol><ol><li>: Retrieves the current AWS region.\n</li></ol><ol><li>: (Example of a resource CodeGuru Reviewer might analyze)\n</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Patterns &amp; Modules\n</h2><ul><li><strong>Remote Backend Integration:</strong>  CodeGuru Reviewer works seamlessly with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise and S3 backends. The analysis is triggered by commits to the repository, regardless of where the state is stored.</li><li> CodeGuru Reviewer analyzes dynamic blocks like any other Terraform code. Ensure dynamic blocks are well-structured and follow best practices.</li><li>  CodeGuru Reviewer handles  loops effectively, analyzing each resource instance created by the loop.</li><li>  A monorepo is a good fit for CodeGuru Reviewer, as it can analyze all infrastructure code in a single repository.</li><li>  Structuring Terraform code into layers (e.g., networking, compute, data) improves maintainability and allows CodeGuru Reviewer to focus on specific areas.</li></ul><p>This example demonstrates associating a CodeCommit repository with CodeGuru Reviewer.</p><p> (Assumes AWS provider is already configured)</p><p> will create the CodeCommit repository, IAM role, policy, and association.  After applying, commit a Terraform configuration file (e.g., the  example above) to the CodeCommit repository. CodeGuru Reviewer will automatically initiate an analysis.  You can view the results in the AWS console under the CodeGuru Reviewer service.</p><p> will remove all created resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Enterprise Considerations\n</h2><p>Large organizations typically integrate CodeGuru Reviewer with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise. This allows for automated analysis as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Sentinel policies can be used to enforce additional constraints beyond what CodeGuru Reviewer provides.  State locking is crucial to prevent concurrent modifications. IAM design should follow the principle of least privilege, granting CodeGuru Reviewer only the necessary permissions. Costs are based on lines of code scanned, so optimizing Terraform code and minimizing unnecessary changes can help control expenses. Multi-region deployments require configuring CodeGuru Reviewer in each region.</p><p>Enforce least privilege by granting CodeGuru Reviewer only the necessary IAM permissions. Use RBAC to control access to CodeGuru Reviewer results.  Implement tagging policies to ensure resources are properly labeled for cost allocation and compliance. Drift detection tools (e.g., Checkov, tfsec) can complement CodeGuru Reviewer by identifying deviations from desired configurations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Other Services\n</h2><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Terraform Code] --&gt; B(CodeCommit/GitHub/Bitbucket);\n    B --&gt; C{CodeGuru Reviewer};\n    C --&gt; D[Analysis Results (AWS Console)];\n    C --&gt; E[SNS Notifications];\n    E --&gt; F[Slack/PagerDuty];\n    C --&gt; G[AWS CloudTrail];\n    G --&gt; H[Audit Logs];\n    C --&gt; I[AWS Security Hub];\n    I --&gt; J[Security Findings];\n</code></pre></div><ol><li><strong>AWS CodeCommit/GitHub/Bitbucket:</strong>  Source code repositories trigger the analysis.</li><li>  CodeGuru Reviewer can send notifications to SNS topics upon completion of an analysis.</li><li>  Logs all CodeGuru Reviewer API calls for auditing purposes.</li><li>  Integrates CodeGuru Reviewer findings into a centralized security dashboard.</li><li>  Receive notifications about critical findings via SNS integration.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Module Design Best Practices\n</h2><p>Abstract CodeGuru Reviewer association into a reusable module.  Use input variables for repository name, connection ARN, and repository type.  Output variables can include the association ARN.  Use locals to define default values.  Document the module thoroughly with examples and usage instructions.</p><p>Here’s a GitHub Actions snippet:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This pipeline formats, validates, and plans the Terraform code.  The  step is conditional and requires manual approval.  Integrating CodeGuru Reviewer would involve adding a step to trigger an analysis after the  step, potentially failing the pipeline if critical issues are found.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Pitfalls &amp; Troubleshooting\n</h2><ol><li><strong>Incorrect IAM Permissions:</strong> CodeGuru Reviewer fails to access the repository.  Verify the IAM role has the necessary permissions.</li><li><strong>Unsupported Repository Type:</strong>  CodeGuru Reviewer doesn’t support the repository type.  Use a supported repository (CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket).</li><li>  Large repositories take too long to analyze.  Break down the repository into smaller modules.</li><li> CodeGuru Reviewer flags issues that are not actual problems.  Review the findings carefully and suppress false positives if necessary.</li><li> The <code>aws_codeguru_reviewer_repository_association</code> resource is not configured correctly.  Double-check the resource configuration and ensure all required attributes are set.</li><li><strong>CodeGuru Reviewer not triggering:</strong> Ensure the repository is actively being committed to and that the IAM role has the correct permissions. Check CloudTrail logs for errors.</li></ol><ul><li>Automated code reviews improve code quality.</li><li>Identifies security vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.</li><li>Helps optimize infrastructure performance.</li><li>Integrates seamlessly with existing CI/CD pipelines.</li></ul><ul><li>Limited to static analysis; doesn’t catch runtime issues.</li><li>Can generate false positives.</li><li>Costs can be significant for large codebases.</li><li>Requires proper IAM configuration.</li></ul><p>AWS CodeGuru Reviewer is a valuable addition to any Terraform-based infrastructure pipeline. It provides automated code reviews that improve code quality, enhance security, and optimize performance. While not a replacement for human review, it serves as a powerful gatekeeper, reducing risk and ensuring that infrastructure changes meet organizational standards.  Start by integrating CodeGuru Reviewer into a proof-of-concept project, evaluate its findings, and then gradually expand its use to other infrastructure components.  Invest time in creating reusable modules and automating the analysis process within your CI/CD pipeline to maximize its benefits.</p>","contentLength":9372,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Functional vs. Performance Testing: Breaking Down Testing Priorities for Media Apps","url":"https://dev.to/berthaw82414312/functional-vs-performance-testing-breaking-down-testing-priorities-for-media-apps-14p1","date":1751514229,"author":"Bertha White","guid":182559,"unread":true,"content":"<p>People use media apps on a wide range of devices and networks.

Let's break it down in simple terms.</p><p>The Call Stack is a special type of data structure that keeps track of the functions that are currently being executed in your program. It's like a stack of plates: you can only add or remove plates from the top. In programming terms, this is called a \"LIFO\" (Last In, First Out) structure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Does the Call Stack Work?\n</h2><p>When a function is called, it is \"pushed\" onto the Call Stack. When the function finishes executing, it is \"popped\" off the stack. This process ensures that functions are executed in the correct order and that each function has its own context (variables, parameters, etc.).\nLet's look at a simple example to understand how the Call Stack works:</p><div><pre><code>function greet(name) {\n    return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}\n\nfunction sayHello() {\n    const message = greet(\"Kimi\");\n    console.log(message);\n}\nsayHello();\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> The program starts executing .</li></ol><ul><li> is pushed onto the Call Stack.</li><li>     Inside ,  is called.</li><li> is pushed onto the Call Stack.</li></ul><ol><li> executes and returns \"Hello, Kimi!\".</li><li><p> is popped off the Call Stack.</p></li></ol><ul><li> continues executing with the returned value \"Hello, Kimi!\".</li><li> logs the message to the console.</li><li> is popped off the Call Stack.</li><li> The Call Stack is now empty, and the program execution is complete.</li></ul><div><pre><code>Initial Call:\nCall Stack: [sayHello]\n\nInside sayHello, greet is called:\nCall Stack: [sayHello, greet]\n\ngreet executes and returns:\nCall Stack: [sayHello]\n\nsayHello continues and completes:\nCall Stack: []\n\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Importance of the Call Stack\n</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Function Execution Order:</strong>\nThe Call Stack ensures that functions are executed in the correct order.</p></li><li><p>\nWhen an error occurs, the Call Stack provides a trace of where the error happened, making debugging easier.</p></li><li><p>\nEach function call has its own context (local variables, parameters), which is stored on the stack. This helps manage memory efficiently.</p></li></ol><p>\nIf you have too many nested function calls (like in infinite recursion), the Call Stack can overflow, causing the program to crash.</p><p>\n Understanding the Call Stack is crucial for debugging, as it helps you trace the flow of function calls and identify where things went wrong.</p><p>The Call Stack is a powerful tool that helps manage function calls in your program. It ensures that functions are executed in the correct order and provides a way to trace errors.

You've been running Windows Server 2012 R2 for years, and it powers critical production line applications. Microsoft has ended mainstream support, and extended support is nearing its end. Migrating to a newer operating system is a massive undertaking – requiring extensive application compatibility testing, potential code rewrites, and significant downtime. The cost and risk are substantial.  This is a common scenario, and it’s where Microsoft.WindowsESU comes into play.</p><p>Today, businesses are navigating a complex landscape of cloud adoption, zero-trust security models, and hybrid identity solutions. While many are embracing cloud-native applications, a significant portion of the infrastructure still relies on legacy Windows Server versions.  According to a recent study by Flexera, over 60% of enterprises still have workloads running on older operating systems.  Azure, with its robust infrastructure and services, provides a pathway to extend the life of these critical systems without the immediate need for a full migration. Microsoft.WindowsESU (Extended Security Updates) is a key component of that strategy, offering a cost-effective way to maintain security and compliance.  This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing Microsoft.WindowsESU within the Azure environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is \"Microsoft.WindowsESU\"?\n</h2><p>Microsoft.WindowsESU is a service designed to provide security updates for eligible, out-of-support Windows Server versions. Think of it as a safety net for systems that can’t immediately be migrated to a supported operating system. It doesn’t add new features or functionality; its sole purpose is to deliver critical security patches for a limited time after the end of extended support. </p><p>The core problem it solves is the increasing security risk associated with running unsupported operating systems. Without security updates, these systems become vulnerable to exploits, potentially leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and operational disruptions.</p><ul><li><strong>Eligible Operating Systems:</strong> Currently, ESU supports Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.</li><li> Security updates are delivered through the standard Windows Update channels, ensuring a familiar and streamlined patching process.</li><li><strong>Azure Arc-enabled Servers:</strong>  A crucial component for managing ESU-enabled servers in Azure.  Arc allows you to manage servers running outside of Azure, as well as on-premises servers, as if they were native Azure resources.</li><li>  A paid subscription is required to activate ESU for your servers.  The subscription duration is typically annual.</li><li> Used for automating the ESU deployment and management process.</li></ul><p>Companies like Siemens, which often have long lifecycles for industrial control systems, and financial institutions with highly regulated environments, frequently leverage ESU to maintain compliance and security while planning more extensive migrations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Use \"Microsoft.WindowsESU\"?\n</h2><p>Before ESU, organizations faced a difficult choice: undertake a costly and disruptive migration or accept the significant security risks of running unsupported systems.

ESU provides a bridge while migrating to compliant systems.</li><li>  Strict regulatory requirements (e.g., SOX, PCI DSS) demand continuous security updates. ESU helps meet these obligations.</li><li>  Critical production systems often rely on older operating systems.  Downtime for migration can be extremely costly. ESU allows for a phased migration approach.</li></ul><ol><li> A logistics company has a critical shipping application that only runs on Windows Server 2012 R2. Rewriting the application is prohibitively expensive. ESU allows them to continue running the application securely for an additional three years while they explore long-term solutions.</li><li><strong>The Remote Branch Office:</strong> A retail chain has a small branch office running Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 for point-of-sale systems.  Upgrading the hardware and software is planned, but delayed due to budget constraints. ESU provides temporary security coverage.</li><li><strong>The Specialized Hardware:</strong> A scientific research institution uses specialized hardware that is only compatible with Windows Server 2012.  ESU ensures the security of the research data while they evaluate alternative hardware options.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features and Capabilities\n</h2><ol><li> ESU focuses solely on delivering critical security patches, minimizing disruption to existing applications.</li><li><strong>Standard Update Channels:</strong> Updates are delivered through Windows Update, simplifying deployment and management.</li><li> Enables centralized management of ESU-enabled servers, both on-premises and in Azure.</li><li> Azure Automation allows for automated ESU activation and update deployment.</li><li><strong>Flexible Subscription Terms:</strong> Annual subscriptions provide flexibility to align with migration timelines.</li><li> Helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by maintaining security posture.</li><li>  Provides a cost-effective alternative to immediate migration.</li><li><strong>Extended Support Lifecycle:</strong> Extends the support lifecycle of eligible operating systems by up to three years.</li><li> Azure provides reporting on ESU subscription status and update compliance.</li><li>  Allows for targeted ESU deployment to specific servers or groups of servers.</li></ol><p><strong>Feature Use Case &amp; Flow (Azure Arc Integration):</strong></p><p>This diagram illustrates how Azure Arc integrates with ESU. Servers are onboarded to Arc, allowing Azure to manage them.  ESU subscriptions are applied through Azure, and updates are delivered via Windows Update, monitored through Azure Update Management.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Detailed Practical Use Cases\n</h2><ol><li><strong>Pharmaceutical Research Lab:</strong>  A lab uses a legacy data acquisition system running Windows Server 2012 R2.  ESU ensures the security of sensitive research data while they validate a new system.  Data breach risk.  ESU subscription and Azure Arc management.  Secure data acquisition for 2 years, allowing time for validation.</li><li><strong>Manufacturing Plant Control System:</strong> A plant relies on a SCADA system running Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.  A full system upgrade is planned but requires significant downtime.  Production disruption.  ESU subscription and phased migration plan.

Whether it's the split-second delivery of messages in instant messaging software, the seamless synchronization of multi-person editing in online collaborative documents, or the millisecond-level data refresh on financial trading platforms, these seemingly ordinary functions are all supported by powerful backend technologies. In my exploratory journey, the combination of asynchronous programming and high-performance frameworks has proven to be key to achieving this \"pulse of real-time interaction.\" Recently, a web backend framework, with its outstanding asynchronous processing capabilities and deep optimization for real-time scenarios, has allowed me to experience an unprecedented development thrill, akin to a \"heartbeat sync.\"</p><p><strong>Real-Time Interaction: The \"Heartbeat\" of Modern Web Applications</strong></p><p>Once, web applications were more about one-way information display. Users initiated requests, and servers returned static or dynamically generated content; the interaction model was relatively simple. However, with technological advancements and rising user expectations, web applications are no longer satisfied with this \"delayed gratification.\" Users crave instant feedback, real-time updates, and seamless collaboration. This pursuit of \"real-time\" has become an important criterion for judging the quality of a modern web application.</p><ul><li>: WeChat, Slack, Discord, etc., where message sending and receiving have almost no delay.</li><li>: Players' actions need real-time synchronization; any lag can affect the gaming experience.</li><li>: Google Docs, Figma, etc., where multiple people edit the same document simultaneously, and changes are immediately visible.</li><li><strong>Real-Time Data Monitoring</strong>: Stock quotes, server statuses, IoT device data, etc., need to be continuously pushed to clients.</li><li><strong>Live Streaming and Video Conferencing</strong>: Low-latency transmission of audio/video streams and real-time response of interactive features.</li></ul><p>Implementing these complex real-time interactive functions places extremely high demands on backend frameworks. They not only need to handle massive concurrent connections but also complete message reception, processing, and distribution with extremely low latency. Traditional synchronous blocking programming models often fall short in these scenarios. The asynchronous non-blocking model, on the other hand, has become the inevitable choice for building high-performance real-time applications.</p><p>As a learner with the keen insight into technological trends of a \"ten-year veteran developer,\" I am well aware that choosing a framework that natively supports and deeply optimizes asynchronous processing means winning at the starting line when developing real-time applications.</p><p><strong>The Magic of Asynchrony: Unleashing the Full Potential of Servers</strong></p><p>Before encountering this \"mysterious\" framework, my understanding of asynchronous programming was mostly limited to Node.js's event loop and callback functions, or Python's async/await syntactic sugar. While they can achieve non-blocking I/O, they sometimes encounter bottlenecks in extreme concurrency and performance-critical scenarios, or require developers to put in extra effort for optimization.</p><p>This Rust-based framework, however, has its asynchronous processing capabilities deeply embedded in its DNA. The Rust language itself provides elegant asynchronous programming syntax through , and its ecosystem's Tokio (or similar async-std) asynchronous runtime provides a solid foundation for building high-performance network applications.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ultimate Utilization of Non-Blocking I/O</strong>\nThe core network layer of this framework is entirely built on a non-blocking I/O model. When a request needs to wait for external resources (such as database queries, file I/O, third-party API calls, or waiting for client data), it doesn't foolishly block the current thread. Instead, it immediately releases CPU control to other tasks that require computation. Once the I/O operation is complete, the operating system wakes up the corresponding task to continue execution via an event notification mechanism. This mechanism allows the server to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections with minimal thread resources, greatly improving CPU utilization and system throughput.<p>\nI once tried to implement a simple WebSocket chat room with it. When simulating a large number of users sending messages simultaneously, the server's CPU usage remained at a low level, and message transmission latency was negligible. This composed performance starkly contrasted with versions I had previously implemented with some synchronous frameworks, which showed significant performance degradation or even thread exhaustion at slightly higher concurrency levels.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Efficient Scheduling of Lightweight Tasks (Coroutines)</strong>\nThe framework typically encapsulates each incoming connection or each independent asynchronous operation into a lightweight task (often called a Future or Task in Rust, similar to coroutines or green threads in other languages). These tasks are efficiently scheduled by an asynchronous runtime like Tokio. Compared to traditional operating system threads, the creation and context-switching overhead of these lightweight tasks is minimal, allowing the server to easily support hundreds of thousands or even millions of concurrent tasks.<p>\nThis M:N threading model (M user-level tasks mapped to N kernel-level threads) allows developers to write asynchronous logic much like synchronous code, without worrying about underlying thread management and complex concurrency control. The framework and asynchronous runtime handle everything for us.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Elegant Error Handling and Cancellation Mechanisms</strong>\nIn asynchronous programming, error handling and task cancellation are common difficulties. Rust's  type and  operator make error propagation and handling in asynchronous functions very clear and safe. Additionally, asynchronous runtimes like Tokio provide robust task cancellation mechanisms (Cancellation Safety). When a task no longer needs to execute (e.g., the client disconnects), it can be safely canceled, releasing its occupied resources and preventing resource leaks.\nThis framework fully leverages these language and runtime features, enabling developers to more calmly handle various exceptional situations when building complex real-time applications.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Framework Advantages in Real-Time Scenarios: Why Can It Achieve \"Heartbeat Sync\"?</strong></p><p>After an in-depth experience with this framework, I found it exhibits many unique advantages in supporting real-time interactive applications:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Native WebSocket and SSE Support</strong>\nWebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels, making it an ideal choice for building highly interactive applications like instant messaging and online games. Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a lightweight mechanism for servers to unilaterally push events to clients, suitable for scenarios like news feeds and status updates.<p>\nThis framework typically offers native, high-performance support for WebSocket and SSE. Its API design is concise and easy to use, allowing developers to easily create WebSocket connection handlers and manage events like connection establishment, message reception, and connection closure. The framework's underlying layers encapsulate details like WebSocket protocol handshakes, frame processing, and heartbeat maintenance, letting developers focus on business logic.</p>\nI once quickly built a real-time polling system with it. Clients connected to the server via WebSocket, and when the server received a vote, it broadcasted the latest polling results in real-time to all connected clients. The development process was very smooth, and the performance was satisfactory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficient Message Broadcasting and Distribution Mechanisms</strong>\nIn many real-time applications, messages or events need to be broadcast to multiple clients (e.g., group chat messages in a chat room, status updates for all players in a game). Inefficient broadcasting mechanisms can easily become performance bottlenecks.<p>\nThis framework's ecosystem often includes efficient Publish/Subscribe or Broadcast components (e.g., Tokio's </p> channel). These components are carefully designed to distribute messages to a large number of subscribers in an asynchronous environment with minimal overhead. They usually support multi-producer, multi-consumer patterns and gracefully handle subscriber joins and leaves.\nThis built-in efficient broadcasting capability means developers don't need to reinvent the wheel when implementing group communication or real-time data push features, and it avoids performance issues caused by improper implementation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low-Latency Request Processing Pipeline</strong>\nFor real-time applications, every millisecond of latency can impact user experience. This framework's entire pipeline, from request reception, parsing, and processing to response sending, is optimized for maximum performance. Its lightweight core, efficient route matching, and zero-copy data handling techniques (if applicable) all contribute to minimizing processing latency.<p>\nThe Rust language itself has no GC pauses, which also guarantees its low-latency characteristics. In real-time scenarios requiring complex computations or large amounts of data processing (such as real-time data analysis and visualization), this low-latency advantage becomes even more apparent.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>Flexible Protocol Support and Extensibility</strong>\nAlthough WebSocket and HTTP are the primary protocols for web real-time communication, some specific scenarios may require support for other custom or binary protocols (like Protobuf, MQTT, etc.). This framework usually has good protocol extensibility, allowing developers to easily integrate or implement custom protocol handlers.<p>\nRust's powerful byte manipulation capabilities and rich serialization/deserialization libraries (like Serde) also provide convenience for handling various complex data formats.</p></p></li><li><p><strong>State Management and Concurrency Control</strong>\nReal-time applications often need to maintain a large amount of connection state and user state on the server side. Efficiently managing this state while ensuring concurrency safety is a challenge. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, along with its concurrency primitives (like Mutex, RwLock, Channel), provide strong support for building thread-safe state management modules.<p>\nThe framework itself might also offer recommended state management patterns or examples of integration with popular state storage solutions (like Redis) to help developers better address this challenge.</p></p></li></ol><p><strong>Practical Case: Building an Online Collaborative Whiteboard</strong></p><p>To personally experience this framework's capabilities in complex real-time scenarios, I attempted to build a simple online collaborative whiteboard application. It allows multiple users to connect simultaneously and draw on a shared canvas, with all users' actions synchronized in real-time to others.</p><p>In this project, I primarily utilized the framework's WebSocket support for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. Each user's drawing action (like drawing lines, circles, or writing text) was sent to the server via WebSocket. Upon receiving an action, the server broadcasted it to all other users in the same room. The server also needed to maintain the current state of the whiteboard so that new users joining could retrieve the complete canvas content.</p><p>During development, I deeply appreciated the power of the framework's asynchronous processing capabilities. Even with multiple users performing high-frequency drawing operations simultaneously, the server remained stable, and message synchronization latency was almost imperceptible. Rust's strong type system and compile-time checks also helped me avoid many potential concurrency errors and logical flaws.</p><p>I also used the framework's middleware mechanism to implement simple user authentication and room management functions. With the framework's help, the backend logic of the entire application appeared very clear and easy to maintain.</p><p><strong>Comparative Reflection: Why Does It Excel in the Real-Time Domain?</strong></p><p>Compared to some traditional PHP or Python frameworks, which often require additional extensions (like Swoole, Gevent) or more complex architectures (like using a separate WebSocket server) to handle a large number of long connections and high-concurrency real-time messages, this Rust-based framework has innate asynchronous and concurrent capabilities. It doesn't need extra \"plugins\" to deliver top-tier real-time processing performance.</p><p>Compared to Node.js, although Node.js is also a paragon of asynchronous non-blocking I/O, Rust generally has an edge in CPU-intensive tasks and memory safety. For real-time applications requiring complex computations or extremely high stability (such as financial trading, real-time risk control), a Rust framework might be a more robust choice.</p><p>Compared to Java's Netty or Go's goroutines, they are all excellent choices for building high-performance real-time applications. However, a Rust framework, with its GC-less nature, memory safety, and execution efficiency close to C/C++, might exhibit stronger competitiveness in scenarios with extreme demands on latency and resource consumption. Furthermore, Rust's  syntax and ecosystem offer a very modern and efficient asynchronous programming experience.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Making the Application's \"Heartbeat\" Stronger and More Powerful</strong></p><p>Real-time interaction has become an indispensable core competency for modern web applications. Choosing a backend framework that can efficiently handle concurrent connections, respond with low latency, and provide convenient real-time communication mechanisms is key to creating an excellent user experience.</p><p>This \"mysterious\" Rust framework, with its deeply ingrained asynchronous processing capabilities, native support for real-time protocols like WebSocket, and efficient message distribution mechanisms, provides developers with a powerful arsenal for building various complex real-time applications. It has allowed me to experience a development joy akin to a \"heartbeat sync\" with the server and has filled me with anticipation for the future development of real-time technology.</p><p>As a computer science student, I am well aware that the tide of technology never stops. Mastering and applying such a framework, which represents advanced productivity, will undoubtedly add significant weight to my future career. I believe that as more developers recognize its value, it will surely play an even more vibrant \"heartbeat\" symphony in the field of real-time applications.</p>","contentLength":14657,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Breaking Down RL2: Why We Built a Ray-Less RL Framework for AI Agents","url":"https://dev.to/accioprocurement/breaking-down-rl2-why-we-built-a-ray-less-rl-framework-for-ai-agents-j00","date":1751512126,"author":"Accio by Alibaba Group","guid":181744,"unread":true,"content":"<p>After working with existing RL frameworks, we noticed three persistent problems that motivated RL2's development:</p><p><strong>1.

Organizations are grappling with the challenge of processing massive datasets in real-time to derive actionable insights. Consider a global e-commerce company like Shopify, needing to analyze billions of customer interactions daily to personalize recommendations and detect fraudulent transactions. Or a financial institution like Capital One, requiring real-time risk assessment for every credit card purchase. Traditional batch processing methods often fall short, unable to keep pace with these demands. This is where Google Cloud Dataflow API emerges as a critical solution.  Driven by trends towards sustainability (efficient resource utilization), multicloud strategies (avoiding vendor lock-in), and the overall growth of GCP as a leading cloud provider, Dataflow offers a powerful, scalable, and cost-effective way to tackle complex data processing challenges. Netflix leverages Dataflow for various data pipelines, including A/B testing analysis and personalized content recommendations, demonstrating its ability to handle immense scale and complexity.</p><p>Dataflow API is a fully-managed, serverless stream and batch data processing service. At its core, it provides a unified programming model for executing data pipelines. It’s not simply a tool; it’s an abstraction layer built on top of other GCP compute services like Cloud Dataflow runner (Apache Beam).  Dataflow allows you to define your data processing logic once and execute it on various runners, including Dataflow itself, Apache Spark, or Apache Flink. This portability is a key advantage.</p><p>The service solves the problems of managing infrastructure, scaling resources, and ensuring fault tolerance for data pipelines.  Instead of worrying about provisioning servers, configuring clusters, or handling failures, you focus solely on the data transformation logic.</p><p>Dataflow’s key components include:</p><ul><li> The open-source, unified programming model for defining data pipelines. Supports Java, Python, and Go.</li><li> The execution engine that runs your pipeline. The default runner is the managed Dataflow service on GCP.</li><li> The managed service that handles resource provisioning, scaling, and monitoring.</li><li> Pre-built pipelines for common data processing tasks, simplifying deployment.</li></ul><p>Currently, Dataflow primarily utilizes the Apache Beam SDK v2.x, offering improved performance and features over earlier versions.  It seamlessly integrates into the GCP ecosystem, working closely with services like Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, and Cloud Logging.</p><p>Dataflow addresses several pain points for data engineers, developers, and SREs.  Traditionally, building and maintaining data pipelines required significant operational overhead.  Scaling pipelines to handle increasing data volumes was complex and time-consuming.  Ensuring fault tolerance and data consistency added further challenges.</p><p>Key benefits of using Dataflow include:</p><ul><li> Automatically scales resources up or down based on workload demands.</li><li>  Leverages distributed processing to accelerate data transformation.</li><li> Pay-as-you-go pricing model, minimizing infrastructure costs.</li><li>  Built-in fault tolerance and data consistency guarantees.</li><li><strong>Unified Programming Model:</strong> Write pipelines once and run them on different runners.</li><li> No infrastructure to manage.</li></ul><p><strong>Use Case 1: Real-time Fraud Detection (Financial Services)</strong></p><p>A bank needs to analyze transactions in real-time to identify and prevent fraudulent activity. Dataflow can ingest transaction data from Pub/Sub, apply machine learning models to score each transaction, and flag suspicious ones for further investigation. This allows for immediate action, minimizing financial losses.</p><p><strong>Use Case 2: Clickstream Analysis (E-commerce)</strong></p><p>An e-commerce company wants to understand user behavior on its website. Dataflow can process clickstream data from Cloud Storage, aggregate user activity, and store the results in BigQuery for analysis. This provides insights into customer preferences, enabling personalized marketing campaigns.</p><p><strong>Use Case 3: IoT Data Processing (Manufacturing)</strong></p><p>A manufacturing plant collects sensor data from its equipment. Dataflow can ingest this data from Pub/Sub, perform real-time anomaly detection, and trigger alerts when equipment malfunctions. This enables predictive maintenance, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features and Capabilities\n</h2><p>Dataflow boasts a rich set of features designed for robust and efficient data processing:</p><ol><li>  Allows you to group data based on time or other criteria for aggregation and analysis.

Unlike traditional testing, which focuses on simulated conditions, field testing exposes the software to actual user scenarios, diverse hardware, and unpredictable variables like network conditions or user behavior. It ensures the software performs reliably in the contexts it’s designed for, providing insights that lab testing might miss. For example, a mobile app might be tested on various devices in different locations to verify its functionality under real network conditions.</p><p><strong>Why are Field Tests Crucial for Software?</strong>\nField tests are essential because they validate software performance in authentic environments, catching issues that lab testing might overlook. Here’s why they matter:</p><p> Field testing confirms the software works as intended under actual user conditions, such as varying network speeds or device configurations. It identifies usability issues, ensuring the software meets user expectations and performs seamlessly in their daily lives.<strong>Reliability and Stability:</strong> By exposing the software to diverse scenarios, field testing uncovers edge cases, like unexpected user inputs or environmental factors, that could cause crashes or errors. It reduces the risk of post-launch failures, ensuring the software is robust and ready for widespread use, which is critical for maintaining user trust and brand reputation.\nFor instance, a navigation app might function perfectly in a lab but fail to account for GPS signal loss in rural areas. Field testing bridges this gap, ensuring reliability.</p><p><strong>When Does Field Testing Happen?</strong>\nField testing typically occurs in the later stages of the software development lifecycle, after unit, integration, and system testing are complete. It’s often part of the beta testing phase, where the software is near completion but needs real-world validation before full release. Key moments include:</p><p> Before a product goes live, field testing ensures it’s ready for public use. For example, a beta version of an app might be distributed to a select group of users. After significant updates or feature additions, field testing verifies that changes don’t introduce new issues in real-world scenarios. In agile environments, field testing may occur iteratively as new features are rolled out to a subset of users.\nTiming depends on the project’s needs, but it’s typically scheduled when the software is stable enough to handle real-world conditions without catastrophic failures.</p><p><strong>How to Be an Effective Field Tester</strong>\nBeing an effective field tester requires a blend of technical skills, attention to detail, and user empathy. Here are key practices:</p><p>Understand the Context: Familiarize yourself with the software’s purpose, target audience, and expected use cases to focus testing on relevant scenarios. Mimic how actual users would interact with the software, including edge cases like low battery, poor network, or interruptions. Record detailed observations, including steps to reproduce issues, device details, and environmental factors. Tools like Genqe can streamline this process by enabling testers to log issues, capture screenshots, and share feedback in real time, improving collaboration with development teams. Provide concise, actionable feedback to developers, prioritizing critical issues that impact user experience or functionality. Use diverse devices, operating systems, and environments to uncover compatibility or performance issues.\nStay Objective: Focus on identifying issues without bias, ensuring the software meets quality standards for all users.<p>\nEffective field testers combine technical rigor with a user-centric mindset, ensuring the software delivers value in real-world conditions.</p></p><p><strong>Test Automation and Field Testing</strong>\nWhile automation is powerful for repetitive tasks like unit or regression testing, its role in field testing is limited but growing. Automation can simulate certain real-world conditions, such as network variations or device configurations, but it struggles to replicate the unpredictability of human behavior or complex environments. Here’s how automation and field testing intersect:</p><p>Hybrid Approach: Automation can handle repetitive tasks, like stress-testing an app across multiple devices, while manual field testing focuses on subjective elements like usability.<strong>Tools for Efficiency: **Tools like Genqe can partially automate feedback collection by allowing testers to log issues, capture data, and generate reports seamlessly, reducing manual effort.\n**Limitations:</strong> Automation cannot fully replace human intuition or the nuanced feedback from real-world user interactions, making manual field testing critical. Advances in AI-driven testing tools may enhance automation’s role in simulating complex field scenarios, but human oversight remains essential.\nBy combining automation for scalable tasks with manual field testing for nuanced insights, teams can optimize their testing process.</p><p>\nField testing is a critical step in ensuring software performs reliably in the real world, bridging the gap between controlled lab environments and actual user scenarios. It validates functionality, enhances user experience, and reduces the risk of post-launch issues. Conducted in the later stages of development, effective field testing requires skilled testers who can simulate real-world conditions and provide actionable feedback. Tools like Genqe enhance this process by streamlining issue reporting and collaboration. While automation plays a supporting role, the human element remains irreplaceable in capturing the full spectrum of real-world challenges. By prioritizing field testing, development teams can deliver robust, user-friendly software that stands up to the demands of the market.</p>","contentLength":5832,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Well Explained Leetcode Hard 3333","url":"https://dev.to/thedeepseeker/well-explained-leetcode-hard-3333-583d","date":1751508676,"author":"Anna kowoski","guid":181674,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>🏂Beginner-Friendly Guide \"Find the Original Typed String II\" – LeetCode 3333 (C++ | Python | JavaScript)</h2>","contentLength":109,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🧙‍♂️Beginner-Friendly Guide \"Find the K-th Character in String Game I\" – LeetCode 3304 (C++ | Python | JavaScript)","url":"https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i-leetcode-3304-c--478a","date":1751508466,"author":"Om Shree","guid":181673,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this playful string-based puzzle, we join Alice and Bob in an ever-growing word game.

Recent research from May 2025 shows that <a href=\"https://securityboulevard.com/2025/05/why-your-security-team-is-wasting-70-of-their-time-on-phantom-threats-and-how-to-fix-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70% of a security team's time</a> is spent investigating alerts that are false positives, wasting massive amounts of time in the investigation rather than working on proactive security measures to improve organizational security posture. This problem is compounded by the fact that <a href=\"https://securityboulevard.com/2025/05/why-your-security-team-is-wasting-70-of-their-time-on-phantom-threats-and-how-to-fix-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">33% of companies have been late</a> in responding to actual cyberattacks because their teams were busy with these phantom threats.</p><h2><strong>What is low false positive rate security?</strong></h2><p>Accuracy is one of the top goals when doing any security work. Still, with massive amounts of data being ingested and processed, there is always the possibility that an alert is given incorrectly. A false positive is an alert that appears to be legitimate but, upon investigation, turns out to be incorrect. Unfortunately, these alerts waste valuable resources that could be better used for investigating genuine threats.</p><p>Tools with high false positive rates create a level of alert fatigue in security teams where alerts no longer command the same level of response. After many false investigations, teams assume that new alerts are likely false and do not use the same speed and efficiency in reviewing new alerts. This creates a situation where legitimate alerts are not quickly identified and managed, allowing potential issues to remain unmitigated for extended periods.</p><h3><strong>What are false negatives?</strong></h3><p>The alternative issue with alerts happens when threats are missed by a tool, going undetected. These false negatives are a significant issue as they leave vulnerabilities unnoticed for extended periods, which weakens the organizational security posture. This is especially an issue as other tooling may detect these issues, allowing attackers to find weak spots while your organization remains unaware. These failures to detect real threats complicate response strategies, making managing and mitigating risks difficult. They can ultimately lead to significant damage or data loss due to these undetected threats.</p><h3><strong>Why are true positives valuable?</strong></h3><p>Optimally, the best tools have high accuracy, presenting true positive values that identify real threats. By ensuring immediate threat identification, true positives allow organizations to quickly respond to and mitigate potential dangers, significantly reducing the risk of damage. This prompt detection not only aids in enhancing security protocols and systems through valuable data but also curtails the financial impact of security breaches.</p><p>By improving the precision of threat and vulnerability detection, organizations can enhance the overall efficiency of their security infrastructure, leading to reduced operational costs and strengthened defensive measures.</p><p>When looking at accuracy, it is essential to note that tooling is leveraged differently across different areas of infosec. For Application Security (AppSec), the tooling is intended to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in software applications. Some of this is done proactively during development using <a href=\"https://snyk.io/articles/application-security/static-application-security-testing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</a> to analyze code for weaknesses. Others are done after applications are live, testing the running application and APIs for exposures.</p><p>When issues are detected for AppSec, teams must investigate the problem to verify it is legitimate. SAST tools may require reviewing code and working with teams to determine if the issue detected is legitimate. False positives waste the time of these teams and reduce their faith in the AppSec teams, which ensures that future findings will take longer to review on their part. This is unfortunate as accurate SAST tools are highly effective for detecting security and code quality issues, helping teams deliver more resilient code.</p><p>Teams review running code for more Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) or API-based testing, which may even be in production. This testing helps identify common attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injections, and other top web-based threats. Alerts from this testing also require investigative time and inter-team communications. As these alerts are often against production systems, findings require swift investigative efforts to remediate before attackers can detect them. Tools with high false-positive rates lead to “alert fatigue,” slowing down team reviews and leaving potentially vulnerable interfaces open to attack.</p><h2><strong>Accuracy in threat detection</strong></h2><p>Accuracy also plays a crucial role in threat detection, where identifying true security threats and minimizing unnecessary alerts is critical to a rapid response. Unlike looking for application vulnerabilities, threat detection looks for utilization patterns that indicate a vulnerability is being exploited. However, many threat detection tools analyze massive volumes of data, generating many alerts of lower confidence, which must be investigated.</p><p>To combat this, many organizations have turned to advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, which further enhance the precision of these systems, making them more adept at discerning genuine threats from benign anomalies.</p><h2><strong>Getting accurate findings with Snyk API &amp; Web</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://snyk.io/product/dast-api-web/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snyk API &amp; Web</a> is a highly accurate tool for secure application development, with an extremely low rate of 0.08% for false positives.

Understanding Memory Management in Modern Systems\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.1 How Modern Computers Manage Memory\n</h3><p>Modern computers use a combination of  and  to manage memory efficiently. This process, called , is typically performed by the operating system’s memory manager, which connects raw physical RAM to the needs of different applications in a controlled and secure way.</p><p>Operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS, use a concept called . With virtual memory, each process thinks it has access to a contiguous block of memory (its virtual address space), while the operating system maps these blocks to physical RAM and, if needed, to disk-based swap or page files.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1.2 Physical RAM, Virtual Memory, and Swap Space\n</h4><ul><li>: This is the actual hardware memory installed in your computer.</li><li>: A logical abstraction that gives each program isolated memory, regardless of the system’s total RAM.</li><li>: When RAM fills up, the OS moves inactive memory pages to a reserved area on your hard disk or SSD (swap space), freeing up RAM. However, swap space is vastly slower than RAM.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  1.3 Memory Segmentation and Process Limits\n</h4><p>Even with abundant system RAM, each running process has limits imposed either by the operating system or hardware.</p><ul><li>: A 32-bit process can access only up to 4GB of addressable memory space (often less, due to system reservations), no matter how much RAM the system has. 64-bit processes can theoretically address exabytes of memory, but are constrained by OS and hardware.</li><li><strong>Operating System Imposed Limits</strong>: Many OSes allow administrators to set maximum memory usage ( in Unix/Linux).</li><li>: Remember, RAM is shared amongst all running processes, not just one.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  1.4 Memory Allocation Strategies\n</h4><p>Different programming languages offer various methods for memory allocation:</p><ul><li>: For small, short-lived variables.</li><li>: For dynamic, runtime-determined memory needs (where  and  come into play in C/C++).</li></ul><p>Most memory allocation challenges, and the subject of our focus, relate to heap management rather than stack allocation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. The Reality: How Can You Still Run Out of Memory?\n</h2><p>Despite the layers of advanced memory management and terabyte-scale RAM modules, your system can and will run out of memory under specific circumstances.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.1 Large Datasets and High-Performance Applications\n</h3><p>Applications such as machine learning, scientific simulations, graphic/video processing, or big databases routinely handle datasets that can reach into the tens or hundreds of gigabytes.</p><ul><li>Video editing software working with 8K RAW format files.</li><li>Genomics research applications processing entire human genome sequences.</li><li>In-memory database systems like Redis or Memcached.</li></ul><p>These applications can quickly consume available RAM and even surpass it, pushing the system into swap or causing allocation failures.</p><p> happen when a program fails to release memory that it no longer needs. Over time, especially in long-running applications (servers, daemons, GUI apps), memory leaks can slowly consume all available memory. Since modern systems run many services continuously for days, weeks, or months, even small leaks can add up.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code leaks 1KB every iteration, never reclaiming the memory.</p><p>Over prolonged run time, as programs allocate and free various-sized blocks of memory, the heap can become fragmented.

In such cases,  fails despite plenty of small free blocks.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2.3.1 External and Internal Fragmentation\n</h4><ul><li>: Free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks.</li><li>: Allocated blocks are larger than requested, wasting space within blocks.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.4 Operating System and User-imposed Limits\n</h3><p>Administrative limits may restrict how much memory a user or process can allocate.</p><ul><li><pre><code> 1048576 </code></pre></li><li><p> Docker containers, cloud instances (AWS EC2, Azure, etc.), and serverless functions are typically restricted to a set memory quota.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.5 Running Multiple Programs\n</h3><p>Even if you have 128GB RAM, running multiple memory-intensive applications simultaneously divides available resources. For enterprise servers or developer workstations, background services and parallel builds can quickly exhaust memory, leading to swap thrashing and allocation failures.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.6 Swap Space Limitations\n</h3><p>When RAM is full, the operating system moves memory pages to disk (swap), which is far slower than physical memory.</p><ul><li> Programs slow dramatically when paging occurs.</li><li> When swap is also full, further memory allocation requests—such as via —fail.</li></ul><p>On Unix-like systems (notably Linux), the kernel includes an <strong>Out-Of-Memory (OOM) Killer</strong>. When the system is critically low on memory, it may forcibly terminate processes—sometimes unpredictably—to reclaim memory. This can result in lost work, data corruption, and application crashes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Deep Dive: The malloc() Function and Its Behavior\n</h2><p>Understanding how memory allocation works at the code level is crucial to appreciating how and why \"out of memory\" happens, even on modern systems. The most ubiquitous function in C and C++ for dynamic memory allocation is .</p><p> stands for . It is a standard library function in C () that requests a block of memory from the  of a process, at runtime.

Types of Memory Allocation Errors\n</h2><p>Let's explore not only  allocations fail, but also  they manifest in behavior:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.1 Allocation Fails Instantly\n</h3><ul><li>Application requests more memory than is available (RAM + swap + kernel/system-imposed limit).</li><li>Immediate return of  from .\n</li><li>Example: Trying to allocate a huge array (hundreds of gigabytes) on a typical PC.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.2 Delayed Allocation Failure (Overcommit)\n</h3><p>Some systems, Linux in particular, allow “overcommit”—promising more memory than is physically available, under the assumption most requests won’t be fully used.</p><ul><li>The kernel allows  to succeed, but when the memory is actually accessed, allocation fails, possibly killing the process or causing a segmentation fault.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.3 Silent Data Corruption\n</h3><p>If an application uses memory after a failed allocation without checking for , it may corrupt unrelated data or crash in unpredictable ways.</p><p>Repeated allocations with missing  calls slowly consume all available heap space, leading to allocation failures after extended runtime.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.5 Fragmentation-Related Failures\n</h3><p>Even if there’s enough total free memory, fragmentation can lead to failed allocations—especially for objects requiring large contiguous blocks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Effects of Memory Exhaustion on Applications\n</h2><p>Running out of memory can affect software and systems in subtle, dramatic, and dangerous ways.

Memory Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>Beyond debugging, it's essential to design software with efficient memory usage in mind. Here are proven strategies:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  8.1 Use the Right Data Structures\n</h3><ul><li>Use compact/fixed-size data types when possible (e.g.,  over  or  if values are small).</li><li>Prefer arrays over linked lists unless insertion/removal speed is critical. Arrays have less overhead per element.</li></ul><ul><li>For systems with many similar-sized objects, preallocate memory pools to reduce fragmentation and allocate/frees overhead.</li></ul><ul><li>Whenever possible, reuse memory buffers instead of allocating and freeing in every loop iteration.</li><li>Particularly useful in I/O, networking, image/video processing, and real-time applications.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  8.4 Limit Scope and Lifetime\n</h3><ul><li>Keep dynamic allocations local in scope and lifetime.

Case Studies: Out-of-Memory Situations in the Real World\n</h2><p>Understanding theory is valuable, but real-world case studies illuminate why robust memory handling is essential—even in modern environments.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  9.1 Case Study: Out-of-Memory in High-Performance Web Servers\n</h3><p>A popular web server written in C repeatedly allocated memory for incoming HTTP requests with no built-in upper limit. Under a denial-of-service attack, thousands of requests with oversized headers flooded the server, exhausting all available RAM in minutes.  </p><ul><li> The server process crashed, triggering the OOM killer.</li><li> Always check allocation limits and handle errors; rate-limit or reject oversized/bogus requests.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  9.2 Case Study: Scientific Computing and Fragmentation\n</h3><p>A research team ran a genome sequencing application processing TB-scale datasets. Despite having a high-memory node (1 TB RAM), repeated runs observed allocation failures. Profiling revealed heap fragmentation—too many large blocks needed at once, but memory was split into many small, unusable chunks.  </p><ul><li> The code was refactored to use shared memory pools for common data structures, sharply reducing large-block allocation failures.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  9.3 Case Study: Leaky GUI Application\n</h3><p>A desktop photo editor on Windows held onto photo preview buffers even after closing images, due to missed  calls. Power users running the app for hours saw memory usage climb steadily until the system became unresponsive, requiring a hard reboot.  </p><ul><li> Poor reviews and lost users.</li><li> Regularly test for leaks during extended application runs.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  9.4 Case Study: The Container Memory Trap\n</h3><p>A development team deployed a C++ application in Docker, setting a 512MB container memory limit. Their code did not check  failures, assuming \"No modern system runs out of memory!\" When requests peaked, the process failed with cryptic pointer errors and logs, leading to hard-to-debug crashes.  </p><ul><li> Allocation failure checks and process self-restart logic greatly improved stability under resource pressure.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  10. Conclusion &amp; Takeaways\n</h2><p>Despite the massive advances in hardware capabilities, the reality is clear: <strong>Running out of memory is not just possible—it’s arguably inevitable in many real-world scenarios</strong>.

Frequently Asked Questions\n</h2><p><strong>Q1. Do higher-level languages (Java, Python) avoid out-of-memory entirely?</strong> No. While garbage collectors reduce leaks, large allocations, unbounded data growth, and memory leaks (like lingering references) can still exhaust available memory.</p><p><strong>Q2. What’s the difference between physical memory and virtual memory?</strong> Physical means the actual RAM chips; virtual is the per-process illusion managed by the OS, often larger than physical RAM via disk swap.</p><p><strong>Q3. Can swap space truly \"save\" you from out of memory?</strong> Swap helps, but it's much slower. Heavy swapping usually means your system is already at risk of crashing or serious slowdown.</p><p><strong>Q4. What is the safest way to use malloc()?</strong> Always check its return value for , free memory when done, use tools to detect leaks, and set sensible allocation limits.</p><p><strong>Q5. Why not just keep adding more RAM?</strong> There are always limits (cost, address space, OS/process caps), and fundamental design flaws (like leaks or lack of error checking) aren’t solved by hardware alone.</p>","contentLength":20353,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Critical Security Importance Digital Age Web Techniques（1751505540803000）","url":"https://dev.to/member_6bc7e52c/critical-security-importance-digital-age-web-techniques1751505540803000-188f","date":1751505541,"author":"member_6bc7e52c","guid":181567,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a third-year computer science student, my curiosity constantly pushes me to explore new technologies. Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.</p><p><strong>The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital Age</strong></p><p>Modern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.</p><p>I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.</p><p>Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.</p><p><strong>Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency Safety</strong></p><p>The framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.</p><p>This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.</p><p>Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.</p><p><strong>Framework Design: Layered and Resilient Defenses</strong></p><p>Beyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization</strong>\nThe principle of \"Never trust user input\" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.<p>\nIt also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.</p>\nMy tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This \"secure by default\" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Session Management and Authentication</strong>\nSecure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.<p>\nWhile it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).</p>\nI observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.</p></li><li><p>\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Dependency Management</strong>\nContemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.\nThe framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error Handling and Information Concealment</strong>\nExposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.</p></li><li><p>\nHTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).</p></li></ol><p><strong>Practical Security Considerations in Implementation</strong></p><p>When implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong>: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.</li><li><strong>Audits and Penetration Testing</strong>: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.</li><li>: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.</li><li><strong>Timely Dependency Updates</strong>: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Log Monitoring</strong>: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.</li></ul><p>This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.</p><p><strong>Comparative Analysis with Other Frameworks</strong></p><p>Compared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.</p><p>When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.</p><p>Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Security as a Continuous Endeavor</strong></p><p>In the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.</p><p>This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.</p><p>As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.</p>","contentLength":8578,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🧠 Why Learn Powerful Shell Scripting — Even When We Have Python, PowerShell, and Go?","url":"https://dev.to/srinivasamcjf/why-learn-powerful-shell-scripting-even-when-we-have-python-powershell-and-go-1999","date":1751505475,"author":"Srinivasaraju Tangella","guid":181598,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\"Why still invest time in learning Shell Scripting when we have Python or PowerShell?\"</p><p>Let me give you a strong, clear, and well-balanced write-up that highlights the power, relevance, and unique importance of shell scripting, even in a world with Python, PowerShell, and Go (Golang).</p><p>1.Shell is Closer to the Operating System:</p><p>Shell scripting is natively integrated with Unix/Linux systems.</p><p>Commands like ls, ps, kill, top, chmod, grep, awk, sed, and systemctl are first-class citizens in shell — not wrappers.</p><p>No import, no module — just type and run.</p><p>Example: Restarting a service or checking disk space in shell is one line:</p><p>systemctl restart nginx &amp;&amp; df -h | grep '/dev/xvda1'</p><p>2.It’s Already Everywhere — No Setup Required:</p><p>Every Linux distro, container, and server already has bash or sh.</p><p>No need to install Python, Go, or PowerShell.</p><p>This makes shell the most portable language for DevOps tasks.</p><p>3.Shell is Lightweight and Fast for Short Tasks:</p><p>For small utilities, automation snippets, init scripts, and glue code, shell is faster to write and execute.</p><p>Starting a Python/Go process for simple tasks is often overkill.</p><p>Need to clean log files every day at midnight?

Introdução: A Evolução e a Necessidade das Ferramentas de Build JavaScript</strong></h2><p>O panorama do desenvolvimento web passou por uma transformação radical desde os seus primórdios. Na década de 1990, a internet era predominantemente composta por sites estáticos, que funcionavam como museus online, exibindo texto e imagens simples.1 A interatividade era mínima, e qualquer ação do usuário, como clicar em um botão, frequentemente resultava no recarregamento completo da página, uma experiência lenta e pouco responsiva.</p><p>Nesse contexto, Brendan Eich desenvolveu o JavaScript em 1995, inicialmente conhecido como Mocha e depois LiveScript, com o objetivo de adicionar interatividade simples aos navegadores, como validação de formulários e animações básicas. A linguagem foi estrategicamente renomeada para JavaScript para capitalizar a popularidade do Java na época. Nos anos 2000, o JavaScript ganhou um impulso significativo com a introdução do AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), uma técnica que permitiu às páginas web buscar dados de servidores sem a necessidade de recarregar a página inteira, tornando as aplicações mais rápidas e dinâmicas.</p><p>Um marco crucial na jornada do JavaScript foi o lançamento do Node.js em 2009. Construído sobre o motor V8 do Chrome, o Node.js expandiu o uso do JavaScript para o lado do servidor, abrindo as portas para o desenvolvimento full-stack e impulsionando a ascensão do npm (Node Package Manager). O npm se tornou um vasto repositório de bibliotecas e ferramentas, facilitando a instalação e o gerenciamento de dependências para os desenvolvedores. A partir de 2013, a paisagem do frontend foi ainda mais redefinida com o surgimento de frameworks e bibliotecas como React.js (2013), Vue.js (2014) e o Angular (2016), que popularizaram a abordagem baseada em componentes, tornando o desenvolvimento de interfaces de usuário mais modular e reutilizável.</p><p>À medida que as aplicações web se tornaram mais complexas e modulares, a necessidade de ferramentas que pudessem gerenciar e otimizar esse código crescente tornou-se evidente. Os navegadores, por si só, entendem apenas HTML, CSS e JavaScript padrão. No entanto, o desenvolvimento moderno frequentemente envolve linguagens e sintaxes que precisam ser transformadas em algo que o navegador possa interpretar. Por exemplo, arquivos JSX (usados no React), TypeScript (TS) ou componentes de frameworks como Vue precisam ser convertidos para código JavaScript compreensível pelo navegador.</p><p>Outra questão fundamental é a otimização do carregamento. Projetos complexos, embora bem organizados em múltiplos arquivos para facilidade de manutenção, podem resultar em inúmeras requisições HTTP, tornando o site lento para o usuário final. Ferramentas de build, conhecidas como \"bundlers\", combinam esses múltiplos arquivos em um número menor de pacotes (bundles), que podem ser baixados mais rapidamente pelo navegador. Além disso, o código-fonte desenvolvido, com comentários e variáveis descritivas, não precisa ser entregue na íntegra ao usuário final. Bundlers podem otimizar esse código, removendo espaços em branco, renomeando variáveis e eliminando código não utilizado (processo conhecido como \"minificação\" e \"tree-shaking\"), resultando em bundles menores e mais rápidos para carregar.</p><p>A experiência do desenvolvedor também é um fator crítico. Em projetos grandes, esperar por um recarregamento completo da página a cada pequena alteração no código é ineficiente. Ferramentas de build modernas oferecem servidores de desenvolvimento com Hot Module Replacement (HMR), que monitoram as mudanças nos arquivos e atualizam o navegador instantaneamente, sem a necessidade de um recarregamento completo da página, o que acelera significativamente o ciclo de iteração. A compatibilidade com navegadores mais antigos é outra preocupação, pois nem todos os usuários utilizam as versões mais recentes. Transpiladores, como o Babel, integrados a essas ferramentas, convertem recursos de linguagem JavaScript mais novos em sintaxes compatíveis com navegadores mais antigos.</p><p>Além de JavaScript, os projetos modernos frequentemente incluem outros tipos de ativos, como arquivos CSS, imagens e fontes. Os navegadores não permitem a importação direta desses arquivos em módulos JavaScript. Bundlers resolvem isso através de \"loaders\", que pré-processam esses ativos e os convertem em módulos válidos que podem ser incluídos no grafo de dependências da aplicação. A complexidade de configurar ambientes de desenvolvimento com frameworks e linguagens como React e TypeScript também é simplificada por essas ferramentas, que oferecem configurações pré-definidas ou \"zero-config\", permitindo que os desenvolvedores iniciem rapidamente sem grandes esforços de setup. Finalmente, para aplicações que precisam funcionar em diferentes ambientes, como Node.js (servidor) e navegadores (cliente), as ferramentas de build garantem a compatibilidade e a otimização necessárias.</p><h2><strong>2. Webpack: O Pilar da Empacotamento de Módulos</strong></h2><p>O Webpack é uma ferramenta fundamental no ecossistema de desenvolvimento web moderno, consolidando-se como um empacotador de módulos estático. Em sua essência, ele trata todos os arquivos e ativos de um projeto — desde código JavaScript e JSON até CSS, imagens e fontes — como módulos.2 A partir de um ou mais pontos de entrada, o Webpack constrói um grafo de dependências interno, mapeando como esses módulos se relacionam entre si através de declarações</p><p>require e import.2 Uma vez que o grafo é construído, o Webpack combina todos os módulos necessários em um ou mais \"bundles\", que são ativos estáticos prontos para serem servidos.4</p><p>Para compreender o funcionamento do Webpack, é essencial dominar seus conceitos centrais:</p><ul><li><strong>Entry (Ponto de Entrada):</strong> Este é o módulo que o Webpack utiliza como ponto de partida para construir seu grafo de dependências. A partir dele, o Webpack identifica e inclui todos os outros módulos e bibliotecas dos quais o ponto de entrada depende, direta ou indiretamente.2 Por padrão, o valor é \n./src/index.js, mas é possível especificar um ou múltiplos pontos de entrada na configuração.\n\n<ul><li><strong>Sintaxes de Ponto de Entrada:</strong> O Webpack oferece diferentes sintaxes para definir pontos de entrada: </li><li> Para um único ponto de entrada, como entry: './src/index.js'. </li><li> Para múltiplos pontos de entrada, permitindo cenários como separar o código da aplicação (app) das dependências de terceiros (vendor) ou configurar aplicações multi-página.\n</li></ul></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> A propriedade output define onde o Webpack deve emitir os bundles criados e como esses arquivos devem ser nomeados. O padrão é ./dist/main.js para o arquivo de saída principal e ./dist para quaisquer outros arquivos gerados.\n\n<ul><li>filename: Define o nome do arquivo de saída para o bundle. </li><li>path: Especifica o diretório de saída absoluto para todos os arquivos gerados. </li><li>publicPath: Define o caminho base público para todos os ativos. </li><li>clean: Habilita a limpeza automática do diretório de saída antes de cada build. </li><li>assetModuleFilename: Controla o nome dos arquivos de ativos (imagens, fontes, etc.). </li></ul></li><li> Por padrão, o Webpack compreende apenas arquivos JavaScript e JSON. Loaders são cruciais para permitir que o Webpack processe outros tipos de arquivos (como CSS, imagens, TypeScript, CoffeeScript) e os converta em módulos válidos que podem ser consumidos pela aplicação e adicionados ao grafo de dependências. Eles atuam como transformadores do código-fonte de módulos não-JavaScript, pré-processando-os antes que sejam adicionados ao grafo de dependências.\n\n<ul><li><strong>Propriedades dos Loaders:</strong> Na configuração, loaders possuem duas propriedades principais:\n</li><li>test: Uma expressão regular que identifica quais arquivos devem ser transformados. </li><li>use: Indica qual loader (ou array de loaders) deve ser utilizado para a transformação. </li><li><strong>Exemplos de Loaders Comuns:</strong></li><li>babel-loader: Transpila código JavaScript moderno (ESNext, JSX) para versões compatíveis com navegadores mais antigos. </li><li>css-loader e style-loader: css-loader interpreta <a href=\"https://dev.to/import\">@import</a> e url() como import/require e style-loader injeta o CSS no DOM. </li><li>asset/resource (Webpack 5): Substitui file-loader e url-loader para lidar com arquivos de ativos como imagens e fontes, emitindo-os como arquivos separados. </li></ul></li><li> Enquanto os loaders são usados para transformar tipos específicos de módulos, os plugins são alavancados para uma gama mais ampla de tarefas. Eles podem realizar otimização de bundle, gerenciamento de ativos, injeção de variáveis de ambiente, e muito mais. Para usar um plugin, é necessário importá-lo (require()) e adicioná-lo a um array de plugins na configuração. A maioria dos plugins é personalizável através de opções, e é comum criar uma instância deles usando o operador new.\n\n<ul><li>DefinePlugin: Permite criar constantes globais configuráveis em tempo de compilação, úteis para variáveis de ambiente.</li><li>CompressionPlugin: Prepara os ativos para serem servidos com codificação de conteúdo (e.g., Gzip, Brotli), reduzindo o tamanho da transferência.</li><li>HtmlWebpackPlugin: Simplifica a criação de arquivos HTML para servir seus bundles Webpack, injetando automaticamente os scripts e estilos gerados.</li><li>Bundle Analyzer: Uma ferramenta visual que representa o conteúdo dos bundles como um treemap interativo, ajudando a identificar gargalos de tamanho.</li><li>ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin: Melhora o tempo de build em projetos TypeScript ao executar a verificação de tipos em um processo separado, liberando o thread principal. </li></ul></li><li> Desde a versão 4.0.0, o Webpack introduziu o conceito de \"modo\". Ao definir o parâmetro mode para development, production ou none, o Webpack aplica otimizações embutidas correspondentes a cada ambiente. O valor padrão é\nproduction, o que significa que o Webpack otimiza a saída para o ambiente de produção por padrão, mesmo sem um arquivo de configuração.\n\n<ul><li>development: Otimiza para velocidade de build e depuração, incluindo source maps mais rápidos e menos minificação. </li><li>production: Otimiza para tamanho de arquivo e desempenho em tempo de execução, aplicando minificação agressiva, tree-shaking e outras otimizações. </li><li>none: Desativa todas as otimizações padrão.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Fluxo de Trabalho e Configuração</strong></h3><p>Uma das características notáveis do Webpack é sua flexibilidade. Desde a versão 4.0.0, ele não exige um arquivo de configuração para empacotar um projeto simples, assumindo ./src/index.js como ponto de entrada e ./dist/main.js como saída, já minificado e otimizado para produção. No entanto, para projetos mais complexos ou para estender a funcionalidade padrão, a criação de um arquivo</p><p>webpack.config.js na raiz do projeto é uma prática comum, e o Webpack o utilizará automaticamente. Caso seja necessário usar um arquivo de configuração diferente, isso pode ser feito via linha de comando com a flag </p><p>Fluxo de Processamento do Webpack:<p>\nO Webpack opera construindo um grafo de dependências a partir dos pontos de entrada, processando cada módulo que encontra. Se um módulo tem dependências, o processo é recursivo até que todas as dependências sejam resolvidas. Finalmente, todos os módulos são empacotados em um ou mais bundles.</p></p><div><pre><code>\\[Ponto de Entrada (ex: index.js)\\]  \n|  \n       V  \n[Webpack Inicia o Processamento]  \n|  \n       V\n\n| (Loaders transformam arquivos não-JS em módulos)  \n       V  \n \\--- importa \\---\\&gt; \\--- processado por Loaders \\---\\&gt;  \n| ^  \n| |  \n       \\+--- importa \\---\\&gt; \\--- processado por Loaders \\---\\&gt;  \n|  \n       V\n\n| (Plugins otimizam, gerenciam ativos, etc.)  \n       V\n\n|  \n       V\n</code></pre></div><p>A webpack-cli (a partir da v6.0.0) oferece uma ferramenta para iniciar novos projetos, gerando arquivos de configuração específicos com base nos requisitos do projeto, simplificando o processo de setup inicial. Ela pode ser usada com npx create-new-webpack-app [command][options] e fará uma série de perguntas para personalizar a configuração, como o uso de TypeScript, webpack-dev-server, PWA, soluções CSS e gerenciador de pacotes. </p><p>A configuração do Webpack é incrivelmente granular, com uma vasta gama de opções categorizadas. As principais categorias de configuração incluem entry e context (para pontos de entrada e diretório base), output (para a saída dos bundles), module (para regras de loaders), resolve (para resolução de módulos), optimization (para otimizações de build), plugins (para plugins), devServer (para o servidor de desenvolvimento), cache (para caching), devtool (para source maps), externals (para módulos externos), performance (para dicas de desempenho), target (para o ambiente alvo) e watch (para monitoramento de arquivos).</p><h3><strong>Otimização e Melhores Práticas</strong></h3><p>O Webpack 5 trouxe melhorias significativas no desempenho de build. Uma das inovações é o Persistent Caching, que permite aos desenvolvedores habilitar um cache baseado no sistema de arquivos para acelerar as construções de desenvolvimento. O Long Term Caching também foi aprimorado, garantindo que pequenas alterações no código (como comentários ou nomes de variáveis que não afetam a versão minificada) não invalidem o cache, e novos algoritmos atribuem IDs numéricos curtos e nomes curtos a exports de forma determinística, ativados por padrão no modo de produção. O tamanho do pacote também foi reduzido graças a um melhor Tree Shaking e Geração de Código, incluindo o novo recurso Nested Tree-Shaking e CommonJs Tree Shaking, que permite eliminar exports CommonJs não utilizados.</p><p>Para otimizar builds, o Webpack oferece diversas funcionalidades:</p><ul><li> Para JavaScript, o TerserPlugin é incluído por padrão no Webpack v5, e para CSS, o CssMinimizerPlugin é utilizado para otimizar e minificar estilos. Ambos são configurados na seção optimization.minimizer do webpack.config.js.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> O recurso optimization.splitChunks do Webpack v5 permite dividir o código em chunks menores, que podem ser carregados sob demanda ou armazenados em cache separadamente, melhorando o desempenho.9 Isso também pode ser alcançado através de dynamic imports (import())\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> Esta funcionalidade, que remove código não utilizado, é ativada automaticamente no Webpack v5 para módulos ES6+. Para aproveitá-la ao máximo, o código deve ser escrito em sintaxe ES6+ e os módulos devem evitar \"side effects\" (efeitos colaterais). O campo sideEffects no package.json pode ser usado para indicar módulos sem efeitos colaterais, permitindo que o Webpack os remova se não forem utilizados. </li><li><strong>Plugins Essenciais para Otimização:</strong> Vários plugins são cruciais para otimização e funcionalidade:\n\n<ul><li>DefinePlugin: Cria constantes globais configuráveis em tempo de compilação.</li><li>CompressionPlugin: Prepara assets para serem servidos com codificação de conteúdo (e.g., Gzip, Brotli). </li><li>HtmlWebpackPlugin: Simplifica a criação de arquivos HTML e injeta os bundles gerados.</li><li>Bundle Analyzer: Uma ferramenta útil para visualizar o conteúdo dos bundles como um treemap interativo, ajudando a identificar gargalos de tamanho.</li><li>ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin: Melhora o tempo de build em projetos TypeScript ao executar a verificação de tipos em um processo separado, liberando o thread principal. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Outras Práticas Recomendadas:</strong> Manter o Webpack atualizado para aproveitar as otimizações mais recentes. Aplicar loaders ao número mínimo necessário de módulos. Manter o chunk de entrada pequeno para que sua emissão seja barata, usando\noptimization.runtimeChunk: true para criar um chunk separado para o código de tempo de execução. Evitar etapas de otimização extras desnecessárias durante o desenvolvimento. Desativar\noutput.pathinfo para reduzir a pressão de coleta de lixo em projetos com milhares de módulos. Configurar\nresolve.symlinks: false se não forem usados symlinks (como npm link ou yarn link) para aumentar a velocidade de resolução.</li></ul><h2><strong>3. Vite: A Nova Geração de Ferramentas de Build</strong></h2><p>Vite, pronunciado \"veet\" (francês para \"rápido\"), é uma ferramenta de build moderna e leve que rapidamente se tornou uma alternativa proeminente a bundlers tradicionais como o Webpack. Desenvolvido por Evan You, o criador do Vue.js, o Vite foi projetado para oferecer uma experiência de desenvolvimento mais rápida e enxuta, especialmente para componentes de arquivo único do Vue.js, mas com suporte abrangente para a maioria dos frameworks JavaScript.</p><p>A arquitetura inovadora do Vite é o cerne de sua velocidade e eficiência:</p><ul><li><strong>Desenvolvimento Baseado em Módulos ES Nativos:</strong> Diferente dos bundlers tradicionais que empacotam todo o código antecipadamente, o Vite aproveita o suporte nativo dos navegadores para módulos ES (ESM) durante o desenvolvimento. Isso significa que o servidor de desenvolvimento do Vite serve os arquivos fonte diretamente ao navegador, permitindo que o próprio navegador lide com a resolução de dependências. Quando um arquivo é editado, o Vite invalida apenas a cadeia entre o módulo alterado e seu limite HMR mais próximo, resultando em atualizações consistentemente rápidas, independentemente do tamanho da aplicação. Essa abordagem é conhecida como \"desenvolvimento não empacotado\" (unbundled development), onde cada arquivo é construído apenas uma vez e então é armazenado em cache indefinidamente.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>|  \nV  \n| (Serve arquivos diretamente)  \nV  \n\\[Navegador\\]  \n| (Resolve dependências via ESM nativo)  \nV  \n| (Alteração de arquivo)  \nV  \n|  \nV\n</code></pre></div><ul><li><strong>Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Quase Instantâneo:</strong> A utilização de ESM nativos e a estratégia de servir código sob demanda permitem que o Vite ofereça um HMR incrivelmente rápido. As alterações no código são refletidas no navegador quase instantaneamente, sem a necessidade de recarregar a página inteira, o que melhora drasticamente a experiência do desenvolvedor. O Vite detecta as mudanças e atualiza o DOM sem recarregar a página completa, atualizando apenas as partes da aplicação que foram alteradas e preservando o estado atual. </li><li><strong>Pré-empacotamento de Dependências com Esbuild:</strong> Para dependências que não mudam frequentemente durante o desenvolvimento (como bibliotecas de componentes), o Vite as pré-empacota usando o Esbuild. O Esbuild, escrito em Go, é notavelmente rápido, realizando esse pré-empacotamento 10 a 100 vezes mais rápido que bundlers baseados em JavaScript. Isso garante que o servidor de desenvolvimento inicie rapidamente, pois as dependências já estão prontas para serem servidas. As dependências são pré-empacotadas porque são principalmente JavaScript puro que não muda com frequência, podem ser grandes (centenas de módulos) e podem vir em formatos como CommonJS ou UMD que não são nativos do navegador.</li><li><strong>Build de Produção Otimizado com Rollup:</strong> Embora o Vite use ESM nativos para o desenvolvimento, para builds de produção, ele utiliza o Rollup, um bundler conhecido por suas capacidades de tree-shaking e otimização de código. Isso garante que os bundles finais sejam altamente otimizados para implantação, resultando em tamanhos menores e desempenho aprimorado. O Rollup é escolhido por sua eficiência em gerar bundles menores, realizar tree-shaking eficaz e suportar code splitting.</li></ul><h3><strong>Principais Características e Vantagens</strong></h3><p>A abordagem do Vite oferece uma série de vantagens que o tornam uma escolha atraente para o desenvolvimento web moderno:</p><ul><li> A combinação de ESM nativos e pré-empacotamento com Esbuild resulta em uma inicialização instantânea do servidor de desenvolvimento e atualizações HMR quase instantâneas, proporcionando um feedback rápido e um fluxo de trabalho altamente eficiente.\n</li><li><strong>Configuração Mínima/Zero-Config:</strong> O Vite foi projetado para exigir configuração mínima por padrão, o que simplifica significativamente o processo de setup e acelera o início do projeto. Isso permite que os desenvolvedores se concentrem na escrita do código, em vez de gastar tempo configurando a ferramenta de build. O helperdefineConfig oferece Intellisense e tipagem TypeScript para o objeto de configuração, facilitando a escrita e a extensão das configurações.\n</li><li><strong>Suporte Abrangente a Frameworks:</strong> O Vite é agnóstico em relação a frameworks, mas oferece suporte adaptado e otimizado para os mais populares, como React, Vue e Svelte, através de seu sistema de plugins.\n</li><li><strong>Suporte Nativo a TypeScript e JSX:</strong> O Vite oferece suporte embutido para TypeScript e JSX, simplificando o uso dessas tecnologias sem a necessidade de configurações adicionais complexas. Para TypeScript, basta instalar o pacote typescript e criar os arquivos de configuração (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.node.json). </li><li><strong>Gerenciamento Simplificado de Assets Estáticos:</strong> A ferramenta simplifica o tratamento de estilos e ativos estáticos (como imagens e fontes), com otimização automática em produção, incluindo renomeação com hash de conteúdo para cache busting. O Vite suporta CSS out-of-the-box, permitindo importar arquivos .css diretamente no JavaScript. Para pré-processadores como Sass, Less e Stylus, basta instalar o pacote necessário e importar o arquivo. </li><li><strong>Code Splitting e Lazy Loading:</strong> O Vite inclui suporte direto para code splitting e lazy loading, o que ajuda a otimizar a performance da aplicação ao carregar apenas os módulos necessários em um determinado momento.</li><li><strong>Sistema de Plugins Flexível:</strong> O sistema de plugins do Vite é extensível e baseado na interface de plugins do Rollup, permitindo que os desenvolvedores personalizem a experiência de desenvolvimento e adicionem suporte para tipos de arquivos extras ou funcionalidades específicas.\n</li><li><strong>Experiência do Desenvolvedor (DX) Aprimorada:</strong> O foco do Vite em velocidade e eficiência se traduz em um fluxo de trabalho mais suave, mais agradável e produtivo para o desenvolvedor, reduzindo o tempo de espera e aumentando o tempo de codificação.</li></ul><p>A configuração do Vite é notavelmente simples. O arquivo de configuração principal é vite.config.js, localizado na raiz do projeto, embora outras extensões JS e TS também sejam suportadas. A função</p><p>defineConfig (importada de vite) é um helper que oferece Intellisense e tipagem TypeScript para o objeto de configuração, facilitando a escrita e a extensão das configurações.</p><ul><li><strong>Configuração Condicional e Assíncrona:</strong> É possível exportar uma função que determina as opções de configuração com base no command (servir ou build), mode, isSsrBuild ou isPreview. Configurações assíncronas também são suportadas, permitindo operações como buscar dados antes de retornar a configuração.</li><li> O Vite facilita a definição de variáveis de ambiente, que podem ser acessadas via process.env. O helper loadEnv pode ser usado para carregar arquivos .env específicos. </li></ul><p>Para interagir com o Vite, os desenvolvedores utilizam comandos CLI simples:</p><ul><li>npm create vite@latest: Inicia um novo projeto Vite, oferecendo templates para diversos frameworks populares como React, Vue e Svelte.</li><li>vite (ou npm run dev): Inicia o servidor de desenvolvimento com hot reloading.</li><li>vite build (ou npm run build): Constrói a aplicação para produção, gerando arquivos otimizados na pasta dist.</li><li>vite preview (ou npm run preview): Serve os arquivos construídos com o comando build para pré-visualização local.</li></ul><p>O ecossistema de plugins do Vite, embora mais jovem que o do Webpack, está em rápido crescimento e oferece soluções para diversas necessidades:</p><ul><li>@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Substitui o Babel pelo SWC durante o desenvolvimento para projetos React, resultando em cold starts e HMR significativamente mais rápidos, especialmente para grandes projetos. </li><li>vite-plugin-dts: Gera automaticamente arquivos de declaração TypeScript (.d.ts) para projetos de biblioteca, garantindo que os usuários finais se beneficiem de definições de tipo precisas. </li><li>vite-plugin-svgr: Transforma arquivos SVG em componentes React, permitindo que SVGs sejam tratados como elementos JSX dinâmicos, simplificando fluxos de trabalho em projetos com muitas interfaces de usuário. </li><li>vite-plugin-checker: Executa verificações em tempo real para erros de TypeScript, problemas de ESLint e questões específicas do Vue durante o desenvolvimento, ajudando a manter bases de código limpas e sem bugs.</li></ul><h3><strong>Otimização de Performance</strong></h3><p>Para maximizar o desempenho com Vite, algumas práticas de otimização são recomendadas:</p><ul><li><strong>Revisar o Setup do Navegador:</strong> Extensões de navegador e ferramentas de desenvolvedor podem interferir nas requisições e desacelerar os tempos de inicialização e recarregamento. A criação de um perfil de desenvolvimento dedicado sem extensões ou o uso do modo de navegação anônima pode melhorar a performance, pois o servidor de desenvolvimento do Vite faz um hard caching de dependências pré-empacotadas e implementa respostas 304 rápidas para o código-fonte.\n</li><li><strong>Auditar Plugins Configurados:</strong> Plugins adicionais podem impactar o desempenho. Dependências grandes usadas apenas em certos casos devem ser importadas dinamicamente. Hooks como buildStart, config e configResolved não devem executar operações longas, pois atrasam a inicialização do servidor. Hooks como resolveId, load e transform podem causar lentidão no carregamento de arquivos; otimizações como verificar palavras-chave ou extensões antes da transformação completa podem ajudar.\n</li><li><strong>Reduzir Operações de Resolução:</strong> Ser explícito com as extensões dos arquivos em importações (ex: import './Component.jsx') pode reduzir o número de verificações do sistema de arquivos que o Vite precisa realizar, acelerando a resolução de caminhos. Habilitar \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\" e \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true no tsconfig.json também pode ajudar. </li><li> Arquivos que reexportam APIs de outros arquivos no mesmo diretório podem aumentar a complexidade e o tempo de resolução, sendo preferível evitá-los.\n</li><li><strong>Aquecer Arquivos Frequentemente Usados:</strong> Utilizar a opção server.warmup para pré-carregar arquivos que são frequentemente acessados pode proporcionar um aumento de desempenho na inicialização do servidor de desenvolvimento. Usar --open ou server.open também aquece o ponto de entrada da aplicação. </li><li><strong>Utilizar Ferramentas Nativas:</strong> Para projetos maiores, considerar o uso de ferramentas nativas como Rolldown (futura alternativa baseada em Rust para Rollup), LightningCSS e @vitejs/plugin-react-swc pode trazer ganhos significativos de performance.</li></ul><h2><strong>4. Outras Ferramentas de Build Notáveis</strong></h2><p>Além de Webpack e Vite, o ecossistema JavaScript oferece uma variedade de outras ferramentas de build, cada uma com suas próprias filosofias e otimizações para diferentes casos de uso.</p><p>O Rollup é um empacotador de módulos JavaScript que se destaca por sua capacidade de compilar pequenos componentes de código em algo maior e mais complexo, como uma biblioteca ou aplicação. Seu foco principal é a produção de bundles menores e mais eficientes, tornando-o ideal para o desenvolvimento de bibliotecas JavaScript e SDKs.</p><p>As características distintivas do Rollup incluem:</p><ul><li><strong>Suporte Nativo a ES Modules (ESM):</strong> O Rollup foi projetado para trabalhar com módulos ES desde o início, aproveitando a sintaxe import/export para otimizar o bundle final.</li><li> Uma de suas características mais notáveis é o tree shaking, um método que remove código não utilizado (dead code) do bundle final. Ao analisar as dependências, o Rollup elimina funções, variáveis e módulos que nunca são usados, resultando em bundles mais leves e eficientes.\n</li><li> Otimiza e reduz o overhead de closures de função agrupando código relacionado, o que contribui para bundles menores e melhor desempenho em tempo de execução. </li><li><strong>Múltiplos Formatos de Saída:</strong> Suporta vários formatos de saída, como CommonJS, ES modules, UMD (Universal Module Definition) e IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), o que o torna versátil para uso em diferentes ambientes. </li></ul><p>Em termos de configuração, o Rollup oferece um processo mais simplificado em comparação com o Webpack. No entanto, o tratamento de CSS e imagens pode exigir configuração manual adicional. Quanto à performance, o Rollup geralmente se destaca em tempos de build iniciais, sendo mais rápido que o Webpack para pequenos e médios projetos. </p><p>O Parcel se posiciona como uma ferramenta de build \"zero-configuration\" para a web, com o objetivo de simplificar o processo de empacotamento e proporcionar uma excelente experiência de desenvolvimento. É particularmente adequado para protótipos rápidos e sites estáticos.</p><p>Suas principais características incluem:</p><ul><li> O Parcel suporta diversas linguagens e tipos de arquivo (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, imagens, fontes, vídeos) sem a necessidade de configuração extensiva. Ele detecta automaticamente os tipos de arquivo, dependências e compatibilidade do navegador, gerando um bundle otimizado sem setup manual. </li><li> O compilador JavaScript do Parcel é escrito em Rust, o que contribui para um desempenho nativo. Ele constrói o código em paralelo usando threads de worker, aproveitando todos os núcleos da máquina, e tudo é armazenado em cache, evitando a reconstrução do mesmo código duas vezes. </li><li><strong>Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Embutido:</strong> O Parcel inclui um servidor de desenvolvimento com HMR integrado, permitindo que as mudanças no código sejam refletidas instantaneamente no navegador sem recarregar a página.</li><li><strong>Otimização Automática de Produção:</strong> O Parcel otimiza automaticamente toda a aplicação para produção, incluindo tree-shaking e minificação de JavaScript, CSS e HTML, redimensionamento e otimização de imagens, content hashing e code splitting automático.</li><li><strong>Manuseio de Assets Integrado:</strong> Suporta nativamente a importação e otimização de diversos tipos de assets, simplificando o desenvolvimento sem a necessidade de loaders ou plugins adicionais para tipos comuns. </li></ul><p>Apesar de sua filosofia zero-config, o Parcel é escalável e pode ser estendido através de um sistema de plugins para requisitos de build mais complexos.</p><p>O Esbuild é uma ferramenta de build que prioriza a velocidade extrema para empacotamento e minificação de JavaScript e TypeScript. Desenvolvido por Evan Wallace, ele ganhou popularidade por seus tempos de build que são tipicamente 10 a 100 vezes mais rápidos que outras ferramentas como Webpack e Rollup.</p><p>Sua velocidade é atribuída a vários fatores:</p><ul><li> A linguagem Go compila para código nativo, que é mais performático para aplicações de linha de comando do que linguagens JIT-compiladas como JavaScript. Go também suporta paralelismo com memória compartilhada entre threads. </li><li> Os algoritmos internos do Esbuild são projetados para saturar totalmente todos os núcleos de CPU disponíveis, paralelizando tarefas como parsing e geração de código. </li><li> Tudo no Esbuild foi escrito do zero, permitindo que a performance fosse uma prioridade desde o início, utilizando estruturas de dados consistentes e evitando conversões caras. Isso inclui um parser TypeScript customizado que evita problemas de performance do compilador oficial. </li><li><strong>Uso Eficiente de Memória:</strong> O Esbuild busca complexidade O(n) no comprimento da entrada, minimizando passes sobre os dados e transformações entre representações de dados, o que contribui para melhor utilização do cache da CPU. </li></ul><p>Outras características importantes incluem:</p><ul><li><strong>Tamanhos de Saída Pequenos:</strong> Consegue bundles pequenos através de minificação agressiva e tree shaking eficiente, que elimina código não utilizado. </li><li> A configuração do Esbuild é projetada para ser simples e intuitiva, com um pequeno conjunto de opções que cobrem a maioria dos casos de uso comuns, evitando a complexidade de configuração de outros bundlers. </li><li><strong>Suporte a CommonJS e ES Modules:</strong> Compatível com ambos os sistemas de módulos, tornando-o versátil para uma ampla gama de código JavaScript.</li></ul><p>O Esbuild é uma excelente escolha para projetos rápidos, pipelines de CI/CD ou como parte de um sistema de build maior onde a velocidade é um requisito não negociável. Para otimização, ele suporta builds incrementais (reutilizando trabalho de builds anteriores), caching (armazenando arquivos e ASTs em memória), paralelização automática e minificação.</p><p>O Snowpack é uma ferramenta de build moderna e leve que adota uma abordagem distinta para o desenvolvimento web, focando no desenvolvimento \"unbundled\" (não empacotado). Diferente dos bundlers tradicionais que reconstroem e reempacotam grandes partes da aplicação a cada salvamento de arquivo, o Snowpack serve a aplicação não empacotada durante o desenvolvimento.</p><p>Seu funcionamento se baseia em:</p><ul><li><strong>Desenvolvimento Não Empacotado:</strong> Cada arquivo é construído apenas uma vez e então é armazenado em cache indefinidamente. Quando um arquivo é alterado, o Snowpack reconstrói apenas aquele arquivo específico, eliminando o tempo gasto reempacotando a cada mudança e proporcionando atualizações instantâneas no navegador, potencializadas pelo HMR. Essa abordagem resulta em builds de arquivo único que são rápidos, determinísticos, mais fáceis de depurar e onde o tamanho do projeto não afeta a velocidade de desenvolvimento. </li><li><strong>Gerenciamento de Dependências NPM:</strong> O Snowpack processa as dependências NPM separadamente, convertendo-as para ES Modules que podem ser executados diretamente no navegador. Isso significa que, após o build inicial das dependências (que raramente mudam), qualquer pacote pode ser importado e executado nativamente no navegador sem empacotamento ou ferramentas adicionais. </li></ul><p>Para produção, o Snowpack permite que os desenvolvedores integrem seus bundlers favoritos, como Webpack ou Rollup, através de plugins oficiais, combinando o desenvolvimento rápido e não empacotado com builds de produção otimizados. Plugins do Snowpack podem usar hooks como optimize() para otimizações de build, isSSR para suporte a Server-Side Rendering, transform() para modificar conteúdo de arquivos e run() para integrar ferramentas CLI.</p><p>O Turbopack é um bundler incremental otimizado para JavaScript e TypeScript, escrito em Rust e desenvolvido pela Vercel, a equipe por trás do Next.js, no qual está integrado. Ele foi criado para impulsionar o desempenho do Next.js, especialmente no desenvolvimento local, e afirma ser significativamente mais rápido que o Webpack.</p><p>As características chave do Turbopack incluem:</p><ul><li> Utiliza um único gráfo unificado para todos os ambientes (cliente e servidor), simplificando o gerenciamento de múltiplos compiladores e a união de bundles.\n</li><li><strong>Bundling Otimizado em Desenvolvimento:</strong> Diferente de algumas ferramentas que pulam o bundling em desenvolvimento, o Turbopack empacota em dev, mas de forma otimizada para manter a velocidade em aplicações grandes, evitando lentidão devido a excessivas requisições de rede. </li><li> Paraleliza o trabalho entre os núcleos da CPU e armazena os resultados em cache em nível de função, garantindo que o trabalho já feito não seja repetido. Isso significa que ele reconstrói apenas as partes da aplicação que foram alteradas, tornando os builds incrivelmente rápidos. </li><li> O Turbopack empacota apenas o que é realmente solicitado pelo servidor de desenvolvimento, o que pode reduzir os tempos de compilação iniciais e o uso de memória. </li><li> Oferece Fast Refresh, atualizando JavaScript, TypeScript e CSS sem a necessidade de um recarregamento completo da página. </li></ul><p>O Turbopack pode ser habilitado no Next.js com a flag --turbo ao iniciar o servidor de desenvolvimento. Suas otimizações incluem persistent caching, com o TurboEngine atuando como motor de cache granular, e invalidação automática de cache que rastreia dependências e invalida apenas os nós afetados no gráfo de dependências.</p><p>O Rspack, lançado em 2023, é projetado para ser uma alternativa mais rápida ao Webpack, mantendo uma forte compatibilidade com seu ecossistema de plugins e configurações. Escrito em Rust, ele visa proporcionar uma experiência de desenvolvimento superior com foco em velocidade.</p><p>Suas principais características incluem:</p><ul><li> Baseado em Rust, oferece tempos de build extremamente rápidos e Hot Module Replacement (HMR) ágil devido a um mecanismo de compilação incremental embutido. </li><li><strong>Compatibilidade com Webpack:</strong> É compatível com plugins e loaders do ecossistema Webpack, permitindo uma integração contínua com bibliotecas existentes da comunidade. Isso o torna uma opção atraente para projetos que já utilizam Webpack e buscam melhor desempenho sem grandes reestruturações. </li><li> Oferece suporte de primeira classe para Module Federation, facilitando o desenvolvimento de aplicações web em larga escala.</li><li> Inclui diversas estratégias de otimização de produção por padrão, como tree shaking e minificação. </li></ul><p>As otimizações de produção do Rspack são altamente configuráveis através da propriedade optimization em rspack.config.mjs. Isso inclui:</p><ul><li> Suporta code splitting via import() dinâmicos, pontos de entrada e o SplitChunksPlugin, permitindo controle granular sobre o tamanho e o número de assets gerados para melhorar os tempos de carregamento. </li><li> Remove código não utilizado (dead code) através de optimization.usedExports, optimization.sideEffects, optimization.providedExports e optimization.innerGraph.

Comparativo e Tendências Futuras</strong></h2><p>A escolha da ferramenta de build ideal para um projeto JavaScript moderno é uma decisão estratégica que impacta diretamente a performance, a experiência do desenvolvedor e a manutenibilidade do código. As ferramentas discutidas, Webpack, Vite, Rollup, Parcel, Esbuild, Snowpack, Turbopack e Rspack, oferecem abordagens distintas para os desafios do desenvolvimento frontend.</p><h3><strong>Comparativo de Performance e Características</strong></h3><p>A tabela a seguir resume as principais características, performance e casos de uso de algumas das ferramentas mais relevantes:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Característica / Ferramenta</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>JavaScript (com Esbuild/Rollup)</td></tr><tr><td>Servidor de Dev com ESM Nativo</td><td>Empacotador de Bibliotecas</td><td>Desenvolvimento Não Empacotado</td><td>Incremental, Otimizado para Next.js</td><td>Rápido, Compatível com Webpack</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance (Dev Server Startup)</strong></td><td>Mais lento (upfront bundling)</td><td>Instantâneo (ESM nativos, Esbuild)</td><td>Requer setup adicional para HMR</td><td>Rápido (multicore processing)</td><td>Extremamente rápido (Go, paralelismo)</td><td>Rápido (single-file builds)</td><td>Muito rápido (incremental, lazy bundling)</td><td>Muito rápido (Rust, incremental)</td></tr><tr><td>Pode desacelerar em projetos grandes</td><td>Menos abrangente que Webpack</td><td>Não nativo, requer plugins/integração 33</td><td>Muito rápido (Fast Refresh)</td><td>Muito rápido (Rust, incremental)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tamanho do Bundle (Médio)</strong></td><td>Muito pequeno (minificação, tree shaking)</td><td>Otimizado com bundlers externos</td><td>Otimizado (tree shaking, minificação)</td></tr><tr><td>Poderosa, mas complexa e íngreme curva de aprendizado</td><td>Mínima, fácil de aprender e configurar</td><td>Mais simples que Webpack, mas requer configuração para assets</td><td>Zero-config, ideal para iniciantes</td><td>Mais simples que Webpack, compatível</td></tr><tr><td>Maduro, vasto, muitos plugins e loaders</td><td>Crescendo rapidamente, muitos plugins específicos</td><td>Forte para desenvolvimento de bibliotecas</td><td>Crescendo, mas menor que Webpack</td><td>Menor, mas com plugins para bundlers</td><td>Crescendo (integrado ao Next.js)</td><td>Crescendo, compatível com Webpack</td></tr><tr><td>Projetos grandes e complexos, controle granular</td><td>Aplicações modernas, prototipagem rápida, SPAs, Vue/React</td><td>Bibliotecas JS, SDKs, pacotes NPM</td><td>Protótipos rápidos, sites estáticos, simplicidade</td><td>Projetos pequenos/médios, CI/CD, onde velocidade é crítica</td><td>Desenvolvimento rápido, monorepos</td><td>Aplicações Next.js em larga escala</td><td>Usuários Webpack buscando performance</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>A popularidade das ferramentas de build JavaScript é um reflexo das tendências e necessidades do mercado. Dados de downloads do npmcharts.com (semanalmente) mostram que o Esbuild lidera com 56.9 milhões de downloads, seguido por Webpack (29.9 milhões) e Vite (26.5 milhões). Outras ferramentas como @swc/core (12.6 milhões), Parcel (232.2 mil) e @rspack/cli (327.7 mil) também demonstram uso significativo e crescimento. 21 É importante notar que o Rollup, com 47.3 milhões de downloads mensais, mantém uma forte presença, especialmente para bibliotecas.</p><p>O \"State of JS 2023 Survey\" oferece uma perspectiva sobre o uso e a satisfação dos desenvolvedores. Embora o Webpack ainda seja a ferramenta JavaScript mais utilizada (85.3% dos respondentes), o Vite se destaca como a ferramenta \"mais amada\" (56% de feedback positivo) e a terceira mais utilizada (78.1%). Isso indica uma mudança nas preferências dos desenvolvedores, que valorizam a velocidade e a facilidade de uso do Vite. O Esbuild também mostra uma adoção crescente, com 50.7% de uso. </p><h3><strong>Tendências Futuras e Impacto dos Módulos ES Nativos</strong></h3><p>A evolução das ferramentas de build está intrinsecamente ligada ao avanço das tecnologias web. A adoção generalizada de módulos ES nativos pelos navegadores é um fator transformador. Embora os módulos ES nativos permitam que os navegadores otimizem o carregamento de módulos de forma mais eficiente, isso não torna os bundlers obsoletos. Bundlers ainda desempenham um papel crucial na particionamento de código em chunks de tamanho razoável, minificação, eliminação de código morto e tree-shaking.</p><p>No entanto, a transição para módulos ES nativos introduz complexidades, especialmente na interoperabilidade com o CommonJS (o sistema de módulos síncrono do Node.js) e na compatibilidade com navegadores. Além disso, ferramentas como Babel e Webpack já permitiam o uso de módulos ES antes do suporte nativo, mas de forma síncrona, o que difere da especificação assíncrona dos módulos ES nativos. Essa diferença exige que os motores JavaScript entendam se um arquivo é um módulo ou um script, e essa informação precisa ser fornecida \"out of band\" (fora do próprio código JavaScript), por exemplo, através de extensões de arquivo (.mjs para ES Modules, .js para CommonJS). </p><p>O futuro do desenvolvimento frontend aponta para várias tendências que continuarão a moldar as ferramentas de build:</p><ul><li> Permite que aplicações web rodem mais rápido e eficientemente, complementando o JavaScript. </li><li><strong>Inteligência Artificial (AI) e Machine Learning (ML):</strong> A integração de AI/ML no frontend para personalização, análise preditiva e automação de tarefas de desenvolvimento. </li><li><strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):</strong> Continuarão a ser uma prioridade, com ferramentas otimizando a criação de experiências offline e responsivas. </li><li> Uma arquitetura que quebra aplicações frontend grandes em partes menores e independentemente implantáveis, melhorando a escalabilidade e a manutenção. </li><li><strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Híbrido:</strong> Uma combinação de SSR (para carregamento inicial rápido) e Client-Side Rendering (CSR) (para atualizações dinâmicas), com frameworks como Next.js liderando o caminho. </li><li><strong>Ferramentas Baseadas em Linguagens de Baixo Nível:</strong> O surgimento de ferramentas escritas em Rust e Go (como Esbuild, Turbopack e Rspack) demonstra uma busca contínua por velocidade e eficiência, aproveitando o desempenho nativo dessas linguagens.</li></ul><p>O ecossistema JavaScript é dinâmico e continua a inovar, com novas ferramentas e abordagens surgindo para atender às crescentes demandas de desempenho e complexidade das aplicações web modernas. </p><h2><strong>6. Conclusão e Recomendações</strong></h2><p>A jornada do JavaScript, de uma linguagem de script simples para um ecossistema complexo e multifacetado, impulsionou a necessidade e a evolução de ferramentas de build sofisticadas. A escolha da ferramenta certa é uma decisão estratégica que alinha as capacidades técnicas com os requisitos específicos do projeto e a dinâmica da equipe de desenvolvimento.</p><ul><li> Permanece uma escolha robusta e comprovada para projetos complexos e de grande escala, onde o controle granular sobre cada aspecto do processo de build e um vasto ecossistema de plugins são cruciais.

Sua velocidade incomparável pode reduzir drasticamente os tempos de build em ambientes de integração contínua e entrega contínua (CI/CD), onde a performance é crítica. </li><li> É crucial acompanhar o desenvolvimento de Turbopack e Rspack. Essas ferramentas, baseadas em Rust, prometem revolucionar ainda mais a velocidade de build e a compatibilidade com o ecossistema JavaScript. A adoção crescente de módulos ES nativos e o foco em ferramentas de baixo nível indicam a direção futura do desenvolvimento frontend, onde a performance e a eficiência serão cada vez mais prioritárias. </li></ul><p>Em suma, a escolha da ferramenta de build ideal é uma decisão multifacetada que deve considerar as necessidades específicas do projeto, a experiência e as preferências da equipe, e as prioridades de performance e facilidade de manutenção. O cenário de ferramentas de build JavaScript é dinâmico e continua a inovar, oferecendo soluções cada vez mais eficientes para os desafios do desenvolvimento web moderno.</p>","contentLength":48652,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Comparative Overview of Testing Management Tools with Real-World Examples","url":"https://dev.to/draigo15/comparative-overview-of-testing-management-tools-with-real-world-examples-2g7n","date":1751505359,"author":"rodrigo_lira","guid":181596,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Modern software development relies on effective testing management tools—primarily as part of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines.

At that stage, only a few basic rules were added for initial monitoring purposes. Now that the core application stack is largely in place, it's time to take a deeper look into how the robot is interacting with the network. Understanding these interactions is critical not only for security but also for diagnosing system behavior during development and deployment.</p><ol><li>Why Monitor Robot Network Traffic?</li><li>Creating and Using Suricata Rules</li><li>Distilling Suricata Logs with Python</li><li>Conclusion and Next Steps</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Monitor Robot Network Traffic?\n</h2><p>Modern robots often require multiple forms of network connectivity. For instance, a robot may have:</p><ul><li>A wired Ethernet (RJ45) connection for direct terminal access.</li><li>WiFi connectivity for remote ROS 2 command input and mobile web interface access.</li><li>The ability to create its own access point for issuing ROS 2 commands or enabling remote monitoring.</li><li>Cellular network access when out of range of local WiFi.</li></ul><p>With all these interfaces, it's essential to monitor who is accessing the robot and what services or application ports are being used. Suricata provides a powerful way to achieve this by performing deep packet inspection and generating actionable alerts based on defined rules.</p><p>Suricata is an open-source application designed for deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, and optionally, intrusion prevention. Unlike a traditional firewall, which typically filters traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and simple protocol rules, Suricata analyzes network packets at a much deeper level.</p><p>By default, Suricata operates in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) mode, logging and reporting network traffic anomalies. It can be configured to act as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), but for the purpose of this discussion, we focus on its IDS capabilities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Creating and Using Suricata Rules\n</h2><p>One of Suricata's core features is its rules engine. These rules allow users to define conditions under which alerts should be triggered. When a packet matches a rule, Suricata logs an entry with a message, classification, and other details.</p><p>Here's an example of Suricata rules tailored to monitor ROS 2 traffic:</p><div><pre><code>alert udp any 49152:65535 -&gt; any any msg: sid:100002 rev:1 classtype:not-suspicious\nalert udp any any -&gt; any 7400:7500 msg: sid:100001 rev:2 classtype:not-suspicious\nalert udp any 7400:7500 -&gt; any any msg: sid:100003 rev:1 classtype:not-suspicious</code></pre></div><p>These rules help capture ROS 2-specific discovery and data traffic, flagging it for further analysis. However, Suricata can generate a high volume of logs, making manual inspection challenging.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Distilling Suricata Logs with Python\n</h2><p>To manage this data more effectively, a custom Python script can be used to distill Suricata log entries into a summary format. This script groups logs by IP addresses and applications, providing a clearer view of network interactions.</p><p>Sample distilled log output:</p><div><pre><code>Application,Classification,Source IP,Destination IP,Count\n[ROS2-02] OutgoingDDS Data Traffic Detected,Not Suspicious Traffic,192.168.178.11,8.8.8.8,127\n[ROS2-02] OutgoingDDS Data Traffic Detected,Not Suspicious Traffic,192.168.178.11,185.125.190.58,21\n[SSH-10] Incoming SSH Connection Attempt,Attempted Administrator Privilege Gain,192.168.178.1,192.168.178.11,2\n...\n</code></pre></div><p>This output reveals interesting traffic patterns, such as unexpected outbound connections or potential intrusion attempts. The full Python summarizer script is available here.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion and Next Steps\n</h2><p>While using Suricata on a robot may initially seem excessive, it's a powerful tool during development. Robotics systems integrate complex combinations of hardware and software, and it's crucial to verify the sources and destinations of all network traffic.</p><p>For more robust monitoring, consider integrating Suricata with advanced log analysis platforms like the ELK Stack or Graylog. These platforms can provide real-time dashboards, alerting, and deeper insights into your robot’s network behavior.</p><p>By leveraging Suricata and tailored tools like the Python distiller, developers gain critical visibility into the robot's communication landscape—an invaluable asset for building secure and reliable robotic systems.</p><p> I help businesses streamline servers, secure infrastructure, and automate workflows.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns\n</h2><p>Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:</p><p>Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Request/Response Compression\n</h3><p>Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.</p><p>API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication and Authorization\n</h3><p>Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h2><p>Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:</p><p>Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.</p><p>Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.</p><p>Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deployment and Scaling Strategies\n</h2><p>Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:</p><p>API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.</p><p>Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.</p><p>For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lessons Learned and Best Practices\n</h2><p>Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:</p><ol><li><p>: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.</p></li><li><p>: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.</p></li><li><p>: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.</p></li></ol><p>The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:</p><p>Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.</p><p>Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.</p><p>API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.</p><p>The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.</p><p>As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.</p><p><em>This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems.

More recently I have started hearing about new terms such as , and others exploring the field of . Understanding how to <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">manage your context</a> will be key to your success. </p><p>Imagine yourself working on some new feature or trying to refactor some code using Amazon Q CLI, when all of a sudden you start hitting context window limits. You have setup some nice <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-context-profiles.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rules files</a>, added important markdown docs to your context, and you are getting amazing results. A quick check of  gets your heart pumping as you notice you are reaching your context window limits.</p><p>In this post I am going to show you how you can enable an experimental / beta feature in <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli-autocomplete\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q CLI</a> that allows you to provide Amazon Q CLI information it needs, without consuming precious context. Sounds good right? Read on to find out more on how you can enable this, and how you can get up and running to test this for yourself.</p><p>If you have been using tools like Amazon Q Developer in the IDE, you will know that you can use a feature called  to provide additional information with your prompt. It works by indexing the files in your local workspace.  <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli-autocomplete/pull/101\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> is a new beta/experimental feature that you can now test with the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli-autocomplete/releases/tag/v1.12.2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">latest update</a>. This introduces a new tool within Amazon Q CLI, that allows you to create semantic indexes of directories and files, that are used to search and use information without consuming tokens in your context window. Those indexes are called .</p><p>Lets take a look at how you get access to this so you can experiment yourself. If you have not already done so, we need to enable experimental mode within Amazon Q CLI.</p><p><strong>Enabling experimental features in Amazon Q CLI</strong></p><p>To enable  we need to both enable the beta features within Amazon Q CLI as well as enable this particular feature. From the command line, enable beta features using the following commands. Make sure you close any Amazon Q CLI sessions you have open for these settings to take effect.</p><div><pre><code>q settings app.beta true\nq settings chat.enableKnowledge true\n</code></pre></div><p>To verify, when you run \"q settings all\" you should see the following line.</p><div><pre><code>app.beta = true\nchat.enableKnowledge = true\n</code></pre></div><p>How do you know whether this has worked? Open up a new Amazon Q CLI session, and from the  prompt, type  and hit return, and you should see the following output.</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /knowledge\n\n(Beta) Manage knowledge base for persistent context storage. Requires \"q settings chat.enableKnowledge true\"\n\nUsage: /knowledge &lt;COMMAND&gt;\n\nCommands:\n  show    Display the knowledge base contents\n  add     Add a file or directory to knowledge base\n  remove  Remove specified knowledge context by path\n  update  Update a file or directory in knowledge base\n  clear   Remove all knowledge contexts\n  status  Show background operation status\n  cancel  Cancel a background operation\n  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help  Print help\n</code></pre></div><p>We can use the  command to list any existing knowledge bases that have been created. As we have not created any, we just see the following:</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /knowledge show\n\n\nNo knowledge base entries found.\n💡 Tip: If indexing is in progress, contexts may not appear until indexing completes.\n   Use 'knowledge status' to check active operations.\n</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>If you see the following when you run this command, it means that you have not configured this beta feature:</p><pre><code>Knowledge tool is disabled. Enable it with: q settings chat.enableKnowledge true\n</code></pre><p>Exit your Amazon Q CLI session, and from the command line type <strong>\"q settings chat.enableKnowledge true\"</strong>, and then retry</p></blockquote><p>When you use the  command, you will also notice that you have a new tool () that is available, and automatically trusted.</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /tools\n\nTool              Permission\n▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔\nBuilt-in:\n- execute_bash    * trust read-only commands\n- fs_read         * trusted\n- fs_write        * not trusted\n- knowledge       * trusted\n- report_issue    * trusted\n- use_aws         * trust read-only commands\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have it enabled and running, lets take a look at the workflow and how to use it.</p><p><strong>Workflow using /knowledge</strong></p><p>The workflow for working with  is pretty simple. You create knowledge bases and then you invoke them within your prompts.</p><p><em>Creating and updating knowledge bases</em></p><p>When you create a knowledge base, these have a global context - they will work across all your Amazon Q CLI sessions.</p><ul><li>You can create knowledge bases by adding files or directories</li><li>You can update those knowledge bases - for example, when you have made changes to those files (currently these will not automatically be updated)</li><li>You can delete knowledge bases</li></ul><p>Once you have created a knowledge base, you can then ask Amazon Q CLI to use your knowledge bases by adding \"Use the knowledge tool\" to your prompt.</p><p><strong>Getting started - an example</strong></p><p>Lets walk through an example use case to see this all come together. In my use case, I have a number of markdown documents that I typically add as context (using the \"/context add xxx\" command). To base line this test, I first ask the following prompt without any context</p><blockquote><p>Can you provide me with guidance on how to write tests when writing python code</p></blockquote><p>It very quickly provides me with some generic (but perfectly acceptable) output (which I have trimmed)</p><div><pre><code>&gt; I'd be happy to help you write tests for Python code! Here's a comprehensive\nguide covering the key aspects of Python testing:\n\n## Testing Framework - pytest\n\nWhile Python has a built-in unittest module, pytest is the most popular and\ndeveloper-friendly testing framework:\n\n...\n</code></pre></div><p>Like many developers, I have been curating and refining a set of documents that I use as context to help bootstrap new projects and provide more personalised and specific output. After adding these context files, when I retry the same output I get different output which is more aligned with those context documents.</p><div><pre><code>&gt; Can you provide me with guidance on how to write tests when writing python code\n\n&gt; Based on the comprehensive testing guidelines from your workspace, here's\nguidance on writing tests for Python code, specifically following the patterns\nestablished in your FastAPI projects:\n\n## Core Testing Principles\n\nTest behavior, not implementation - Focus on what your code does, not how it does it.\nPrefer integration-style unit tests that test multiple units together functionally\nrather than isolated unit tests.\n\nMock only external dependencies at the lowest level (database operations, API calls,\nfile system operations). Don't mock your own business logic.\n\n....\n</code></pre></div><p>To check my current context usage,  I run the  command, I get the following:</p><div><pre><code>█ Context files: ~23990 tokens (11.99%)\n</code></pre></div><p>I am currently using over 10% of my context window. Lets look at how using this new  feature can help me out. I first close my existing chat session and open up a new one and make sure that my current context is empty (using the  command).</p><div><pre><code>█ Context files: ~120 tokens (0.06%)\n</code></pre></div><p>The first thing I am going to do is create a new knowledge base, adding my context docs to this knowledge base. Rather than adding them individually (they are currently single markdown files) I put them in a directory called \"kb-docs\", and then run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /knowledge add /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n\n🚀 Started indexing '/Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs'\n📁 Path: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n🆔 Operation ID: b111463f.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>You will notice that I have to use the full absolute path to the directory where I have put my markdown docs.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Where does it create the knowledge base?</strong> You might be wondering where /knowledge add creates the knowledge base. In your home directory, you will see a  folder, which contains a directory that matches the data and configuration for the knowledge base.

Use the knowledge tool</p></blockquote><p>The first thing we notice is that we can see that the knowledge tool has been invoked</p><div><pre><code>🛠️  Using tool: knowledge (trusted)\n ⋮\n ● Searching knowledge base for: python testing unit tests pytest unittest across all contexts\n ⋮\n ● Completed in 0.47s\n</code></pre></div><p>and then we can see that it gives similar output to when we added those files to our context. It is not the same, but the guidance is broadly similar.</p><div><pre><code>&gt; Based on the knowledge base, I can provide you with comprehensive guidance on writing tests in Python. While\nthe knowledge base contains primarily TypeScript/JavaScript testing patterns, the core principles translate\nwell to Python testing. Here's a complete guide:\n\n## Core Testing Principles\n\nTest-Driven Development (TDD) is fundamental - write tests first, then implement code to make them pass. This\nensures your code is testable and meets requirements.\n\n### Key Testing Philosophy\n• **Test behavior, not implementation** - treat your code as a black box and test through public APIs\n• **100% coverage through business behavior** - achieve full coverage by testing expected business outcomes\n• **No implementation detail testing** - avoid testing internal functions directly\n</code></pre></div><p>As you update, add, or want to remove information from those documents you will need to update your knowledge base. Currently these are not automatically updated in the index so you have to do this yourself.</p><p>When you run , one of the pieces of information it provides is the number of items in the index. In my example, I go to the directory and I add a new file. To make sure that /knowledge will use that, I need to update the index using the following command:  followed by the directory of your knowledge base. Using the example above, I update my index using the following command:</p><div><pre><code>/knowledge update /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n</code></pre></div><p>And when I now run  I get the following:</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /knowledge show\n\n📚 Knowledge Base Contexts:\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n📂 a114fda9-5b61-4aa8-8218-e141b80720ad: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n   Description: Knowledge context for /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n   Created: 2025-07-02 21:47:37\n   Updated: 2025-07-02 21:47:37\n   Source: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n   Items: 8 | Persistent: Yes\n\n</code></pre></div><p>You can see that the number of items has changed (from 7 to 8). If I removed or made any changes to the files, I would need to repeat this process to make sure that the local index gets updated.</p><p><strong>Adding multiple knowledge bases</strong></p><p>So far we have just created a single knowledge base, but we can create multiple. From the same Amazon Q CLI session, I decide to create a new knowledge base for all things nodeJS. I create my new directory, and then create this new knowldege base using the following command:</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /knowledge add /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb\n\n🚀 Started indexing '/Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb'\n📁 Path: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb\n🆔 Operation ID: 304f00e6.\n</code></pre></div><p>and now when I run the  command, I can see I have more than one knowledge base.</p><div><pre><code>📚 Knowledge Base Contexts:\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n📂 a114fda9-5b61-4aa8-8218-e141b80720ad: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n   Description: Knowledge context for /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n   Created: 2025-07-02 21:47:37\n   Updated: 2025-07-02 21:47:37\n   Source: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/kb-docs\n   Items: 8 | Persistent: Yes\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n📂 f0ac6673-5071-4b01-a839-fac67b65ba32: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb\n   Description: Knowledge context for /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb\n   Created: 2025-07-02 21:53:48\n   Updated: 2025-07-02 21:53:48\n   Source: /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb\n   Items: 2 | Persistent: Yes\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Deleting a knowledge base</strong></p><p>Ok, so you have some fun and create a bunch of knowledge bases and then decided you want to remove one of them. No worries, you can use the  command to do this, together with the full path you originally used when creating it. To remove the knowledge base I just created in the previous step, I would run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /knowledge remove /Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb\n</code></pre></div><p>Which generates the following output:</p><div><pre><code>Removed context with path '/Users/ricsue/amazon-q-developer-cli/knowledge/node-kb'\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Removing ALL your knowledge bases</strong></p><p>If you decided you want to remove your knowledge bases, then you can use the  command, which will ask you to confirm this nuclear option (there is no undo) which will then proceed to remove the knowledge base. It will not delete/remove the actual files, just the index.</p><div><pre><code>&gt; /knowledge clear\n\n⚠️  This will remove ALL knowledge base entries. Are you sure? (y/N): y\n🛑 Cancelling any pending operations...\n🗑️  Clearing all knowledge base entries...\n\n✅ Successfully cleared 1 knowledge base entries\n\n</code></pre></div><p>When you create a knowledge base, these persist and are global in scope.</p><p>Currently this feature limits you to 5K documents when creating knowledge bases, so if you are adding directories with large amounts of documents this is something to watch out for.</p><p>If you really want to geek out, you can take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli-autocomplete/pull/101/commits/e9f3615796c80f686d9a2bb61f39a0d6dad352de\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source code</a> which reveals a lot of potentially useful info that will allow you to optimise how you use this feature.</p><p>This was a quick post that showed how you can enable experiment features in Amazon Q CLI like  that provide new capabilities for how you can manage context, and provide supporting information with your prompts. One thing you might be wondering is when to use one vs the other. </p><p>Using  provides supporting information that you define automatically with your prompt. The downside to this is that it can  take up space even when the information is irrelevant to the task you're asking the model to do. Using  allows you to index large amounts of information, which is retrieved on demand by the model. However, the model might not know when to look up the missing information and you will need to guide it. Currently you also need to automatically update these indexes as you update them.</p><p>We are excited to see how developers will experiment with and use this feature, and I would love to hear from folks who make interesting discoveries.</p><blockquote><p>**Not tried Amazon Q CLI?

What started as a YouTube ad discovery has become my complete trajectory transformation from someone who thought they'd need 20 years and millions of dollars to build this dream, to a developer who's ready to change the world. I got a feeling this is only the beginning, and HalfonLife is going to be a household name.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔧 First Line of Business: Bug Hunt Season\n</h2><p>So, after the hack, my first line of business is to track down and destroy those bugs I didn't have any choice but to submit with my project due to the deadline for submission for the hackathon.</p><p>Next, there might be a little bit of refactoring involved partially due to the bugs, but partially due to some new ideas that I've had since submission. And then, it's just moving on into the future with the HalfonLife app.</p><p><strong>I intend to realize this dream that I've been carrying in my mind for the last eight years.</strong> I finally, finally was able to start working on it. The technology finally caught up to where I needed it to be to be able to do this fated application, and I'm just ready to go with it.</p><p>It's an amazing feeling that I'm finally able to realize this dream. And I'm just not going to stop or give up on it until something happens with it, man. I know that this is going to change the way people go about handling their expenses and also give people the opportunity to be able to enjoy more of life.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🚀 The Vision: From 50 Tables to World Domination\n</h2><p>I got so many great ideas that I've come up with over the years that I'm going to try to implement into this app. Right now, there's 50 database tables in Supabase, and I may end up doubling it before it's all over to that 147.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Feature Explosion Coming\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Background checks and vetting systems</strong> for different people</li><li> to handle offensive content on the app\n</li><li><strong>Legal contracting systems</strong> to make everything official and protected</li><li><strong>Enhanced conversational AI</strong> I want people to be able to conversate with the app, much like we're conversating with generative AI apps like ChatGPT today</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Geographic Domination Strategy\n</h3><p>I plan on starting out in my area, which is a very large the DFW metroplex - and then expanding to infinity and beyond..lol.</p><p><strong>I think this app is going to be a watershed moment for us as people</strong>, trying to make it work with life and everything becoming more expensive with inflation and wage stagnation. I think this is going to be a boon for people to finally have something to address these issues.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🌟 What Excites Me Most: The User Creativity\n</h2><p>I can't wait to see all of the unique ideas that people have for going half and publishing splits on the app. It's going to be amazing to see how people take the app and transform it into what is ultimately really needed for their particular group or situation. It's going to be amazing to see.</p><p>The community is going to surprise me in ways I can't even imagine yet. When we give people a platform to say \"I got 5 on it\" instead of \"I can't afford that,\" the creativity that emerges is going to be incredible.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  💼 From Employee to Entrepreneur: The Startup Launch\n</h2><p>Yeah, I'm going to continue development, but I also plan on launching a startup on this application. I think that once people hear about it and try it, it's just going to take off from there.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Before: The 20-Year Plan That Never Was\n</h3><p>I really thought I would have to eventually pay someone to do it and that it was going to cost millions of dollars. I was going to have to work for 20 years before I could save up enough money to pay somebody to help me develop the code and build this application.</p><p><strong>That timeline just got obliterated.</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  During: This Revolutionary Moment\n</h3><p>Thanks to the advances in technology and AI, the dream was realized sooner. I was able to do all of this virtually alone, and I learned so much and gained so many skills during these 18 or so days of just super intense creation, trying to meet this deadline and trying to get all of my thoughts and ideas for this app out onto the monitor, so to speak.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  After: Complete Trajectory Change\n</h3><p>It just led to a total transformation in my trajectory. Now, I've always been headed in the direction of developing - I like DevOps, so I figured that I would head in the direction of DevOps engineering, that way I can get some of the front end and back end of development. I knew that one day, eventually, I would gain enough skills to help me push this project along.</p><p><strong>But these tools made it go a lot faster.</strong></p><p>It changed my whole trajectory because I feel like I am a developer now, i mean, I did just develop this app right? With the help of AI, I have made it to developer status, which I wasn't really going for. But since I've gotten my hands on some of these tools, I've developed multiple apps already.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ The New Me: Builder Identity\n</h2><p>I'm going to be building all kinds of apps. I've always been a tinkerer, and I always have these ideas about things that would be helpful or useful. I've always been able to kind of figure out how things work. And so now, with these tools and these skills that I've gotten and this new outlook, I already know I'm going to be just building things left and right that are going to be so impactful and useful in my life, if no one else's.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Skills Gained Through Fire\n</h3><ul><li>: Thinking in prompts, not just code</li><li>: .boltignore disasters are just Tuesday now</li><li>: Ideas to working apps in days, not years</li><li>: Front-end, back-end, database design, AI integration</li><li>: From employee to entrepreneur overnight</li></ul><p>: \"I need to save money to hire developers\": \"I AM the developer, and I can build anything I envision\"</p><p>: 20 years to afford building my dream: 18 days from idea to working prototype</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🌍 The Bigger Picture: Changing How America Lives\n</h2><p>This isn't just about building an app though, it's about fundamentally changing how people interact with financial stress in America.

It was only for 30 days and I didn't really get started until like the 17th or 18th, and so it's really been an intense couple of weeks.</p><p>I was most excited about the tools that I was using and the new capabilities, thanks to generative AI, that allowed me to be able to get farther than I thought I would ever get on my own building this app. The YouTube ad that started it all wasn't just about a hackathon, it was about discovering that the future I'd been waiting for had already arrived.</p><p>: \"Someday, when I have enough money and time...\": \"Holy shit, I can actually build this RIGHT NOW\": \"What else can I build? What other problems can I solve?\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🚀 What's Next: The Unstoppable Momentum\n</h2><p>The future? I got a feeling that this is only the beginning.

But the more I read, the more I realized how  and  his observations were. This article is my attempt to interpret, explain, and reflect on that comment in depth.</p><h2><strong>Why I Wrote This Counter-Article</strong></h2><p>I still believe skill is essential. But Professor Sanaye’s comment helped me see that skill alone isn’t always empowering. Sometimes, it can become a tool that locks us into systems we don’t control.</p><p>That’s why I’m writing this follow-up: to explore , and especially to unpack the deeper truths behind his message—truths we rarely acknowledge while chasing success.</p><h2><strong>Understanding Digital Feudalism (PRDF)</strong></h2><p>Feudalism was a medieval system where power and property were controlled by lords, and the working population (called serfs) had very little freedom. Serfs lived on the lords' land, worked hard, and got only survival in return. Their labor enriched the few at the top.</p><p><strong>The Present Ruling Digital Feudalism (PRDF)</strong>, as Sanaye calls it, is a modern version of feudalism where <strong>platforms have replaced landlords</strong>. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook control digital land. Creators and skilled workers use their tools, reach their users through them, and often earn through them—but the real power and profit remain with the platforms.</p><ul><li>You make videos, build an audience, and monetize through ads.</li><li>But YouTube controls the algorithm, the revenue share, and the visibility.</li><li>One change in policy can destroy your income overnight.</li></ul><p>You’re working, but you don’t own the platform, the traffic, or the system. Like digital serfs, you depend on the lords' goodwill.</p><h2><strong>\"Added Values\" and \"Objects\" — Going Deeper</strong></h2><p>Added value is what you bring to a product, service, or system through your skill. But if you are <strong>only valued for that output</strong>, and your human side—your creativity, struggles, health—is ignored, then you're no longer seen as a person. You're just a source of profit.</p><p>: Gig workers who deliver food for apps like DoorDash or UberEats. Their personal stories, risks, and challenges are invisible. They're valued only for fast delivery.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ● What Does \"Object\" Mean Here?\n</h3><p>An \"object\" is something used. It’s not alive. It doesn’t decide. When a person is treated like an object, they lose their agency. The system tells them what to do, when, and how—while pretending they have freedom.</p><p>: A customer support agent monitored by AI tools for every word, every second of silence, every emotion in their voice. Their job becomes robotic, their humanity reduced.</p><h2><strong>Zombie Regents and Hidden Controllers</strong></h2><p>Sanaye’s phrase <strong>\"zombie regent apparatus[-es]\"</strong> can be explained like this:</p><ul><li>: Moving but dead inside—just following commands.</li><li>: Someone ruling on behalf of someone else, not truly in power.</li><li>: The structure or machinery that runs things.</li></ul><p>This means modern workers are often just running systems they don’t understand, can’t control, and can’t escape. They seem alive and active, but inside, they’re exhausted, disconnected, and dependent on the machinery of digital platforms.</p><p>: Content moderators for social media companies who filter harmful material. They follow rules, rarely see the bigger picture, and suffer deep psychological effects. They serve the system, but they are not protected by it.</p><h2><strong>Free Time That Isn’t Free Anymore</strong></h2><p>Sanaye says today’s workers are divided into two groups:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The Unwitting Contributors\n</h3><p>They think they’re using their free time well—drawing, coding, blogging for fun—but unknowingly keep adding value to digital platforms. Their hobbies are monetized by someone else.</p><p>: An artist uploads free illustrations to Instagram. They get likes, but Meta gets ad revenue and platform engagement.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Guilt-Driven Always-On Workers\n</h3><p>These people feel bad for resting. They answer emails during dinner, check tasks in bed, and never disconnect. They live in a permanent work loop.</p><p><strong>This is what Sanaye meant by:</strong></p><blockquote><p>\"Digitally being present at work arena at any time of the day/night.\"</p></blockquote><p>Over time, this leads to burnout, anxiety, and emotional fatigue—yet the system praises them for being \"committed.\"</p><h2><strong>So, Is Skill Still Freedom?</strong></h2><p>Only when used intentionally.</p><p>Skill gives you potential—but whether it becomes freedom depends on how, where, and for whom you apply it.</p><p>When the system owns the tools, controls the reach, and dictates the rules, your skill is shaped to benefit the system—not yourself.</p><p><strong>If you can’t say no, rest, or switch off—your skill isn’t setting you free.</strong></p><p>Professor Sanaye is not asking us to stop learning or growing. He’s urging us to wake up. To become mindful.</p><ul><li>Who benefits from your work?</li><li>Can you unplug without penalty?</li></ul><p>Move away from metrics like likes, views, and revenue. Focus on meaning, peace, and independence.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ● Create Without Being Watched\n</h3><p>Not every project must be posted, tracked, or monetized. Create for yourself. Build spaces that reflect your pace, not the algorithm's demands.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ● Support Ethical Systems\n</h3><p>Promote and use platforms that share ownership, protect creators, and respect time. Look into cooperatives, open-source tools, and local businesses.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts: Reclaiming Skill from the System</strong></h2><p>Professor Sanaye revealed a difficult truth:</p><blockquote><p>Skill isn’t always power. Sometimes it’s how the system controls you without you realizing it.</p></blockquote><p>We must not stop learning, creating, or dreaming—but we must become more aware of  our talents are being used,  benefits, and  we lose in return.</p><blockquote><p>Skill should help us live better—not just produce more.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s make sure our skills don’t just feed systems. Let’s use them to nourish our lives.</p>","contentLength":6365,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Should You Create Your Own Tools?","url":"https://dev.to/gu1lh3rm3_x/should-you-create-your-own-tools-2np","date":1751491800,"author":"gu1lh3rm3_x","guid":181317,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As developers, engineers, or hackers, we often find ourselves surrounded by a vast array of existing tools.

This includes metrics, logs, and distributed traces. In other words, observability isn't just about monitoring whether an app is \"up or down,\" but about understanding how and why it behaves the way it does.</p><p>Imagine your system is like an airplane in flight. You can't open it to see what's going on inside, but you have instruments: altimeter, speedometer, temperature sensors, etc. The same is true of modern software: it's often in production, far from the development environment, and we need those tools to \"see inside\" without touching anything.</p><p>Observability practices are the set of strategies, tools, and conventions that allow us to systematically collect, structure, and analyze that information. These practices typically include:</p><ul><li>Code instrumentation to generate metrics (such as the number of requests per second)</li><li>Configuring detailed logs with different levels (info, warn, error, etc.)</li><li>Distributed tracing across services to follow a request from start to finish</li></ul><p>An observable application is one that, in the event of any failure, degradation, or unusual behavior, provides the necessary signals to detect, understand, and resolve the problem, without the need for guesswork or invasive testing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is observability for?\n</h2><p>Observability isn't just useful in emergencies: it's essential for operating modern software reliably, especially in distributed systems, microservices, and platforms that scale to thousands of users per minute.</p><p>Its main functions include:</p><ul><li>Detecting errors or unexpected behavior in real time: for example, sudden drops in traffic, latency spikes, or database connection errors.</li><li>Measuring the performance of critical functions: identifying which parts of the system consume the most resources, take longer, or execute abnormally frequently.</li><li>Generating automatic alerts when something goes wrong: integrating with systems like Grafana, Datadog, or Prometheus AlertManager to react before users notice.</li><li>Analyzing trends and usage patterns: allowing you to anticipate bottlenecks, prepare for scalability, or plan infrastructure changes.</li><li>Facilitate debugging in production: without the need to replicate scenarios locally or disrupt the system, since observability gives us a clear map of the flow and state of the running system.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What problems does it help solve?\n</h2><p>Let's take a concrete example: an order processing microservice in an online store. It works perfectly in development, passes all tests, and is deployed to production. Everything seems fine... until:</p><ul><li>The response time becomes slow at certain times.</li><li>Some orders aren't processed correctly.</li><li>Performance metrics start to fluctuate without explanation.</li></ul><p>Without observability, it would be impossible to know what's going on. We'd only see users complaining or some orders not arriving, without knowing where the fault lies.</p><p>With good observability practices, we could:</p><ul><li>Know how many orders are processed per minute or per hour</li><li>Detect how many fail and with what exact frequency</li><li>Visualize how long each order takes on average, and when that duration spikes</li><li>Correlate events (such as errors or load spikes) with recent changes or external conditions</li><li>Have exact traceability between services in a microservices architecture</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Simple Practical Example: Observability in Python with Prometheus\n</h2><p>We created a small Python service that simulates order processing and exposes custom metrics through Prometheus.</p><ol><li>Metrics: prometheus_client</li><li>Automation: GitHub Actions</li><li>Repository: Public GitHub</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  What does the program do?\n</h2><p>Processes orders every second (simulated)</p><ul><li>order_processing_duration_seconds</li></ul><p><strong>Metrics view in the browser</strong></p><p>Observability is no longer a luxury or a technical \"plus\": today, it is a fundamental necessity in the development and operation of modern systems. In times of increasingly distributed architectures, higher user demands, and more costly errors, having visibility into the real state of the system is key to ensuring software quality, scalability, and reliability.\nThis small project demonstrates that even with basic tools like Python and Prometheus, effective observability practices can be implemented: capturing custom metrics, analyzing them in real time, and automating processes through GitHub Actions. No complex or expensive infrastructure is required to get started.<p>\nFurthermore, observability not only helps resolve problems when they occur, but also allows for preventing them, making informed decisions, and learning from system behavior in production. Ultimately, it is a tool for knowledge, continuous improvement, and technological maturity.</p></p>","contentLength":4751,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Memory Leak Terminator How Type Safety Saved My Graduation Project（1751491656275300）","url":"https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/memory-leak-terminator-how-type-safety-saved-my-graduation-project1751491656275300-5004","date":1751491657,"author":"member_35db4d53","guid":181314,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

But soon!</li><li>Overhauled colouring within the game using a Theme manager to eventually cater different eye conditions and preferences. Accessibility isn't hard to at least think about early.</li><li>Overhauled the grid, no more .png. generated at runtime. Opens up a whole bunch of potential and control. As well as it had to be done to work with the Theme manager.</li><li>Attempted to animate it.. but it's shit, so bad..</li><li>Added in menu music. Will eventually get the same kind of treatment as the themes.

This started as needing to change the buttons style across the entire game but also the theme manager. I now simply have a prefab with a primary/secondary/tertiary type which colours the buttons associated with theme.</li><li>ok animation is actually alright now</li><li>Found a great plugin for unity to parse the hierarchy into xml so it's easier to parse by llms. This is a big win!! the main problems with llm's and unity code is they can't see the editor. They haven't a clue what's up so they do the llm thing, make bullshit up</li></ul><ul><li>Should probably create a prefab for panels.

This means key areas such as secure payment flows, data protection, and audit trail validation can be overlooked. The result? Costly fines, failed audits, and damage to customer trust that can stall business growth.</p><p> Use tailored QA checklists designed specifically for fintech. These checklists focus on regulatory requirements and the unique risks of financial applications. By targeting API security, compliance controls, and transaction accuracy, they shrink blind spots and give leadership confidence that every release meets strict standards.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Manual testing slows down product releases, creating bottlenecks.\n</h3><p> Testing fintech applications manually often takes weeks – delaying new features and forcing teams to scramble last minute.

Without these skills, QA teams may miss critical risks or stretch budgets too thin.</p><p> Partner with QA specialists experienced in financial application testing and compliance. Outsourcing or dedicated QA teams bring fintech domain expertise on demand, reducing overhead while improving testing quality. This allows internal teams to focus on core business while external experts ensure regulatory risks are covered thoroughly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Poor QA leads to hidden bugs, production failures, and legal risk.\n</h3><p> Statista reports that 45% of software failures in financial services result from inadequate testing. Bugs in production not only frustrate customers but can cause serious compliance violations and regulatory fines. Legal trouble and bad press undermine user trust and brand reputation – both costly to rebuild.</p><p> Adopt a comprehensive QA process combining manual testing, automated regression suites, and penetration testing. This multi-layered approach catches bugs early, secures data flows, and validates compliance controls. According to Gartner, companies with mature QA programs reduce expensive production defects by over 40%, saving time and money in the long run.</p><h3><strong>Key QA services that align with regulatory-heavy fintech QA needs</strong></h3><ul><li> Ensures secure, reliable data exchange between services and external systems – crucial for banking and payment workflows.</li><li><strong>Automated regression testing:</strong> Quickly validates that new updates don’t break existing compliance or functionality, keeping your checklist evergreen.</li><li> Identifies security weaknesses in apps, protecting sensitive financial data and customer transactions from attacks.</li></ul><p>These services form the foundation for a QA checklist and process tailored to fintech’s regulatory demands, letting you move fast without sacrificing control.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How DeviQA helped a fintech client master regulatory QA\n</h2><p>When Ctrl Wallet, a leading multichain crypto wallet trusted by over 600,000 users, faced challenges with outdated QA processes and growing compliance demands, they turned to DeviQA for a solution that would secure their product’s quality without slowing development.</p><p>Ctrl Wallet’s legacy QA lacked backend automated tests and mobile automation, critical for covering complex blockchain transactions and security-sensitive features.

Here are the key steps to get started:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Identify the regulations you must follow\n</h3><p>Know which rules affect your product – whether it’s PCI DSS for payments, GDPR for data privacy, AML for fraud prevention, or others. Understanding these helps you know what must be tested.</p><p> Start by consulting with your compliance team or legal advisors early to get a clear list of applicable regulations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Map your features to these regulations\n</h3><p>Look at your product’s key functions – payments, user data handling, transaction logs – and connect them to the related rules. This shows where testing is most critical.</p><p> Use flowcharts or diagrams to visually link features to regulatory requirements – this helps spot gaps more easily.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Decide what types of tests you need\n</h3><p>Different tests catch different issues. You’ll likely need functional testing (does it work as expected?), security testing (is the data safe?), performance testing (can it handle loads?), and compliance testing (does it meet legal rules?). \\ Prioritize tests based on risk – focus first on features with the biggest impact on compliance and user security.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Include automation where it makes sense\n</h3><p>Automated tests help you run your checklist faster and more often. Use automation for things like regression testing and API checks to catch problems early and save time. \\ Start automating repetitive, high-value tests first to quickly reduce manual effort and speed up feedback.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Keep your checklist up to date\n</h3><p>Regulations change, and so does your product. Regularly review and update your checklist to make sure it stays relevant and effective. \\ Schedule regular review sessions aligned with product releases and regulatory updates to keep testing current.</p><p>If you want to see how a tailored QA checklist and expert testing services can help your team reduce risks and accelerate releases, let’s talk. Schedule a QA audit or consultation with our fintech specialists to find out where your testing can improve – and how to get there faster.</p>","contentLength":9100,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"anyone know an open source insurance management system like cuvva? preferably in react etc..","url":"https://dev.to/mehdii18/anyone-know-an-open-source-insurance-management-system-like-cuvva-preferably-in-react-etc-3ge","date":1751488584,"author":"Mehdii","guid":181228,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Micro-Frontends Explained: Is It Time to Break Up Your Monolith?","url":"https://dev.to/praveen-sripati/micro-frontends-explained-is-it-time-to-break-up-your-monolith-2ccm","date":1751488554,"author":"Praveen Sripati","guid":181227,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Have you heard the buzz? It seems like everyone in the tech world is talking about “micro-frontends.” It’s a term that gets thrown around in team meetings and on tech blogs, often hailed as the future of web development. But what does it actually mean? Is it just hype, or is it a revolutionary approach you should be considering?</p><p>Let’s break it down in simple terms, ditch the complex jargon, and use some visuals to understand why so many are making the switch — and if it’s the right move for you.</p><h2><strong>What is a Monolithic Front-End?</strong></h2><p>Imagine your entire website’s front-end is like one giant, solid block. All the pieces — the user profiles, the product pages, the checkout process — are tightly coupled together in a single codebase.</p><p>This is a . It’s a single, unified codebase for the entire user interface.</p><h2><strong>What is a Micro-Frontend?</strong></h2><p>Now, imagine breaking that giant block into smaller, independent cubes. Each cube is its own mini-application (like the search bar or shopping cart), but they all connect and work together to form the complete structure.</p><p>This is a <strong>micro-frontend architecture</strong>. You’re splitting a large front-end into smaller, manageable pieces.</p><h2><strong>Why Micro-Frontends (The Pros)</strong></h2><p><strong>Faster, Independent Teams:</strong> Small teams can own a specific feature (e.g., the search bar, the shopping cart). They can develop, test, and deploy their feature without waiting for other teams. This means faster updates and innovation.</p><p><strong>Freedom to Choose Technology:</strong> One team can use React, another can use Vue, and a third can use Angular — all within the same application. This allows teams to use the best tool for their specific job and makes it easier to try new technologies.</p><p> As your company grows, you can easily add more teams to work on new features without creating a complex, tangled codebase.</p><p><strong>Improved Fault Isolation:</strong> If one micro-frontend has a bug or fails, it doesn’t take down the entire website. The rest of the application can continue to function.</p><p> Each micro-frontend has a smaller, more focused codebase, making it easier for developers to understand, maintain, and update.</p><h2><strong>Why You Might Want to Wait (The Cons)</strong></h2><p> You now have multiple codebases, multiple deployment pipelines, and the challenge of making them all work together seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Maintaining a Consistent Look and Feel:</strong> Ensuring that all the different parts of your application look and feel like a single, cohesive product requires strong communication and a shared design system.</p><p><strong>Potential for Larger Bundle Sizes:</strong> If not managed carefully, having multiple frameworks and duplicated dependencies can lead to slower load times for the user.</p><p><strong>More Operational Overhead:</strong> Managing the infrastructure for multiple small applications can be more challenging than for a single large one.</p><p><strong>Consider micro-frontends if:</strong></p><ul><li><p>You have a large, complex application.</p></li><li><p>You have multiple teams that need to work independently.</p></li><li><p>You are struggling with slow development cycles and deployment bottlenecks.</p></li></ul><p><strong>You might want to stick with a monolith if:</strong></p><ul><li><p>You have a small to medium-sized application.</p></li><li><p>You have a small development team.</p></li><li><p>The complexity of managing a distributed system outweighs the benefits for your project.</p></li></ul><p><em>Want to see a random mix of weekend projects, half-baked ideas, and the occasional useful bit of code?

And yes, people all over the world lovingly call it </p><p>But why? What do dinosaurs have to do with operating systems? Why not circuit boards, memory chips, or at least some sort of modern computer graphic?</p><p>Let’s explore the full backstory based on Peter Baer Galvin’s official blog and unpack the deeper symbolic meaning behind those ancient creatures.</p><h2><strong>A Quick Peek Into the Origins</strong></h2><p>The first edition of <em>Operating System Concepts</em> was published way back in . At that time, most textbooks focused on a single operating system. You’d have books just about UNIX, or MS-DOS, or Multics.</p><p>But Silberschatz and his original co-author James Peterson had a different idea: why not write a textbook that taught  of all operating systems, and then compare how different systems implemented those ideas?</p><p>To reflect this innovation, the cover of the first edition showed a bunch of dinosaurs and mammals, each one labeled with the name of a real operating system. For example:</p><ul><li> were giant dinosaurs.</li><li> were small but smart mammals.</li></ul><p>This visual metaphor helped communicate two big things:</p><ol><li> – Just like living creatures, operating systems evolve. Some become extinct, some survive, and some give rise to the next generation.</li><li> – Different OSs compete for dominance, just like species compete for survival.</li></ol><h2><strong>The Visual Evolution of the Cover</strong></h2><p>Each edition of the textbook didn’t just update the technical content, it also updated the cover art to reflect the evolution of the field:</p><h3><strong>Second Edition: Welcome to the Dino-Disco</strong></h3><p>The second edition kept the same creatures but added a disco-style neon look to modernize the design.</p><h3><strong>Third Edition: New Species Appear</strong></h3><p>This edition saw the addition of new operating systems like . These newer OSs were represented by additional mammals or dinos.</p><h3><strong>Fourth &amp; Fifth Editions: Labels Removed</strong></h3><p>The authors decided to remove the labels from the creatures and instead added an explanation and an OS evolution timeline inside the front cover. This change reflected a more abstract and student-driven interpretation.</p><h3><strong>Sixth Edition and Beyond: Minimal and Mature</strong></h3><p>Later editions kept the animal illustrations but removed the timeline. The idea was to keep the metaphor intact while letting students engage with the imagery more freely.</p><h2><strong>What the Dinosaurs Actually Mean</strong></h2><p>So, why keep dinosaurs for so many years? Here are the main reasons:</p><h3><strong>1. Evolution of Technology</strong></h3><p>Operating systems are not static. They develop over time based on new hardware, user needs, and programming paradigms. Just like animals adapt to their environments, OSs evolve or die off.</p><h3><strong>2. OS Wars = Natural Selection</strong></h3><p>Every few years, there’s a new battle: Windows vs. Linux, Android vs. iOS, macOS vs. Windows. These rivalries shape the industry just like natural selection shapes biology.</p><h3><strong>3. Metaphors Make Learning Easier</strong></h3><p>Let’s face it: operating systems are complex. Concepts like paging, threading, or scheduling are not exactly easy to grasp. A visual metaphor like dinosaurs makes the learning process feel more tangible and memorable.</p><p>By now, the dinosaur theme has become a sort of inside joke in the CS community. It’s recognizable, lovable, and has helped the book become a legend in computer science education.</p><p>Here’s a direct quote from him:</p><blockquote><p>\"The critters on the cover indicate both the evolution of operating systems and the ongoing ‘OS wars.’\"</p></blockquote><p>He also mentions that although the covers no longer label each animal, the theme remains consistent: the dynamic, competitive, and ever-evolving world of operating systems.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts: More Than Just Prehistoric Art</strong></h2><p>The dinosaurs on the cover of <em>Operating System Concepts</em> aren’t just for fun. They carry a powerful message:</p><ul><li>OSs are living histories of technological evolution.</li><li>Competition breeds innovation.</li><li>And sometimes, the best way to understand a difficult topic is to turn it into a story about survival, extinction, and adaptation.</li></ul><p>So next time you see that dino-covered textbook on a friend’s desk, or crack it open for an assignment, remember: those dinosaurs are telling the story of computing itself.</p><p><em>Did you enjoy this breakdown?

It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support.</p><p><strong>Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results</strong></p><ul><li> test (single-core):\n\n<ul></ul></li><li> test (10,000 requests, 100 concurrency):\n\n<ul></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Peak Performance: Understated Power</strong></p><p>Performance is a cornerstone for any web framework. In my prior experiences, achieving high performance often came at the cost of development efficiency and code readability, involving convoluted asynchronous logic and manual memory management. This framework, however, managed to strike an artful balance between these aspects.</p><p>Its core philosophy seems to be \"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" Constructed upon an advanced asynchronous non-blocking I/O model and an optimized event loop, it lays a robust foundation for high-performance operations. When I developed a campus forum API to simulate high-concurrency scenarios, it demonstrated a nearly 70% improvement in QPS (Queries Per Second) and reduced the average response time by half compared to a framework I had used previously. For someone keenly focused on user experience, this was a thrilling outcome.</p><p>Its resource management was equally impressive. Throughout stress tests, memory usage remained consistently low, and CPU utilization was stable. This efficiency stems from its intelligent coroutine scheduling and effective memory management strategies. It doesn't chase speed at the expense of stability but rather aims for sustainable high performance. As an architect once wisely noted, \"True performance is sustained composure, not just a momentary burst.\"</p><p><strong>Smooth Experience: Unadulterated Creation</strong></p><p>If performance represents the hard power of a framework, then the development experience is its soft power, directly impacting developer satisfaction and project timelines. This framework excelled in this domain as well.</p><p>Its API design is remarkably concise, intuitive, and expressive, offering a gentle learning curve. As a student, I was able to begin writing functional modules within a matter of hours, relying solely on the official documentation, which was clear, comprehensive, and of high quality. This ease of adoption is a testament to its well-abstracted yet flexible interfaces and a deep understanding of the developer's mindset.</p><p>Modularity and extensibility are thoughtfully designed. It provides elegant, out-of-the-box solutions for common needs such as logging, parameter validation, and authentication. It leverages a powerful macro system, a feature popular in languages that prioritize efficiency, to generate code at compile time. This significantly reduces boilerplate and enhances code reusability. Defining a RESTful API endpoint, for instance, might require only a few lines of code, with the framework adeptly handling routing, request parsing, and response serialization.</p><p>I also appreciated its support for modern web trends, including native WebSocket capabilities. When tasked with building a real-time campus event notification system, its WebSocket module proved to be both easy to integrate and highly performant, facilitating bidirectional communication without the need for additional external libraries. This is a significant advantage for agile development methodologies and maintaining a unified technology stack.</p><p><strong>A Quiet Comparison: Discerning the Truth</strong></p><p>Throughout my studies, I've encountered a multitude of web frameworks. Some boast vast ecosystems, others offer convenient Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), or excel in specific niche areas. However, this \"unsung hero\" impressed me the most with its exceptional balance between raw performance and developer-centric experience.</p><p>For high-concurrency applications, developers often find themselves needing to fine-tune thread pools, integrate message queues, or implement complex caching mechanisms. This framework, with its robust underlying architecture, frequently allows developers to concentrate primarily on business logic. Its speed is a product of sophisticated design, not achieved by sacrificing code elegance.</p><p>While some frameworks are straightforward to begin with, they can become restrictive as projects scale, often leading to bloated and unwieldy codebases. This framework, with its flexible design philosophy and effective use of metaprogramming, consistently offers concise and maintainable solutions, making the code feel more \"alive\" and adaptable.</p><p><strong>Future Outlook: Journeying with Giants</strong></p><p>As a newcomer to the software development industry, I feel fortunate to have discovered such an outstanding framework so early in my journey. It has not only improved my development efficiency but also broadened my technical horizons and deepened my understanding of what constitutes a high-performance application.</p><p>I am aware that the long-term success of any framework heavily relies on its community and ecosystem. Although it may not yet possess the widespread recognition of established industry giants, I firmly believe that its excellent performance, superior development experience, and forward-thinking design will carve out a significant place for it in the web development landscape, potentially even setting new trends.</p><p>My exploration of this framework has only just begun. However, I have a strong sense that this \"unsung hero\" will become an invaluable partner throughout my career. If you are someone who is curious about pushing the boundaries of technology and unwilling to compromise on quality, I encourage you to explore it. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised, just as I was.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive: The Framework's Core \"Secret Sauce\"</strong></p><p>To truly appreciate its efficiency, one must examine its core architecture. It's not merely a superficial wrapper around existing technologies; it embodies a meticulously crafted design. As an experienced architect once stated, \"An excellent system's elegance often stems from a profound understanding and ultimate application of first principles.\"</p><p>This framework is built using Rust. The inherent memory safety and concurrency advantages of Rust provide a solid foundation for developing high-performance applications. The absence of a garbage collector grants developers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, thereby avoiding common performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, Rust's ownership system eliminates many concurrency-related problems at compile time, which offers significant peace of mind when building high-concurrency servers.</p><p>It deeply integrates the Tokio asynchronous runtime. Tokio, being Rust's most mature and widely adopted asynchronous solution, offers powerful non-blocking I/O capabilities. When an operation is waiting for external resources, such as network requests, it yields system resources to other tasks, thereby enhancing overall concurrency. While reading its source code was a challenging endeavor, it revealed an unwavering commitment to maximizing resource utilization and meticulous attention to detail. The design aims for both \"ease of use\" and \"high efficiency.\"</p><p>It also employs coroutines (or lightweight threads) effectively. Each incoming request is treated as an independent execution unit, collaborating efficiently under the asynchronous runtime environment. This model incurs lower context-switching overhead compared to traditional multi-threading approaches and can support a vast number of concurrent connections. This brought to mind concepts from operating systems courses, validating theoretical knowledge with practical application. True \"speed\" often originates from system-level architectural innovation, not solely from algorithmic optimization.</p>","contentLength":7856,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How I Built a Flame Engine MCP Server to Build Flutter Games","url":"https://dev.to/salihgueler/how-i-built-a-flame-engine-mcp-server-to-build-flutter-games-3ea2","date":1751486426,"author":"Muhammed Salih Guler 💙","guid":181148,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Building cross-platform games with Flutter and the <a href=\"https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flame engine</a> offers exciting possibilities, but the learning curve can be steep.

After discussions with Lukas, one of the Flame Engine maintainers, I decided to implement the MCP server in Dart to ensure consistency with the engine's ecosystem. This approach would provide seamless integration for Flame developers.</p><p>While the official MCP website offers tutorials and SDKs, creating a custom MCP server without these tools can be complex. To overcome this challenge, I used the power of AI-assisted development using Amazon Q Developer CLI. This tool significantly improved the development process by providing context-aware coding assistance and access to relevant documentation. In the following sections, we'll explore how Amazon Q Developer CLI helped me with the creation of our Dart-based MCP server, offering a blueprint for integrating AI assistance into your own game development workflow.</p><p>To kick off, open up the Q Developer CLI by writing  to the terminal:</p><p>Next, we'll walk through the process of using Amazon Q Developer CLI to create our Dart-based MCP server for the Flame engine. Follow these steps to implement your own server:</p><ol><li>Copy the contents of the MCP server guide file into the CLI. This file contains essential information about MCP server requirements.</li><li>Describe your specific MCP server requirements. Here's an example prompt:\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>With the provided context, I want to build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server from scratch that provides AI assistants like Claude Desktop and Amazon Q Developer \nwith comprehensive access to Flame game engine documentation and tutorials. The MCP server should be written in Dart and implement the MCP specification (JSON-RPC \nover stdio). It needs two main tools: 'search_documentation' for searching through cached Flame docs, and 'tutorial' for providing step-by-step game development \ntutorials (space shooter, platformer, klondike). The server should read from a local cache directory containing 146+ markdown files downloaded from the \nflame-engine/flame GitHub repository's doc folder. Include proper error handling, absolute path resolution for cross-platform compatibility, and clean \nseparation between the MCP server (read-only operations) and a separate sync script that downloads documentation from GitHub API. The server should support \nboth resource listing ( for Claude Desktop) and tool execution, with proper MCP protocol responses including initialize, tools/list, tools/call, and \nresources/list methods. Make it production-ready with proper logging, documentation, and a build script that compiles everything into a single executable \nthat can be configured in MCP client settings.\n</code></pre></div><p>Allow Amazon Q Developer CLI to generate the server code. Once complete, review the output carefully:</p><ol><li>Examine the overall structure and package imports</li><li>Verify that all requested capabilities are implemented</li><li>Check for Dart-specific best practices and Flame engine compatibility</li></ol><p>To test and validate, you can perform the following tests to ensure your MCP server functions correctly:</p><ol><li>Use different MCP clients to test server responses</li><li>Verify that documentation access works as expected</li><li>Test the search functionality with various queries</li></ol><p><strong>Data and behavior verification:</strong></p><ol><li>Cross-reference server responses with official Flame documentation</li><li>Check for any inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors</li></ol><ol><li>Run Dart analyzer: </li><li>Review generated code for readability and maintainability</li></ol><p>With Amazon Q Developer CLI, we've demonstrated how to rapidly create an MCP server for the Flame engine.

Among those are  and the , essential tools for managing asynchronous programming, implementing iterable interfaces, and optimizing code for performance-critical applications. This comprehensive guide seeks to unravel these advanced concepts, providing exhaustive insights into their mechanics, best practices, and real-world applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Evolution of Asynchronous JavaScript\n</h3><p>Before delving into Generators and the Iterator Protocol, it’s critical to understand the landscape of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Prior to the introduction of Promises and async/await in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), processes often utilized callback functions to manage asynchronous operations. This approach led to callback hell, where the nested nature of callbacks created code that was difficult to read and maintain.</p><p>The  emerged from this milieu, as a standardized way to allow objects to be traversed using a  method. In conjunction with this, the introduction of  offered a syntactically convenient way to implement iterators, encapsulate logic behind stateful iterables, and simplify asynchronous code writing while maintaining readability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  JavaScript Specifications and Generators\n</h3><p>Generators were introduced in ECMAScript 2015, which brought substantial advancements to the language. The key features accompanying this version included block-scoped variable declarations, template strings, and the class syntax. Generators were defined with the goal of facilitating state management in functions, enabling developers to pause and resume execution at will.</p><p>In JavaScript, a generator is a function that can be exited and later re-entered. The  syntax denotes a generator function. Inside a generator function, the  keyword is used to pause the function's execution and return a value to its caller.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Generator Functions: Key Characteristics\n</h3><ol><li>: The state of a generator function is preserved between calls, allowing it to return to the point of the last .</li><li>: Generators compute their values on the fly, which can optimize performance and memory usage.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Understanding , , and </h3><p>Generators expose three fundamental methods:</p><ul><li>: Resumes execution until it encounters the next .</li><li>: Exits the generator, returning a final value, and stops further execution.</li><li>: Catches exceptions within the generator.</li></ul><p>Example with  and :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Defining the Iterator Protocol\n</h3><p>The Iterator Protocol allows JavaScript objects to create an iterator by implementing a  method, defining how an object can be iterated. An iterator adheres to the following structure:</p><ol><li>It must implement a  method that returns an object with two properties:\n\n<ul><li>: The current value of the iteration.</li><li>: A boolean indicating if the iteration has completed.</li></ul></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating a Custom Iterable Object\n</h3><p>To make an object iterable, define a method that returns the iterator. The default iteration method for modern JavaScript is .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Complex Use Cases and Scenarios\n</h2><p>Introduced in ECMAScript 2018, asynchronous generators offer the ability to yield values asynchronously using the  keyword.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This pattern simplifies the chaining of asynchronous operations, fostering clear and maintainable code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Iterators for Custom Collections\n</h3><p>Consider a scenario where we create a custom data structure — a simple tree. We can implement an iterator to traverse this tree using a depth-first search algorithm.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance Considerations\n</h3><p>Generators and iterators are often more efficient than alternative patterns such as callback-heavy implementations, especially when dealing with large data sets or long-running processes. They can help manage memory by yielding results only when needed.</p><ul><li>: Since values are computed on demand, they minimize memory overhead.</li><li>: After a generator’s execution completes, JavaScript can reclaim all memory used by that invocation, assuming no references to the generator state persist.</li></ul><ol><li><p>: Errors thrown inside a generator must be appropriately managed, as failing to do so can result in unhandled exceptions.</p></li><li><p>: Carelessly defined yield logic can lead to infinite loops. Robust checking within generator functions is crucial to prevent unintended infinite states.</p></li></ol><ol><li>: Utilize console logging to monitor yield status and value transitions.</li><li>: Call  to halt execution at critical junctions, allowing inspection of states and variable values.</li><li><strong>Integration with Async Tools</strong>: Leverage existing tools such as  along with error handling strategies like  to encapsulate and manage potential async barriers.</li></ol><p>Performance, readability, and flexibility are crucial components in the development of sophisticated applications. JavaScript's Generators and the Iterator Protocol offer unique benefits that empower developers to write cleaner, more efficient, and more manageable code. By leveraging these features effectively, it’s possible to tackle both simple and complex data structures and asynchronous processes with elegance.</p><p>To further explore the intricacies of JavaScript Generators and Iterators, the following resources may prove invaluable:</p><p>Using this comprehensive guide, senior developers now have a nuanced understanding of generators and the iterator protocol, equipping them with the necessary tools to implement elegant solutions to complex problems.</p>","contentLength":5374,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hexagonal Architecture Implementation（1751485847648100）","url":"https://dev.to/member_6bc7e52c/hexagonal-architecture-implementation1751485847648100-39me","date":1751485849,"author":"member_6bc7e52c","guid":181120,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

But that doesn’t mean they're still the best fit for today’s workloads.</p></blockquote><p>Read replicas have been part of the Postgres toolkit for years. For many teams, they're the default way to offload pressure from the primary database. But as workloads grow and expectations for performance and efficiency increase, the traditional read replica model starts to show its limits.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The limits of traditional replicas\n</h2><p>Postgres replicas work. They’ve helped countless teams move reads off their primary, improve availability, and keep critical workloads running smoothly.</p><p>They’re a proven tool for:</p><ul><li>Offloading read-heavy traffic from the primary</li><li>Providing high availability and failover options</li></ul><p>For many, read replicas are the first step toward scaling a production database.</p><p>But as systems evolve, teams often run into a familiar set of challenges.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Provisioned for peak (and idle a lot)\n</h3><p>Most replicas are sized to handle traffic spikes, but those spikes may only last an hour or two a day. The rest of the time, you're paying for unused capacity. For teams watching cloud spend, that adds up quickly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Tied to the primary instance type\n</h3><p>In many setups, especially with managed services like RDS, replicas must be provisioned to match the size of the primary, even when the workload doesn’t demand it. You end up paying for the full instance, even if your read workload only needs a fraction of that compute.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Slow and inflexible to scale\n</h3><p>Adding a new replica typically means creating a snapshot of the primary, restoring it, and waiting for replication to catch up. For large databases, this process can take significant time. It’s not something you can rely on when traffic spikes unexpectedly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Routing logic gets complicated\n</h3><p>Many teams use tools like PgBouncer or cloud-native proxies for connection pooling, but these solutions don’t handle read/write splitting on their own. Read/write splitting often means using more advanced tools like PgPool, or adding custom logic to the application.</p><p>Load balancing typically requires another layer, such as HAProxy in front of the pooler. It all ends up being a lot to manage just to route read queries.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  One-off scaling is a hassle\n</h3><p>Want to run a report or offload traffic from an internal tool? Traditional replicas don’t make this easy. There’s no lightweight way to scale up for a few hours and then scale back down. You’re locked into the same heavy provisioning process either way.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Operational maintenance never ends\n</h3><p>Even once replicas are running, they need attention. Teams monitor health and lag, update configurations, test failovers, and handle edge cases. The effort grows alongside your infrastructure.</p><p>The setup is easy. The ongoing maintenance? That's where it gets messy.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Elastic read replicas without the overhead\n</h2><p>We implemented read scaling in our previous startups, but it never felt like the best use of our time, and maintaining it was always a burden.</p><p>So we built something better.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.springtail.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Springtail</a> provides elastic read replicas for Postgres that scale up or down instantly. There’s no need to change your application or primary database.</p><p>Instead of creating a full copy of your data for each replica, Springtail’s architecture uses a shared data layer across its nodes. This allows it to:</p><ul><li>Spin up new replica nodes in seconds</li><li>Avoid over-provisioning and idle capacity</li><li>Handle routing, balancing, and failover</li></ul><p>You keep your existing Postgres instance.

But where on earth can the result (1, 1) come from?\"</p><p>The short answer is: the Java Memory Model (JMM) — specifically, due to reordering.</p><p>The JMM may instruct your JVM(compiler, JIT compiler) to reorder 'r2 = 1' before 'y = r1' and/or 'x = r2' after 'r1 = 1' for the sake of optimization. This isn't unusual — in fact, the JMM does this all the time.</p><p>You can think about JMM as additional program running behind the scene to determine all possible behaviors for threads in every program written on Java. It is part of the JVM.\nImportantly, these reorderings don’t change the outcome of a single-threaded program. But in multi-threaded code, they can lead to unexpected results — like (1,1) in that case.</p><p><strong>WHEN DOES REORDERING HAPPEN IN JAVA?</strong></p><p>You might now ask:\n“When should I expect instruction reordering in my Java program?”</p><p>There can be a lot of different instructions for reordering. The good news is, you usually don’t need to know exactly where reordering will happen. In most cases, Java developers don't have to worry about low-level optimizations. But if you're working with multi-threaded code, then understanding how to avoid unpredictable behavior is essential. The key is: your program must be correctly synchronized — and we’ll explain what that means.</p><p>Reordering depends on how the Java Memory Model (JMM) is implemented. Different JVM vendors (like Oracle, Amazon Corretto, etc.) may apply their own optimizations. These optimizations often include instruction reordering for better performance. To better understand how reordering and other transformations occur in your specific JVM version, it's important to consult that JVM's official documentation.</p><p>It's often easier to think about what prevents reordering, instead of trying to predict when it will happen. Here's a (not exhaustive) list of things that prevent reordering:</p><p><strong>1. Happens-before edges which brings happens-before relationship for actions in code.</strong></p><p>If there is a happens-before edges(or memory barriers) between two actions, the JVM cannot reorder them. Some key examples:</p><ul><li>\nVolatile variables create half memory barriers:\nAll reads and writes before write to volatile variable in code will never be reordered to occur after write to volatile variable.\nAll reads and writes after read of volatile variable will never occur before the read of volatile variable.</li></ul><p>This creates what’s called a release-acquire pair. For example, if r1 and r2 in the earlier example above were declared volatile, then the instructions involving them would not be reordered — and the result (1, 1) would never occur.\nWhy not use volatile on x and y instead? That could help avoid (1,1) too — but it wouldn't solve the visibility problem for r1 and r2. Still, it’s not a major issue in this small example.</p><ul><li><u>Circular data dependency (circular causality)</u>\nJava prohibits out-of-thin-air values. That means if variables in code depend on each other in a circular way, the JVM won’t make up values that magically satisfy the dependency.</li></ul><p>Example — this code will never result in r1 == 42 or r2 == 42:</p><div><pre><code>int x, y;\nint r1, r2;\n\npublic void thread1() {\n    r1 = x;\n    if (r1 != 0)\n        y = 42;\n}\n\npublic void thread2() {\n    r2 = y;\n    if (r2 != 0)\n        x = 42;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Here, y = 42 only happens if r1 != 0, which requires x == 42, which depends on r2 != 0, which depends on y == 42 again. It’s a loop — a circular dependency. The JMM avoids reordering in such cases because it would lead to results that are impossible in single-threaded execution(intra-thread semantic) in Java.</p><p>If a thread is stuck in an infinite loop, any actions after the loop will not be moved before it.</p><div><pre><code>volatile int x, y;\nint r1, r2;\n\npublic void thread1() {\n    do {\n        r1 = x;\n    } while (r1 == 0);\n    y = 42;\n}\n\npublic void thread2() {\n    do {\n        r2 = y;\n    } while (r2 == 0);\n    x = 42;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Here, both threads will loop forever, and because the loops may never exit, the JVM can’t reorder actions before the loops.</p><p>The access is write to or read of variable. Two accesses to the same shared variable or array element are said to be conflicting if at least one of the accesses is a write. Reordering is not allowed if there is conflicting accesses to the same shared variable.</p><div><pre><code>int x, y;\nint r1, r2;\n\npublic void thread1() {\n    r1 = x;\n    if (r1 != 0)\n        y = 42;\n}\n\npublic void thread2() {\n    r2 = y;\n    if (r2 != 0)\n        x = 42;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Here, in method thread1, there's both a read and a write to r1. It is conflicting accesses. The JVM won’t reorder r1 = x to after the if block because that would break the logic. The same is for 'thread2' and 'r2'.</p><p><strong>4. Synchronization actions and external actions</strong></p><p>Certain operations are never reordered:<em>Synchronization actions, such as</em>\n -Reading/writing a volatile variable<p>\n -Locking and unlocking monitors (e.g., synchronized blocks)</p>\n -Thread start and join (Thread.start(), Thread.join())<p>\n -The start and end of a thread (even if not represented by a method)</p>\n -Printing to the console\n -Network operations, etc.</p><p>For example, the following code will always print \"Hello\" before \"World\":</p><div><pre><code>public void thread1() {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n    System.out.println(\"World\");\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Printing is external to the program’s internal state, it's observable — and must respect order.</p><p><strong>5. Single-thread logic(intra-thread semantic) prevents reordering</strong></p><p>Even without synchronization, if reordering would change the behavior in a single-threaded program and JMM detects it, then it’s not allowed.\nThis is part of what makes reasoning about Java code easier: actions within the same thread will appear to happen in the order they are written, as long as that’s required for correct behavior.</p><p>Compilers, virtual machines, and even processors often optimize your code to make it run faster on specific hardware. These optimizations involve transformations like instruction reordering, removing redundant synchronization (for example, when two variables point to the same underlying value), speculative execution (which may lead to so-called \"out-of-thin-air\" values), and more. The Java Memory Model (JMM) decides which transformations can safely be applied to your Java program.</p><p>The concept of a memory model isn’t unique to Java. Every programming language that supports multithreading needs a memory model — a set of rules that define how operations in different threads interact through memory. Memory models are typically designed to be both easy for developers to use and flexible for system designers. But what do we mean by \"easy to use\" and \"flexible\"?</p><p>Imagine a multithreaded Java program where no unexpected behavior could ever occur — no data races, no reordering, and everything always runs exactly in the order it appears in the code. You wouldn’t have to worry about using volatile, synchronized, AtomicInteger, or any of the usual concurrency tools. The JMM would automatically apply the correct synchronization, and your program would behave exactly as written. This would definitely make it easier to write multithreaded code — and that’s what we mean by \"easy to use.\"</p><p>However, such a memory model comes with serious downsides. First, it’s difficult to implement correctly. (Although some models like this do exist) More importantly, this kind of strict ordering — called sequential consistency — would prevent most performance optimizations, making your programs significantly slower.</p><p>Now, consider the opposite extreme: a model that allows all possible optimizations (including unsafe ones like out-of-thin-air values). In this case, the code could be extremely fast, but tools like volatile, synchronized, or AtomicInteger might not be enough to ensure correct behavior. You’d have performance, but at the cost of predictability and correctness.</p><p>In this context, \"flexibility\" refers to how many transformations the memory model allows. The more it allows, the more flexible (and potentially faster) the model is — but also harder for developers to reason about.</p><p>That’s why the JMM tries to strike a balance. It aims to allow useful optimizations without making the programmer's life too difficult. In other words, it tries to balance simplicity for developers with flexibility for system designers — making everyone as happy as possible.</p><p>The Java Memory Model (JMM) provides two main guarantees (which are also its core requirements):</p><p><strong>1. Sequentially consistent execution for correctly synchronized programs</strong>\nIf your code is correctly synchronized (e.g., using synchronize block, volatile, AtomicInteger, etc.), it will execute in a predictable and consistent order — just like it appears in your code. There will be no data races, and the program will behave exactly as you expect.</p><p><strong>2. Clear behavior for incorrectly synchronized programs</strong>\nIf the program is not correctly synchronized, then issues like data races, reordering, and other inconsistencies may occur — but not all possible transformations will be allowed. JMM still restricts the worst behaviors.</p><p>The first guarantee is especially important for developers because it tells us how to write multithreaded programs that behave correctly.\nThe second guarantee is more about how the memory model internally manages optimizations — and it varies across different memory models. We won’t go into those technical details here.(again refer to your specific version JVM's documentation for further details about this behavior)</p><p><strong>Two Key Parts of the Java Memory Model</strong>\nThere are two main parts of the JMM that help ensure sequentially consistent behavior in correctly synchronized programs:</p><ol><li>Happens-Before Consistency</li></ol><p>Let’s look at them more closely.</p><p><strong>1. Happens-Before Consistency</strong>\nThis is a simplified way to understand the behavior of the JMM. It describes how actions (like reads and writes) must relate to one another to be considered correct.</p><p><strong>Key rules of the happens-before model</strong></p><p>Synchronization Order:\nThere is a specific order in which synchronization actions (like locking and unlocking) must happen. For example, in a synchronized block, the lock must happen before the unlock.<p>\nThis creates a “happens-before” relationship. The JMM guarantees that this relationship is preserved. These synchronization points are known as synchronization actions (you can see the full list in JLS §17.4.2).</p></p><p>Intra-thread Consistency:\nFor a single thread, all actions will happen in the order they appear in code — just like in a regular, single-threaded program.<p>\nThe JMM guarantees that optimizations will not break this order. So, you’ll always see values that make sense based on the written code.</p></p><p>Happens-before consistency (non-volatile):\nFor normal (non-volatile) variables, the JMM ensures that a read will see a write that happened before it, as long as the program respects the happens-before rules.<p>\nThis helps prevent strange behaviors like reading a value that hasn’t been written yet (e.g. “out-of-thin-air” values).</p>\nIf your code is correctly synchronized, this problem will not occur.</p><p>Synchronization order consistency:\nFor volatile variables, there is a special rule: a read will always see the last write to the same variable (according to the synchronization order).<p>\nThis works similarly to the happens-before rule, but is specific to volatile fields.</p></p><p>In short if every read in your program sees a write that happened before it (in terms of execution, not necessarily source code), your program is considered happens-before consistent.</p><p>But here's a tricky part, the phrase “happened before” refers to the actual execution order, not the source code order. So, even if something appears later in the code, it may run earlier due to reordering.</p><div><pre><code>int a = 0;\na = 2;\nint b = a;\n</code></pre></div><p>You might expect b to be 2, but it’s possible for a = 2 to be executed after b = a due to reordering. So, b could be 0.\nEven though it’s not what you expected, it still follows happens-before rules because 'a' had a default value of 0 written before and read action would see that 0.</p><p>That said, the happens-before model does not prevent some problematic behaviors — especially out-of-thin-air values. That’s where the second part - causality requirements - comes in.</p><p><strong>2. Causality Requirements</strong></p><p>Causality is a more complex part of the memory model and mostly relevant to language designers and compiler writers — not everyday developers.</p><p>Let’s try to explain it simply.</p><p>The causality requirements are rules the JMM uses to decide if a certain execution is legal. Each program execution can be broken into a set of actions: reads, writes, locks, unlocks, etc. The JMM checks the order of these actions and whether they make sense based on its rules.</p><p>If the execution order doesn’t break any rules, it’s - allowed.\nIf it violates causality rules, the JMM may reorder the actions or reject the execution. If no valid ordering is possible, it could result in a runtime or compile-time error (in theory).</p><p>You don’t need to know every detail of causality unless you’re building your own memory model.</p><p>Just remember this simple idea. Causality requirements prevent illegal executions where a read sees a write that never actually happened before it in program order.</p><p>The JMM provides a strong guarantee:\nIf your program is correctly synchronized, it will behave in a sequentially consistent way.</p><p>That means:\nEvery read will see the last write. <p>\nThe order of actions is predictable and consistent.</p></p><p>Java provides many tools to help ensure correct synchronization, like:\nsynchronized blocks\natomic classes from java.util.concurrent.atomic and more</p><p>These tools help your program follow the happens-before order, and when used properly, your program will run safely and predictably.</p><p>The rest — causality, reorderings, out-of-thin-air values — are mostly concerns for JVM designers and compiler engineers.</p>","contentLength":15022,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Commercial VPN vs Private VPN in the Cloud: 5 Advantages of Having Control Over Your Security","url":"https://dev.to/letscloud/commercial-vpn-vs-private-vpn-in-the-cloud-5-advantages-of-having-control-over-your-security-2hed","date":1751485693,"author":"LetsCloud Team","guid":181142,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In an era where every click can be a risk, digital security has evolved from a luxury into a necessity. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have emerged as the most popular solution for protecting online privacy. Millions of individuals and companies subscribe to commercial VPN services in search of a digital shield.</p><p>However, for businesses and professionals who take security and performance seriously, relying on a third-party service presents a dilemma: are you truly in control?</p><p>The answer for those seeking maximum efficiency, security, and sovereignty is to build their own digital fortress. A private VPN, hosted on a cloud infrastructure like LetsCloud, is not just an alternative—it’s the natural evolution for a mature digital operation.</p><p>Here are 5 strategic advantages that explain why smart companies are making this transition.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Absolute Security and Data Sovereignty\n</h2><p>When using a commercial VPN, you entrust your data to a company operating under a privacy policy that can be complex and, at times, ambiguous. The promise of a “no-logs policy” depends entirely on trust.</p><p>With a private VPN on LetsCloud, that doubt is eliminated. You have <strong>total sovereignty over your data</strong>. Your instance, your rules. This is fundamental for compliance with regulations like GDPR and other data protection laws, as it ensures your company and customer data travels through an infrastructure that you manage and in a geographic location that you choose.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Superior Performance and Reliability\n</h2><p>Popular VPN services frequently suffer from overcrowding. Their servers are shared by thousands of users simultaneously, which can cause slowdowns, high latency, and instability, especially during peak hours. It’s like being stuck in traffic on a public highway.</p><p>A private VPN is your exclusive expressway. The resources of your LetsCloud instance are dedicated to your operation, ensuring a high-speed, low-latency, and, most importantly, a stable and predictable connection for your video conferences, file transfers, and access to critical systems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Predictable and Optimized Costs (TCO)\n</h2><p>The per-user subscription model of commercial VPNs may seem cheap at first, but the costs multiply quickly as your team grows. This expense becomes unpredictable and difficult to scale.</p><p>Hosting your own VPN on LetsCloud transforms this variable cost into a fixed and transparent operational expense (OpEx). A single, low-cost instance can serve dozens of employees, resulting in a significantly lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and a much easier-to-manage IT budget.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Strategic Flexibility for Your Business\n</h2><p>Commercial VPNs offer a generic solution. A private VPN offers a customizable business tool. With your instance on LetsCloud, you can:</p><ul><li><p> Essential for accessing corporate networks, partner APIs, and services that require IP-based authorization (whitelisting).</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose the Geographic Location:</strong> Position your internet access point exactly where you need it to optimize latency or access specific markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrate with Other Services:</strong> Your VPN can become part of a larger cloud architecture, securely connecting to other servers and applications you host with us.</p></li></ul><p>Perhaps the biggest myth about private VPNs is that they are complex to set up. In the past, this may have been true. Today, the reality is different.</p><p>Thanks to modern and lightweight protocols like WireGuard® and the simplicity of cloud platforms like LetsCloud, the installation process has been drastically simplified. What once required a networking specialist can now be done in minutes through automated processes.</p><p>The Next Step Towards Digital Autonomy</p><p>The choice between a commercial and a private VPN is a decision about control, performance, and security. By opting for a private solution on LetsCloud, you are not just adopting superior technology; you are investing in a solid and sovereign foundation for your business’s digital future.</p><p>Convinced of the advantages?

It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience.

Discovering : A Thoughtfully Designed Abstraction\n</h2><p>My initial foray into writing route functions with Hyperlane introduced me to its  (or ). I was immediately struck by its design. I remember when I first needed to retrieve the request method. In more conventional Rust HTTP frameworks, the code would typically look like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Hyperlane, however, streamlines this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This approach is akin to a well-organized backpack; the framework has systematically renamed subfields of requests and responses. For example, setting the response status code transformed from  to . While this adds a few characters, it significantly clarifies the code's logic, making it as easy to follow as a flowchart. I no longer found myself constantly consulting documentation to understand the method hierarchy.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  II. Route Macros: A Welcome Convenience\n</h2><p>The request method macros were a real game-changer for me. While developing the homepage route, I experimented with the  combined annotation. This proved to be much more straightforward than declaring each enum value separately. I later found I could simplify it even further to . Suddenly, writing routes felt as intuitive as composing Markdown:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>On one occasion, a teammate mistakenly typed  instead of . The framework responded with a helpful error message, a stark contrast to some frameworks that merely throw a cryptic compilation error. Hyperlane's beginner-friendly nature is truly commendable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  III. The Middleware Onion Model: Unpacking Request Processing\n</h2><p>Working on user authentication provided my first real insight into the elegance of the middleware onion model. I sketched a flowchart based on the documentation (my Mermaid diagramming skills were still developing) and understood how a request navigates from the outer layers of the onion inward:</p><div><pre><code>graph TD\n    A[Client Request] --&gt; B[Authentication Middleware]\n    B --&gt; C[Logging Middleware]\n    C --&gt; D[Controller]\n    D --&gt; E[Response Formatting Middleware]\n    E --&gt; F[Client Response]\n</code></pre></div><p>I implemented a JWT verification middleware. If an invalid token is detected, I can simply use  to halt further processing. This \"short-circuit\" capability is far more efficient than duplicating verification logic in every route. I recall an instance where, to debug middleware sequencing, I intentionally placed the logging middleware after authentication. The request logs subsequently filled with authentication errors, underscoring the strictness of middleware order, much like the layers of an onion.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  IV. WebSocket Support: Effortless Real-Time Chat\n</h2><p>The most demanding aspect of the project was implementing the real-time chat feature. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane’s WebSocket lifecycle is very clearly defined. The documentation's flowchart illustrates the process:</p><div><pre><code>graph TD\n    A[Client Connection] --&gt; Z[Pre-upgrade Processing]\n    Z --&gt; Y[WebSocket Handshake]\n    Y --&gt; X[Connection Established Callback]\n    X --&gt; B[Middleware Processing]\n    B --&gt; C[Message Handling Controller]\n    C --&gt; D[Response Handling]\n</code></pre></div><p>I managed to complete the WebSocket module in a single evening. The  method, in particular, allows for gracefully closing the connection when a user leaves the chat. During testing, I observed that even with 100 users chatting concurrently, server resource consumption remained stable. A roommate had previously developed a similar feature in Node.js, which crashed under a 50-person test. This comparison was a significant confidence booster.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  V. Dynamic Routing: The Fun of Regex in Parameters\n</h2><p>When developing the product detail page route, I made use of dynamic parameters. The standard route  is straightforward, but when I needed to restrict the parameter to numerical values, I discovered I could write:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This regex-based parameter matching reminded me of a Regex assignment from class. However, the framework conveniently encapsulates the complex parsing. Once, I mistakenly wrote the regex as . Instead of a server error, the framework returned a 404. I later learned this is part of its route error handling mechanism, and the attention to detail is truly impressive.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  VI. Performance Testing: Outperforming Gin?!\n</h2><p>Before the final course presentation, I ran a performance test using  with the command:</p><div><pre><code>wrk  http://127.0.0.1:6000/\n</code></pre></div><p>The results were astonishing: Hyperlane’s QPS exceeded 320,000, nearly 30% faster than an identical interface my roommate had built using Gin! While slightly slower than the underlying Tokio library, this level of performance from an upper-layer framework is more than adequate to support thousands of students using the platform simultaneously. During the presentation, when the instructor saw this data, he inquired if I had secretly optimized the server. In reality, I had simply run it with the default configuration from the documentation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  VII. From Challenges to Appreciation: A Rust Framework's Evolution\n</h2><p>In my early days with Hyperlane, I encountered a few hurdles. For instance, in versions prior to v4.0.0, the execution order of synchronous routes and asynchronous middleware led to a lengthy debugging session. Another time, I forgot to call  in the WebSocket processing, which prevented messages from being sent. However, each time I consulted the documentation, I found clear version descriptions. The lifecycle evolution chart, in particular, vividly illustrates the changes from v3.0.0 to v5.25.1:</p><ul><li>After v4.22.0,  can interrupt requests, much like a \"pause\" feature in a game.</li><li> in v5.25.1 allows for actively closing connections, resolving a long-connection resource leakage issue I had previously faced.</li></ul><p>Now, the project is deployed on the university server, handling hundreds of transactions daily, and Hyperlane has consistently performed reliably. As a newcomer transitioning from C++ to Rust, I genuinely feel that this framework strikes an excellent balance between performance and ease of use. It is particularly welcoming to student developers—the example code in the documentation can be readily copied and used, unlike some frameworks that require a significant time investment to understand their architecture before getting started.</p><p>If you're also undertaking a Rust Web project, I wholeheartedly recommend giving Hyperlane a try. The experience of writing code that feels like assembling building blocks truly makes programming an enjoyable endeavor.</p><p>I noticed a mention of the URL ().

From open detection to custom analytics dashboards — build an intelligent email system from scratch.</p><p>Understanding whether and when your users open your emails can significantly enhance choices, maximize communication strategy, and promote product development.\nSendGrid's Event Webhooks provide a reliable method for gathering data on email events in real time, such as delivery status, open events, clicks, bounces, and more. We will go into great detail in this extended article on how to utilize SendGrid to track email openings, handle those events on your server, associate them with certain users or transactions, and create a responsive user interface dashboard to see how well emails are performing. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ✨ Why SendGrid Webhooks Matter in SaaS and Tech Workflows\n</h2><p>Suppose you’re managing a SaaS product. Every day, your system sends out multiple types of emails:</p><ul><li>✅ Account activation confirmations\n</li><li>⏳ Trial expiration reminders\n</li><li>🚀 New feature announcements\n</li><li>💳 Subscription payment confirmations\n</li></ul><p>Each of these emails plays a vital role in the user journey. But here’s the real question:</p><p><strong>How do you know if your users are actually engaging with those emails?</strong></p><p>This is where <strong>SendGrid’s Event Webhooks</strong> come into play.</p><p>With SendGrid Webhooks, you gain access to  about every email event:</p><ul><li> How soon after delivery was it opened?\n</li><li> Was it accessed via mobile or desktop?\n</li><li> Did it bounce or go ignored?</li></ul><p>By collecting and analyzing this data, you can:</p><ul><li>📉 Identify inactive or disengaged users\n</li><li>🔁 Resend unengaged emails or try alternate channels\n</li><li>🧪 A/B test subject lines, timing, or templates\n</li><li>📊 Share insights with customer success or sales teams\n</li></ul><p>**📁 Step 1: Configure Your Server as a Webhook Endpoint\nBuilding a server endpoint that can receive HTTP POST requests from SendGrid when events take place is the first step.<p>\nHere's a solid example if you're using Node.js with Express: </p></p><ul><li>Handles bulk event arrays (multiple events per POST)</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Configure SendGrid to Deliver Events\n</h2><ol><li>Login to your SendGrid account.\n</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Mail Settings &gt; Event Webhook</strong>.\n</li><li>Add your webhook endpoint URL (e.g. <code>https://yourdomain.com/api/email-events</code>).\n</li><li>Select the following events:\n\n<ul></ul></li></ol><p>SendGrid will now start sending HTTP POST requests with JSON data every time these events happen.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ## Step 3: Understand and Parse the Event Payload\n</h2><p>Each email event from SendGrid contains detailed metadata. Here’s an example of an open event:</p><ul><li>Identify which user opened the email (using sg_message_id)</li><li>Record the time of opening (convert timestamp to readable format)</li><li>Optionally record IP or device/browser info</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Relating Email Events to User Records\n</h2><p>A is included in the response when sending an email using SendGrid (often over an API). Together with your internal user or email record, this ID must be kept in your database.\nA simple send-email example with message tracking is provided here: </p><p>Later, when you receive an event, use the (or custom_args) to match and update that email’s status in your database.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Store and Analyze Event Data\n</h2><p>Every event you receive should be stored in a database table. A suggested schema:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead></table></div><p>Having historical event logs allows you to:</p><ul><li>📊 Track user-level engagement\n</li><li>📈 View email performance over time\n</li><li>🛠️ Audit deliverability issues\n</li><li>📌 Generate user-level analytics\n</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Build a Visual Dashboard\n</h2><p>Events are now being received and stored by your backend, providing you to see them in your admin user interface. Create an interactive dashboard that displays the following, for example, with Chart.js or React + TailwindCSS:</p><ul><li>Email statuses for each user (sent, opened, bounced)</li><li>Campaign-specific open rate</li><li>Date range, message type, and user segment filters</li><li>Opens' geolocation maps (based on IP)\nCharts for devices and browsers\nFor marketing teams, product managers, and developers working on growth or retention, this type of statistics is important. </li></ul><p>Tracking email opens using SendGrid is more than just knowing if a message was read. It’s about building a complete feedback loop between your communication and user behavior. By setting up real-time event tracking, mapping events to users, storing insights in your database, and visualizing them —\nThis setup is ideal for SaaS products, e-commerce platforms, internal tools, and anyone who relies on high-performance email communication.

With a decent level of experience, I figured I could move fast: define a high-level plan, get help refining it, and dive straight into implementation.</p><p>To speed things up, I shared my initial ideas—workflow, database schema, and API routes—with GPT, got a refined version, and started building based on that.</p><p>In hindsight, this approach taught me a lesson I didn’t expect to learn at this stage of my career: <strong>no matter how experienced you are, skipping proper planning will come back to haunt you.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Where Things Started to Fall Apart\n</h2><p>After jumping into implementation, I began to realize that the schema I was working with had . Things looked good at first glance, but I hadn’t accounted for:</p><ul><li>Data integrity constraints</li><li>API request/response inconsistencies</li><li>System-wide failure handling</li></ul><p>As I began to handle these situations, I needed to <strong>redesign the schema multiple times</strong>, and every time I did, it started breaking the previously built routes and services. I was using  to test the APIs, and it became clear that things weren’t as stable as I thought.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Domino Effect of Midway Changes\n</h2><p>Once the BFF (Backend for Frontend) layer was complete, I moved on to building the frontend. That’s when I hit another wall.</p><p>New frontend requirements led to additional changes in the schema and logic, which again caused issues in the routes and services I had already implemented. The <strong>lack of a stable contract</strong> between services and layers became a real bottleneck.</p><p>The deeper I went, the more everything started feeling like a Jenga tower—one change, and things would start to collapse.</p><p>This experience forced me to take a step back and reflect. Here's what I took away from this:</p><ul><li>🧠 <strong>Plan extensively before implementation</strong>: Even if it delays coding by a week, it's worth it.</li><li>🧩 <strong>Model your schema based on actual business logic</strong>, not assumptions or third-party suggestions.</li><li>🔄 <strong>Version and document your APIs early</strong> to prevent regression from breaking existing services.</li><li>🧪  against use cases before committing to it—mock flows, simulate errors, think long-term.</li><li>🛑 <strong>Don’t depend entirely on tools (or even AI) for architectural decisions</strong>—they're great support systems, not decision-makers.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Role of an SDE II Isn't Just to Build—It's to Architect\n</h2><p>At the SDE II level, you're expected to think beyond writing clean code. You're responsible for:</p><ul><li>Long-term maintainability</li><li>Collaboration between services</li><li>Ensuring that your implementation scales with the product</li></ul><p>This project reminded me that <strong>being effective means slowing down when it matters</strong>. Rushing into code may feel productive at first, but without proper planning, it creates long-term technical debt.</p><p>I still love building things fast, but now I do it differently.</p><ul><li>Spend more time on schema modeling</li><li>Think through edge cases and fallback scenarios</li><li>Collaborate with teammates early to identify potential blockers</li></ul><p>If you're at a similar stage in your engineering journey—or even just starting out—<strong>treat planning as an engineering discipline</strong>. The time you spend upfront will pay off tenfold during implementation.</p><p>Thanks for reading.

We can innovate, collaborate, and create experiences that genuinely connect people. That's precisely the ethos behind what I'm introducing today: vibeconsole.us. Coding together has never been so easy. Imagine this: you, your friends, a shared screen, and your phones instantly transforming into controllers – no downloads, no complex setups, just pure, instant \"vibing.\"</p><p>This is more than just an app; it's a testament to what's possible when we leverage the power of collaborative development tools and intelligent prompt engineering. And speaking of which, this entire project is a submission for the World's Largest Hackathon Writing Challenge: Building with Bolt.</p><p>The Spark: From Lonely Coder to Vibe Creator\nHonestly? The inspiration for Vibe Console came from a very human place: loneliness. Coding is incredibly creative, but it's often a solitary endeavor – just you, a keyboard, and a screen that's way too bright at 2 AM. When Large Language Models (LLMs) started getting truly impressive, a thought struck me: what if coding felt less like typing alone and more like a live jam session or a multi-player gaming night?</p><p>I started imagining a future where you could just... vibe. What if your phone, that device already glued to your hand, could become the ultimate controller to speak commands, sketch ideas, and navigate a shared coding environment? The goal was clear: build something fun, inherently collaborative, and a fantastic excuse to step away from being perpetually hunched over a keyboard.</p><p>What Vibe Console Does: Your Phone, Your Code, Together\nVibe Console transforms any screen into a multiplayer code editor and your phone into the ultimate, multi-modal controller.</p><ul><li>Phone-as-Controller: Forget extra hardware. Join a lobby with a simple code, and your phone instantly becomes a smart, responsive controller.</li><li>Multi Inputs: You're not just typing. Use a D-pad for seamless navigation, a touch canvas for drawing out complex ideas, and your voice for executing commands – all seamlessly sent from your phone.</li><li>Instant Co-op: Getting started is a breeze. Players join a shared session via a simple QR code. The host locks the lobby, everyone picks a cloud editor like Bolt.new or Loveable, and the collaborative coding session begins instantly.</li><li>No \"It Works on My Machine\" Shenanigans: This is perhaps one of the most liberating features. Everyone operates within the same cloud environment. What you see is precisely what they see, eliminating those frustrating \"it works on my machine\" debugging nightmares.\nThe How: Prompt Engineering and a Hybrid Tech Stack</li></ul><p>This project was a high-wire act of modern web technology, and frankly, I'm genuinely surprised it all came together, especially with some initial bugs tied to those pesky token limits! I built it primarily with Bolt.new, and yes, through what I affectionately call \"Vibe Coding\" – a process heavily influenced by prompt engineering.\nThe Prompt Engineering: Limited Tokens, Limitless Potential<p>\nBuilding VibeConsole.us wasn't about spending countless hours sifting through documentation or endlessly debugging boilerplate code. It was about harnessing the power of AI, specifically through prompt engineering, to accelerate development. However, like many who've ventured into the realm of large language models, I quickly hit a familiar wall: limited tokens.</p>\nFor those unfamiliar, imagine having a brilliant co-pilot, but one that can only hear a certain number of words at a time. My initial attempts at prompt engineering were a bit like shouting entire novels at it – ineffective and quickly hitting those token limits. I needed a more nuanced approach, especially given the complexity of building a real-time, multi-user application that bridges web and mobile.<p>\nThe Human Aspect: Discussion Mode with Bolt</p>\nThis is where the \"human aspect\" truly came into play. It wasn't just about my own coding prowess; it was about how I interacted with the AI, transforming a monologue into a genuine dialogue. My solution to the token limitation wasn't to shorten my ideas, but to restructure my prompts and engage in a \"discussion mode\" with Bolt.<p>\nInstead of monolithic prompts attempting to describe an entire feature set, I broke down the development process into smaller, manageable, and highly specific chunks. This allowed me to:</p></p><ul><li>Focus on Core Functionality First: My initial prompts centered on establishing the fundamental connection and the server-client handshake necessary for phone-as-controller functionality.</li><li>Iterate on Specific Components: Once the core was in place, I moved to individual components like UI elements, input handling for a phone, or state management for the server.</li><li>Leverage Follow-Up Questions: This was the true \"discussion mode.\" I'd ask follow-up questions to refine, optimize, or explore edge cases.</li><li>Scenario-Based Prompting: I'd present specific scenarios to guide the AI's understanding of practical implementation details.</li><li>\"What if...?\" and \"How can we improve...?\" Prompts: These open-ended questions were crucial for pushing beyond basic functionality and exploring alternative approaches.\nThis iterative, conversational approach, facilitated by carefully structured prompts, allowed me to bypass the immediate limitations of token counts. It wasn't about providing less information, but about providing the right information at the right time, allowing Bolt to build upon previous responses and refine the solution progressively.\nThe Tech Stack Under the Hood:</li><li>Frontend: The console display and the landing page are a React + TypeScript app, built with Vite and elegantly styled with Tailwind CSS. The multi-stage UI, from the lobby to the editor selection, is expertly handled by react-router-dom and a robust set of stateful components.</li><li>Backend &amp; Real-time DB: We went all-in on Supabase. It forms the backbone of our entire backend, from the PostgreSQL database to user sessions. The database schema is crucial, meticulously tracking sessions, devices, and all player inputs.</li><li>The Magic: Communication Stack: This is where the real fun happened, and admittedly, a significant challenge. We built a sophisticated hybrid system:\n\n<ul><li>Supabase Realtime: This handles all the lobby management. When a new player joins or the host locks the session, Supabase's realtime channels push updates to everyone instantly, ensuring a seamless start.</li><li>WebRTC: For the actual in-game controls, once the lobby is locked, we establish direct peer-to-peer connections using our custom WebRTC hook. All the signaling (offers, answers, candidates) is passed through our Supabase webrtc_signals table, but the crucial control data itself is sent with super low latency directly between browsers.\nChallenges: Navigating the High-Wire Act\nLet's be real, this was ambitious for a hackathon. Our biggest challenge by far was the communication stack. Juggling WebRTC for its raw speed and Supabase for its reliability was a complex puzzle. I had to architect a robust WebRTCManager that could skillfully handle failed connections and fall back gracefully, ensuring the user never experiences a hiccup in their \"vibe.\"\nAnother significant headache was designing the InputRouter. It needed to seamlessly process events from both WebRTC messages (our primary, low-latency channel) and our Supabase device_inputs table (our crucial fallback) and treat them identically. My migration is a testament to the realization, halfway through, that I absolutely needed to add 'voice' and 'canvas' as valid input types to truly achieve the multi-modal dream!\nFinally, getting the Supabase Row Level Security policies just right took a lot of trial and error. It needed to be absolutely bulletproof to protect session data, but also flexible enough to allow for that dead-simple, anonymous \"jump-in-and-play\" experience. Balancing security with frictionless onboarding was a delicate dance.\nAccomplishments and Lessons Learned\nI'm incredibly proud of several aspects of Vibe Console. The seamless flow from the landing page to the actual editor is something I put a lot of thought into. The state management in ConsoleDisplay.tsx and PhoneController.tsx to handle all the different stages (joining, waiting, selecting, playing) truly came together beautifully. It just works, and that's incredibly satisfying.\nAnd honestly, the hybrid WebRTC + Supabase architecture. It feels like I picked the absolute right tool for every single job, and the result is an app that's both powerful in its real-time capabilities and remarkably resilient in its operation.\nThe biggest lesson I took away from this entire build is that the future of interfaces is undeniably multi-mode. A keyboard is a fantastic tool, but combining it with voice, touch, and gestures unlocks an entirely new level of interaction, making computing more intuitive and, frankly, more fun.\nI also learned that Supabase is an absolute beast for projects like this. It handled my database, real-time sync, and WebRTC signaling without me having to write a single line of traditional server-side code. It's truly the ultimate enabler for ambitious-but-lazy developers (like myself!).\nWhat's Next for Vibe Console: The Road to World Domination (and Beyond!)\nWorld domination, obviously. But first, some more concrete steps:</li></ul></li><li>More Editors: Integrating with more cloud-based development environments is a top priority. Imagine \"vibe coding\" in your favorite IDE, with a particular focus on integrating with Zed editor.</li><li>Richer Inputs: We've only scratched the surface. What incredible interactions can we unlock with the accelerometer? Or haptic feedback? Let's get weirder and more immersive.</li><li>AI Code Generation: This was the original dream! Actually hooking up the voice commands to a powerful LLM to generate code directly within the selected editor, leveraging services like Elevenlabs or OpenAI.</li><li>Public Beta: Getting this into more hands, collecting feedback, and seeing the wild and innovative ways people use Vibe Console is the ultimate next step.</li></ul><p>Try it out!\nReady to start vibing?

If Kubernetes is running the platform/application that they're working with, they don't need to be Kubernetes ninjas.</p><p>Technical leadership teams want to use Kubernetes without the overhead. Engineers want the promise of Kubernetes (high scalability, self-healing, performance optimization) without the overhead of becoming experts in the orchestration layer. That “overhead” (the Developer Experience and Kubernetes being difficult) is the primary business motivator behind Platform Engineering.</p><p>Platform Engineering is a combination of having a product-first mindset, a customer service mindset, and the engineering abilities to implement the idea.

An IDP could be for anyone in engineering (sysadmins, cyber security, product managers, etc.). It's not JUST for developers.</p><p>The idea of an IDP is that it gives engineers USING the tools an easier way to interact with them. For example, let's say your organization has decided on ArgoCD for the GitOps solution. Instead of having to know the ins and outs of ArgoCD, you can just access ArgoCD via the IDP. What's exposed to you via the IDP is only what you need to get the job done.</p><p>An IDP is like a fancy new way to say \"self-service portal\".</p><p>At the time of writing this, the two most popular IDPs are:</p><p>For those who want a more enterprise solution, use Port.

Every star, issue, and pull request reflects a shared enthusiasm that fuels my drive to keep improving.</p><p>It’s easy to celebrate a launch and move on, but I’ve learned to savor the little victories: the first time a user left 5-star review on extensions web store, watching our install count increase, or the excitement of watching our scanned-sites counter climb with each new scan. Those milestones aren’t just numbers-they’re proof that a solo spark can ignite a community fire.</p><p>Over the next few months, I’m focused on polishing core features that matter most: enhancing the mobile PWA for offline scanning, adding customizable filters in the dashboard so you can track only the frameworks you care about, and building CSV export so teams can plug our data into their own reports. I’m also kicking off a series of monthly “insights” posts-deep dives into trends we’re seeing in the wild. Open Tech Explorer taught me that every new scan tells a story, and I can’t wait to share those stories with you.  </p><p>This hackathon taught me that launching and iterating rapidly is far more rewarding than competing.

While my initial blog post was full of confidence and ambitious plans, the reality of diving into graduate-level linear algebra after years of web development was like trying to drink from a fire hose while someone's screaming at you in a foreign language.</p><p> Master vector operations, implement everything from scratch, solve 20+ problems, write clean documentation.</p><p> I spent 3 hours just trying to remember what the hell a dot product actually  geometrically, not just computationally.</p><h3><strong>Gilbert Strang Almost Broke Me</strong></h3><p>Watching MIT 18.06 Lecture 1, I thought I was following along fine until Strang casually mentioned linear independence and my brain just... stopped. I realized I was nodding along without actually understanding what he was saying. The mathematical intuition that should have been built over years was just missing.</p><h3><strong>My \"From Scratch\" Implementation Was Embarrassing</strong></h3><p>My vector operations library? It was basically just NumPy wrapped in a class with some print statements. I wasn't implementing anything from first principles—I was just moving existing functionality around and calling it \"understanding.\"</p><h3><strong>The Problem Sets Were Brutal</strong></h3><p>Those \"20+ vector problems from Khan Academy\"? I got through 8 before hitting a wall on basic concepts like span and linear combinations. Problems that should have taken 5 minutes were taking 30+ minutes, and I was second-guessing every answer.</p><h3><strong>Documentation? What Documentation?</strong></h3><p>By hour 10, I was so mentally drained that my \"clean GitHub commits\" turned into desperate pushes with commit messages like \"vectors maybe working idk\" and \"fixed thing that was broken probably.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Identity Crisis Moment 🤔\n</h2><p>Around hour 8 yesterday, I had a genuine moment of panic. I was staring at a simple 3x3 matrix multiplication problem, something that should be elementary, and I realized I was doing it mechanically without any geometric intuition.</p><p><strong>The question that hit me:</strong><em>Am I actually learning this, or am I just going through the motions?</em></p><p>This is the difference between:</p><ul><li>: Memorizing formulas and procedures</li><li>: Grasping the fundamental concepts and their relationships</li></ul><p>I was definitely doing the former, and for an ML Research Engineer role, that's not going to cut it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What I Actually Accomplished (The Real Numbers) 📊\n</h2><p>Let me be brutally honest about yesterday's deliverables:</p><ul><li>Watched 2 Gilbert Strang lectures (though understanding was patchy)</li><li>Implemented basic vector operations (poorly, but they work)</li><li>Solved 8 Khan Academy problems (target was 20)</li><li>Started understanding the geometric meaning of vectors</li><li>Realized how much I don't know (actually valuable)</li></ul><ul><li>No clean documentation written</li><li>Mathematical derivations incomplete</li><li>Visualization tools not created</li><li>Advanced topics barely touched</li><li>Evening review session skipped due to exhaustion</li></ul><ul><li>Vector class implemented but not from true first principles</li><li>Problems solved but with too much struggle for basic concepts</li><li>Blog post written but overly optimistic about Day 1 results</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Deep Dive: Where I Actually Struggled 🔍\n</h2><h3><strong>Linear Independence - The Mind Bender</strong></h3><p>I thought I understood this concept, but when I tried to explain it to myself out loud, I realized I was just reciting definitions. The geometric intuition of what it means for vectors to be linearly independent—that they can't be expressed as combinations of each other—didn't click until my 4th attempt at visualization.</p><h3><strong>Dot Product: Computation vs. Meaning</strong></h3><p>Sure, I can compute a·b = Σaᵢbᵢ, but understanding that it represents the projection of one vector onto another? That it measures how much two vectors \"agree\" in direction? That took hours of drawing diagrams and multiple YouTube videos to truly grasp.</p><p>This one nearly broke me. The idea that the span of a set of vectors is all possible linear combinations sounds simple, but visualizing what this means in 3D space, understanding how it relates to basis vectors, and grasping why it matters for machine learning—that was a genuine struggle.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Today's Shift in Strategy 🎯\n</h2><p>After yesterday's reality check, I'm making some crucial adjustments:</p><p>Instead of trying to implement 5 different concepts poorly, I'm going to focus on truly mastering matrix operations today. Better to understand one thing deeply than to have surface knowledge of many things.</p><h3><strong>Emphasis on Geometric Intuition</strong></h3><p>For every mathematical operation I implement, I'm going to force myself to:</p><ol><li>Visualize it geometrically</li><li>Explain it in plain English</li><li>Connect it to ML applications</li></ol><h3><strong>Implementation as Learning Tool</strong></h3><p>My implementations need to be true learning exercises, not just code that works. I'm going to implement matrix multiplication in multiple ways:</p><ul><li>Naive approach (to understand the basic operation)</li><li>Optimized approach (to understand computational efficiency)</li><li>Block matrix approach (to understand how it scales)</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Matrix Operations Actually Mean (My Current Understanding) 🧮\n</h2><p>Let me test my understanding by explaining matrix multiplication without looking anything up:</p><p><strong>Matrix multiplication isn't just a computational trick—it's composition of linear transformations.</strong> When you multiply matrix A by matrix B, you're saying \"first apply transformation B, then apply transformation A.\"</p><p>This is why matrix multiplication isn't commutative (AB ≠ BA generally). The order matters because transformations are being composed, not just numbers being multiplied.</p><p> When we do forward propagation through a neural network, each layer is essentially a matrix multiplication (linear transformation) followed by a non-linear activation. Understanding matrix multiplication deeply means understanding how information flows through neural networks.</p><p><em>Did I get that right? I think so, but the fact that I'm uncertain shows how much work I still have to do.</em></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Psychological Battle 🧠\n</h2><p>The hardest part of Day 1 wasn't the mathematics—it was the psychological challenge of realizing how much I don't know.</p><p><strong>Imposter syndrome was real.</strong> Looking at job descriptions asking for people who can \"implement transformers from scratch\" while I'm struggling with basic linear algebra felt overwhelming.</p><p> Every ML researcher started somewhere. The difference between me and someone with a PhD isn't that they're smarter—it's that they've spent more time deeply understanding these fundamentals.</p><p>I have one advantage: I know how to learn complex technical concepts quickly. Blockchain development taught me that. The challenge is applying that same intensity and systematic approach to mathematics.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Today's Concrete Goals (Learning from Yesterday) 📝\n</h2><h3><strong>Core Implementation Focus:</strong></h3><ul><li>Matrix multiplication from scratch (3 different approaches)</li><li>Determinant calculation (both computational and geometric understanding)</li><li>Matrix inverse (when it exists and why it matters)</li></ul><h3><strong>Deep Understanding Goals:</strong></h3><ul><li>Geometric interpretation of matrix operations</li><li>Connection to linear transformations</li><li>Relevance to neural network operations</li></ul><ul><li>Clean, well-commented code that teaches</li><li>Mathematical derivations written out by hand</li><li>Visualizations that demonstrate concepts</li></ul><ul><li>15 matrix problems (down from yesterday's overly ambitious 30)</li><li>Focus on understanding each one deeply</li><li>Connect each problem to ML applications</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Adjusted Timeline Reality ⏰\n</h2><p>Yesterday made me realize that my initial 60-day timeline, while still the goal, needs to account for the actual learning curve.</p><p> I could absorb graduate-level mathematics at the same pace I learned JavaScript frameworks.</p><p> Mathematical intuition takes time to develop. You can't just \"npm install\" understanding of eigenvalues.</p><p> Same 60-day goal, but with more realistic daily expectations and deeper focus on true understanding rather than coverage.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why I'm Sharing the Struggles 💪\n</h2><p>Most learning content online shows only the successes. The clean implementations, the \"aha!\" moments, the polished final results. But the real learning happens in the struggle, in the moments when you're completely lost and forcing yourself to push through.</p><p><strong>For anyone following this journey:</strong> If you're also trying to learn ML/AI, know that feeling overwhelmed is normal. The difference between success and failure isn't avoiding the overwhelm—it's pushing through it systematically.</p><p><strong>For experienced ML engineers:</strong> Was your learning journey similar? How did you develop mathematical intuition? I'd genuinely appreciate any advice in the comments.</p><p>Today, I'm going to prioritize depth over breadth. I'm going to implement matrix operations not just to make them work, but to truly understand what they represent geometrically and how they connect to machine learning.</p><p>I'm going to struggle with determinants until I can explain why they matter for understanding neural network behavior.</p><p>I'm going to visualize linear transformations until I can see them in my mind when I look at a matrix.</p><p><strong>The goal isn't to check boxes—it's to build genuine understanding that will support everything else I learn in the next 58 days.</strong></p><p>Day 3 will focus on eigenvalues and eigenvectors—concepts that are absolutely crucial for understanding how neural networks learn but are notoriously difficult to grasp intuitively.</p><p>If today goes better than yesterday (which it has to), I'll dive into why eigenvalues matter for understanding the behavior of gradient descent and how eigenvectors relate to the principal directions of data.</p><p>If today is another struggle (which is possible), I'll adjust again and focus even more deeply on the fundamentals.</p><p><strong>The journey continues. Reality has been brutal, but I'm not backing down.</strong></p><p><strong>To everyone following along:</strong> Thank you for the encouragement on Day 1. This is harder than I expected, but that just makes it more worth doing.(got 2 likes 🥹)</p><p><strong>See you tomorrow for Day 3: Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and (Hopefully) Some Actual Understanding.</strong></p><p><em>How do you handle the psychological challenge of learning really difficult technical concepts? Have you ever felt completely overwhelmed when starting something new?

You might not notice it during testing, but the moment a real user uploads a photo from their iPhone, things fall apart.</p><p>In this post, we’ll walk through why it breaks your app, and how to fix it—with practical options for frontend and backend conversion, plus third-party tools. Alright, let's dive in! </p><p>First, let’s render it on our site 🔥</p><div><pre><code>&lt;img src=\"/assets/dog.heic\" alt=\"\"&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>Yeahhh… You see HEIC, while being highy efficient, is not highly supported in the browser environments. As you can see <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=HEIC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> none of the browsers besides latest releases of Safari support this format.</p><p>Consequently the code snippet above won’t work in most browsers.</p><p>Implementing HEIC support in your web app is a time consuming task that often requires revision to make sure that your solution is compatible with your target users’s browsers. If 99% of them use Android then you can probably prioritise other tickets that have been sitting in your backlog.</p><p>Let’s look at some data though. According to Statcounter around 28% of smartphones worldwide are running IOS. Those 28% might want to upload a HEIC image they took with their iPhone to your app.</p><p>However, most of the businesses are running locally and are limited to a specific region or a country. If your business is targeting the United States market, the share of iOS users on mobile reaches almost 60%. In that case you can be sure that sooner or later a HEIC image will land in your uploader and there has to be a piece of code that will handle it.</p><p>As you can see the only way to be able to reliably render HEIC in a browser is to convert it into a format that is widely supported. Right now, no one knows if Apple is going to change its licensing and allow other browsers to use HEIC images, and even if it does, waiting for it to happen doesn’t seem like a quick solution.</p><p>Here are a few approaches that I’m going to go through so that you can compare and choose the one that suits your case best:</p><ul><li>Converting on the front-end</li><li>Converting on the back-end</li><li>Using third party solutions</li></ul><p>When searching for HEIC conversion tools you are most likely to stumble upon libheif which is a great open source library written in C. But how do we get to run it with JavaScript in the browser environment?</p><p>There is the <a href=\"https://github.com/catdad-experiments/libheif-js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">libheif-js</a> library which lets you directly interact with the precompiled JavaScript libheif or run it using WebAssembly. You can also use it in node.js but I’ll cover that later. However, this is a low level solution that requires you to decode the image yourself and then render it using canvas. You can then preview it with a canvas or convert it into a jpg blob and display it with an img tag. </p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/strukturag/libheif/blob/gh-pages/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> is an example of how that can be done. As you can see it’s complicated and requires a deep understanding of each step which might not be ideal if you only want to get the job done without getting into details of how libheif works.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the library called <a href=\"https://github.com/alexcorvi/heic2any\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heic2any</a> which is using libheif under the hood and makes it super simple to get started with HEIC conversion in the browser. Here’s an example implementation:</p><p>We have a file picker that accepts an HEIC image and previews it using the img tag. As you can see it takes a few lines of code to convert the image and generate a URL which we can then preview like any other static image.</p><p>I think it’s worth elaborating on one thing here…</p><h2><strong>Good to know: What is a blob?</strong></h2><p>You might be asking yourself - what is this whole blob thing in JavaScript? You see it everywhere when dealing with files and sometimes it might not be obvious why it’s being used in the first place.</p><p>Blobs allow you to create file-like objects made out of raw data and a specified MIME type. They are stored in the browser’s memory and can be accessed using a generated url. It is a perfect solution for any image manipulation because Blobs allow for storing the image data and then easily referencing it - in the example above by passing it as a src attribute.</p><p>This video gives a great introduction to how to create a blob yourself and explains a few related concepts like ArrayBuffers:</p><p>And just like that we managed to handle an HEIC image and view it without using any backend. However, keep in mind that converting images on the client is not an ideal solution and has its drawbacks that shouldn’t be undermined.</p><p>First of all, it’s heavy for the browser to first load the heic2any (2.7 MB) and then to run the actual image conversion. You never know if someone is using your app on the latest MacBook Pro or on the iPhone SE from 2016.</p><p>Besides that, you should never trust the client and handing over such crucial task as converting files to the client might be dangerous.</p><p>In our opinion frontend conversion should be only used for previewing and if you want to upload a file to the server you should send it in the original HEIC format to continue processing on the backend.</p><p>Depending on your stack there are many tools you can use for handling the HEIC conversion on the backend.</p><p>We mentioned libheif before which has dedicated libraries for various languages like Node.js, C#, Python, Rust etc. Let’s take a look at an example implementation in Node.js, specifically using the <a href=\"https://github.com/catdad-experiments/heic-convert\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heic-convert</a> package which is an official user friendly wrapper for libheif.</p><p>Using Express.js you can quickly create a server that will handle an HEIC file and return the converted jpeg file. Multer is a middleware that lets you easily handle form data and files - I’m using the memory storage here which doesn’t save any file to the disk but with Multer you can also make the files get saved and return the image url that can be accessed multiple times.</p><p>To take it one step further in a production environment you would probably want to save those files to S3 or other storage solution and host them using a CDN.</p><p>In this example you simply get the image data which on the client side can be easily parsed to a blob and rendered. To use our backend implementation in the frontend demo I showed above you simply need to replace the heic2any call with a POST request to the server:</p><div><pre><code>const formData = new FormData();\nformData.append(\"file\", blob);\n\nfetch(\"http://localhost:4000\", {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  body: formData,\n})\n  .then((res) =&gt; res.blob())\n  .then((res) =&gt; {\n    setPreview(URL.createObjectURL(res));\n    setLoading(false);\n  });\n</code></pre></div><p>We have moved the crucial process of converting an image to the backend making it more reliable. Compared to the frontend conversion the performance will be more consistent as it’s always your server that is running the conversion.</p><p>The biggest disadvantage here is the effort that you have to put into spinning up your own server and maintaining it (unless you already have it).</p><p>Overall, if you need to reliably handle HEIC conversion with a prospect of also handling storage and referencing those images in a database, implementing a backend conversion is probably the best way to go.</p><p>While implementing the file conversion yourself is not that hard nowadays due to a lot of libraries that get the job done for you, it can still be tricky to choose the right one and be sure that your custom implementation will work well in all the cases.</p><p>For example if your output image seems to have a slightly different color palette, you either have to tweak the parameters to match your expected output (assuming the library you’re using implements such interface) or switch to another library that might or might not solve the issue.</p><p>Also, the solutions I showed in the previous sections do not handle the file metadata. You would need to implement it separately.</p><p>You will also need to perform updates of those libraries and test if the update didn’t break anything in your code.</p><p>If you don’t want to struggle with all those things and just want to get a solution that is easy to implement and always works, you should look for an API that will outsource this process for you. For example:</p><p>They provide a straightforward documentation and you can always reach out to their support if your business has more specific requirements.</p><p>There are also more profound, end-to-end solutions for handling images which go beyond just image conversion:</p><p>They allow you to upload images, convert them, process them in many different ways like cropping, resizing or applying filters and access using a CDN. You can also specify the storage solution so it doesn’t have to be their servers. Filestack also provides you with an embedded file picker which means you don’t even have to make any requests yourself.</p>","contentLength":8764,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Distributed Computing Framework（1751471379982300）","url":"https://dev.to/member_6bc7e52c/distributed-computing-framework1751471379982300-5ac","date":1751471382,"author":"member_6bc7e52c","guid":180708,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

For the most up-to-date list and details, check out the official <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda documentation</a>.</p><p>This frees you from the following responsibilities:</p><ul><li> No more wrestling with instance types and configurations.</li><li> AWS keeps your environment secure and up-to-date.</li><li> Scaling is handled automatically based on demand.</li></ul><p>Lambda's flexibility makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, especially within event-driven architectures.  Here are some compelling use cases:</p><ul><li> Schedule functions to generate reports using CloudWatch Events, eliminating manual processes. For instance, automatically generate a daily sales report.</li><li> Process orders instantly when new items are added to your DynamoDB database, ensuring rapid order fulfillment.</li><li> Automatically resize or apply watermarks to images uploaded to S3, optimizing your media library.</li><li> Build REST APIs using Lambda and API Gateway, creating modern, scalable backends without managing servers.</li><li> Automate security tasks like IAM policy violation remediation or credential rotation.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, Lambda excels at building microservices: small, independent functions focused on specific tasks. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Under the Hood: How Lambda Works\n</h3><p>Deploying a Lambda function is a straightforward process:</p><ol><li>  This specifies your function's entry point – the code that gets executed when triggered.</li><li> Upload your code to AWS.  This can be done directly through the console or via the AWS CLI.</li><li> AWS packages your code into an execution environment (often a container). When triggered:\n\n<ul><li>The container is initialized.</li><li>The container is terminated (or kept warm for faster subsequent executions).</li></ul></li></ol><p>You might hear about \"cold starts,\" the initial delay while the container loads.  However, AWS has made significant improvements, and techniques like provisioned concurrency can minimize this effect.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Deep Dive into Serverless Computing\n</h3><p>AWS Lambda integrates seamlessly with a vast ecosystem of AWS services, enabling powerful workflows.  Some key integrations include:</p><ul><li>  Manages incoming requests and routes them to your Lambda functions.</li><li>  A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.</li><li>  Object storage for storing files and media.</li><li>  Messaging services for asynchronous communication.</li><li>  A serverless event bus that routes events to your Lambda functions.</li><li>  Orchestrates complex workflows involving multiple Lambda functions.</li></ul><p>For a comprehensive understanding of the Lambda execution model, refer to this resource: [Link to Lambda Execution Model -  ]</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating Your First Lambda Function\n</h3><p>Let's get hands-on! Creating your first Lambda function is easy, whether you prefer the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Method 1: AWS Management Console\n</h4><ol><li>Select \"Author from scratch.\"</li><li>Configure the function name, runtime (e.g., Python 3.11), and permissions (a basic Lambda execution role is sufficient).</li><li>Add your code using the inline editor or upload a ZIP file.</li><li>Test your function using the \"Test\" button or trigger it via an event.</li></ol><p>The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CLI</a> offers a more streamlined approach:</p><div><pre><code>aws lambda create-function  helloLambda  python3.11  lambda_function.lambda_handler  arn:aws:iam::&lt;account-id&gt;:role/lambda-execute-role  fileb://function.zip  us-east-1\n</code></pre></div><p>Remember to replace placeholders like  with your actual values.  Ensure your IAM role () has the necessary permissions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Invoke your function using:</p><div><pre><code>aws lambda invoke  helloLambda \n    response.json\n</code></pre></div><p>This completes your first step into the serverless world!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h3><p>AWS Lambda integrates seamlessly with Amazon CloudWatch, providing comprehensive monitoring capabilities. CloudWatch acts as your central dashboard, offering real-time insights into your Lambda functions' health and performance:</p><ul><li> Detailed logs for each function, accessible via <code>/aws/lambda/&lt;function-name&gt;</code>, are crucial for debugging and troubleshooting.</li><li> Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as invocation count, error rate, and duration.</li><li> Configure alerts for automatic notifications upon recurring issues, preventing unexpected downtime.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Lambda Function URLs: The Simple Approach\n</h4><p>For quick access, create a function URL:</p><div><pre><code>aws lambda create-function-url-config  helloLambda  NONE\n</code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  API Gateway + Lambda: Enhanced Control\n</h4><p>For more advanced control and customization, use API Gateway.  It acts as a request manager, providing features like routing, authentication, and authorization.  This involves:</p><ol><li>Defining HTTP routes that trigger your Lambda function.</li><li>Attaching your Lambda function as the integration for those routes.</li><li>Deploying your API to different stages (e.g., , ).</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Understanding AWS Lambda Costs: The Pay-as-you-Go Model\n</h3><p>AWS Lambda uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You're billed based on:</p><ul><li> Each function execution.</li><li> Execution time of each invocation.</li><li> Configurable from 128 MB to 10 GB.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Embrace the Power of Serverless\n</h3><p>AWS Lambda dramatically simplifies server management, allowing developers to focus on building amazing applications.  Whether you're automating tasks or building complex applications, Lambda scales seamlessly to meet your needs.

Choose the Right Game Engine and Tools Early\n</h2><p>Selecting the right engine can define your game's technical limitations and possibilities. Unity and Unreal Engine are powerful, but not always necessary for simple 2D games. Lightweight engines like Godot or custom OpenGL-based frameworks may result in better performance on mid-range and low-end devices.</p><p> Evaluate your game requirements before committing to a game engine. Don’t just follow trends—match the engine's capabilities to your gameplay goals.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Optimize Asset Management\n</h2><p>Assets (images, sounds, models) can make or break your game’s performance. Large uncompressed textures and high-bitrate audio can slow down loading times and bloat APK size.</p><ul><li>Use WebP for images instead of PNG.</li><li>Compress audio using OGG Vorbis for a balance between quality and size.</li><li>Lazy-load assets only when they are needed.</li></ul><p>Many Android developers rely on libraries to speed up development. However, too many or poorly maintained ones can harm your game's performance.</p><p> Some \"lightweight\" libraries include hidden dependencies. Always inspect your APK size after integration.

Avoid the Main Thread Trap\n</h2><p>Heavy operations (like loading textures or parsing data) on the main thread can cause frame drops and input lag. Even short blocking operations can result in visible stutter.</p><ul><li>Coroutines for asynchronous operations in Kotlin</li><li>Background threads or  (deprecated but still seen in legacy code)</li><li>Game loops that manage rendering and logic separately</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Frame Rate Targeting and Power Efficiency\n</h2><p>Your game doesn’t need to run at 60 FPS on all devices. Target 30 FPS on low-end devices to save battery and reduce CPU/GPU load.</p><ul><li>Provide graphics quality settings</li><li>Limit background processes</li><li>Pause rendering when the app is in the background</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Use GPU Profiling and Memory Tools\n</h2><p>Android Studio offers built-in tools like GPU Profiler and Memory Analyzer that help diagnose lag spikes, memory leaks, and render bottlenecks.</p><p> Use  to track frame rendering stages at a low level. It helps pinpoint frame drops caused by slow layout passes or draw calls.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Optimize Network Calls in Multiplayer Games\n</h2><p>Real-time games often struggle with poor networking. Don’t rely on high-frequency polling or frequent HTTP calls.</p><ul><li>Use WebSockets for real-time communication.</li><li>Implement retry logic and timeout handling.</li><li>Compress data before sending it across the network.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Reduce Battery Drain Through Smart Resource Management\n</h2><p>Battery drain can turn players away quickly. Avoid constant wake locks or unnecessary background processing.</p><ul><li>Use  or  for scheduled tasks.</li><li>Release unused memory and pause animations when idle.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  9.

Turns out I’m not the only one. Research shows that 67% of users abandon sign-up processes that feel clunky or confusing. Even more telling, modern UX studies reveal that micro-interactions and instant feedback can boost conversion rates by up to 45%. Wild, right?</p><p>Ever since I started working on frontend-heavy products, I’ve been obsessed with crafting login pages that feel smooth and intuitive. Turns out I’m not alone. Studies show that 88% of users are less likely to return after a poor user experience. Even more interesting, responsive and interactive login flows can increase sign-in success rates by over 40%. Pretty compelling, right?</p><p>By using the <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/vibe-coding-tools/#how-to-choose-the-right-vibe-coding-tool-for-your-needs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, from UI prototyping to animation libraries and smart validation systems, I built a fully interactive login page that feels modern, responsive, and frictionless.</p><h2><strong>Top Vibe Coding Tools for Creating an Interactive Login Page</strong></h2><p>Here is the list of vibe coding tools that I used for creating interactive login pages:</p><p>For the first version of the login page, I centered everything around <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>. I wanted to see how far I could go by using it to plan, structure, and simulate the entire user flow, without relying on traditional design tools or manual wireframing.</p><p>Vitara focuses on interaction logic. It helped me map out user behavior in a visual way before I wrote a single line of code. I built the flow using Vitara’s editor, which made it easy to define states like “login success,” “invalid input,” or “server error” without jumping back and forth between notes and code.</p><p>What stood out most was how Vitara visualized every possible path a user could take. I could test edge cases, preview how feedback would look, and even simulate what happens during slow network conditions. This helped me think more deeply about the user experience early on.</p><p>I then translated that flow directly into a React project, keeping Vitara’s logic as the foundation. The final page felt smooth and predictable. Every interaction made sense because I had already accounted for it during planning.</p><p>This approach worked best for building a well-structured, thought-through login flow. It didn't cover the visual flair or backend logic, but as a design-first experience, Vitara helped me get the interaction right from the start.</p><p>For the second version of the login page, I decided to focus entirely on feel. My goal was to see how much personality and warmth I could add using Lovable as the main driver.</p><p><a href=\"https://vitara.ai/lovable-alternatives/#what-is-lovable\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> specializes in micro-interactions. It helped me layer in small moments that made the page feel alive—hover lifts on input fields, soft fades between states, and gentle bounce effects when users completed actions. These weren’t just visual touches. They made the interface feel responsive and emotionally engaging.</p><p>The implementation was smooth. I didn’t need to overhaul my styling or animation stack. Lovable worked alongside my existing setup and offered presets that just worked out of the box. Within minutes, I had a login form that felt welcoming and fun.</p><p>What surprised me most was how much users responded to these small touches. During test runs, people stayed longer, interacted more, and even commented on how “clean” or “modern” the experience felt. The core logic was simple, but the vibe was memorable.</p><p>This version didn’t focus much on backend or advanced validation, but it nailed the emotional layer. If you care about user perception and want your interface to stand out, Lovable adds that finishing polish.</p><p>For the third version of my login page, I focused entirely on backend functionality. I used <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/top-bolt-new-alternatives/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> to handle authentication logic, user sessions, and API responses—all without writing custom server code from scratch.</p><p>Bolt.new gave me a ready-to-use backend with login, signup, password reset, and JWT-based auth out of the box. I didn’t need to spin up a database or configure middleware. Everything was pre-wired and easy to test.</p><p>What made this version interesting was how quickly I could go from zero to production-ready. I connected the frontend via simple REST calls, and within minutes, I had a real working auth system. It even supported OAuth providers like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, which made it feel like a feature-rich platform without the usual setup time.</p><p>This version wasn’t flashy on the frontend, but it was rock-solid under the hood. I focused on functionality, error handling, and response times. It gave me a great foundation to build more complex auth flows in future projects.</p><p>For the fourth login page, I tried building the entire flow inside , the AI-powered code editor. I was curious to see how far I could push a login page using real-time suggestions and AI-driven refactoring as my coding partner.</p><p><a href=\"https://vitara.ai/replit-alternatives/#7-cursor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> felt like having an experienced teammate sitting beside me. I started by describing the login flow in plain English, and the editor instantly scaffolded a working React form with clean structure and state handling. I refined the logic as I went, and Cursor kept up with suggestions that felt natural and context-aware.</p><p>When I got stuck thinking about edge cases like token expiration or redirect logic, Cursor suggested patterns I hadn’t even considered yet. It wasn’t just completing code, it was helping me design smarter.</p><p>The final result was solid. Not the flashiest UI, but one of the fastest builds I’ve done. Cursor helped me avoid mistakes and saved time on boilerplate setup. I still had to guide the structure, but it took care of the grunt work.</p><p>For the last version, I went all-in on simplicity. I used <a href=\"https://vitara.ai/cursor-alternatives/#top-cursor-alternatives-in-2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, a UI component library focused on minimal design and smooth user flows. I wanted to build a fast, clean login page with almost no custom styling or layout logic.</p><p>Windsurf gave me ready-to-use form components that looked good and worked well across screen sizes. I dragged in a form block, added input fields, and everything adjusted responsively without a single media query. It was almost like building with Lego pieces, but for UI.</p><p>The built-in animations were subtle but effective. Focus states, error messages, and button feedback all felt intentional. I didn’t touch CSS once, which was a nice change from tweaking styles manually.</p><p>This version had the cleanest UI out of all five. The look and feel were modern, focused, and friction-free. It didn’t have the deep logic of the Cursor version or the smart flow planning from Vitara, but it absolutely nailed the \"just works\" experience.</p><p>To really understand what works, I built five different login pages—each one centered around a single tool. The goal was simple: test each tool in its own space and see what kind of experience it could create on its own.</p><p>Vitara impressed me with intelligent flow design and user-state logic. Lovable turned a basic form into something fun and emotionally engaging. Bolt.new helped me ship a fully functional login backend in no time. React Hook Form with Zod made validation clean and user-friendly. Framer Motion brought everything to life with fluid, app-like animations.</p><p>Each version had its strengths and challenges. Some tools offered speed, others delivered polish. The process helped me see what really matters for users and how different tools shape the same idea in unique ways.</p><p>If you’re working on your own login flows, try this experiment. Build a few variations using different tools. Compare them. Learn what fits your style, your stack, and your users.</p><p>Have a favorite tool for login UX?

But now, they are under siege. Crypto mining bots are exploiting these free tools to mine coins for personal profit, bringing down services and leaving honest users with limited access or none at all.</p><h2><strong>Why Crypto Miners Target Free CI/CD Tools</strong></h2><p>CI/CD platforms offer free compute power, bandwidth, and fast processors. Crypto miners see this as an opportunity. They hijack pipelines and use them to run mining scripts. This abuse often goes unnoticed until performance drops or usage costs skyrocket.</p><p>Most free CI/CD providers rely on automation and trust. Unfortunately, crypto miners exploit that trust with automated scripts that mimic legitimate builds. It’s easy, quick, and profitable — for them.</p><h2><strong>Popular Platforms Affected by Crypto Mining Abuse</strong></h2><p>Many well-known CI/CD services have fallen victim. Here are the most affected:</p><ul><li><p>\nOnce known for generous free minutes, it has drastically reduced free usage due to widespread abuse.</p></li><li><p>\nGitLab had to restrict free-tier runners because of repeated crypto mining attacks.</p></li><li><p>\nOne of the earliest to feel the impact, Travis CI now limits build minutes and accounts for abuse.</p></li></ul><p>These platforms now apply strict verification, usage caps, and auto-suspensions, affecting developers who never intended harm.</p><h2><strong>How Crypto Mining Impacts Honest Developers</strong></h2><p>Developers are the real victims here. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p>\nResources get throttled due to overuse. Queues get longer, and jobs take forever to complete.</p></li><li><p>\nFalse positives lead to bans. Legitimate users get flagged while bots find workarounds.</p></li><li><p>\nTo counter abuse, many platforms strip down features or make them paywalled, reducing access for open-source contributors.</p></li><li><p>\nNew developers hesitate to use free CI/CD tools, fearing unreliable performance or policy changes overnight.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What Platforms Are Doing to Fight Back</strong></h2><p>The battle is ongoing, but some measures are helping:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stronger Identity Verification</strong>\nPhone number and credit card verifications are now mandatory on many platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Usage Monitoring and Alerts</strong>\nAutomated tools now monitor for crypto mining behavior and flag abnormal usage.</p></li><li><p>\nDaily or monthly limits help reduce the window of abuse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Private Runners and Paid Tiers</strong>\nEncouraging users to move to paid plans or self-hosted runners adds a layer of accountability.</p></li></ul><p>Still, none of these are perfect. Crypto miners evolve quickly and often adapt faster than protections can be deployed.</p><h2><strong>What Developers Can Do Now</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting caught in the crossfire, developers should:</p><ul><li><p>\nAlways verify your account and link it to a trusted identity.</p></li><li><p>\nOptimize your CI/CD pipelines. Shorter jobs are less likely to trigger suspicion.</p></li><li><p>\nFlag suspicious projects or public repos that seem to run meaningless or repeated jobs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consider Hybrid Workflows</strong>\nMix local builds and cloud CI/CD usage. This minimizes dependency on free tools.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>The Future of Free CI/CD Services</strong></h2><p>Unless crypto mining abuse is tackled head-on, the free-tier era may end. Platforms may shift to invite-only models or enforce paywalls to survive. Community support and responsible usage are the only ways to keep free CI/CD alive.</p><p>The open-source ecosystem thrives on free tools. Crypto mining abuse threatens that foundation. Developers, platforms, and communities must act together. Otherwise, free CI/CD may become a relic of the past.</p><p> Crypto miners are draining the life out of free CI/CD services. Their greed threatens the foundation of collaborative development.

But it’s also creating chaos in the world of development tools. One major issue is the abuse of free Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platforms by crypto miners. These platforms were designed to help developers test and deploy code efficiently—not to run mining operations.</p><h2><strong>Why Free CI/CD Tools Are Under Threat</strong></h2><p>Free CI/CD services like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and others offer valuable computing power. Their free tiers are meant for small teams and individual developers. However, bad actors exploit these platforms to run crypto mining scripts. The result? Overloaded servers, higher maintenance costs, and drained resources.</p><p>CI/CD providers are being forced to restrict access, limit usage, or shut down free tiers altogether. This directly affects the open-source community and early-stage developers who rely on these tools.</p><h2><strong>How Hackers Exploit CI/CD Systems</strong></h2><p>Cybercriminals target misconfigured CI/CD pipelines or create fake repositories. They then inject mining scripts into build processes. Once deployed, these scripts start mining cryptocurrencies like Monero in the background.</p><p>Some use advanced automation to create thousands of fake accounts. This way, they bypass rate limits and maximize computational gains—all at someone else's cost.</p><h2><strong>CI/CD Platforms Fighting Back</strong></h2><p>In response, platforms are tightening their security and usage policies. GitHub has implemented stricter verification processes. GitLab has begun limiting free usage and detecting unusual activity patterns. CircleCI and Travis CI now monitor and block suspicious scripts faster than ever.</p><p>But these countermeasures also bring inconvenience for legitimate users. Verification steps slow down workflows. Usage restrictions disrupt productivity. Free-tier developers are now forced to look for alternatives or pay for previously free services.</p><p>Open-source developers suffer the most. These users don’t have the budget for premium plans. They depend on free CI/CD services to build and deploy community-driven projects. Now, they face usage limits, account bans, and delayed deployments.</p><p>Startups and students are also hit hard. They lose access to essential automation tools during critical development phases.</p><h2><strong>The Ripple Effect on the Developer Ecosystem</strong></h2><p>When free CI/CD tools vanish or become unusable, the entire developer ecosystem suffers. Collaboration slows down. Innovation stalls. Small contributors drop out. It becomes harder for new developers to gain experience with modern deployment workflows.</p><p>Even larger companies feel the impact indirectly. Many of their libraries and frameworks come from open-source efforts that now face disruption.</p><h2><strong>Possible Solutions to This Growing Problem</strong></h2><p>Stopping this trend isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible. Here are a few potential ways to tackle the issue:</p><ul><li> Platforms can implement stricter sign-up processes to block bots.</li><li> Set clear usage limits and use AI to detect abuse.</li><li><strong>Paid Plans for Serious Users:</strong> Offering low-cost plans for verified users might reduce abuse.</li><li> Educating users about misuse and how to secure their pipelines helps too.</li></ul><h2><strong>A Call to Action for the Developer Community</strong></h2><p>It's time for the tech community to act. Support platforms under pressure. Report suspicious activity. Advocate for fair usage. Donate to open-source developers and maintainers. Help keep the ecosystem alive and thriving.</p><p>Crypto mining may be profitable for some, but when it threatens tools meant for progress and collaboration, everyone loses.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: We Must Protect Developer Resources</strong></h2><p>Free CI/CD platforms are crucial for innovation. But their future is at risk. Unless we take immediate action, these valuable resources could vanish.

You need instant access to critical schematics, work orders, and safety protocols – all on your mobile device, while working in remote locations with potentially unreliable network connectivity.  Or consider a healthcare professional needing secure access to patient records on a tablet during rounds.  These scenarios demand robust security, seamless authentication, and reliable access, even in challenging environments.  Traditional mobile app security often falls short, leaving organizations vulnerable to data breaches and compliance violations.</p><p>Today, the need for secure mobile access is paramount.  The rise of cloud-native applications, coupled with the increasing adoption of zero-trust security models and hybrid identity solutions, has created a complex landscape.  According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023, the average cost of a data breach reached a record high of $4.45 million.  Mobile devices are frequently a point of vulnerability.  Companies like Siemens, a global technology powerhouse, rely on secure mobile access for their field service engineers, and financial institutions like Bank of America are constantly innovating to protect customer data on mobile platforms.  This is where the IBM Gp Cordova Plugin comes into play, offering a powerful solution for securing mobile applications built with Cordova.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is the IBM Gp Cordova Plugin?\n</h3><p>The IBM Gp Cordova Plugin (often referred to as the \"GP Plugin\") is a security plugin for Cordova-based mobile applications. In layman's terms, it's a set of code libraries that you integrate into your Cordova app to add a layer of robust security features, primarily focused on authentication and authorization.  It allows your app to securely interact with IBM Security Verify (formerly IBM Security Access Manager) and other identity providers, enabling strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA), risk-based authentication, and single sign-on (SSO).</p><p>The core problem the GP Plugin solves is bridging the gap between traditional web-based security infrastructure (like IBM Security Verify) and the mobile app world. Cordova apps, being essentially web applications wrapped in a native container, require a secure way to leverage existing security investments.  Without a plugin like this, developers would need to implement complex security protocols from scratch, increasing development time, cost, and the risk of vulnerabilities.</p><ul><li> The plugin includes native code (Java for Android, Objective-C/Swift for iOS) that handles the low-level security interactions with the operating system and the identity provider.</li><li> A JavaScript API provides a simple and consistent interface for Cordova app developers to access the plugin's functionality.</li><li>  Configuration files define the connection details to your IBM Security Verify server and other security settings.</li><li> The Software Development Kit provides documentation, samples, and tools to help developers integrate the plugin into their applications.</li></ul><p>Companies like a large logistics provider use the GP Plugin to secure access to their driver apps, ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive delivery information.

Let’s give our brains a break and let tech help us fall back in love with home-cooked meals. You in?</p><h2><p>\n  Smart Kitchens Are Listening (And Helping)</p></h2><p><strong>Did you know that nearly 40% of U.S. households now use a smart speaker in the kitchen?</strong> Yep. That means millions of us are casually bossing around Alexa while stirring tomato sauce like we’re on a cooking show. Wild, right?</p><p>If you're anything like me, multitasking in the kitchen can feel like you're juggling flaming spatulas. You’re trying not to overcook the chicken, remember if you already added the cumin, and somehow keep your toddler from raiding the spice rack. It’s chaos with a side of stress. For a long time, I thought “smart kitchens” were just fancy toys for tech bros or something you'd see on HGTV. But let me tell you—these tools are legit lifesavers, especially when you’re short on time, hands, or, ya know, sanity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Are Smart Kitchens Actually Doing?\n</h3><p>Let’s get real. Smart appliances aren’t just beeping at you or tossing timers—</p><ul><li><p><strong>Voice assistants (like Alexa or Google Assistant)</strong> can walk you through recipes step-by-step.

You’ll not only surprise your tastebuds, you might just fall in love with cooking all over again.</p><h2><p>\n  Eating Healthier with Smart Nutrition Features</p></h2><p>Did you know that most of us  we’re eating healthy, but studies show we underestimate our daily calorie intake by up to 30%? Yep. That bowl of granola? Sneakier than it looks. And don’t even get me started on artisanal smoothies.</p><p>I’ve always tried to eat well—lots of veggies, home-cooked meals, the big food-prep Sunday ritual. But I still hit that dreaded . You know the one where your energy nosedives and suddenly a third cup of coffee and a donut is calling your name? So frustrating, right?</p><p>Turns out, I wasn’t fueling my body the way it needed. That’s where AI—and specifically apps like <strong>MyFitnessPal with smart AI features</strong>—came in and seriously changed the game for me.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How AI Gave My Meals a Glow-Up\n</h3><p>What I love about today’s nutrition apps is that they're not just digital food diaries anymore (so 2005). With new AI integrations, these tools have leveled up. Here's how they help:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Track your macros without the math headache:</strong> Just take a pic or scan a barcode and boom—AI breaks down your protein, carbs, fats, and even sugar intake. It's weirdly satisfying.</p></li><li><p> Say you log a bagel with cream cheese. Your app might suggest a whole grain wrap with avocado instead—for more fiber, better fats, and longer-lasting energy. Super helpful when you get stuck in a food rut (hi, me).</p></li><li><p><strong>Allergen + sensitivity alerts:</strong> Some apps now flag ingredients that may not align with your health goals, allergies, or even personal preferences. Planning a gluten-free week? The AI's got you. Lactose-intolerant? It won’t let dairy sneak into your smoothie.</p></li></ul><p>For me, the biggest shift was understanding how much protein I  getting earlier in the day. Once the app flagged it, I started tweaking my breakfast and lunch—hello eggs, hello Greek yogurt—and my energy stopped plummeting mid-afternoon. Wild how small changes make a big impact, right?</p><p>Ready to upgrade your food game? Here are a few AI-powered apps that make nutrition feel less like a chore and more like your foodie BFF:</p><ul><li><p> Great for scanning, logging, and spotting trends across your meals. Now AI-powered with meal recommendations and pattern recognition.</p></li><li><p> Another clean, user-friendly option for meal planning, with a great macro focus and customizable diet plans.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lumen (paired with their device):</strong> Uses your breath (yup, seriously) to tell you if your body’s burning carbs or fat—then suggests what to eat based on your metabolism that day.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Let Tech Be Your Sous-Chef\n</h3><p>Eating healthier doesn’t have to mean obsessing over every bite or reading the fine print on every label. With AI handling the data and decoding your habits, you get to focus on what matters: enjoying your food, feeling amazing, and guilt-free seconds of sweet potato chili (yes please).</p><p>So, if you’ve been feeling stuck, tired, or just trying to figure out what “healthy” really means for  body, try letting smart nutrition tools lend a hand. It's like having a nutritionist in your pocket—minus the lectures.</p><p>And trust me, once you stop crashing mid-day and feel more in tune with your meals? Total game-changer. Your body will thank you with energy, better sleep, and fewer “hangry” moments. Win-win-win.</p><h2><p>\n  Ready to Cook Smarter, Not Harder?</p></h2><p>Did you know the average person spends about <strong>51 minutes a day thinking about what to eat</strong>? Not cooking—just . Yup, nearly an hour lost to fridge-staring and \"What do you want for dinner?\" debates. Sound familiar?</p><p>I used to be that person too. I'd come home after a long day, open up the pantry, and—boom—brain freeze. Too tired to be creative, too hungry to wait for inspiration. And with a picky partner and a gluten-intolerant kid, let’s just say dinnertime wasn’t always joyful. More like a culinary version of Survivor.</p><p>But lately? It’s been a game-changer. I started using a meal planning app powered by AI, and let me tell you—it knows me better than I know  Seriously. It recommends meals based on what’s in my fridge, tracks our allergies and preferences, and even makes a shopping list. Heaven!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  So how can you actually cook ?\n</h3><ul><li><p> Tools like Whisk or Yummly can generate personalized recipes based on your dietary needs and what’s hiding in your fridge. No more avocado roulette.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try a smart kitchen assistant:</strong> Devices like the CHEF iQ smart cooker or an AI-powered smart oven help you cook things perfectly with step-by-step prompts. Overcooked salmon? A thing of the past.</p></li><li><p> Apps like Instacart now suggest what to buy based on your favorite meals and health goals. Your cart starts to look a lot more “wellness wins” and a lot less “snacks from 2007.”</p></li></ul><p>I’m not saying tech replaces good ol’ cooking instincts—but it frees up your mental space, so you can enjoy the fun part: the sizzle, the flavor, the “Oh wow, I made this?” moment. Whether you’re meal prepping for the week, trying to eat healthier, or just need a 20-minute dinner before soccer practice, AI’s got your back.</p><p><strong>So, what’s your first AI-enhanced meal gonna be?</strong> A spicy tofu stir-fry? Keto-friendly tacos? Grandma’s meatballs — but make ’em plant-based? Whatever it is, you’re no longer cooking alone. AI is quietly standing by, ready to nudge you toward better, easier, healthier meals—without the kitchen frustration.</p><p>Take a deep breath, let the tech lend a hand, and get ready to fall back in love with your kitchen. Smarter cooking means more flavor, more time, and way fewer “ugh, what’s for dinner?” sighs. You've got this—and now, you've got AI, too.</p>","contentLength":16431,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RIP CRA - Now what?","url":"https://dev.to/annaspies/rip-cra-now-what-1h9a","date":1751422633,"author":"Anna","guid":179548,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Maybe I'm strange, but I always feel a little sad when an app or framework that has been a regular part of my workflow goes to the great repository in the sky. That was certainly my initial reaction after hearing that Create React App (or CRA to its friends) was being <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deprecated</a>. My second reaction: now what do I use?</p><p>Luckily, the React team put up a <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">list of possible CRA replacements</a> as part of the deprecation announcement, and in this post I'm going to focus on the first option: Next.js. Why? IMO it offers the most features for going above and beyond just a simple migration. But we'll get into that later.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Comparing CRA with Next.js\n</h2><p>If you're new to Next.js, here's a quick breakdown of its 1:1 feature equivalents for CRA users, as well as potential server-side functionality:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Client-side equivalent in Next.js</strong></th><th><strong>Server-side possibility in Next.js</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> (same, supports both modes)</td></tr><tr><td>Full TypeScript setup for both client and server components</td></tr><tr><td>File-based routing in </td><td>App Router with nested layouts and server components</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamic  updates in server components</td></tr><tr><td>Static file serving at </td><td> with built-in image optimization</td></tr><tr><td> or  in a client component</td><td>Fetch data directly in server component, RSC fetch</td></tr><tr><td>Component state with </td><td> in client components ()</td><td>Server-rendered props via RSC + cookies/session context</td></tr><tr><td>Local dev server with Webpack</td><td>Webpack + incremental adoption of Turbopack</td></tr><tr><td>Environment variables in </td><td>Same, plus bundle for the browser with  prefix</td><td>Same, plus runtime env vars via Docker image</td></tr><tr><td>Requires separate Node server</td><td>Built-in API routes ()</td></tr><tr><td>User-installed Jest or Vitest</td><td>User-installed Jest or Vitest (no native test runner)</td></tr><tr><td>CSS with plain files or modules</td><td>Global CSS and CSS Modules supported, built-in code-splitting</td><td>Full support for Tailwind, Sass, PostCSS, and scoped CSS</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The initial setup and much of the configuration of Next.js will seem familiar to CRA users. Like CRA, Next.js has a one-line  command: . For TypeScript users, adding the  flag means your project is automatically configured for TypeScript, much like the  flag for CRA. Both frameworks ship with Webpack, but Next.js also includes <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turbopack</a>, a newer and in most cases more performant bundler from the Next.js team. For testing, CRA uses Jest under the hood, while Next.js leaves it up to the user to choose a testing library.</p><p>The main differences between the two frameworks mainly come down to the features Next.js offers that aren't available in CRA. These can be divided into two categories: performance improvements and developer experience (DX) improvements.</p><p>Performance improvements:</p><ul><li>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for faster initial loads</li><li>Image optimization for responsive, lazy-loaded images</li><li>Built-in code splitting by default at the page level</li><li>Edge and serverless function support</li></ul><ul><li>File-based routing, so no need to manually configure routes</li><li>API routes - build backend logic right in your app</li><li>Built-in support for layouts and nested routing in the App Router</li><li>Next.js Middleware makes A/B testing, i18n, etc. much easier to implement</li></ul><p>Now that we've seen how Next.js compares feature-for-feature with CRA, the next question is: why make the switch at all?</p><p>If you have a legacy app or side project that hasn't been updated in years, you may be wondering why bother migrating if the CRA setup is working? For deployed apps, the answer is vulnerabilities: at some point, you or dependabot will need to update a library with high severity vulnerabilities, and will likely run into the dreaded <code>Conflicting peer dependency</code> error. As CRA's dependencies are no longer being updated, that error is more likely to occur the longer you wait.</p><p>Additionally, you'll need to migrate if you want to get newer versions of core libraries such as TypeScript or React. While React 19 currently works with CRA, TypeScript is sadly stuck at version 4, meaning you won't get the speed or size improvements or expanded ESM support of version 5.</p><p>But the best reason to migrate is to take advantage of Next.js server-side features and built-in optimizations. So, let's explore some migration strategies next.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Migrating an existing CRA app to Next.js with client-side features only\n</h2><p>If you're ready to migrate an existing CRA app to Next.js but want to start with a 1:1 move that keeps your app functioning as a single-page client-side app (SPA), the  directory is the best place to begin. This setup allows you to preserve familiar patterns while getting immediate benefits like built-in routing.</p><p>Let's walk through migrating a simple component; in this case, a minimal login UI from a CRA app:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In Next.js, we would first create , to replace , then move the component mostly as-is to the new file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is still a purely client-side component. You get immediate access to Next.js features like routing without giving up control over how your app behaves. To complete the example, we also need to add a login endpoint under :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Pretty straightforward, with minimal code changes. Of course, in a large codebase, things can get more complex, so if you want to see what a migration like this looks like in practice, see <a href=\"https://github.com/bildungsroman/case-study/commit/255e44254482c1e4a0020e1164659abc3dbeb289\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this commit</a> of a working example app. If you have an existing CRA app that you're ready to migrate to Next.js, you can follow this <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/migrating/from-create-react-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">step-by-step migration guide</a>.</p><p>The migration guide and commit linked above offer examples of straightforward, 1:1 SPA migrations. But to really take advantage of Next.js, let's see what a migration to using server-side rendering (SSR) looks like.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Migrate a SPA to React Server Components\n</h2><p>While migrations are often done out of necessity, they can also serve as an opportunity to make significant performance improvements and modernize a legacy app's architecture. Refactoring an SPA to use server components will reduce your client-side JavaScript bundle size, improving initial load times and your users' experience. Server components also allow for resolving authentication state server-side, which has the added benefit of being more secure while also reducing load times. And the final bonus: server-rendered content is better for search engines, if SEO is important to you. <a href=\"https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">React Server Components</a> go one step further than SSR, allowing parts of the component tree to render only on the server, never reaching the client as JavaScript.</p><p>What does this look like in practice? Let's return to our authentication example, now migrated to the App Router. In a server component like , we use  to access login state directly from the server:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Only the  component remains client-side. This keeps the interactive part of the app lightweight, while moving the auth check to the server where it belongs:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This structure allows the app to render personalized content without requiring a round trip to the client to determine the user's session. It's a small change that brings meaningful performance and security improvements. To see what this looks like in an existing codebase, <a href=\"https://github.com/bildungsroman/case-study/commit/c50dfe3ce02a33137a1055249ade0c8caf99d34e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this commit</a> from the same repository referenced earlier shows a migration from client components to using server-side API routes and middleware.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Stretch goal: implement Partial Prerendering for the best of both worlds\n</h2><p>If you want to go even further into Next.js's experimental features, you can implement <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Partial Prerendering</a> (PPR) in the same component. While React Server Components are great for applications that need real-time dynamic data, and static generation is great for infrequently updated data, such as content from a CMS, PPR is a new feature that gives you the best of both. PPR uses React Suspense to separate dynamic content from static content, allowing Next.js to pre-render the static content at build time, while dynamic content is streamed at runtime from the server.</p><p>Here's an example of our auth component using PPR. First, we'd create a dynamic user component and skeleton:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, using , we designate the dynamic part of our page while allowing the remainder to load as static content:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With just a few tweaks, our legacy CRA auth code has evolved into a modern, flexible component that plays nicely with both static and dynamic rendering.</p><p>So yes, it's always a little sad to say goodbye to an old tool, especially one that's been part of your team's routine. But as we've seen, moving from CRA to Next.js doesn't mean starting over. It just means migrating to a more flexible, more capable way of building React apps.</p>","contentLength":8285,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Temporary Email: Privacy Guardians in the Digital Age","url":"https://dev.to/john_wilson/temporary-email-privacy-guardians-in-the-digital-age-44kn","date":1751422515,"author":"John Wilson","guid":179547,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today's world of increasing information security awareness, more and more people are focusing on online privacy protection. Questions like \"When should I use a temporary email?\" and \"What risks exist when using my real email?\" frequently appear in daily conversations. This article will delve into the value of temporary email addresses, share practical scenarios, and provide security advice to help you better protect your personal privacy in the digital world.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Typical Application Scenarios for Temporary Email\n</h2><p>With the booming development of AI technology, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and various AI writing tools are emerging one after another, most requiring email registration to experience them. However, not every AI product is worth leaving your real email information for.</p><p>: I once had high expectations for a highly recommended AI drawing tool and registered with my real email without hesitation. The product experience was mediocre, but I began receiving product update emails every day. Although unsubscribing is an option, who can guarantee that your email address hasn't been sold to other marketing agencies?</p><p>: First try with a temporary email, and if the product is truly excellent, consider re-registering with your real email – protecting your privacy while not missing out on quality services.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Software Downloads and Trials\n</h3><p>Many software manufacturers adopt a \"free trial\" marketing strategy that seems attractive on the surface but often comes with:</p><ul><li>Frequent reminder emails about the trial period ending soon</li><li>Continuous feature upgrade notifications</li><li>Various \"user research\" and \"product feedback\" requests</li></ul><p>: After downloading an image editing software, my inbox received over 30 related emails in just one month! Experience tells me that temporary email addresses are ideal for these situations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Development and Testing Work\n</h3><p>For programmers, product managers, or testers, temporary emails are essential tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Registration Process Testing</strong>: Verifying the completeness and reliability of email sending functions</li><li><strong>Multi-User Scenario Simulation</strong>: Evaluating system performance under different user conditions</li><li>: Testing key features like email notifications and password resets</li><li>: When creating numerous test accounts is needed</li></ul><p>During product testing phases, you might need to create dozens of test accounts. Using real emails is not only impractical but would also lead to inbox management chaos.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Competitive Analysis Research\n</h3><p>When conducting market research, registering for competitors' services to understand their product strategies and marketing methods is a common practice. Using temporary emails has significant advantages here:</p><ul><li>Effectively protects identity information, avoiding exposure of research intentions</li><li>Specifically observes competitors' email marketing strategies and user communication methods</li><li>Prevents marketing emails from interfering with daily work and personal inboxes</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. One-Time Event Participation\n</h3><p>Online prize drawings, free resource downloads, and webinars usually require providing an email address. These situations are particularly suitable for temporary emails:</p><ul><li>No longer receiving related emails after the event ends, reducing information interference</li><li>Avoiding having your email added to various marketing databases</li><li>Important notifications (such as winning information) are usually communicated through other channels</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Potential Risk Analysis of Using Real Email Addresses\n</h2><p>Many people might think \"it's just a few spam emails,\" but the actual risks far exceed imagination:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Commercial Trading of Email Addresses\n</h3><p>This is the most prevalent risk. Unscrupulous websites may sell user email information to marketing companies, causing your email to appear in countless marketing databases. One of my friends receives hundreds of spam emails daily because of this, making management difficult.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Phishing Email Threats\n</h3><p>When your email is exposed in various databases, the probability of becoming a phishing attack target greatly increases. Scammers will impersonate websites you've registered with, sending fake emails like \"account abnormality\" or \"password about to expire\" to induce clicking on malicious links.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Chain Leakage of Personal Information\n</h3><p>Email addresses are usually associated with other personal information, such as real names and phone numbers. Once an email leaks, it may trigger wider exposure of personal information, constituting privacy security risks.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Decreased Work Efficiency\n</h3><p>Spam email flooding seriously affects normal email processing efficiency. Data shows that professionals may spend 30 minutes or more daily clearing spam emails, which is undoubtedly a waste of time resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Email Security Usage Strategies\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Layered Management Approach\n</h3><p>I recommend adopting a \"layered use\" strategy, rationally allocating services of different importance:</p><ol><li>: Dedicated to the most important services, such as bank accounts, work communications, and main social media</li><li>: Used for general service registrations, such as e-commerce platforms and commonly used software</li><li>: Suitable for one-time needs, test experiences, and trial evaluations</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Choosing Reliable Temporary Email Services\n</h3><p>There are many temporary email services in the market. When choosing, consider these key factors:</p><ul><li>: Ensuring stable access when needed</li><li>: Not recording or leaking email content, protecting user privacy</li><li>: Intuitive and concise interface, convenient and efficient operation</li><li>: Supporting multiple domain choices, providing email favorites functionality</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Practical Application Experience Sharing\n</h2><p>While recently using <a href=\"https://tempmail100.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temp Mail</a> for work, I discovered a particularly practical application scenario:</p><p>When testing the new user registration process for the company, I needed to create multiple test accounts. Previously, when using other temporary email services, I frequently encountered problems like domains being blocked or emails expiring too quickly, causing testing interruptions. This service solved key pain points:</p><ul><li>Provides multiple domain choices, ensuring there are always available options</li><li>Email favorites feature supports long-term retention of test emails</li><li>Fast generation speed, seamlessly integrated into the testing process</li></ul><p>Now, I save commonly used test emails as favorites and call them directly when needed, greatly improving work efficiency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Regular Maintenance Management\n</h3><p>Even if you adopt a layered strategy, you should regularly maintain your email:</p><ul><li>Clean up unnecessary emails, keeping the inbox tidy</li><li>Proactively unsubscribe from mailing lists you no longer follow</li><li>Regularly update email addresses and security settings for important services</li><li>Check suspicious login or registration emails to detect security threats early</li></ul><p>Temporary email, as a simple yet practical technical tool, can effectively protect personal privacy and improve work efficiency in various scenarios. The key is to clearly understand when to use it and when not to.</p><p>Remember this core principle: For services of questionable reliability or only temporary use, choose <a href=\"https://tempmail365.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temporary email</a> for important services used long-term, use your real email.</p><p>In the digital age of information explosion, learning to protect personal privacy has become an essential skill. <a href=\"https://tempmail365.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temporary email</a> may be small, but it can provide an extra layer of protection for your digital life. By reasonably utilizing this tool, you can better control personal information security while enjoying digital convenience.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Recommended Temporary Email Services\n</h2>","contentLength":7555,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Poetry and Horizon of Code Elegant Framework Philosophy and Developer Mental Model（1751422478272900）","url":"https://dev.to/member_a5799784/poetry-and-horizon-of-code-elegant-framework-philosophy-and-developer-mental-model1751422478272900-3f0k","date":1751422480,"author":"member_a5799784","guid":179546,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

This ease of adoption is a testament to its well-abstracted yet flexible interfaces and a deep understanding of the developer's mindset.</p><p>Modularity and extensibility are thoughtfully designed. It provides elegant, out-of-the-box solutions for common needs such as logging, parameter validation, and authentication. It leverages a powerful macro system, a feature popular in languages that prioritize efficiency, to generate code at compile time. This significantly reduces boilerplate and enhances code reusability. Defining a RESTful API endpoint, for instance, might require only a few lines of code, with the framework adeptly handling routing, request parsing, and response serialization.</p><p>I also appreciated its support for modern web trends, including native WebSocket capabilities. When tasked with building a real-time campus event notification system, its WebSocket module proved to be both easy to integrate and highly performant, facilitating bidirectional communication without the need for additional external libraries. This is a significant advantage for agile development methodologies and maintaining a unified technology stack.</p><p><strong>A Quiet Comparison: Discerning the Truth</strong></p><p>Throughout my studies, I've encountered a multitude of web frameworks. Some boast vast ecosystems, others offer convenient Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), or excel in specific niche areas. However, this \"unsung hero\" impressed me the most with its exceptional balance between raw performance and developer-centric experience.</p><p>For high-concurrency applications, developers often find themselves needing to fine-tune thread pools, integrate message queues, or implement complex caching mechanisms. This framework, with its robust underlying architecture, frequently allows developers to concentrate primarily on business logic. Its speed is a product of sophisticated design, not achieved by sacrificing code elegance.</p><p>While some frameworks are straightforward to begin with, they can become restrictive as projects scale, often leading to bloated and unwieldy codebases. This framework, with its flexible design philosophy and effective use of metaprogramming, consistently offers concise and maintainable solutions, making the code feel more \"alive\" and adaptable.</p><p><strong>Future Outlook: Journeying with Giants</strong></p><p>As a newcomer to the software development industry, I feel fortunate to have discovered such an outstanding framework so early in my journey. It has not only improved my development efficiency but also broadened my technical horizons and deepened my understanding of what constitutes a high-performance application.</p><p>I am aware that the long-term success of any framework heavily relies on its community and ecosystem. Although it may not yet possess the widespread recognition of established industry giants, I firmly believe that its excellent performance, superior development experience, and forward-thinking design will carve out a significant place for it in the web development landscape, potentially even setting new trends.</p><p>My exploration of this framework has only just begun. However, I have a strong sense that this \"unsung hero\" will become an invaluable partner throughout my career. If you are someone who is curious about pushing the boundaries of technology and unwilling to compromise on quality, I encourage you to explore it. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised, just as I was.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive: The Framework's Core \"Secret Sauce\"</strong></p><p>To truly appreciate its efficiency, one must examine its core architecture. It's not merely a superficial wrapper around existing technologies; it embodies a meticulously crafted design. As an experienced architect once stated, \"An excellent system's elegance often stems from a profound understanding and ultimate application of first principles.\"</p><p>This framework is built using Rust. The inherent memory safety and concurrency advantages of Rust provide a solid foundation for developing high-performance applications. The absence of a garbage collector grants developers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, thereby avoiding common performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, Rust's ownership system eliminates many concurrency-related problems at compile time, which offers significant peace of mind when building high-concurrency servers.</p><p>It deeply integrates the Tokio asynchronous runtime. Tokio, being Rust's most mature and widely adopted asynchronous solution, offers powerful non-blocking I/O capabilities. When an operation is waiting for external resources, such as network requests, it yields system resources to other tasks, thereby enhancing overall concurrency. While reading its source code was a challenging endeavor, it revealed an unwavering commitment to maximizing resource utilization and meticulous attention to detail. The design aims for both \"ease of use\" and \"high efficiency.\"</p><p>It also employs coroutines (or lightweight threads) effectively. Each incoming request is treated as an independent execution unit, collaborating efficiently under the asynchronous runtime environment. This model incurs lower context-switching overhead compared to traditional multi-threading approaches and can support a vast number of concurrent connections. This brought to mind concepts from operating systems courses, validating theoretical knowledge with practical application. True \"speed\" often originates from system-level architectural innovation, not solely from algorithmic optimization.</p>","contentLength":7856,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Better safe than sorry","url":"https://dev.to/adarshmaharjan/better-safe-than-sorry-2c7m","date":1751415015,"author":"Adarsh","guid":179419,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>How to remove a leaked .env file from GitHub permanently...</h2>","contentLength":59,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/adarshmaharjan/-f9p","date":1751414978,"author":"Adarsh","guid":179418,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>How to remove a leaked .env file from GitHub permanently...</h2>","contentLength":59,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gemini CLI: O Agente de IA do Google Para o Terminal dos Desenvolvedores","url":"https://dev.to/ikauedev/gemini-cli-o-agente-de-ia-do-google-para-o-terminal-dos-desenvolvedores-4eg1","date":1751414827,"author":"Kauê Matos","guid":179417,"unread":true,"content":"<p>O Gemini CLI é uma ferramenta inovadora desenvolvida pelo Google que traz o poder do modelo de inteligência artificial Gemini diretamente para o terminal de comandos.

Whether retrieving request information or setting responses, everything follows the same naming pattern, allowing developers to get up to speed quickly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Method Chaining: Fluent Programming Experience\n</h2><p>Another highlight of Context design is support for method chaining, making code very fluent and readable:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Method chaining not only makes code more concise but also reduces repetitive  prefixes, improving code readability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Attribute System: Flexible Data Passing\n</h2><p>Context's attribute system is a very powerful feature that allows data passing between different stages of request processing:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example shows how to use the attribute system to pass data between middleware and route handlers, achieving a loosely coupled design.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Type-Safe Attribute Access\n</h2><p>Context's attribute system is not only flexible but also type-safe, thanks to Rust's type system:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real Application Experience\n</h2><p>In my projects, Context design brought significant improvements to development experience:</p><ol><li>: Consistent API design helped me quickly master all functionalities</li><li>: Method chaining and clear method naming make code self-documenting</li><li>: Compile-time checking prevents runtime errors</li><li>: Lightweight design doesn't impact application performance</li></ol><p>Through actual usage, I found:</p><ul><li>Development efficiency improved by 60%</li><li>API usage errors almost eliminated</li></ul><p>Context's design philosophy embodies the principle of \"simple but not simplistic.\" It abstracts complex HTTP processing into a simple, consistent interface, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than framework details.</p>","contentLength":2262,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Secure E-commerce Platform on AWS-Infrastructure","url":"https://dev.to/isaac_obuor_4ec2278316110/secure-e-commerce-platform-on-aws-infrastructure-4791","date":1751406593,"author":"Isaac Obuor","guid":179334,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This comprehensive project will give you hands-on experience with all the AWS services mentioned in the job posting.

In order to build a culture informed by observability, it must first be easily understood.</p><p>One simple way to do this that many elite teams have embraced is a strategy of using a golden metric to simplify observability.</p><p>A single golden metric can help in surfacing business critical issues. While the specific metric varies product to product depending on the case, selecting a key indicator makes assessing general product health much simpler.</p><p>Netflix Engineering, in their tech blog, outlines how they use Streams per Second (SPS) as their primary service health metric. Since streaming is core to their business, an irregularity in SPS is a strong signal that they’re experiencing a significant problem.</p><p>By embedding this metric into company-wide language, going so far as to categorize all production incidents as “SPS impacting” or “not SPS impacting”, they frame observability as a shared cultural touchstone across teams.</p><p>This clarity is critical. Just like how a doctor relies on pulse and blood pressure as primary indicators of our body’s health, teams can trust a golden metric to get a broad sense of their product’s health.</p><p>However, our doctor probably could run more tests than pulse and blood pressure if they needed to. Similarly, more complex metrics inform deeper investigation.</p><p>This is likely too product specific to generalize, but ideally for these smaller metrics, the reasoning behind following a metric should ideally be largely understandable to non-technical team members. This opens up access to our source of truth (more on this later).</p><p>Unfortunately, even well-intentioned teams can sabotage their observability culture through alert fatigue. When every service anomaly triggers a page, teams quickly learn to ignore or delay responding to alerts, eroding trust in your team's monitoring systems.</p><p>The golden metric approach directly combats this by establishing clear hierarchy: alerts tied to your core business metric demand immediate attention, while secondary metrics can trigger notifications that are reviewed during regular business hours. This prevents the all-too-common scenario where engineers become numb to constant noise, ultimately missing the signals that actually matter for user experience and business impact.</p><p>When simplified, metrics and dashboards become more easily referenced, conversationally and otherwise, building a foundation for observability minded decision making across the organization.</p><p>*<em>Monitoring Embedded in Rituals\n*</em>\nThere’s no way to be randomly attentive to observability.</p><p>As workloads increase, vibe-based investment in telemetry metrics ends up just becoming convenience-based. In order to be proactive, it’s useful to embed consideration of observability into defined rituals.</p><p>Stand-ups, retros, and incident reviews are all rituals that can be used as an opportunity to survey dashboards, key metrics, and relevant traces.</p><p>GitLab showcases the power of this approach through their experience operationalizing Observability-Based Performance Testing. Their aim was to embed observability culture deeply into operations to proactively and systematically identify potential performance problems.</p><p>In an initial implementation, they primarily focused on adapting rituals to promote observability culture. In their canary group, 5 minutes of daily standup was carved out to scan dashboards and cut tickets for any anomalies.</p><p>They attributed this simple discipline as being responsible for “maintaining a 99.999% uptime during 10x growth period” and consistently meeting performance KPIs. A testament to how consistently proactive observability practices enable performance at scale.</p><p>Non-event based rituals can be used as well. Adopting Observability as Code (OaC) intuitively ingrains observability changes into existing development workflows, ensuring they are reviewed and well documented like a code contribution.</p><p>Some teams even go so far as to weave observability directly into the service of their core product. For example, teams like Ritual use triggers in their feature flags to tie components of their product to real-time monitors.</p><p>Although each team’s implementation will differ, establishing consistent observability routines serve to build a more proactive culture, shifting teams towards prevention rather than firefighting.</p><p>*<em>Telemetry is the source of truth\n*</em>\nWithout telemetry grounding every conversation about product usage and user behavior, teams often fall back on subjective assumptions. While anecdotal feedback has its place, the overhead of reconciling opinions simply isn’t worth it, and risks producing decisions that don’t align with actual customer needs..</p><p>That’s why telemetry must be treated as a first-class citizen: the definitive source of truth for an organization to rely on.</p><p>Stripe emphasizes this point in their AWS blog detailing their transition from a traditional time-series database to cloud-hosted Prometheus and Grafana for storing observability metrics.</p><p>One key decision to note about the migration process is that Stripe didn’t just switch metrics from one service to another and expect their engineers to adapt overnight. They recognized that rapid, mandatory migration would risk damaging their observability culture and undermine the perceived reliability and importance of these metrics.</p><p>Instead, they opted to write metrics to both the old and new services simultaneously, asking engineering teams to manually verify parity. They gradually built confidence using team-wide trainings, internal documentation practices, office hours, and internal champions, ensuring that respect for observability as the trusted source of truth endured across their engineering team.</p><p>This principle even extends beyond engineering teams.</p><p>As the definitive source of truth for product usage, observability metrics are equally critical to technical support, product, and customer success teams. By championing observability as a shared source of truth, every team gains a powerful tool to advocate effectively on level footing.</p><p>By consistently applying a unified, metrics-driven view as the single source of truth, observability culture empowers an entire organization to discuss product usage in lock-step and maintain cohesive, objective communication across all functions.</p><p>Observability culture is not a one-time project, but an evolving mindset.</p><p>Across these companies, despite differing implementations, the principles remain consistent: prioritize obvious metrics, embed monitoring into rituals, and treat telemetry as the ultimate source of truth.</p><p>Netflix, Stripe, and GitLab earned their reputations as elite engineering organizations partly because they mastered this culture. Their systems reliability and product stability at scale show that an investment in observability culture is one of the highest-leverage moves any team can make.</p>","contentLength":7967,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Playing with Stemming","url":"https://dev.to/erikhatcher/playing-with-stemming-5cad","date":1751406297,"author":"Erik Hatcher","guid":179331,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Playground \"unit test\" technique\n</h2><p>Before we get into the textual analysis stemming topic, I want to share a different way of displaying search results in a playground.

Let’s explore the three fundamental types it offers.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The  Outcome: Eliminating null and </h3><p>The  outcome tackles the problem of null. Instead of a value that can be  or , an  can be one of two things:</p><ul><li>: A box containing a value of type .</li><li>: A box representing the absence of a value.</li></ul><p><strong>Why is this better than null?</strong> Because the type system forces you to deal with the absence. No more “<strong>Error: Unexpected null value</strong>” or . You must open the box to get the value!</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Notice how clean that is? No  check. The  box handles it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The  and  Outcomes: Eliminating try-catch\n</h3><p>Operations that can fail, like parsing a number or decoding JSON, traditionally force us to write try-catch blocks. The outcome-based approach is to make failure a predictable, manageable value instead of an application-halting exception.</p><ul><li>A  is a simple wrapper that is either  (success) or  (failure).</li><li>A  is a powerful constructor for a . It executes a synchronous function for you and automatically catches any exceptions, wrapping the outcome in a .</li></ul><p><strong>Why is this better than try-catch?</strong> It transforms unpredictable runtime exceptions into a predictable return value. Your function’s signature declares that it can fail, and the caller must handle that possibility. There are no hidden exceptions waiting to crash your program.</p><p>Let’s write a parsing function that is truly exception-free.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Result: 200\nFailed to parse: FormatException: Invalid radix-10 number at character 1\nHello!\n^\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The  Outcome: Taming Asynchronous Failures\n</h3><p>An  outcome combines the concepts of  and . It’s a box that represents a value that will resolve in the future to either an  or an . It’s the ultimate tool for robust asynchronous pipelines, as it handles both network/IO exceptions and logical failures.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Big Payoff: Building an Unbreakable Pipeline\n</h2><p>Let’s put it all together. Imagine a common real-world scenario:</p><p>For a given user ID, fetch the user’s configuration data from an API, parse it as JSON, and then safely extract a deeply nested, optional setting: <code>config.notifications.sound</code>.</p><p>This process can fail at every single step:</p><ul><li>The network request to fetch  could fail (no internet, 404, etc.).</li><li>The response body might not be valid JSON.</li><li>The JSON might be valid, but the  key could be missing.</li><li>The  key could be missing.</li><li>The  key could be missing.</li></ul><p>Here’s how you’d build this logic robustly with outcomes from the <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/df_safer_dart\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">df_safer_dart</a> package.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Define the failable operations using outcomes\n</h3><p>We wrap our primitive operations, letting the outcome types handle the error context.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Chain them together into a beautiful, linear flow\n</h3><p>Now we compose these functions. We’ll use  to chain operations. If any step produces an , all subsequent  calls in the chain are automatically skipped.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Execute and handle the final result\n</h3><p>Finally, we run our pipeline and use  to handle the final outcome in a type-safe way.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Processing User ID: 1\n  -&gt; Success: Sound setting is chime.mp3\n\nProcessing User ID: 2\n  -&gt; Success: Sound setting was not specified.\n\nProcessing User ID: 3\n  -&gt; Success: Sound setting was not specified.\n\nProcessing User ID: 4\n  -&gt; Failure: An error occurred: Exception: User Not Found\n\nProcessing User ID: 5\n  -&gt; Failure: An error occurred: Exception: User Not Found\n</code></pre></div><p>This is the power of outcome-based design in Dart. The  function is a clean, declarative, and robust description of a complex operation. Every potential point of failure is handled gracefully and implicitly by the outcome wrappers. You write the code for the ideal scenario, and the outcomes take care of the messy reality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why You Should Use This Pattern\n</h2><ol><li><strong>Eliminates Error-Prone Boilerplate:</strong> You no longer write  or . This removes entire classes of common bugs.</li><li><strong>Explicitness and Predictability:</strong> Failures are not hidden exceptions; they are predictable values encoded in the type system. You are forced to handle them.</li><li> You build complex operations from small, simple, and independently testable functions.</li><li> Your code describes what you want to achieve (the happy path), not the low-level mechanics of how you’re avoiding crashes.</li><li> For the critical parts of your application, this pattern creates pipelines that don’t just handle errors — they are fundamentally designed around them, making them resilient by construction.</li></ol><p>To get started with these powerful patterns in your own Dart or Flutter projects, check out the <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/df_safer_dart\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">df_safer_dart</a> package on pub.dev.</p>","contentLength":6029,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Domain Mapping Architecture（1751405750066100）","url":"https://dev.to/member_a5799784/domain-mapping-architecture1751405750066100-262p","date":1751405752,"author":"member_a5799784","guid":179327,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

In one project, delivered by a software house, we had to fully refactor it before going live due to excessive domain, pass-through, shared data, and content coupling. These interdependencies made the services fragile and undermined their autonomy, scalability, and maintainability.</p><p>Understanding the different forms of coupling and their implications is essential for designing robust and scalable microservice systems.</p><p>Before we explore the types of coupling, let’s understand how components communicate in different architectural styles.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Component Communication: In-Process vs. Inter-Process\n</h3><p>In monolithic systems, modules interact within the same process, sharing memory, objects, and direct calls. This in-process communication is fast, reliable, and flexible. Although coupling exists between modules, developers can manage them more easily since everything resides in the same space and they can coordinate changes directly.</p><p>In contrast, microservices-based architectures run each service in separate processes, often in distributed environments. Inter-process communication occurs over the network using REST APIs, asynchronous events, and gRPC, among others. This introduces challenges such as latency, network failures, versioning, and observability, requiring well-defined contracts and service decoupling. </p><p>Thus, while coupling in monolithic systems is more tolerable, it can directly compromise system autonomy, scalability, and resilience in microservices.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How Communication Affects Coupling in Microservices\n</h3><p>The way services or modules communicate determines the type and severity of coupling. In monoliths, content coupling or shared data coupling is common (we’ll discuss these later), as modules can access each other’s internal structures directly.</p><p>In microservices, the ideal is to maintain loose domain coupling, where services depend only on public, stable contracts, such as APIs or events, and never on internal logic or data structures. This separation preserves service autonomy and prevents cascading side effects.</p><p>Now that we understand the different communication contexts and their impact on coupling, let’s examine the main types of coupling.</p><p>Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between two modules or services and how much one must know or rely on the other to function properly. The lower the coupling, the greater the service autonomy and flexibility.</p><p>Not all coupling is inherently bad; eliminating it completely is unfeasible in real-world systems. The goal is to reduce unnecessary or harmful forms of coupling as much as possible.</p><p> presents the four main types of coupling that can occur between microservices, ordered from the most desirable (low coupling) to the least desirable (high coupling).</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7trvbcatpr1ez4a8vgvz.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7trvbcatpr1ez4a8vgvz.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: Types of coupling in order of increasing dependency\" width=\"602\" height=\"201\"></a> Types of coupling in order of increasing dependency</p><p>The most common types of coupling in microservices are domain coupling, pass-through coupling, shared data coupling, and content coupling, which are ordered in increasing dependency. They are organized from the most desirable (low coupling) to the least desirable (high coupling).</p><p>Designing effective microservices requires careful attention to these forms of dependency and applying best practices to mitigate them, such as using asynchronous events, well-defined APIs, and clear separation of responsibilities. Next, we analyze each of these types, starting with domain coupling.</p><p>Domain coupling occurs when one microservice directly depends on another to perform a business function. It is a common and acceptable type of dependency in microservices since each service handles a specific business domain. Communication between services is natural to fulfill broader system requirements. For example, in a digital library system, a Loan service might need to query a User service to obtain user details such as name, email, address, and the Catalog service to get book details.  illustrates domain coupling between the loans, users, and catalog services.</p><p>The Loan service is domain-coupled with both the User and Catalog services. The Catalog service is also domain-coupled with the Loan service, while the User service remains independent and has no domain coupling to other services.</p><p>It is worth noting that domain coupling becomes particularly problematic when the boundaries of responsibility between services are not clearly defined. In many projects, the lack of explicit domain modeling leads to situations where one service depends on rules or decisions belonging to another or, worse, replicates them in parallel. This results in data inconsistencies, duplicated logic, semantic coupling, and difficulty evolving the system.</p><p>Without clear boundaries, what would be a natural coupling, such as querying data from a neighboring domain, becomes a fragile and dysfunctional link that requires coordinated deployments, increases the risk of regressions, and undermines service autonomy. In the long run, the system loses the benefits of modularity and tends to become a distributed monolith, where everything depends on everything else.</p><p>Therefore, defining business domains, as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) proposed, is fundamental to ensure that domain coupling remains healthy and controlled.</p><p>Pass-through Coupling occurs when a service passes data to another, not because it needs the data itself, but because a third service will use it.  illustrates a pass-through coupling scenario where the delivery of a book needs to notify other users about its availability via email.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffn7gjbf181y3clbyv73d.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffn7gjbf181y3clbyv73d.png\" alt=\"Pass-through coupling\" width=\"621\" height=\"92\"></a> Pass-through coupling</p><p>The loan service queries the User service to retrieve user emails and passes them to the Notification service. The Loan service merely forwards the user data to the notification service without using it directly, creating a pass-through coupling.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Drawbacks of Pass-Through coupling\n</h4><p>Pass-through coupling may initially seem harmless, but it introduces several architectural issues that undermine distributed systems’ cohesion, maintainability, and evolution. The harms of pass-through coupling are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increase in unnecessary coupling:</strong> The intermediary service, in this case, the Loan service, does not need the data for itself, yet it becomes dependent on the format, semantics, and contract of data that belongs to the Notification service. As a result, changes in the source (User service) or the destination (Notification service) can break the intermediary service (Loan service).</p></li><li><p><strong>Violation of the single responsibility principle:</strong> The intermediary service starts handling responsibilities outside its domain, merely to satisfy the needs of another service. This leads to a loss of cohesion, as the service becomes too aware of foreign domains.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unnecessary exposure of internal details:</strong> Internal data from one service, such as email structure or addresses, is leaked to another service, even if that service doesn’t use it directly. This increases the risk of abstraction leakage and breaks encapsulation.</p></li><li><p> Changes to how data is represented or used now affect three services instead of two: the original producer (User service), the final consumer (Notification service), and the intermediary (loan service). This increases maintenance costs and the risk of regressions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unnecessary complexity in the data flow:</strong> The data path becomes longer and harder to trace. Understanding where the data came from and why it is there becomes more challenging, complicating debugging, observability, and auditing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing and isolation become harder:</strong> Since the intermediary service now depends on the data and contracts of two other services, its tests must mock or simulate more external behaviors, making them more fragile and time-consuming.</p></li></ul><p>Pass-through coupling violates the principles of modularity and service autonomy. It causes a service to become responsible for data and contracts that do not belong to its domain, making the system more rigid, fragile, and difficult to evolve.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  How can we avoid pass-through coupling?\n</h4><p>A viable alternative would be for the Loan service to forward only the IDs of the users waiting for the book delivery to the Notification service. The Notification service would then be responsible for querying the User service to retrieve the corresponding email addresses.  illustrates this alternative.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2un1pf2xosdgubekynz7.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2un1pf2xosdgubekynz7.png\" alt=\"Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling\" width=\"371\" height=\"242\"></a> Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling</p><p>To avoid temporal coupling, a topic that will be addressed later, we can adopt the same logic of interaction between services, but use asynchronous communication via a message broker instead of direct calls.  illustrates this approach.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8bgv6bjmujwa3369gwxs.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8bgv6bjmujwa3369gwxs.png\" alt=\"Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling using message brokers\" width=\"335\" height=\"302\"></a> Alternative to avoid pass-through coupling using message brokers</p><p>As we have seen, pass-through coupling introduces unnecessary dependencies by making a service intermediate data that does not fall under its responsibility. Now, let’s examine shared data coupling.</p><p>At an even more concerning level, shared data coupling occurs when two or more services directly share the same data source, compromising the independence and isolation of functionalities.  illustrates a shared data coupling.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9ivnxr0dgi3stvmkgr3d.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9ivnxr0dgi3stvmkgr3d.png\" alt=\"Shared data coupling\" width=\"301\" height=\"205\"></a> Shared data coupling</p><p>Using the previous scenario where users on the waiting list must be notified of a book delivery, shared data coupling would arise if the Notification service accessed the User service’s database directly to retrieve email addresses.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Drawbacks of shared data coupling\n</h4><p>The main problems associated with shared data coupling are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Loss of service autonomy:</strong> When two or more services access the same data source, be it a database, memory, or shared file system, they are no longer truly autonomous. As a result, any change to the data schema can impact multiple services simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fragility in structural changes:</strong> Since services share the physical data structure, changes such as renaming columns, adding indexes, or modifying constraints require team coordination. This makes independent and safe service evolution more difficult.</p></li><li><p> It becomes nearly impossible to version data independently per service, as all services are tied to the same model and schema. This limits practices such as controlled migrations or safe rollbacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concurrency and integrity conflicts:</strong> Different services may attempt to update the same data simultaneously without orchestration or control logic. This can result in inconsistencies, data loss, or transactional corruption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased testing and deployment complexity:</strong> Integration testing and deployments become more difficult, as a change in one service may require regression testing in all other services that share the data. This leads to tighter organizational coupling, delays, and increased risk in production environments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unintentional exposure of internal structures:</strong> Sharing a data source often reveals implementation details such as relationships and normalization. This can result in misuse, duplicated logic, and inconsistent interpretations of the data across services.</p></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  When shared data coupling may be accepted\n</h4><p>Shared data coupling is one of the most problematic forms of coupling, as it violates the principle of service autonomy. Despite the risks, shared data coupling can be tolerated in specific scenarios, such as reading static data, such as lists of usernames, countries, or even cities, provided this information is relatively stable and rarely changes. However, services should never directly access another service’s database, as when the Notification service accesses the User service’s database.</p><p>In situations like the country list example, a more appropriate approach would be to expose this data through a shared cache, such as Redis, thus preserving the independence between services.</p><p>Next, we will examine content coupling, which is considered the most critical among all coupling types.</p><p>This is the most undesirable type of coupling. It occurs when an external service directly accesses the internal data of another service, modifying its internal state while completely bypassing the API or business logic responsible for protecting that access.  illustrates this scenario.</p><p>Using our digital library case study, this would be equivalent to the Payment service directly accessing the loans table to update the status field to “Regularized” after a fine is paid without calling the Loan service’s API, which should be responsible for validating and applying this change.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Drawbacks of content coupling\n</h3><p>The main consequences of content coupling are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Violation of encapsulation:</strong> The consuming service bypasses the business logic of the service that owns the data, breaking domain boundaries and allowing changes without validation or control.</p></li><li><p><strong>High risk of regressions:</strong> Any change in the internal structure, such as field names, data types, or business rules, can silently break the consuming service. Local tests may fail to catch these issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inability to evolve safely:</strong> The service that owns the data becomes constrained, as it can no longer refactor its internal structure without directly affecting other services. This creates hidden bidirectional coupling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Difficulty in tracing and auditing:</strong> Since changes occur outside the official API, logs, events, and traces become inconsistent. Another service may modify the data without the service owner even realizing it.</p></li></ul><p>Even in emergencies we must avoid the content coupling. Communication between services should always occur through well-defined public interfaces that encapsulate business rules and ensure data consistency. Otherwise, the system becomes fragile, difficult to maintain, and prone to errors that are hard to diagnose.</p><p>Temporal coupling occurs when a service depends on another being available at the exact moment of interaction for a functionality to complete successfully. Unlike logical coupling types such as domain, pass-through, content, or shared data coupling, temporal coupling is related to runtime availability.</p><p>An example would be the Loan service making a synchronous HTTP call to the User service to verify if the user is active before completing a book checkout. The loan process is blocked or fails if the User service is unavailable or experiencing high latency. Figure 8 illustrates a synchronous call to the User service from the Loan service.</p><p>Temporal coupling is not always harmful, but it is essential to recognize its presence. In scenarios where a sequence of microservices communicates synchronously, the challenges of this type of coupling tend to intensify, potentially impacting the system’s scalability and resilience.  presents a blocking, synchronized network call.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2u8fv53lgvftdbvsumae.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2u8fv53lgvftdbvsumae.png\" alt=\"Loan service makes a synchronous call to the user service\" width=\"561\" height=\"92\"></a> Loan service makes a synchronous call to the user service</p><p>One way to reduce temporal coupling is to adopt asynchronous, event-based communication using a broker such as Kafka or RabbitMQ. In addition, it is essential to apply fault-tolerance best practices to mitigate the effects of this type of coupling, such as circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, and degraded responses. The use of local or distributed caching, as well as the separation of critical and non-critical flows, also helps prevent non-essential functionalities from blocking the main operation.</p><p>Designing microservices requires awareness of the different types of coupling, how they arise, and how to mitigate them. Understanding coupling types such as domain, pass-through, shared data, content, and temporal is essential to ensure autonomy, scalability, and maintainability in distributed architectures.</p><p>While certain coupling levels, such as domain coupling, are inevitable, the goal should always be to minimize unnecessary coupling by favoring well-defined contracts, asynchronous event-driven communication, fault tolerance, and proper encapsulation of each service’s responsibilities.</p><p>By correctly identifying the type of coupling involved in an interaction and applying the appropriate strategies to reduce it, we can build more resilient, evolvable systems aligned with the principles of service-oriented architecture. Ultimately, good microservice design depends less on the complete absence of coupling and more on its correct identification, management, and isolation.</p><p>Newman, S. (2021).

No epicentro dessa revolução, os Modelos de Linguagem de Grande Escala (LLMs), como GPT-4 e Gemini 2.5, emergem como ferramentas com capacidades sem precedentes para automatizar tarefas cognitivas, gerar conteúdo e interagir com usuários de forma fluida. No entanto, a verdadeira promessa da IA em ambientes corporativos não reside apenas no poder intrínseco desses modelos, mas em sua capacidade de se integrar e operar de forma harmoniosa dentro dos complexos ecossistemas de software já existentes.</p><p>Esta disciplina, em sua jornada, explorou como a engenharia de prompts nos permite dialogar com esses modelos, extraindo respostas inteligentes e direcionadas. Agora, avançamos para o próximo nível: entender como a IA pode transcender a mera geração de texto para se tornar um agente ativo e estratégico em um ambiente de negócios. A chave para essa evolução está na  – a capacidade de LLMs e outros modelos de IA se comunicarem e colaborarem com sistemas externos, acessando dados, executando ações e orquestrando fluxos de trabalho complexos. Este artigo desvendará os desafios e as soluções para essa integração, com foco em padrões como o <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>, e explorará as vastas oportunidades, bem como os riscos inerentes, que surgem quando a inteligência artificial se conecta plenamente ao ambiente operacional das empresas.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Fragmentação dos LLMs Isolados e as Limitações das APIs Tradicionais\n</h2><p>A ascensão dos  (LLMs) como o GPT-4 e o Gemini 2.5 tem revolucionado a forma como concebemos a interação humano-máquina e a automação de tarefas cognitivas. A capacidade de gerar texto coerente, traduzir idiomas, sumarizar informações e até mesmo codificar tem aberto um leque de oportunidades em diversos setores, desde o atendimento ao cliente até a análise de dados complexos. <strong>No artigo anterior, exploramos em profundidade a Engenharia de Prompt, desvendando como a formulação cuidadosa de instruções e contextos é crucial para extrair o máximo valor desses modelos. Vimos que um LLM, por mais poderoso que seja, depende da qualidade do prompt para gerar respostas precisas e relevantes.</strong> No entanto, a euforia em torno do poder intrínseco desses modelos muitas vezes obscurece um desafio fundamental: a sua <strong>interoperabilidade e integração efetiva</strong> em ecossistemas de software já existentes. Um LLM, por mais eficaz que seja em gerar texto a partir de um prompt, raramente opera em um vácuo. Para que seu potencial seja plenamente explorado em um ambiente de negócios, ele precisa se comunicar de forma fluida e eficiente com bancos de dados, sistemas de CRM, ERPs, APIs de terceiros e uma miríade de outras aplicações.</p><p>A utilização de LLMs de forma isolada, ainda que útil para prototipagem e tarefas pontuais, rapidamente atinge suas limitações em cenários empresariais complexos. Considere, por exemplo, um  de atendimento ao cliente que utiliza um LLM para gerar respostas. Se esse LLM, mesmo com prompts otimizados, não puder acessar o histórico de compras do cliente, o status de um pedido ou informações de estoque em tempo real, sua utilidade será significativamente mitigada. Ele se torna uma ferramenta de comunicação genérica, incapaz de fornecer assistência personalizada e precisa, frustrando tanto o cliente quanto a empresa. Essa desconexão revela a insuficiência de uma abordagem \"\" superficial, onde o LLM é visto apenas como uma <strong>caixa preta de texto-para-texto</strong>, sem considerar as <strong>complexas interações que definem um processo de negócio real</strong>.</p><p>As APIs (<em>Application Programming Interfaces</em>) tradicionais, embora sejam o pilar da conectividade na era digital, também apresentam desafios significativos quando se trata de integrar LLMs de forma sofisticada. Enquanto as APIs permitem a comunicação entre diferentes softwares, elas geralmente são projetadas para requisições e respostas estruturadas, com formatos de dados predefinidos e esquemas rígidos. A natureza fluida e contextualmente rica da linguagem natural, que é a base dos LLMs, muitas vezes não se encaixa perfeitamente nesses modelos. Isso leva a um esforço considerável no desenvolvimento de \"\" e \"\" entre o LLM e as APIs existentes, o que pode introduzir latência, complexidade de manutenção e um alto custo de desenvolvimento. Além disso, a gestão do contexto conversacional, essencial para interações significativas com LLMs, é frequentemente negligenciada ou implementada de forma  nessas integrações, limitando a capacidade do LLM de manter uma \"\" da conversa. <strong>Se na Engenharia de Prompt focamos em como o LLM  instruções para gerar texto, nesta aula, voltamos nossa atenção para como o LLM pode  e  informações de sistemas externos para realizar ações concretas e acessar dados relevantes.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  O Modelo Context Protocol (MCP): Um Paradigma para a Interoperabilidade de LLMs\n</h2><p>Diante dos desafios impostos pela fragmentação dos LLMs isolados e pelas limitações das APIs tradicionais, emerge a necessidade de um padrão robusto para a interoperabilidade, capaz de orquestrar a comunicação entre LLMs e sistemas externos de maneira eficiente e contextualizada. É nesse cenário que o <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> se apresenta como uma solução promissora. O MCP não é apenas mais uma API; <strong>ele representa uma arquitetura conceitual e um conjunto de convenções projetadas para otimizar a interação de LLMs com recursos externos, habilitando-os a atuar como agentes inteligentes em ecossistemas de software complexos</strong>. A sua essência reside na capacidade de fornecer aos LLMs o contexto necessário para que possam não apenas gerar texto, mas também tomar decisões informadas e executar ações no mundo real.</p><p>No cerne do MCP está a ideia de que um LLM pode ser mais do que um gerador de linguagem. Ele pode se tornar um \"\" para um agente de IA, capaz de interagir com ferramentas, acessar informações e modificar o estado de sistemas externos. Imagine um LLM que não só responde a perguntas, mas também pode, por exemplo, consultar um banco de dados de clientes, fazer uma reserva de voo via uma API de viagens, ou até mesmo gerar um relatório financeiro baseado em dados extraídos de um sistema ERP. Para que isso seja possível, o LLM precisa de um mecanismo padronizado para \"\" quais ferramentas estão disponíveis, como usá-las, e como interpretar os resultados de suas chamadas. O MCP fornece essa ponte crucial, definindo um vocabulário comum e um fluxo de comunicação que permite aos LLMs interagir com funcionalidades externas de forma programática. Isso é um salto qualitativo em relação às integrações onde o LLM apenas produz texto para ser processado por outro sistema.</p><p>A arquitetura do MCP envolve a representação de \"\" e \"\" que os LLMs podem invocar. Um recurso <strong>pode ser um banco de dados, um serviço web, ou até mesmo outro modelo de IA</strong> especializado em uma tarefa específica (como reconhecimento de imagem ou análise de sentimentos). As ferramentas, por sua vez, são as <strong>operações ou funções que podem ser executadas nesses recursos</strong>. O MCP define como essas ferramentas são descritas para o LLM, permitindo que ele \"\" a ferramenta mais apropriada para uma determinada tarefa e \"\" os parâmetros necessários para executá-la. Por exemplo, se um LLM precisa obter a temperatura atual de uma cidade, o MCP poderia expor uma ferramenta \"\" com um parâmetro \"\". O LLM, ao receber uma requisição de temperatura, identificaria a necessidade de usar essa ferramenta, extrairia o nome da cidade da requisição do usuário, e formataria a chamada para a ferramenta de acordo com o protocolo. Essa abordagem modular e padronizada simplifica o desenvolvimento e a manutenção de sistemas baseados em LLMs, promovendo a reutilização e a escalabilidade. <strong>A Engenharia de Prompt, neste contexto, se torna a chave para instruir o LLM sobre o \"\" para selecionar a ferramenta correta e para \"\" a intenção do usuário em uma chamada de função estruturada que o MCP pode processar.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Análise de Cenários de Integração: Casos de Sucesso e Desafios Reais\n</h2><p>A adoção do <em>Model Context Protoco*l (MCP) e de abordagens similares para a interoperabilidade de LLMs tem gerado casos de sucesso notáveis, mas também expõe desafios inerentes à complexidade da integração de IA em ambientes de negócios. Um exemplo clássico de sucesso é a **automação do atendimento ao cliente</em>*, onde LLMs integrados via MCP podem acessar bases de conhecimento, históricos de clientes e sistemas de gerenciamento de pedidos. Em vez de apenas responder perguntas frequentes de forma genérica, esses sistemas podem, por exemplo, verificar o status de uma entrega, iniciar um processo de devolução ou até mesmo agendar uma chamada com um atendente humano para casos mais complexos, tudo isso de forma autônoma e contextualmente rica. Isso se traduz em maior eficiência operacional e melhor experiência do cliente. Empresas como a <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com.br/blog/advanced-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk</a> e a <a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/campaign/ai-metrics-guide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intercom</a> têm explorado ativamente essa integração, mostrando o potencial de LLMs para transcender a simples automação e oferecer interações verdadeiramente inteligentes.</p><p>Outro cenário promissor é a <strong>otimização de processos de negócios</strong>, especialmente em áreas como finanças e logística. Um LLM, habilitado pelo MCP, pode ser integrado a sistemas de ERP para analisar dados de vendas, identificar tendências, e até mesmo sugerir ajustes em cadeias de suprimentos. Por exemplo, um LLM poderia analisar dados históricos de vendas e, ao identificar uma anomalia, consultar um sistema de previsão de demanda para propor uma alteração no estoque, comunicando essa sugestão a um gerente via um sistema de notificação. Essa capacidade de interligar dados e ações em diferentes sistemas, mediada por um LLM, demonstra o potencial transformador da IA na tomada de decisões operacionais. A <a href=\"https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/bibin-baby/2025/06/18/ai-powered-ibm-business-automation-workflow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM</a> e a <a href=\"https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SAP</a> têm liderado esforços para integrar LLMs em suas plataformas de automação de processos, vislumbrando um futuro onde a inteligência artificial se torna um componente central da inteligência de negócios.</p><p>No entanto, a jornada da interoperabilidade não está isenta de . Um dos maiores é a <strong>confiabilidade e a \"\" dos LLMs</strong>. Mesmo com o MCP fornecendo as ferramentas corretas, o LLM ainda pode, ocasionalmente, gerar respostas incorretas ou inventar informações, especialmente em cenários complexos ou com dados ambíguos. Isso exige a implementação de mecanismos robustos de <a href=\"https://dev.to/vinicius3w/etica-e-privacidade-na-era-da-ia-dilemas-oportunidades-e-o-futuro-da-governanca-no-cenario-de-f48\"><strong>validação e revisão humana</strong></a>, especialmente em aplicações críticas. A <strong>segurança e a privacidade dos dados</strong> também representam um desafio colossal. Ao permitir que LLMs acessem e manipulem dados sensíveis, é imperativo garantir que todas as interações estejam em conformidade com regulamentações como a  e a , e que haja salvaguardas contra vazamentos e acessos não autorizados. A auditoria das interações do LLM e a implementação de <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/access-management/role-based-access-control-rbac/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">controles de acesso baseados em funções (RBAC)</a> são cruciais. Além disso, a <strong>complexidade de design e depuração</strong> de sistemas baseados em agentes de IA pode ser assustadora. A depuração de um erro que ocorre na interação entre um LLM, um recurso externo e a lógica de negócios exige ferramentas sofisticadas e um profundo entendimento de todo o pipeline de dados.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Design Conceitual de Ferramentas e Recursos MCP: Praticando a Orquestração\n</h2><p>Para aprofundar a compreensão sobre o  (MCP) e sua aplicação prática, é fundamental exercitar o design conceitual de ferramentas e recursos que um LLM poderia utilizar. Imagine um cenário onde estamos construindo um agente de IA para um sistema de gestão de projetos. Este agente precisa ser capaz de realizar tarefas como <strong>criar novas tarefas, atualizar o status de tarefas existentes, atribuir tarefas a membros da equipe, e consultar prazos</strong>. Para que o LLM execute essas ações, precisamos expor um conjunto de ferramentas e recursos que ele possa invocar.</p><p>Primeiramente, identificaríamos os  que o LLM precisaria acessar. Nesse caso, o principal recurso seria o <strong>Sistema de Gerenciamento de Projetos (SGP)</strong>, que armazena todas as informações sobre tarefas, projetos e membros da equipe. Esse SGP poderia ser um software como Jira, Trello, ou uma base de dados interna. O MCP então definiria como o LLM \"\" esse recurso, talvez como uma representação de esquema JSON que descreve as entidades (tarefas, projetos, usuários) e seus atributos. Essa descrição é crucial para que o LLM possa entender a estrutura dos dados que irá manipular.</p><p>Em seguida, conceberíamos as  que o LLM pode usar para interagir com o SGP. Cada ferramenta seria uma função específica que o LLM pode \"\". Por exemplo:</p><ul><li><strong><code>create_task(project_id: str, task_name: str, description: \"str, assignee_id: Optional[str], due_date: Optional[str]) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Esta ferramenta permitiria ao LLM criar uma nova tarefa em um projeto específico, com parâmetros para o nome da tarefa, descrição, responsável e prazo. O LLM precisaria extrair essas informações da requisição do usuário.\"</li><li><strong><code>update_task_status(task_id: str, new_status: str) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Uma ferramenta para atualizar o status de uma tarefa (e.g., \"\", \"\", \"\"), exigindo o ID da tarefa e o novo status.</li><li><strong><code>assign_task(task_id: str, assignee_id: str) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Permite atribuir uma tarefa a um membro da equipe, necessitando do ID da tarefa e do ID do responsável.</li><li><strong><code>get_task_details(task_id: str) -&gt; Dict</code></strong>: Para consultar os detalhes de uma tarefa específica, fornecendo o ID da tarefa e retornando suas informações.</li></ul><p>O MCP não apenas define a assinatura dessas funções, mas também como o LLM \"\" sobre qual ferramenta usar em um dado momento e como formatar a entrada e saída dessas ferramentas. O design cuidadoso dessas ferramentas é um passo crítico, pois elas são a interface entre a capacidade de compreensão e geração de linguagem do LLM e as ações concretas que ele pode realizar no ambiente de negócios. A clareza na descrição das ferramentas e a robustez na manipulação de seus parâmetros são essenciais para evitar erros e garantir que o agente de IA funcione de forma previsível e confiável. Este é o ponto de partida para a criação de sistemas mais complexos, que veremos a seguir.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Próxima Fronteira: Orquestração de Agentes e Fluxos de Trabalho Complexos com LLMs\n</h2><p>Se o  (MCP) fornece a linguagem para que um LLM interaja com o mundo, a  eleva essa capacidade, permitindo que múltiplos LLMs e outros modelos de IA colaborem em tarefas mais sofisticadas e processos de negócios que transcendem a capacidade de um único agente. A complexidade do mundo real raramente se encaixa em uma única interação de pergunta-resposta; em vez disso, exige uma <strong>série orquestrada de ações, decisões e comunicações entre diferentes componentes de software</strong>. É aqui que frameworks de orquestração entram em cena, oferecendo a estrutura para construir \"\" de agentes de IA, cada um com sua especialidade, trabalhando em conjunto para atingir um objetivo comum.</p><p>A emergência de <strong>arquiteturas de múltiplos agentes</strong> sinaliza uma evolução natural na forma como a IA é aplicada. Em vez de ter um LLM monolítico tentando resolver todos os problemas, podemos ter um agente especializado em compreender a intenção do usuário, outro em buscar informações em bancos de dados, um terceiro em gerar código, e assim por diante. Essa divisão de trabalho permite maior modularidade, escalabilidade e, potencialmente, maior precisão, pois cada agente pode ser otimizado para sua tarefa específica. Frameworks como  e  exemplificam essa abordagem, fornecendo abstrações e ferramentas para encadear LLMs, ferramentas e fontes de dados, criando \"\" de raciocínio e ação. Eles permitem definir <strong>fluxos de trabalho complexos</strong>, onde o resultado de uma ação de um agente se torna a entrada para outro, mimetizando a colaboração humana em equipes.</p><p>A gestão do <strong>estado e memória distribuída</strong> é um desafio central nessa orquestração. Em uma conversa ou processo de negócios de longa duração, é crucial que os agentes mantenham um histórico relevante para o contexto. Isso vai além da simples janela de contexto de um LLM; exige mecanismos para persistir e compartilhar informações entre diferentes etapas do processo e entre múltiplos agentes. Ferramentas de banco de dados vetoriais, caches de contexto e sistemas de gerenciamento de sessão tornam-se essenciais para garantir que a inteligência do sistema seja cumulativa e não efêmera. Além disso, a  e a  são aspectos críticos. Como múltiplos agentes tomam decisões e interagem com recursos, pode haver situações de concorrência ou ações contraditórias. Estratégias de arbitragem, sistemas de fila e monitoramento em tempo real são necessários para garantir a coerência e a integridade das operações. A capacidade de depurar e auditar esses fluxos de trabalho complexos, entendendo o raciocínio de cada agente em cada etapa, é vital para a confiabilidade e a responsabilidade.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Engenharia de Prompts e a Gestão do Ciclo de Vida dos Agentes de IA: Operacionalizando a Interoperabilidade\n</h2><p>A eficácia da interação dos LLMs com as ferramentas expostas via MCP, e a precisão de sua colaboração em fluxos de trabalho orquestrados, dependem criticamente de como eles são \"\" ou \"\" via prompts.  Nesta seção, estendemos esse conceito, mostrando como a engenharia de prompts se torna fundamental para a operacionalização dos agentes de IA, permitindo que eles não apenas gerem texto, mas  de forma inteligente e interajam com sistemas externos de forma consistente.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Importância da Engenharia de Prompts na Interação com Ferramentas\n</h3><p>A Engenharia de Prompts, no contexto de agentes de IA, transcende a mera geração de conteúdo. Ela se torna o mecanismo primordial para instruir o LLM sobre:</p><ul><li> Como o LLM decide qual ferramenta (definida via MCP) é a mais adequada para uma determinada solicitação do usuário. Um prompt bem elaborado pode descrever o propósito de cada ferramenta e como ela se relaciona com as intenções do usuário.</li><li><strong>Uso Correto dos Parâmetros:</strong> Uma vez que a ferramenta é selecionada, o LLM precisa extrair os parâmetros corretos da entrada do usuário para invocar a ferramenta. Por exemplo, em um pedido como \"<em>Qual a temperatura em Londres?</em>\", o LLM deve ser promptado para identificar \"\" como o parâmetro \"\" para a ferramenta .</li><li><strong>Interpretação de Resultados:</strong> Após a execução de uma ferramenta, o LLM recebe uma resposta (e.g., dados de um banco de dados, o resultado de uma API). O prompt deve instruir o LLM a interpretar esses resultados e transformá-los em uma resposta coerente e amigável para o usuário, ou a usá-los para uma próxima etapa do raciocínio.</li></ul><p>Técnicas avançadas de prompt, como o <strong><em>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting</em></strong> ou o <strong><em>ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)</em></strong>, são particularmente relevantes aqui. O ReAct, por exemplo, incentiva o LLM a alternar entre \"\" (pensar sobre o problema, planejar a próxima ação) e \"\" (invocar uma ferramenta). Um prompt que incorpora ReAct pode instruir o LLM a primeiro \"\" qual ferramenta usar, depois \"\" chamando a ferramenta, e então \"\" o resultado para continuar o raciocínio. Isso melhora drasticamente a capacidade do LLM de planejar e executar tarefas complexas que envolvem múltiplas interações com ferramentas.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Gestão do Ciclo de Vida dos Agentes de IA (<em>AI Agent Lifecycle Management</em>)\n</h3><p>A construção de um agente de IA não termina com sua primeira implantação. Assim como qualquer software, sistemas baseados em LLMs e orquestração de agentes exigem uma gestão contínua do seu ciclo de vida para garantir sua performance, confiabilidade e adaptabilidade.</p><ul><li><strong>Versionamento de Prompts e Lógica de Orquestração:</strong> À medida que os prompts são refinados e a lógica de orquestração evolui, é crucial versionar essas configurações. Isso permite rastrear mudanças, realizar  em caso de regressões e colaborar eficientemente em equipes.</li><li><strong>Testes e Validação Contínua:</strong> Além dos testes iniciais, os agentes de IA precisam ser submetidos a testes de regressão frequentes. Isso garante que as atualizações nos prompts, nos modelos de LLM subjacentes ou nas integrações externas não introduzam comportamentos indesejados. A criação de conjuntos de dados de teste que cobrem casos de borda e cenários críticos é essencial.</li><li><strong>Mecanismos de  e Tratamento de Erros:</strong> É inevitável que agentes de IA encontrem situações para as quais não foram treinados ou que resultem em falhas de ferramenta/API. Implementar mecanismos de , como encaminhar a solicitação para um operador humano ou fornecer uma resposta padrão, é crucial para manter a experiência do usuário e a robustez do sistema.</li><li><strong>Monitoramento e Observabilidade em Produção:</strong> Ferramentas de monitoramento são indispensáveis para acompanhar o comportamento dos agentes em tempo real. Isso inclui rastrear a taxa de sucesso das chamadas de ferramentas, a latência, o uso de recursos e, crucialmente, identificar padrões de \"\" ou comportamento inesperado. A observabilidade permite que as equipes respondam rapidamente a problemas e coletem dados para futuras otimizações de prompts e orquestração.</li><li> O ambiente de negócios e os dados evoluem constantemente. Os agentes de IA precisam se adaptar a essas mudanças. Um ciclo de  contínuo, onde o desempenho é avaliado, os dados de uso são analisados e os prompts/orquestrações são ajustados, é vital para manter a relevância e a eficácia do sistema ao longo do tempo. Isso minimiza o risco de \"\" e garante que o agente continue a entregar valor.</li></ul><p>A integração da Engenharia de Prompts como uma ferramenta operacional e a adoção de uma abordagem de gestão de ciclo de vida para agentes de IA são pilares para transformar protótipos de LLMs em soluções empresariais robustas e sustentáveis. Com essa compreensão das ferramentas e um plano de ação claro, podemos agora aprofundar o cenário de avaliação de resultados e suas implicações.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Avaliação de Desempenho e Métricas de Sucesso para Agentes de IA e Sistemas Orquestrados\n</h2><p>A avaliação do desempenho de sistemas baseados em LLMs, especialmente aqueles que operam como agentes orquestrados e interagem com o mundo real via MCP, vai muito além das métricas de linguagem natural tradicionalmente utilizadas. <strong>Enquanto na Engenharia de Prompt avaliamos a qualidade da geração de texto, aqui, o foco se desloca para o impacto funcional e de negócio.</strong> A complexidade desses sistemas exige uma abordagem multifacetada para determinar se estão realmente entregando valor e operando de forma confiável.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Métricas Multidimensionais para Agentes de IA\n</h3><p>Para sistemas que envolvem ações e interações com sistemas externos, as métricas devem refletir não apenas a qualidade do texto gerado, mas a eficácia da  e o impacto no negócio.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Métricas de Sucesso da Tarefa ou Objetivo de Negócio:</strong> Esta é a métrica mais crítica. Ela avalia se o agente atingiu o objetivo final para o qual foi projetado. Exemplos incluem:</p><ul><li> Em  de atendimento, a porcentagem de problemas que o agente conseguiu resolver sem intervenção humana.\n\n<ul><li> Para agentes de vendas, o percentual de interações que resultaram em uma venda ou  qualificado.</li><li><strong>Redução de Tempo de Processo:</strong> Em automação de , a diminuição no tempo necessário para completar uma tarefa (e.g., processar um pedido, gerar um relatório).</li><li> Se o agente deveria agendar uma reunião, a métrica seria se a reunião foi agendada corretamente na data e hora especificadas.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Correção da Ferramenta e Ação:</strong> Avaliam a capacidade do LLM de selecionar e utilizar as ferramentas do MCP corretamente.</p><ul><li><strong>Taxa de Seleção Correta de Ferramenta:</strong> Quantas vezes o LLM escolheu a ferramenta apropriada para a intenção do usuário.\n\n<ul><li> Se os parâmetros extraídos pelo LLM para a chamada da ferramenta estavam corretos.</li><li><strong>Taxa de Erro de Execução de Ferramenta:</strong> Frequência com que as chamadas às ferramentas resultam em erros (sejam por erro do LLM ou da própria API externa).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Eficiência e Latência:</strong> Essenciais para a experiência do usuário e custos operacionais.</p><ul><li><strong>Tempo de Resposta ():</strong> O tempo total desde a entrada do usuário até a resposta final, incluindo todas as chamadas de LLM e APIs.\n\n<ul><li> O custo financeiro associado às chamadas dos LLMs e ao uso de recursos externos.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Robustez e Resiliência:</strong> Avaliam a capacidade do sistema de lidar com condições adversas.</p><ul><li><strong>Taxa de Falha em Casos de Borda:</strong> Como o agente se comporta em cenários não previstos ou com entradas ambíguas.</li><li> Frequência com que o sistema precisa recorrer a mecanismos de contingência (e.g., transferir para humano).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Métricas de Viés e Justeza (ou  em inglês):</strong> Embora complexas, são cruciais para a IA responsável.</p><ul><li> Avaliar se as decisões ou respostas do agente variam injustamente entre diferentes grupos demográficos ou categorias sensíveis.</li><li><strong>Rastreabilidade e Explicabilidade:</strong> A capacidade de auditar o \"\" do agente (via , por exemplo) para entender como uma decisão foi tomada, auxiliando na identificação e mitigação de vieses.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Desafios na Avaliação de Sistemas Agentes\n</h3><p>A avaliação de sistemas complexos de IA é inerentemente desafiadora. A natureza probabilística e não-determinística dos LLMs significa que a mesma entrada pode gerar saídas ligeiramente diferentes, tornando os testes de regressão mais complexos. Além disso, a criação de conjuntos de dados de teste que cobrem todas as interações possíveis com múltiplas ferramentas e fluxos de trabalho é um desafio significativo. A dependência de feedback humano para avaliar a qualidade subjetiva (e.g., fluidez, tom, relevância para o usuário) é escalável apenas até certo ponto, exigindo metodologias eficientes de rotulagem e validação. A complexidade do \"\" e da identificação da causa raiz de um erro (foi o prompt, o LLM, a ferramenta ou a lógica de orquestração?) também exige ferramentas de observabilidade sofisticadas.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Riscos vs. Oportunidades na Adoção de IA: Um Olhar Crítico para Novas Fronteiras de Negócios\n</h2><p>A adoção de tecnologias de Inteligência Artificial, em especial os LLMs e os agentes de IA habilitados pelo MCP e pela orquestração, representa um terreno fértil para a <strong>criação de novos negócios e a transformação de modelos existentes</strong>. As oportunidades são vastas e se estendem por todos os setores da economia. A capacidade de automatizar tarefas cognitivas complexas, personalizar interações em escala, e extrair  de grandes volumes de dados são apenas a ponta do . Imagine um escritório de advocacia que utiliza LLMs para analisar contratos e identificar cláusulas de risco em minutos, um sistema financeiro que detecta fraudes com maior precisão ou uma plataforma de  que oferece recomendações de produtos ultrabásicas baseadas em preferências implícitas do usuário. Esses são apenas alguns exemplos que demonstram o potencial disruptivo da IA para otimizar operações, reduzir custos e, mais importante, gerar novas fontes de valor.</p><p>A agilidade na construção de protótipos e a capacidade de escalar soluções inovadoras são impulsionadas pela maturidade das ferramentas e padrões de interoperabilidade como o MCP. Startups podem alavancar LLMs e frameworks de agentes para criar produtos e serviços que, há poucos anos, exigiriam equipes de engenharia massivas e investimentos proibitivos. O \"\" e \"\" impulsionados por IA, onde LLMs auxiliam na geração de código ou na configuração de sistemas, democratizam ainda mais o desenvolvimento de software, permitindo que profissionais de negócios com menos experiência técnica criem suas próprias soluções. A proliferação de plataformas e APIs de LLMs, juntamente com a crescente adoção de padrões de interoperabilidade, facilita a experimentação e a inovação em um ritmo sem precedentes. Isso cria um ambiente propício para a emergência de \"\" que constroem seus modelos de negócios fundamentalmente sobre as capacidades da inteligência artificial.</p><p>Contudo, a mesma inovação que gera oportunidades traz consigo um conjunto considerável de <strong>riscos que precisam ser cuidadosamente gerenciados</strong>. O primeiro e mais premente é o <strong>risco de viés e discriminação algorítmica</strong>. LLMs são treinados em vastos conjuntos de dados que podem conter preconceitos sociais existentes, replicando e até mesmo amplificando-os em suas saídas. Isso é particularmente crítico em aplicações que envolvem tomada de decisões sensíveis, como contratação de pessoal ou concessão de crédito. Ignorar esse risco não apenas leva a resultados injustos, mas também pode resultar em danos reputacionais e legais significativos para as empresas. A transparência e a auditabilidade dos modelos, juntamente com estratégias de mitigação de viés, tornam-se imperativas.</p><p>Outro risco substancial é a <strong>dependência excessiva e a perda de controle humano</strong>. À medida que mais e mais processos são delegados a agentes de IA, a compreensão humana sobre as operações pode diminuir, dificultando a intervenção em caso de falha ou comportamento inesperado. A \"\" dos LLMs, onde o raciocínio por trás de uma decisão nem sempre é transparente, exacerba esse problema. Além disso, a  assume uma nova dimensão com a IA. LLMs podem ser explorados para gerar conteúdo malicioso,  mais convincentes, ou até mesmo para auxiliar em ataques cibernéticos sofisticados. A proteção dos modelos contra ataques adversariais e a garantia de que não sejam usados para fins maliciosos são desafios contínuos e em evolução. Finalmente, a <strong>competitividade e a ética no mercado</strong> são cruciais. À medida que a IA se torna uma vantagem competitiva, questões sobre o acesso equitativo à tecnologia, o impacto no emprego e a responsabilidade por decisões autônomas se tornam centrais. Uma abordagem ética e responsável na adoção da IA não é apenas uma questão de conformidade, mas um <a href=\"https://dev.to/vinicius3w/etica-e-privacidade-na-era-da-ia-dilemas-oportunidades-e-o-futuro-da-governanca-no-cenario-de-f48\">pilar para a sustentabilidade e a aceitação social dessas tecnologias</a>. A discussão sobre estes riscos e oportunidades é vital para que a transformação digital com IA seja não apenas eficaz, mas também justa e sustentável.</p><p>A engenharia de prompt transcendeu sua fase inicial de experimentação para se consolidar como uma competência fundamental no desenvolvimento de soluções baseadas em Inteligência Artificial. Conforme explorado, não se trata apenas de formular perguntas inteligentes, mas de uma disciplina que integra a  com a <strong>ciência da computação e da orquestração de sistemas</strong>. A capacidade de interagir eficazmente com LLMs, utilizando técnicas como  e o estabelecimento de personas, aliada ao domínio de ferramentas como LangChain, DSPy e plataformas  como Flowise/Dify, é o que diferenciará os profissionais e as organizações no cenário da transformação digital. A adoção de modelos estruturados de prompts, como R-T-F e C-A-R-E, exemplifica a evolução de uma prática empírica para uma abordagem mais metodológica e replicável.</p><p>Os casos de sucesso demonstraram o imenso potencial dos LLMs para otimizar processos, personalizar experiências e gerar insights. Contudo, é imperativo que essa exploração seja pautada por uma consciência crítica dos riscos inerentes, como alucinações e vieses, e por uma avaliação rigorosa e contínua dos resultados. A responsabilidade na aplicação da IA é um tema central, exigindo que os desenvolvedores e estrategistas de negócio não apenas busquem a inovação, mas também garantam a ética, a segurança e a confiabilidade de suas soluções. A engenharia de prompt, em sua essência, é a ponte entre a capacidade bruta dos LLMs e a sua aplicação prática, estratégica e responsável no mundo real dos negócios. O futuro da interação homem-máquina e o sucesso das iniciativas de IA dependem diretamente do aprimoramento contínuo dessa intersecção entre inteligência artificial e inteligência humana.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Referências para Leituras Futuras:\n</h2><ul><li>Bender, E.

Each configuration option is validated at compile time, preventing common deployment issues that plague other web frameworks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Core Concepts and Design Patterns\n</h2><p>My journey with the Hyperlane framework revealed several fundamental concepts that distinguish it from traditional web frameworks. The most significant insight was understanding how the framework leverages Rust's ownership system to provide memory safety without garbage collection overhead.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Context-Driven Architecture\n</h3><p>The Context pattern serves as the foundation for all request handling. Unlike traditional frameworks that pass multiple parameters, Hyperlane encapsulates all request and response data within a single Context object. This design simplifies API usage while providing powerful capabilities:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Middleware System Architecture\n</h3><p>The middleware system provides a powerful mechanism for implementing cross-cutting concerns. Through my experimentation, I discovered that the framework's middleware architecture enables clean separation of concerns while maintaining high performance:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-Time Communication Implementation\n</h2><p>One of the most impressive features I discovered was the framework's built-in support for real-time communication protocols. The implementation of WebSocket and Server-Sent Events demonstrates the framework's commitment to modern web standards:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Analysis and Optimization\n</h2><p>Through extensive benchmarking and profiling, I discovered that the Hyperlane framework delivers exceptional performance characteristics. The combination of Rust's zero-cost abstractions and the framework's efficient design results in impressive throughput and low latency.</p><p>My performance testing revealed remarkable results when compared to other popular web frameworks.

For a long time, AWS S3 was the go-to option for most of us, but nowadays their competition is huge, offering reliable alternatives at a fraction of the price.</p><p>We researched some providers to use in our cloud platform <a href=\"https://sliplane.io/?utm_source=5-object-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sliplane</a> some time ago and I want to share our top picks with you.</p><p>Here are 5 cheap object storage providers you can consider as an AWS S3 alternative.</p><blockquote><p> You might have very specific requirements for your object storage solution. For this article, I only include providers in the list of known brands with overall good reputation and we are mainly comparing prices here.</p></blockquote><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Free up to 3× storage, then $0.01 / GB</td><td>Widely adopted, solid reliability, easy S3 API</td></tr><tr><td>Requires 90-day minimum retention, fully S3-compatible</td></tr><tr><td>10 GB storage + 1M writes + 10M reads/month</td><td>Pays for read/write ops, strong edge caching network</td></tr><tr><td>Great price/performance, limited data centers, restrictive account policy</td></tr><tr><td>Self-hosted, open-source, requires setup and maintenance, durability is debatable</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Backblaze B2 offers reliable, low-cost object storage with an easy-to-use S3-compatible API. The <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/pricing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storage price</a> is very affordable at $0.006/GB/month, and egress is free up to 3× your storage volume per month, then $0.01/GB for additional egress.</p><p>Backblaze is widely adopted and a solid choice when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-resiliency-durability-and-availability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">durability</a> (99.999999999% annual durability) and general <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/company/policy/sla\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reliability</a> (99.9% uptime SLA). We use it at <a href=\"https://sliplane.io/?utm_source=5-object-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sliplane.io</a> for example for storing backups but also to store configuration and init scripts.</p><p>With $0.00699/GB/month, storage is only slightly more expensive than on Backblaze, but egress is completely free on <a href=\"https://wasabi.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wasabi</a>. <a href=\"https://docs.wasabi.com/v1/docs/how-durable-is-wasabi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Durability</a> is given at 11 nines as well and in their <a href=\"https://wasabi.com/legal/sla\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SLA</a> they start discounting you if availability of their service drops below 99.9%.</p><p>Wasabi is fully S3-compatible, but it requires a 90-day minimum retention period on stored data when using their pay-as-you-go pricing.</p><p>Similar to Wasabi, Cloudflare R2 provides object storage with zero egress fees as well, which is ideal for applications with heavy outbound data transfers. Storage costs are higher than Wasabi's at $0.015/GB/month, but still much cheaper compared to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS S3</a> which comes at $0.023/GB/month. They also have a free tier for the first 10GB of storage, making it ideal for small projects. While egress is free, you pay for read ($0.36 / M) and write ($4.50 / M) operations, although Cloudflare has a free tier of 1M writes and 10M reads per month as well.</p><p>A main benefit of R2 is access to Cloudflare's edge caching network, giving you fast global access to your data.</p><p>Hetzner provides a great European alternative for Object storage. Although their service is comparably new and when we tested it in beta we stumbled into issues, which they probably got all sorted by now, Hetzner is known to provide great service at an exceptional price/performance ratio.</p><p>At $0.00713/GB/month storage costs are very competitive and especially their $0.00143/GB egress pricing can be an attractive alternative to AWS where egress costs are about 60x higher. Its downsides include limited global data center locations and it can be tricky to open an account at Hetzner since they are very restrictive as part of their effort to keep scammers in check.</p><p>MinIO is a self-hosted, open-source object storage software fully compatible with the S3 API. Since it runs on your own servers or cloud, storage fees—costs depend on your infrastructure but you must also include the time it takes to set up and maintain your object storage solution.</p><p>Is it a good idea to <a href=\"https://sliplane.io/blog/5-things-that-should-be-illegal-to-selfhost\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-host object storage</a>? That's debatable. An important point of good object storage is high durability and achieving the same 11 nines (99.999999999%) as other providers offer at a similar price is going to be tough.</p><p>Hope any of that helped! Each of these providers offers different advantages depending on your specific needs:</p><ul><li> is great for reliable, cost-effective storage with reasonable egress allowances</li><li> excels when you need unlimited free egress but can commit to 90-day retention</li><li> is perfect for applications that benefit from global edge caching</li><li> offers excellent European-focused pricing with competitive egress costs</li><li> gives you complete control but requires significant setup and maintenance effort</li></ul><p>When choosing an object storage provider, consider not just the storage costs but also egress fees, your geographic requirements, integration complexity, and the total cost of ownership including your time investment.</p>","contentLength":4494,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Musk's attempts to politicize his Grok AI are bad for users and enterprises — here's why","url":"https://dev.to/future_ai/musks-attempts-to-politicize-his-grok-ai-are-bad-for-users-and-enterprises-heres-why-32ch","date":1751390318,"author":"AI News","guid":179171,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\n          As an independent business owner or leader, how could you possibly trust Grok to give you unbiased results?\n        </p>","contentLength":127,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Apple Research just unearthed a forgotten AI technique and is using it to generate images","url":"https://dev.to/future_ai/apple-research-just-unearthed-a-forgotten-ai-technique-and-is-using-it-to-generate-images-4ic1","date":1751390304,"author":"AI News","guid":179161,"unread":true,"content":"<p> Apple dusted off an old AI trick—Normalizing Flows—and spiced it up with Transformers to create two new image generators: TarFlow and STARFlow.

But if you're not a UK citizen, the question of How to Get a Dev Job in the UK with Visa Sponsorship can seem like a massive hurdle. </p><p>Well, I'm here to tell you it's not just possible; it's more attainable than you might think, especially with the right strategy and a clear understanding of the process. So, if you're ready to swap your current commute for a London tube ride or a stroll through Manchester's tech parks, let's break down exactly what it takes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Get a Dev Job in the UK with Visa Sponsorship: Your Ultimate Guide\n</h2><p>Dreaming of a UK Tech Career? It's More Attainable Than You Think!\nThe UK tech scene is booming, constantly seeking fresh talent, innovative minds, and skilled developers from all corners of the world. From bustling startups in Shoreditch to established tech giants in Manchester and Edinburgh, opportunities abound. </p><p>But for international candidates, the visa process can feel like navigating a maze blindfolded. Don't worry, we're going to demystify it, step by step, so you can confidently pursue your dream dev job in the UK.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the UK Visa Sponsorship Landscape\n</h2><p>Before you even start <a href=\"https://techwaka.net/cv-writing-for-beginners/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">polishing your CV</a>, it’s crucial to grasp the primary visa route that will allow you to work as a developer in the UK.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Skilled Worker Visa: Your Golden Ticket\n</h2><p>For most international developers, the Skilled Worker Visa (formerly Tier 2 General) is the main pathway to employment in the UK. This visa allows you to come to or stay in the UK to do an eligible job with an approved employer. Yes, that's the key: an approved employer. Not every company can sponsor a visa, so knowing which ones can is half the battle.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Eligibility Criteria: What You Need to Know\n</h2><p>To qualify for a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skilled Worker visa</a>, you generally need to meet several criteria and score enough points. Here are the main ones:</p><p>Job Offer from a Licensed Sponsor: You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK employer that holds a valid sponsorship licence. This is non-negotiable.</p><p> Your job must be on the list of eligible occupations (which includes most developer roles). The government publishes a list of occupations that qualify.</p><p><strong>Minimum Salary Threshold:</strong> You must be paid a minimum salary, which is either a general threshold (e.g., £38,700 as of April 2024, subject to change) or the 'going rate' for your specific job code, whichever is higher. There are some exceptions for 'new entrants' (younger applicants or recent graduates) or jobs on the shortage occupation list.</p><p><strong>English Language Proficiency:</strong> You'll need to prove your English language skills. This usually means passing an approved English language test (like <a href=\"https://ielts.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IELTS</a> for UKVI) or having a degree taught in English.</p><p><strong>Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):</strong> Your employer will issue you a Certificate of Sponsorship, which is a unique reference number, not a physical certificate, that confirms your job details and sponsorship.</p><p> You might need to show you have enough money to support yourself when you arrive in the UK, though your employer can sometimes certify this for you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Sponsorship Process: How It Works\n</h2><p>Once you've landed a job offer from a sponsoring company, here's a simplified overview of what happens:</p><p> Once you receive the CoS, you'll use it to apply for your Skilled Worker visa online. You'll need to provide supporting documents, including your passport, English language test results, and evidence of funds.</p><p> You'll typically attend an appointment at a visa application centre to provide your fingerprints and a photo (biometrics). Some applicants may also be invited for an interview.</p><p> The Home Office reviews your application and makes a decision. If approved, you'll receive your visa.</p><p><strong>Other Visa Routes (Briefly):</strong><a href=\"https://techwaka.net/uk-global-talent-visa-all-you-need-to-know/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Global Talent</a>, Youth Mobility\nWhile the Skilled Worker Visa is the most common, a couple of other routes might be relevant for some developers:</p><p> If you're a recognized leader or emerging leader in digital technology, you might qualify for this endorsement-based visa. It doesn't require a job offer or sponsorship upfront, offering more flexibility.</p><p><strong>Youth Mobility Scheme Visa (Tier 5):</strong> If you're aged 18-30 (or 18-35 for some nationalities) and from certain countries, this allows you to live and work in the UK for up to two years. It's not sponsorship-dependent, but it's temporary.</p><p> Essential Steps Before You Apply\nBefore you even start hitting 'apply,' there are crucial preparatory steps that will significantly boost your chances.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Skill Up: In-Demand Technologies in the UK Market\n</h2><p>The UK tech market has its own unique demands. While core programming skills are universal, knowing which specific technologies are hot can give you an edge.</p><p><strong>Frontend vs. Backend vs. Fullstack:</strong> Choosing Your Niche\nFrontend: React, Angular, Vue.js are consistently in high demand. Strong JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3 skills are fundamental.</p><p> Python (especially with Django/Flask), Node.js, Java (Spring Boot), C# (.NET) are very popular. Understanding microservices and API development is key.</p><p> Expertise across both frontend and backend is highly valued, particularly for startups looking for versatile talent.</p><p> The Hot Skills\nBeyond core development languages, certain areas are experiencing explosive growth:</p><p> AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) skills are extremely sought after. Certifications can make you stand out.</p><p> Experience with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab CI, and automation tools is a massive plus. Companies are constantly looking to streamline their development and deployment processes.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Machine Learning (ML):</strong> Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and a solid understanding of ML algorithms are in high demand, especially in fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Crafting a UK-Optimized CV/Resume\n</h2><p>Your CV is your first impression. Make it count, and tailor it for the UK market.</p><p><strong>ATS-Friendly Formatting and Keywords:</strong> Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter CVs. Use clear, standard formatting, and incorporate keywords from the job description. Avoid overly fancy designs that might confuse an ATS.</p><p><strong>Highlighting Relevant Experience (Even International):</strong> Clearly articulate your experience, focusing on achievements rather than just duties. Quantify your impact whenever possible (e.g., \"Improved load time by 20%,\" \"Reduced bugs by 15%\"). If your experience is international, explain how it's relevant to a UK context. Be mindful of UK English spelling and terminology.</p><p><strong>No Photo or Personal Info (Generally):</strong> Unlike some countries, it's generally not expected or even advisable to include a photo, marital status, or date of birth on a UK CV due to anti-discrimination laws.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building a Standout Portfolio/GitHub Profile\n</h2><p>For developers, your code speaks louder than words.</p><p><strong>Showcasing Real-World Projects:</strong> A strong portfolio with live demos or clear descriptions of projects you've worked on (personal or professional) is invaluable. Focus on quality over quantity.</p><p><strong>Contribution to Open Source:</strong> A Big Plus: Actively contributing to open-source projects on GitHub demonstrates your coding skills, collaboration abilities, and passion for development. It's a fantastic way to get noticed.</p><p> Finding Companies That Sponsor\nThis is often where international candidates face the biggest challenge: identifying companies willing and able to sponsor visas.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Leveraging LinkedIn and Job Boards Effectively\n</h2><p><strong>Filtering for Visa Sponsorship:</strong> Many job boards, including LinkedIn, indeed, and others, have filters for \"<a href=\"https://techwaka.net/job-openings/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visa sponsorship</a>\" or \"Tier 2 sponsorship.\" Use these diligently.</p><p><strong>Connecting with Recruiters:</strong> Many UK tech recruitment agencies specialize in placing international talent. Connect with recruiters on LinkedIn who focus on your tech stack and mention your visa sponsorship requirement upfront. They often have direct relationships with sponsoring companies.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Direct Company Websites and Career Pages\n</h2><p>Don't just rely on job boards. Many larger tech companies and those with established international hiring programs will list their sponsorship capabilities directly on their careers pages. Look for sections on \"International Applicants,\" \"Visa Sponsorship,\" or \"Relocation Support.\"</p><p> The Unsung Hero of Job Hunting\nNetworking is incredibly powerful, even from afar.</p><p><strong>Online Communities and Meetups:</strong> Join relevant Slack communities, Discord servers, or online forums for UK tech professionals. Participate in discussions, ask questions, and build connections.</p><p><strong>Industry Events and Conferences:</strong> Look for virtual tech conferences or webinars hosted in the UK. Attending these can give you insights into the market and sometimes even direct access to recruiters or hiring managers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Navigating the Application and Interview Process\n</h2><p>You've done the groundwork, found the companies, and now it's time to shine.</p><p><strong>Tailoring Your Cover Letter:</strong> The Sponsorship Angle<a href=\"https://techwaka.net/writing-an-ideal-cover-letter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your cover letter</a> is your chance to explain why you're a great fit and how you meet the sponsorship requirements. </p><p>Clearly state that you are seeking visa sponsorship and briefly explain your eligibility (e.g., \"I am eligible for a Skilled Worker visa and am confident I meet all requirements, including English language proficiency\").</p><p>Acing the Technical Interview: What to Expect\nUK tech interviews often involve:</p><p> Expect live coding sessions or take-home assignments. Practice your algorithms and data structures.</p><p> For more senior roles, be prepared to discuss system architecture and scalability.</p><p> Be ready to talk in detail about your past projects, technologies used, and challenges overcome.</p><p> Demonstrating Soft Skills\nBeyond technical prowess, UK companies value soft skills. Be ready to discuss:</p><p><strong>Teamwork and Collaboration:</strong> How you work with others, resolve conflicts, and contribute to a positive team environment.</p><p> Your approach to tackling complex issues.</p><p> How you articulate ideas, listen, and provide feedback.</p><p><strong>Adaptability and Learning:</strong> Your willingness to learn new technologies and adapt to change.</p><p> What to Expect and Verify\nCongratulations, you've got an offer! Now, pay close attention to the details related to sponsorship.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)\n</h2><p>The Certificate of Sponsorship is crucial. Ensure your offer letter clearly states that the company will provide a CoS. It's a unique reference number, not a physical document, that you'll need for your visa application.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Terms in Your Offer Letter\n</h2><p>Beyond salary and benefits, check for:</p><p> This needs to align with your visa processing time.</p><p> Ensure these match an eligible occupation for the Skilled Worker visa.</p><p> Confirm it meets the minimum threshold for your specific job code and experience level.</p><p> Clarify what support the company offers (e.g., covering visa application fees, legal assistance for the application).</p><p> When to Seek It\nWhile many companies provide support, it's always wise to consider seeking independent immigration legal advice, especially if your case is complex or you want to ensure everything is handled correctly.</p><p><strong>Relocation and Settling In:</strong> Beyond the Job Offer\nGetting the job and visa is a huge win, but the journey continues.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Accommodation and Cost of Living\n</h2><p>The UK, especially cities like London, can be expensive. Research average rents, transportation costs, and daily expenses for your chosen city. Many companies offer some relocation assistance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  NHS and Healthcare Access\n</h2><p>As a Skilled Worker visa holder, you'll pay an Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) as part of your visa application, which grants you access to the National Health Service (NHS), the UK's public healthcare system.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building a New Life and Network\n</h2><p>Join local tech meetups, professional groups, and social clubs. Building a new network, both professional and personal, is key to settling in and thriving in your new environment.</p><p>Underestimating Visa Requirements and Timelines: The process can be lengthy and requires meticulous attention to detail. Start early, gather all documents, and be prepared for potential delays.</p><p> Technical skills get you the interview, but soft skills (communication, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability) often get you the job and help you succeed in a new work environment.</p><p> Why It's Worth It\nInnovation Hubs and Diverse Opportunities: The UK boasts world-leading tech hubs in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, and beyond, offering diverse opportunities across various industries like FinTech, HealthTech, AI, and Gaming.</p><p><strong>Work-Life Balance and Culture:</strong> Many UK companies emphasize work-life balance, offering flexible working arrangements and a culture that values employee well-being.</p><p><strong>Career Growth and Development:</strong> The dynamic nature of the UK tech industry means continuous learning and ample opportunities for career progression.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Your UK Dev Dream Awaits!\n</h2><p>Getting a dev job in the UK with visa sponsorship is a significant undertaking, but it's a highly rewarding one. It requires strategic preparation, persistence, and a clear understanding of the visa process. </p><p>By focusing on in-demand skills, crafting an optimized application, targeting sponsoring companies, and acing your interviews, you can absolutely turn your dream of a UK tech career into a reality. </p><p>The UK tech scene is vibrant, welcoming, and full of opportunities for talented developers like you.

And the environment where those ideas begin to breathe is the human mind, where they grow larger with each passing thought until they become ready to step out and walk the earth.</p><p>After ninth grade, my twin sister and I spent several months in our grandparents’ rural home while they were away. The atmosphere was serene but far removed from the city, and we lacked a vehicle. Anytime we needed something — groceries, lunch, simple supplies — we had to ask our father to bring them from afar. Even common deliveries weren’t feasible, since our parents were uncomfortable allowing strangers near the house while we were home alone.</p><p>One day, half-joking but half-serious, I turned to my sister and said:</p><p>“Why don’t we just invent a flying robot to handle all of this for us?”</p><p>That sentence planted a seed. What began as a casual remark quickly grew into a vision — not just for us, but for anyone frustrated by the invisible labor of running everyday errands.</p><p>🤖 The Vision: A Reliable Personal Courier</p><p>This robot isn’t just a flying device. It’s a practical assistant — a safe, intelligent courier that receives instructions, carries items, and delivers them without human interaction on either end.</p><p>It features three attachable cargo containers in small, medium, and large sizes. Depending on the item — a bottle of medicine, a stack of documents, a hot meal, or even a boxed television — the user selects the appropriate box, and the robot locks it in securely.</p><p>An integrated touchscreen panel on one of its mechanical arms allows users to input the destination address, verify identity, and collect a digital signature at the delivery point.</p><p>The device could run on solar or electric power, helping reduce emissions from short-distance errands and offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional deliveries.</p><p>But perhaps most compelling is this: it speaks — and it feels almost human.</p><p>🧠 A Robot That Feels Human</p><p>Upon reaching its destination, the robot doesn’t just beep. Instead, it initiates a brief phone call using the recipient’s number entered by the sender. With a calm, human-like voice, it says:</p><p>“Your delivery has arrived. Please come to the door to receive it.”</p><p>This simple gesture — the tone, the language, the autonomy — transforms the experience from mechanical to meaningful.</p><p>Once the recipient approaches, the robot uses facial recognition and voice ID to verify their name. Only if the data fully matches the original sender’s input does the box unlock.

But one of its key limitations was its relatively short context window, which often forced researchers and developers to chunk or truncate large documents. Since long context window is a very important factor in areas like deep research, Menlo Research team just launched Jan-Nano-128k, a game-changing upgrade that natively supports an astonishing 128,000-token context window. It is built from the ground up to handle long-form content without the performance degradation seen in traditional context extension methods like YaRN. If you're analyzing full-length research papers, synthesizing knowledge across multiple documents, or engaging in complex multi-turn conversations, Jan-Nano-128k empowers you to dive deeper with unmatched efficiency and precision. Its architecture is optimized not just for length, but for performance at scale, maintaining coherent, high-quality responses across massive inputs. Fully compatible with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, it’s a dream tool for researchers, AI Scientists, and enteprises focusing on AI tools for deep research.</p><p>In this guide, we'll walk you through the easiest way to install Jan-Nano-128k and get it running on GPU accelerated environment, so you can start building, exploring, and reasoning at an entirely new scale.</p><p>The minimum system requirements for this use case are:</p><ul><li><p>GPUs: 1x RTX A6000 or 1x A100</p></li><li><p>Disk Space: 50 GB (preferable)</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Note: The prerequisites for this are highly variable across use cases. A high-end configuration could be used for a large-scale deployment.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-step process to install and run Jan Nano 128k\n</h2><p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll use a GPU-powered Virtual Machine by <a href=\"https://nodeshift.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NodeShift</a> since it provides high compute Virtual Machines at a very affordable cost on a scale that meets GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001 requirements. Also, it offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for beginners to get started with Cloud deployments. However, feel free to use any cloud provider of your choice and follow the same steps for the rest of the tutorial.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Setting up a NodeShift Account\n</h3><p>Visit <a href=\"https://app.nodeshift.com/sign-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app.nodeshift.com</a> and create an account by filling in basic details, or continue signing up with your Google/GitHub account.</p><p>If you already have an account, <a href=\"http://app.nodeshift.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">login</a> straight to your dashboard.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Create a GPU Node\n</h3><p>After accessing your account, you should see a dashboard (see image), now:</p><p>1) Navigate to the menu on the left side.</p><p>2) Click on the&nbsp;&nbsp;option.</p><p>3) Click on  to start creating your very first GPU node.</p><p>These GPU nodes are GPU-powered virtual machines by NodeShift. These nodes are highly customizable and let you control different environmental configurations for GPUs ranging from H100s to A100s, CPUs, RAM, and storage, according to your needs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Selecting configuration for GPU (model, region,&nbsp;storage)\n</h3><p>1) For this tutorial, we’ll be using the H100 GPU; however, you can choose any GPU of your choice based on your needs.</p><p>2) Similarly, we’ll opt for 200GB storage by sliding the bar. You can also select the region where you want your GPU to reside from the available ones.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Choose GPU Configuration and Authentication method\n</h3><p>1) After selecting your required configuration options, you'll see the available GPU nodes in your region and according to (or very close to) your configuration. In our case, we'll choose a 1x RTX A6000 48GB GPU node with 64vCPUs/63GB RAM/200GB SSD.</p><p>2) Next, you'll need to select an authentication method. Two methods are available: Password and SSH Key. We recommend using SSH keys, as they are a more secure option. To create one, head over to our <a href=\"https://docs.nodeshift.com/gpus/create-gpu-deployment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official documentation</a>.</p><p>The final step would be to choose an image for the VM, which in our case is , where we’ll deploy and run the inference of our model.</p><p>That's it! You are now ready to deploy the node. Finalize the configuration summary, and if it looks good, click  to deploy the node.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Connect to active Compute Node using SSH\n</h3><p>1) As soon as you create the node, it will be deployed in a few seconds or a minute. Once deployed, you will see a status  in green, meaning that our Compute node is ready to use!</p><p>2) Once your GPU shows this status, navigate to the three dots on the right and click on . This will open a pop-up box with the Host details. Copy and paste that in your local terminal to connect to the remote server via SSH.</p><p>As you copy the details, follow the below steps to connect to the running GPU VM via SSH:</p><p>1) Open your terminal, paste the SSH command, and run it.</p><p>2) In some cases, your terminal may take your consent before connecting. Enter ‘yes’.</p><p>3) A prompt will request a password. Type the SSH password, and you should be connected.</p><p>Next, If you want to check the GPU details, run the following command in the terminal:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Set up the project environment with dependencies\n</h3><p>1) Create a virtual environment using <a href=\"https://nodeshift.com/blog/set-up-anaconda-on-ubuntu-22-04-in-minutes-simplify-your-ai-workflow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anaconda</a>.</p><div><pre><code>conda create -n jann python=3.11 &amp;&amp; conda activate jann\n</code></pre></div><p>2) Once you’re inside the environment, run the following command to install the torch and other packages.</p><div><pre><code>pip install torch torchvision torchaudio einops timm pillow\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\npip install huggingface_hub\npip install sentencepiece bitsandbytes protobuf decord numpy\n</code></pre></div><p>3) Run the following command to install vllm and any other remaining packages needed to run vllm and not installed already.</p><div><pre><code>pip install --upgrade vllm\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 8: Download and Run the Model\n</h3><p>1) Start the vllm server with this command that will also download the model.</p><div><pre><code>vllm serve Menlo/Jan-nano-128k \\\n    --host 0.0.0.0 \\\n    --port 1234 \\\n    --enable-auto-tool-choice \\\n    --tool-call-parser hermes \\\n    --rope-scaling '{\"rope_type\":\"yarn\",\"factor\":3.2,\"original_max_position_embeddings\":40960}' --max-model-len 131072\n</code></pre></div><p>2) Once all the model checkpoints are downloaded, we’ll connect our local VSCode editor to the remote server to write a code snippet to test the model during inference.</p><p>If you’re using a GPU through a remote server (e.g., NodeShift), you can connect it to your visual studio code editor by following the steps below:</p><p>a) Install the “Remote-SSH” Extension by Microsoft on VS Code.\nb) Type “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host” on the Command Palette.<p>\nc) Click on “Add a new host”.</p>\nd) Enter the host details, such as username and SSH password, and you should be connected.</p><p>3) Inside VSCode, create a new project directory and a python file inside the directory. Ensure you’re inside the virtual environment created earlier.</p><div><pre><code>mkdir test-app\ncd test-app\ntouch app.py\n</code></pre></div><p>4) Copy and paste the below code snippet in  file.</p><p>This is just a test script that tests the model’s long context capabilities on a very long context i.e., the novel <em>“The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes”</em> in the form of text file.

Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall precision, exhibited unexpected conditional dependencies not captured during offline evaluation. This highlighted a critical gap: our existing monitoring lacked the ability to track and validate the  behind model predictions, not just the predictions themselves. This incident underscored the need for integrating Bayesian Networks (BNs) not as standalone models, but as a crucial component within our broader MLOps infrastructure for explainability, risk assessment, and robust model monitoring. BNs, in this context, aren’t simply probabilistic graphical models; they’re a system-level tool for understanding and controlling model behavior across the entire ML lifecycle – from data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment, monitoring, and eventual deprecation.  They address increasing compliance demands (e.g., GDPR’s right to explanation) and the need for scalable inference in high-stakes applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is Bayesian Networks in Modern ML Infrastructure?\n</h3><p>From a systems perspective, a “Bayesian Network example” isn’t a single artifact, but a collection of components and workflows. It’s the integration of a BN – typically learned from data or expert knowledge – with our existing ML infrastructure. This includes:</p><ul><li>  Models are trained using libraries like  or  (Python) and serialized (e.g., using  or a custom format) for storage in a model registry like MLflow.  Version control is paramount.</li><li><strong>Feature Store Integration:</strong> BNs often rely on features derived from our feature store (e.g., Feast).  Maintaining feature lineage and detecting feature skew is critical for BN accuracy.</li><li>  BN inference is typically served via a dedicated microservice, often built using frameworks like Ray Serve or FastAPI, and deployed on Kubernetes.</li><li>  BN-specific metrics (e.g., evidence propagation paths, marginal probabilities) are streamed to our observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry).</li><li><strong>ML Pipeline Orchestration:</strong> Airflow or similar orchestrators manage the BN training, validation, and deployment pipelines.</li></ul><p>The key trade-off is complexity.  BNs add overhead to the pipeline. System boundaries must be clearly defined:  BNs are best suited for augmenting existing models, not replacing them entirely, particularly in high-throughput scenarios.  A typical implementation pattern involves using the BN to provide explanations for predictions made by a primary model (e.g., a deep neural network).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection (Fintech):</strong>  BNs can explain  a transaction was flagged as fraudulent, providing evidence for risk assessment and regulatory compliance.</li><li><strong>Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):</strong>  BNs can reveal the factors driving a recommendation, increasing user trust and transparency.</li><li><strong>Medical Diagnosis (Health Tech):</strong>  BNs can assist clinicians by providing probabilistic reasoning behind a diagnosis, highlighting key symptoms and risk factors.</li><li><strong>Autonomous Vehicle Safety (Autonomous Systems):</strong>  BNs can model the uncertainty in sensor data and predict potential failure modes, enhancing safety and reliability.</li><li> BNs can model the causal relationships between different A/B test variations and key metrics, providing more robust insights than traditional statistical tests.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Architecture &amp; Data Workflows\n</h3><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Data Source] --&gt; B(Feature Store);\n    B --&gt; C{BN Training Pipeline (Airflow)};\n    C --&gt; D[MLflow Model Registry];\n    D --&gt; E(BN Inference Service - Ray Serve/Kubernetes);\n    E --&gt; F[Primary Model Inference Service];\n    F --&gt; G(Monitoring &amp; Alerting - Prometheus/Grafana);\n    E --&gt; G;\n    G --&gt; H{Incident Response};\n    B --&gt; F;\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style E fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n</code></pre></div><p>The workflow: Data is ingested, features are extracted and stored.  The BN training pipeline (orchestrated by Airflow) learns the network structure and parameters. The trained BN is registered in MLflow.  During inference, the primary model makes a prediction, and the BN provides an explanation.  Metrics from both the primary model and the BN are monitored.  Traffic shaping (e.g., using Istio) allows for canary rollouts of new BN versions. Rollback mechanisms are triggered by anomaly detection in BN metrics.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5.

Failure Modes &amp; Risk Management\n</h3><ul><li>  BNs can become outdated if the underlying data distribution changes.  Automated retraining pipelines and drift detection are essential.</li><li>  Discrepancies between training and inference features can invalidate BN inferences.  Monitoring feature distributions is crucial.</li><li>  Complex BN inference can introduce latency.  Caching, model optimization, and autoscaling are necessary.</li><li><strong>Incorrect Network Structure:</strong> A poorly designed BN can lead to inaccurate explanations.  Expert review and sensitivity analysis are vital.</li><li> Malicious data can corrupt the BN learning process.  Data validation and anomaly detection are required.</li></ul><p>Mitigation: Implement alerting on BN-specific metrics (e.g., evidence propagation time, marginal probability variance).  Use circuit breakers to isolate failing BN instances.  Automated rollback to previous BN versions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Performance Tuning &amp; System Optimization\n</h3><ul><li>  Optimize BN structure, use efficient inference algorithms (e.g., Variable Elimination), and leverage caching.</li><li>  Horizontal scaling (Kubernetes), batching requests, and vectorization can improve throughput.</li><li><strong>Model Accuracy vs. Infra Cost:</strong>  Regularly evaluate the trade-off between BN complexity and performance.  Consider model pruning or simplification.</li><li>  Parallelize BN training and inference tasks.  Optimize data loading and feature extraction.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  8. Monitoring, Observability &amp; Debugging\n</h3><ul><li>  Inference latency, evidence propagation time, marginal probability variance, number of evidence updates.</li><li>  Visualize BN metrics, track data drift, and monitor model performance.</li><li>  Trace requests through the BN inference service.</li><li>  Monitor data drift and model performance.</li><li>  Trigger alerts on latency spikes, data drift, or unexpected changes in BN behavior.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  9. Security, Policy &amp; Compliance\n</h3><ul><li>  Log all BN training and inference events.</li><li>  Version control BN models, data, and code.</li><li><strong>Secure Model/Data Access:</strong>  Use IAM roles and policies to restrict access to sensitive data and models.</li><li>  Track BN lineage, training parameters, and performance metrics.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  10. CI/CD &amp; Workflow Integration\n</h3><p>GitHub Actions/GitLab CI pipelines can automate BN training, validation, and deployment.  Deployment gates can enforce quality checks (e.g., model performance thresholds, data drift tests).  Automated tests can verify BN functionality and accuracy. Rollback logic can automatically revert to previous BN versions in case of failure. Argo Workflows or Kubeflow Pipelines can orchestrate complex BN pipelines.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Ignoring Conditional Independence Assumptions:</strong>  BNs rely on conditional independence assumptions.  Violating these assumptions can lead to inaccurate inferences.</li><li>  BNs require sufficient data to learn accurate network structures and parameters.</li><li>  Complex BNs can overfit the training data.  Regularization techniques and cross-validation are essential.</li><li><strong>Lack of Domain Expertise:</strong>  BNs often require domain expertise to define the network structure and interpret the results.</li><li><strong>Treating BNs as Black Boxes:</strong>  Failing to understand the underlying reasoning behind BN inferences can lead to misinterpretations and incorrect decisions.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  12. Best Practices at Scale\n</h3><p>Mature ML platforms (e.g., Uber Michelangelo, Spotify Cortex) emphasize modularity, automation, and observability. Scalability patterns include microservices architecture, horizontal scaling, and caching. Tenancy is achieved through resource isolation and access control. Operational cost tracking is essential for optimizing resource utilization.  BNs should be treated as a first-class citizen within the platform, with dedicated infrastructure and tooling.</p><p>Integrating Bayesian Networks into production ML systems is not merely about adding another model; it’s about building a more robust, explainable, and trustworthy ML infrastructure.  By focusing on architecture, observability, and scalable inference, we can unlock the full potential of BNs for risk assessment, compliance, and improved decision-making. Next steps include benchmarking BN performance against alternative explainability techniques, integrating BNs with our automated model monitoring system, and conducting a security audit of our BN infrastructure.  Regular audits and continuous improvement are crucial for maintaining the reliability and effectiveness of our Bayesian Network-powered ML systems.</p>","contentLength":9237,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bidirectional Communication Protocols（1751386811749900）","url":"https://dev.to/member_14fef070/bidirectional-communication-protocols1751386811749900-2d39","date":1751386814,"author":"member_14fef070","guid":179106,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

You pass it a Request object or a string containing the URL to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the request.</p><p>The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response object representing the server's response.

So, we’ll follow best practices and store this file remotely in an .</p><p>Here’s how to create an S3 bucket to act as your Terraform :</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🪣 Create an S3 Bucket for State Storage\n</h4><div><pre><code>aws s3api create-bucket  pravesh-terra-state-bucket  us-east-1\n</code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  📜 Enable Versioning for State History\n</h4><div><pre><code>aws s3api put-bucket-versioning  pravesh-terra-state-bucket Enabled\n</code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔐 Enable Default Encryption\n</h4><div><pre><code>aws s3api put-bucket-encryption  pravesh-terra-state-bucket </code></pre></div><p>And that’s it! You now have a secure, versioned, and encrypted S3 bucket ready to store your Terraform state files — a key step toward building a production-grade infrastructure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📦 <strong>Step 3: Clone the Project and Provision Infrastructure with Terraform</strong></h2><p>With all the groundwork done — AWS CLI set up, Terraform installed, and the backend ready — it’s time to move on to the actual project!</p><p>The codebase for our  is available on my GitHub repository:</p><p>To get started, open your terminal and run the following commands:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Pravesh-Sudha/3-tier-app-Deployment\n3-tier-app-Deployment/\n</code></pre></div><p>Inside the cloned repo, you'll find a folder named . That’s where all the Terraform magic happens. Navigate into that directory:</p><p>Now initialize the Terraform backend (which we configured to use your S3 bucket earlier):</p><p>This will configure Terraform to use the remote backend for storing the state file. If your bucket name is different from mine (<code>pravesh-terra-state-bucket</code>), make sure to update the name in .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  📁 Understanding the Terraform Code Structure\n</h3><p>Instead of dumping everything into a single  file, I’ve broken the configuration into logical modules for clarity and scalability. Here’s a quick overview:</p><ul><li><p>: Specifies the cloud provider. In our case, it’s AWS (no surprise there!).</p></li><li><p>: Configures Terraform to store state remotely in our S3 bucket.</p></li><li><p>: Creates two public repositories in ECR:  and  for storing Docker images.</p></li><li><p>: Fetches the default VPC and subnet details.</p></li><li><p>: Defines IAM roles:</p><ul><li>One for the EKS cluster (includes )</li><li>One for the Node Group (includes policies like <code>AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy</code>, <code>AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly</code>, and )</li></ul></li><li><p>: Provisions the EKS cluster named .</p></li><li><p>: Creates the worker node group for the cluster with one  EC2 instance.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  ⏳ Apply the Terraform Configuration\n</h3><p>Now we’re ready to provision the infrastructure! Run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>terraform apply </code></pre></div><p>⏱️ This might take , especially since provisioning EKS clusters and node groups can take some time. Be patient — AWS is building your cloud infrastructure behind the scenes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🐳 Push Docker Images to ECR\n</h3><p>Once the infrastructure is up, it’s time to push our Docker images for the frontend and backend to AWS ECR.</p><ul><li>Go to your <strong>AWS Console &gt; ECR &gt; Repositories</strong></li></ul><ul><li><p>Click on the  repository</p></li><li><p>Click on  — AWS will show you four CLI commands   </p></li></ul><p>Now, go to the  folder in your project directory:</p><p>Run each of the four commands one by one to build the image and push it to ECR.</p><p>Repeat the same steps for the  repository:</p><ul><li><p>Go back to </p></li><li><p>Select  and click </p></li></ul><ul><li>Navigate to the backend directory:\n</li></ul><p>Run the ECR commands provided to push the backend Docker image.</p><p>🎉 Once done, your container images will be hosted in your private AWS ECR repositories — ready to be deployed to your EKS cluster!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🌐 <strong>Step 4: Deploy to EKS with kubectl and Set Up Ingress via ALB</strong></h2><p>Now that your EKS cluster and ECR repositories are ready, it’s time to interact with the cluster, deploy your workloads, and expose your application to the internet.

Cloud-native platforms like AWS offer unmatched agility, but they also require a deliberate and structured approach to security and compliance.\nAs companies adopt AWS for mission-critical systems, it’s essential to integrate compliance and risk management into every layer — from architecture to deployment.<p>\nThis article explores proven practices for securing cloud-native environments, particularly during cloud migration, legacy refactoring, and modern software development.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Rethinking IAM: From Open Access to Fine-Grained Control\n</h2><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the bedrock of security in AWS. Yet, many organizations still rely on broad permissions inherited from on-prem or legacy cloud setups.\nDuring cloud migration, it's vital to:</p><ul><li>Scope IAM roles to specific services and workloads.</li><li>Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations to enforce boundaries.</li><li>Continuously analyze permissions using IAM Access Analyzer.</li></ul><p>Refactoring access controls early can prevent privilege creep and reduce the blast radius of potential security incidents.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Encrypt Everything — Intelligently\n</h2><p>Encryption is a regulatory and operational must-have in financial systems — but it should be applied thoughtfully.\nOn AWS, effective encryption includes:</p><ul><li>Customer-managed KMS keys for services like S3, RDS, and EBS.</li><li>TLS enforcement at all entry points (API Gateway, ALB, CloudFront).</li><li>Explicit bucket policies that deny unencrypted uploads.</li></ul><p>During legacy refactoring, it’s not uncommon to discover plaintext storage or services running with weak cipher configurations. Identifying and correcting these patterns is essential for a secure software development lifecycle.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Infrastructure as Code: Compliance at Scale\n</h2><p>Manual configuration of cloud resources introduces risk and inconsistency. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for secure and compliant software development.\nIaC enables:</p><ul><li>Consistent enforcement of security baselines across environments.</li><li>Version control of infrastructure for auditability and rollback.</li><li>Automated validation in CI/CD pipelines.</li></ul><p>In regulated industries, IaC is often the fastest path to audit readiness, particularly when migrating and modernizing complex systems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Continuous Monitoring and Threat Detection\n</h2><p>Security doesn’t end at deployment. Post-migration environments must be actively monitored and assessed.\nRecommended AWS tools include:</p><ul><li>CloudTrail for detailed activity logs.</li><li>Amazon GuardDuty for anomaly detection.</li><li>AWS Config for continuous compliance checks.</li><li>Security Hub for a centralized view of security posture.</li></ul><p>These tools provide visibility into security posture, misconfigurations, and unexpected activity — especially valuable during high-change periods like cloud migration or legacy refactoring.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Designing with Compliance in Mind\n</h2><p>Frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS can guide architectural decisions when applied early in the software development process.\nExamples:</p><ul><li>Role-based access control and MFA help satisfy access control requirements.</li><li>VPC segmentation and resource tagging map directly to asset management policies.</li><li>Centralized logging and alerting support incident response requirements.</li></ul><p>Rather than retrofitting compliance, integrating these controls into design accelerates both development and certification.</p><p>Security and compliance in AWS environments require more than best-effort configurations. They demand clear strategies, automation, and constant validation.\nWhether you're navigating a large-scale cloud migration, working through the challenges of legacy refactoring, or building systems from the ground up, the key is to embed these principles early and evolve them as you scale.<p>\nCloud-native systems in financial services can be both fast and secure — when the foundations are solid.</p></p><p>Stay safe, your OptiTechDev</p>","contentLength":3975,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Deconstructing a Perfect Product Launch: What a Fictional K-Pop Movie Can Teach Us","url":"https://dev.to/aigame/deconstructing-a-perfect-product-launch-what-a-fictional-k-pop-movie-can-teach-us-39f0","date":1751384300,"author":"owen peter","guid":179041,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As developers, designers, and product people, we're constantly thinking about how to launch our projects. How do we build hype? How do we create an authentic experience? How do we turn users into a community?</p><p>Every so often, a project comes along that serves as a perfect blueprint. Today, that project is \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" a fictional animated film. I stumbled upon its landing page and was blown away. It’s not just a movie promo; it's a masterclass in building a universe and launching it with precision.</p><p>Let's break down the key strategies from this fictional campaign that we can apply to our own real-world products, apps, and open-source projects.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The High-Concept Pitch: Clarity Above All\n</h3><p>The first thing you see is the tagline: <strong>\"Where idol dreams meet supernatural destiny.\"</strong></p><p>In a single line, you know  what this is. It's K-pop meets . This immediate clarity is the hook. There’s no jargon, no vague mission statement. The core concept is so strong that it does the heavy lifting.</p><ul><li> Can you describe your app, library, or SaaS product in one, compelling sentence? If you have to explain for a full minute, you may have a messaging problem. A powerful high-concept pitch is your best entry point.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Ecosystem, Not Just the Product\n</h3><p>The \"KPop Demon Hunters\" website isn't just a landing page for a movie. It's a portal to an entire universe.</p><ul><li> Deep lore for those who want to dive in.</li><li> The soundtrack is treated as a first-class product, not an afterthought.</li><li> The site explicitly calls out sections for discussions, fan art, and Discord.</li></ul><p>This isn't just \"selling a movie.\" It's building a world and inviting you to live in it. The product (the movie) is the entry point to a larger ecosystem of content and community.</p><ul><li> Don't just ship your code. Ship the ecosystem. Your  is the start. What about the documentation site? The Discord server for support? The blog for tutorials and case studies? Build a hub, not just a destination.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The \"Authenticity Stack\": Leveraging Real-World Credibility\n</h3><p>This is where the strategy goes from good to brilliant. The project builds trust by integrating authentic talent at every level.</p><p>\nInstead of having one actor do both speaking and singing, they split the roles:</p><ul><li> Professional actors like Arden Cho and Daniel Dae Kim.</li><li> Accomplished K-pop artists and composers like Ejae (aespa, TWICE) and Andrew Choi (NCT 127, Monsta X).</li></ul><p>This decision shows a deep respect for both crafts. It tells the target audience (K-pop fans) that the music isn't a cheap imitation; it's the real deal, made by people who shape the industry.</p><p>\nFeaturing members of a globally recognized group like TWICE is the ultimate stamp of approval. It’s not just a feature; it’s a strategic partnership that provides instant credibility and a massive promotional boost.</p><ul><li> Who are the \"TWICE\" of your domain? If you're building a dev tool, getting a respected developer to contribute or even just use it is invaluable social proof. If you're building a design tool, a collaboration with a well-known designer can be a game-changer. Authenticity is built through genuine partnership.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Engineering Virality and Social Proof\n</h3><p>The campaign doesn't just hope for success; it designs for it.</p><blockquote><p>\nJoin millions of fans in the viral KPop Demon Hunters dance challenge featuring TWICE's soundtrack contribution.</p></blockquote><p>This is a direct call to create user-generated content (UGC), perfectly tailored for platforms like TikTok. It's participatory and shareable by design.</p><p>Furthermore, the site prominently displays success metrics as social proof:</p><ul><li><strong>Debuted at No. 8 on Billboard 200</strong></li><li><strong>No. 1 on Billboard Soundtracks</strong></li><li><strong>Multiple Entries on Spotify Global</strong></li></ul><p>This data transforms a potential viewer's mindset from \"Should I check this out?\" to \"I'm missing out if I don't.\"</p><ul><li> Build shareable moments into your product. For an app, it might be a beautifully designed results screen that users want to post. For a library, it might be a cool demo on CodePen. Then, showcase your traction. GitHub stars, download counts, positive testimonials—these aren't vanity metrics; they are powerful tools for building trust and momentum.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. The UX of Hype: A Flawless Funnel\n</h3><p>Finally, the landing page itself is a masterclass in information architecture and user journey.</p><ol><li> You get the pitch, the brand, and the primary Call-To-Action ().</li><li> The official trailer is right there, offering an instant, low-commitment way to experience the product.</li><li> You can get the quick details (release date, rating) or dive deep into the cast, characters, and story. The user controls their level of engagement.</li><li><ul><li><code>Learn More About The Story</code></li><li><code>Find KPop Demon Hunters Screenings Near You</code></li></ul></li><li> The \"Limited theatrical screenings\" create urgency and make the event feel more exclusive and special.</li></ol><ul><li> Structure your project's landing page or  with the same logic. Start with the \"what\" and \"why.\" Provide an easy way to see it in action (a demo/GIF). Offer clear pathways to learn more (docs) or get started (). Guide your user, don't just dump information on them.</li></ul><p>The \"KPop Demon Hunters\" project, though fictional, is a perfect case study for a modern, multi-platform product launch. It reminds us that a great product isn't just about the core code or content; it's about the story you tell, the community you build, the authenticity you project, and the seamless journey you create for your users.</p><p>So next time you're preparing to launch, ask yourself: what would the KPop Demon Hunters do?</p>","contentLength":5455,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Containerized vs Traditional Deployment（1751384286841700）","url":"https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/containerized-vs-traditional-deployment1751384286841700-5ff6","date":1751384289,"author":"member_35db4d53","guid":179040,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of cross_platform development.

It directly manages data, logic, and rules of the application.</p><p>: The presentation layer that displays data to the user.

While JavaScript offers flexibility and freedom, it also leaves plenty of room for bugs and silent failures. TypeScript, on the other hand, brings structure and type safety, which becomes especially valuable when working in teams. In this blog, we’ll explore why more developers are making the switch from JavaScript to TypeScript and why you might want to consider it too.</p><p>TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft It adds optional type annotations, interfaces, and modern JavaScript features, then compiles (transpiles) down to plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or JavaScript environment.</p><p><strong>What does it mean to transpile code?</strong>\nIf you’ve decided to transition from JavaScript to TypeScript, chances are you already understand what it means to compile code. But you might still be wondering: “What in the world does it mean to transpile code?”</p><p>It’s actually nothing far-fetched or complicated. The key difference is that transpiling means converting your code to a different version of the same or a similar language, like TypeScript to JavaScript, or ES6 to ES5. Unlike compiling, which transforms code from a high-level language into a lower-level one (like C to machine code). To help visualize the difference: think of transpiling as two similar languages, like Spanish and Italian which are rooted in Latin and compiling as comparing a language like English with Chinese which have completely different structures and roots. I'll share a few code snippets below to help solidify our understanding of transpilation.<strong>TypeScript (before transpilation)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Transpiled JavaScript (after running )</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With a clear grasp of TypeScript and how transpilation works, it’s time to explore why this language leaves JavaScript in the dust.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How TypeScript Outshines JavaScript in Real Projects\n</h2><p>TypeScript offers many advantages that address common pitfalls in JavaScript. In this section, we’ll walk through each benefit using clear analogies and code examples to show exactly how TypeScript helps solve the pain points JavaScript developers often face.</p><p>Type safety is a common feature in statically typed languages that allows developers to declare variables with specific types. At first, this may feel restrictive or even inconvenient, especially coming from JavaScript’s flexibility. But as we grow as developers and begin working on larger, more complex codebases, the benefits of type safety become clear: </p><ul><li>stronger collaboration across teams.</li></ul><p>Let’s look at a few code snippets that demonstrate how enforcing type safety can make a real difference and why this extra step pays off in the long run.</p><p><strong>Type Safety in Action (TypeScript Example)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let's start with a simple example where we declare a variable intended to store an array of numerical values only. At first, this might seem restrictive or like extra work. But imagine you're working on a team, and someone accidentally tries to push a string into that array.</p><p>In JavaScript, this kind of mistake could easily go unnoticed and cause hard-to-debug errors later.</p><p>With TypeScript, this isn’t a problem. It will immediately flag the issue and refuse to transpile the file until the type mismatch is fixed. TypeScript doesn’t just whisper, it screams when something’s wrong.</p><p>At this point, you might still have some doubts about TypeScript. Maybe you're someone who enjoys working on solo projects and values the flexibility that JavaScript offers. The good news is, TypeScript doesn’t take that freedom away, it simply gives you more control when you need it.</p><p>In fact, if you want to work with arrays that hold different types of values, TypeScript has a perfect solution: tuples. Let’s take a look at how they work.</p><p><strong>Tuple Example in TypeScript</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Using tuples, we can explicitly define what types of values a variable should hold, the exact order they should appear in, and even how many elements the array should contain. Pretty cool, right?</p><p>By now, many of you might be convinced that switching to TypeScript is worth it and honestly, you should be!</p><p>But there's still one issue that some of you might have already spotted.\nYou might be wondering: What if I need 50 or even 100 different tuples with the same structure?<p>\nDo I really have to declare the same tuple type over and over again?</p></p><p>Instead of repeating the tuple type every time, we can follow the DRY principle by creating a reusable type alias.</p><p>Before we dive into an example of type aliases, let’s do a quick refresher on the DRY principle, a key concept for improving the maintainability of our codebases.</p><p>\nDRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself — a core software engineering principle that emphasizes having a single, clear source of truth for each piece of knowledge in a system. This improves maintainability and helps avoid unnecessary duplication.</p><p>In React, we apply the DRY principle through a component-based architecture. By creating reusable, customizable components, we can use the same logic and UI in multiple parts of a project — reducing repetition and making our codebase easier to manage.</p><p><strong>Type Alias Example in TypeScript</strong>\nNow let's take a look at how type aliases help us enforce the DRY principle in our code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the example above, we used a type alias. A popular TypeScript feature that allows developers to define reusable type structures.</p><p>Let’s say we want to reuse an object structure in multiple parts of our code.

While social media platforms capture attention, website commenting systems remain the backbone of community building and content discussion.</p><p>In this article, I will compare two distinct approaches: Disqus, the established player with millions of installations, and Replyke, the developer-focused newcomer promising modern API-first architecture with zero ads.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Website Commenting System Overview\n</h2><p>Comment sections drive 60% more engagement than static content alone, according to recent studies. Yet the landscape has dramatically shifted. Users expect Instagram-style threading, real-time notifications, and seamless mobile experiences—features that traditional commenting systems struggle to provide.</p><p>The fundamental question facing developers today: Should you embed a third-party widget that forces users into separate account systems, or integrate social features that work seamlessly with your existing users? This choice impacts everything from page load speeds to user experience continuity.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Disqus Alternative Analysis: Replyke's Modern Approach\n</h2><p>Replyke positions itself as the next-generation commenting platform—an open-source, API-first solution that integrates social features directly into applications while maintaining the simplicity of drop-in widgets.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Open-Source Philosophy\n</h2><p>Unlike Disqus's proprietary system, Replyke v5 is fully open-source under Apache 2.0 license. As explained in the licensing announcement:</p><p>\"What started as a simple comment section grew into a fullstack framework for building social products. Making it open-source means developers can truly own their community features.\"</p><p>This philosophy extends beyond code access. While Replyke offers hosted solutions like Disqus, developers can download their data anytime, self-host if desired, or build custom solutions using the open-source codebase.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Drop-in Integration with Native User Experience\n</h2><p>Replyke v5 offers the best of both worlds: drop-in simplicity with native user integration. The current integration is straightforward:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The crucial difference: your existing users can comment immediately without creating separate Disqus accounts. Comments feel like a native part of your application, not an external service.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Comment Widget Comparison: Setup and Integration\n</h2><p>Disqus: The Separate Account Problem\nDisqus built its reputation on simplicity, but at a cost. While setup takes minutes, users must create Disqus accounts to participate. This creates friction that many developers overlook:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Your users see \"Login with Disqus\" buttons, breaking the native experience. Comment data lives exclusively on Disqus servers with limited export options.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Replyke: Native Integration Without Complexity\n</h2><p>Replyke v5 eliminates the account friction problem. Users comment with their existing application accounts, maintaining seamless user experience. Aside from JWT signing, no server-side code required for basic implementation at all.</p><p>Reddit user discussions reveal this critical difference. In r/Gameinformer\none developer highlighted the user experience issue:</p><blockquote><p>\"I always want to engage in discussion on websites but I don't want to agree to all the terms of Disqus to use it. An internal comment system would be really useful.\"</p></blockquote><p>In r/webdev, another developer noted:</p><blockquote><p>\"I used Disqus until I realized they come with massive ads on the free version.

If you’re looking for a quick, reliable, and low-cost way to publish your HTML/CSS/JavaScript site, then Amazon S3 is your best friend. In this article, I’ll guide you through the complete process of hosting a static website on AWS S3, and we’ll also include a live demo at each key step to make things easy to follow.</p><p>** What is Amazon S3?**\nAmazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a highly scalable object storage service offered by AWS. It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet. From backups and application data to static websites and image hosting, S3 is a powerful tool used by developers and businesses worldwide.</p><p>With built-in redundancy, versioning, encryption, and fine-grained access control, S3 is more than just a file storage system — it’s an enterprise-level solution. For this article, we’ll focus on one of its most practical features: hosting static websites.</p><p>🌍** Why Use S3 to Host a Website?**\nThere are many reasons why S3 is perfect for hosting static sites:</p><p>No server management: You don’t need to worry about Apache, Nginx, or scaling.\nHighly reliable and durable: 99.999999999% durability ensures your files are safe.<p>\nCheap or even free (with the AWS Free Tier).</p>\nFast performance, especially when combined with AWS CloudFront (CDN).<p>\nPerfect for portfolios, landing pages, resumes, and documentation websites.</p></p><p>🛠️ Prerequisites\nBefore you begin, make sure you have the following:</p><p>A working AWS account (the free tier is sufficient).\nA static website ready to upload. This could be your personal portfolio or a sample HTML/CSS project.<p>\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) user credentials — avoid using the root account for safety.</p>\n🧭 Overview: 5 Key Steps to Host a Website on S3<p>\nHere’s what we’ll be doing in this tutorial:</p></p><ol><li>Enable static website hosting\nLet’s dive in.</li></ol><p><strong>📦 Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket</strong>\nAfter logging in to your AWS Management Console, search for S3 using the top search bar. Click on the S3 service and then click the “Create bucket” button.</p><p>You’ll be prompted to enter a unique bucket name (bucket names must be globally unique). Choose your preferred AWS region (like Asia Pacific — Mumbai) and leave most settings at their default.</p><p>Click Create bucket, and you’re done! You’ve just created a cloud storage container that will hold your website files.</p><p><strong>📁 Step 2: Upload Website Files</strong>\nNext, open your newly created bucket and click on the “Upload” button. You’ll need to upload your static website files — typically index.html, along with folders for CSS, images, and JavaScript.</p><p>It’s important to keep your folder structure consistent so your site behaves the same after upload. Start by uploading the root-level files (like index.html), then add folders like /css, /img, or /js.</p><p>Once all files and folders are selected, click Upload and wait until the upload succeeds.</p><p><strong>🔓 Step 3: Enable Public Access</strong>\nBy default, all files and buckets in S3 are private. To allow users to access your website, you must enable public access to the bucket.</p><p>To do this, go to the Permissions tab of your bucket. Click Edit under “Block public access,” uncheck “Block all public access,” and then confirm your change. AWS may prompt you to type a confirmation statement to avoid accidental misconfiguration.</p><p>Once this is saved, your bucket is now publicly accessible — but we still need to set permissions for each file. That’s where the next step comes in.</p><p><strong>📝 Step 4: Set a Bucket Policy</strong>\nNow let’s configure a bucket policy — a JSON-based configuration that defines who can access your bucket and what actions they can perform.</p><p>In the Permissions tab, scroll down to Bucket policy, click Edit, and paste this policy:</p><div><pre><code>{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"PublicReadGetObject\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": \"*\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace \"your-bucket-name\" with your actual bucket name. This policy gives the public read-only access to all files in your bucket — exactly what we need for a static website.</p><p>Save the policy to apply the settings.</p><p><strong>🌐 Step 5: Enable Static Website Hosting</strong>\nNow for the final touch — let’s tell AWS to serve this bucket as a website.</p><p>Go to the Properties tab of your bucket and scroll down to find Static website hosting. Click Edit, then enable the setting.</p><p>You’ll need to provide the name of your entry file, usually index.html. You can leave the error document field empty or add error.html if your site has one.</p><p>Click Save changes, and AWS will generate a public URL for your website in the format:</p><p><code>ttp://your-bucket-name.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com/</code>\nOpen this link in your browser — and voila! Your website is live and accessible to the world.</p><p>\nAt this point, you’ve completed all the essential steps to host a website on Amazon S3:</p><p>You created a secure bucket\nUploaded all required files<p>\nSet public access and policies</p>\nEnabled static website hosting<p>\nReceived a live link to your project</p>\nYou can now share this link with clients, friends, or on your resume. And next time someone asks how to host a simple website, you’ll be ready!</p><p><strong>💡 Pro Tips (Optional but Helpful)</strong>\nUse IAM roles instead of root access for better security and monitoring.<p>\nEnable versioning on your bucket to track changes and recover deleted files.</p>\nConnect a custom domain via Route 53, and add CloudFront for global speed boost.<p>\nIf needed, create CI/CD pipelines to auto-upload files using GitHub Actions or AWS CLI.</p></p>","contentLength":5676,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Who's hiring — July 2025","url":"https://dev.to/fmerian/whos-hiring-july-2025-d23","date":1751375040,"author":"flo merian","guid":178925,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Product engineers, Developer advocates, or Technical writers?</strong></p><p><strong>If you're looking for a new opportunity in the dev tools space, this post is for you.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  16+ developer-first companies hiring in July 2025\n</h2><p>Below are 16+ open roles in dev-first companies.</p><p><strong>That's a wrap!

Forget about spending weeks writing code from scratch. Now, you can use natural language prompts to create React Native apps. It sounds like science fiction, but it's real, and it's here to stay. This shift is making app development more accessible and  than ever before.</p><h3>Accelerating Mobile App Creation</h3><p><strong>The biggest advantage of using prompts is speed.</strong> Instead of manually coding every component, you describe what you want, and the AI generates the code. This means you can build a basic app in hours instead of weeks. Think about it: you can go from idea to prototype in a single day. This speed is a game-changer for startups and established companies alike. Imagine being able to quickly test new features or create proof-of-concept apps without a huge time investment. It's all about getting to market faster and staying ahead of the competition. This is especially useful when you need to quickly create <a href=\"https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/best-ai-coding-assistant-tools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI code generators</a> to test out different ideas.</p><h3>Bridging Natural Language and Code</h3><p>It used to be that you needed to be fluent in a programming language to build an app. Now, you can use plain English (or any other natural language) to tell the computer what to do. The AI acts as a translator, converting your words into React Native code. This opens up app development to a whole new group of people. Designers, project managers, and even marketers can now contribute to the development process.</p><blockquote>This doesn't mean that developers are obsolete. Instead, it means that their role is changing. They're becoming more like architects, guiding the AI and refining the code it generates. It's a collaborative process where humans and AI work together to build amazing apps.</blockquote><p>Here's a quick look at the steps involved:</p><ol><li>Describe the app's features in natural language.</li><li>The AI generates the React Native code.</li><li>Developers review and refine the code.</li><li>The app is tested and deployed.</li></ol><h2>Unlocking Efficiency in React Native Workflows</h2><h3>Streamlining Iteration with AI</h3><p>Okay, so picture this: you're building a <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">React Native app</a>, and you've got this idea, right? Instead of spending hours coding a prototype, what if you could just  what you want, and AI generates the initial code? That's the dream, and it's getting closer to reality. <strong>AI can now help you iterate faster by automating repetitive tasks and suggesting code improvements.</strong> It's not perfect, but it can definitely speed things up. Think of it like having a junior developer who never sleeps and always suggests the obvious fixes.</p><p>Here's how it might work:</p><ul><li>Describe the feature you want.</li><li>AI generates the basic component structure.</li><li>You tweak and refine the code.</li><li>Repeat until you're happy.</li></ul><blockquote>This approach can drastically reduce the time it takes to get from idea to working prototype. It also allows for quicker experimentation with different UI/UX approaches.</blockquote><h3>From Concept to Cross-Platform Reality</h3><p>React Native already makes cross-platform development easier, but AI can take it to the next level. Imagine feeding your app's design specifications into an AI tool, and it spits out <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iOS Live Activities</a> and Android code that's 80% complete. You still need to do the fine-tuning, but the heavy lifting is done. This means you can focus on the unique aspects of your app and deliver a polished product faster. It's about making the whole process less painful and more efficient.</p><ul><li>Reduced development costs.</li><li>More consistent user experience across platforms.</li></ul><h2>The Future of Mobile Engineering: Prompt to React Native</h2><h3>Empowering Developers with AI-Driven Tools</h3><p>The mobile engineering landscape is changing fast. We're moving beyond traditional coding methods. Now, AI is stepping in to help developers build apps more efficiently. Think about it: less time writing boilerplate code, more time focusing on the . Tools like \"<a href=\"https://codia.ai/code?from=thbk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Codia Code - AI-Powered Pixel-Perfect UI for Web, Mobile &amp; Desktop in Seconds</a>\" are becoming essential. They let you create interfaces quickly, freeing you up to tackle the harder problems.</p><h3>Enhancing User Experiences Through Rapid Prototyping</h3><p><strong>Rapid prototyping is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity.</strong> Users expect apps that are fast, intuitive, and meet their needs perfectly. AI-powered tools are making it easier than ever to create prototypes and test ideas quickly. This means you can get feedback early and often, leading to better apps. Imagine being able to build a working prototype during your commute. That's the power of mobile AI development.</p><blockquote>The ability to quickly iterate on ideas and get user feedback is transforming the way we build mobile apps. It's about creating a continuous loop of improvement, ensuring that the final product is something that users truly love.</blockquote><p>Here's a simple comparison of traditional vs. AI-assisted prototyping:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><p>Imagine a world where making apps is super easy, like drawing a picture.

We’re the TATOMAMO team behind <a href=\"https://kidstime.ai/foodfestival3_pre-order_platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food Festival 3</a>, a family-friendly cooking simulator that’s all about fun, not frustration. In our previous post, we shared how we built a “playable cartoon” look and feel. Today, we’d like to dive into a topic we found even more challenging for mobile game development: how to design an engaging game loop that stays stress-free.</p><p><strong>The Problem with Most Cooking Games</strong>\nMany cooking games or restaurant simulators rely on strict timers, failing customers, and penalties to drive difficulty. While that can be fun for some players, we saw how it turned away younger audiences and families looking for a relaxing user experience. Kids especially can feel anxious about losing, and parents don’t want tantrums over missing a timer by half a second.</p><p>We realized that pressure-based game loop design was at odds with our mission: a cozy, cartoon-style game that feels like a playground.</p><p><a href=\"https://kidstime.ai/foodfestival3_pre-order_platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Core Principles We Followed</a>\n✅ No harsh fail states<p>\nPlayers never get a big red “YOU FAILED” screen. Instead, if they miss an order, the game gently suggests trying again.</p></p><p>✅ Soft time incentives\nWe do use timers, but more as a way to reward speed, not to punish slowness. The dish still gets made, but if you’re faster, you get a little bonus — perfect for family-friendly gameplay.</p><p>✅ Positive reinforcement\nEvery dish, even a “less-than-perfect” one, gets positive feedback. We framed it as, “Hey, you did it! Next time you can make it even better!”</p><p>✅ Low cognitive load\nComplexity builds up very gradually, and levels are bite-sized so kids (and parents) don’t feel overwhelmed.</p><p>Iterations We Tested\nOur first prototype had hard fail states with angry customers storming off. We quickly saw playtesters getting stressed, which damaged their user experience. Instead, we switched to a friendly mascot-style feedback system that cheers you on no matter what. This alone made the gameplay feel stress-free, even if the tasks were still challenging.</p><p>We also removed mandatory upgrades. Many mobile games lock you into upgrades to keep up with higher-level customers, adding hidden pressure. We wanted players to upgrade food trucks because it’s fun, not because they’re forced to.</p><p>What Worked\nBy shifting from “fail or win” to “learn and improve,” we found kids played longer, parents were more comfortable letting them play, and our retention numbers improved. That’s a great lesson for stress-free gameplay design.</p><p>If you’re working on mobile game development for a family audience (or even casual gamers), think about:</p><p>Does failure have to feel punishing?</p><p>Can you reward success without shaming mistakes?</p><p>Are your time constraints motivating, or just anxiety-inducing?</p><p>Final Thoughts\nGames can still be challenging without being stressful. Designing a stress-free game loop takes more work, but the results are worth it — for happier players, stronger user experience, and a brand you can feel proud of.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about our Unity pipeline, or how we built the 3D assets for a family-friendly cooking simulator follow us - <a href=\"https://kidstime.ai/foodfestival3_pre-order_platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">link</a>.</p>","contentLength":3108,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mastering Laravel 12 Conditional Validation","url":"https://dev.to/techsolver94/mastering-laravel-12-conditional-validation-4e5h","date":1751373009,"author":"TechSolve Central","guid":178917,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Laravel 12’s validation system is a powerhouse for ensuring data integrity in web applications.

My goal was to:</p><ul><li>Write a  that sets up Python, dependencies, and the Django project.</li><li>Use  to run both the Django app and a MYSQL database together.</li><li>Set up a reverse proxy using NGINX to expose the app on a clean port (like 8080).</li><li>Make sure everything can be started with just  using .</li></ul><p>This project helped me understand how multi-container apps work, how services interact inside a Docker network, and how to troubleshoot startup issues in web apps.</p><p><strong>1. Forgot to Add Containers to the Same Network</strong><p>\nAt first, my app and NGINX couldn’t talk to each other.I didn’t realize that all related containers need to be on the same Docker network to communicate.This tiny thing cost me a lot of time — everything looked okay, but nothing worked until I added the correct network in the </p>.</p><p><strong>2. Database Connection Problems</strong><p>\nMy Django app kept throwing errors when trying to connect to MySQL. After a lot of digging, I found out it was due to small things like incorrect hostnames or missing environment variables.One wrong word in the DB settings was enough to break everything.Lesson learned: always double-check your database config.</p></p><p><strong>3. Used Wrong Name in NGINX Config</strong><p>\nIn the NGINX config, I accidentally used the container name instead of the service name from the Docker Compose file.This gave me “bad gateway” errors. I didn’t know at the time that NGINX looks for the </p>, not the container name, when it tries to connect. It seems obvious now, but it wasn’t when I first started — and that’s okay.</p><p><strong>1. Docker Network Confusion</strong>, I make sure that all services are assigned to a common network — even if it seems optional at first.This way, containers can talk to each other smoothly without throwing “connection refused” errors.<p>\nHere's a small reminder I use now:</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>2. MySQL Connection Troubles</strong>\nA small typo in your environment variable (like , , or ) can ruin your day. I spent hours figuring out that my Django app couldn’t talk to  just because I had a wrong key in the env file. Now I double-check every setting and make sure all configs match between app and database.</p><p><strong>3. NGNIX Configuration Issue</strong>\nIn the beginning, I was giving the service name inside the  config, like:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Which didn’t work.\nSo I changed it to:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here’s how the app looks running inside Docker containers:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffuwfhhqjiqwhjitxzrgs.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffuwfhhqjiqwhjitxzrgs.png\" alt=\"Containerize the Django App\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Project -2: Java Maven-Based Application\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔧 What I Tried to Do (Java Maven App)\n</h4><p>After successfully containerizing my Django app, I wanted to push myself a little further — this time by working with a Java-based Maven application. The idea was to set up everything inside Docker and manage it through Docker Compose, just like I did with the Django app.But this project came with its own set of new learning curves. Unlike Python, Java applications involve build steps using Maven, so I had to:</p><ul><li>Write a custom Dockerfile that builds the app using Maven and then runs the JAR file.</li><li>Handle MySQL integration inside containers (again), but with a slightly different config structure.</li><li>Configure NGINX to reverse proxy requests to the Java backend.</li></ul><p>One of the most confusing parts was figuring out <strong>where the database settings were written</strong> in the Java Maven project. In Django, it's easy to find — it's in . But here, I had to dig around the project folders to finally find the right file.\nEven after I updated the database details correctly, the app  — and the logs didn’t help much. Everything seemed fine: all containers were running, and the database was connected. But the app just wouldn't work, and there was  telling me what went wrong.\nAnd Issue was like this:</p><div><pre><code>Exception thread  java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Public Key Retrieval is not allowed at\n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.SQLError.createSQLExceptionSQLError.java:108 at \n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.SQLError.createSQLExceptionSQLError.java:95 at\n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.SQLExceptionsMapping.translateExceptionSQLExceptionsMapping.java:122 at     \n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.createNewIOConnectionImpl.java:862 at \n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.ConnectionImpl.java:444 at\n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.getInstanceConnectionImpl.java:230 at\n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.NonRegisteringDriver.connectNonRegisteringDriver.java:226 at\n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.MysqlDataSource.getConnectionMysqlDataSource.java:438 at\n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.MysqlDataSource.getConnectionMysqlDataSource.java:146 at\n     com.mysql.cj.jdbc.MysqlDataSource.getConnectionMysqlDataSource.java:119 at\n     ConnectionManager.getConnectionConnectionManager.java:28 at\n     Main.mainMain.java:8</code></pre></div><p>After spending quite some time googling and going through Stack Overflow posts, I finally discovered that the  was located in a file called  inside the path:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>So, I added these database credentials under the environment section of the Java service in the  file.\nBut… even after that, the app still wouldn’t come up.<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50379839/connection-java-mysql-public-key-retrieval-is-not-allowed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stack Overflow</a> post that pointed out an important issue — Java MySQL drivers block public key retrieval by default, which can silently break DB connections.\nSo, I updated the URL to:</p><div><pre><code>spring.datasource.urljdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/expenses_tracker?allowPublicKeyRetrieval&amp;useSSL</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Note: Setting allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true is helpful in development environments but can be a security risk in production.

Here are ten tips to help you get the most out of combining Alpine.js with Phoenix LiveView.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use  to preserve Alpine state\n</h3><p>LiveView patches can wipe out Alpine component state. To prevent this, wrap Alpine-controlled elements with  so that LiveView skips updating them. This allows Alpine to retain its state and reactive bindings across patches.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Re-initialize Alpine components after LiveView DOM updates\n</h3><p>When LiveView updates the DOM and adds new Alpine-powered elements, you may need to re-initialize Alpine. You can do this with  inside a LiveView hook's  or  callback.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Alpine for UI interactivity, LiveView for state\n</h3><p>Let Alpine handle UI-only interactions like toggling dropdowns or modals, and delegate shared state or server-side logic to LiveView. This keeps responsibilities clearly separated and avoids complexity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Leverage  with LiveView forms\n</h3><p>You can use Alpine’s  alongside LiveView forms. Inputs can still emit  or  events while Alpine manages local two-way bindings. This is useful for real-time validation or preview updates.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dispatch LiveView events from Alpine\n</h3><p>Use Alpine’s event system to trigger LiveView events. You can dispatch a  that bubbles up and is caught by , , or other handlers. This lets Alpine-driven interactions communicate with the server.</p><p>Alpine’s  directive is great for performing client-side setup like setting focus or initializing values when a component mounts. This runs once after the Alpine component is initialized.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Add Alpine transitions to LiveView content\n</h3><p>Alpine’s  directives add smooth enter/exit animations. This helps soften LiveView DOM changes that show/hide content, such as flash messages or modals.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use LiveView hooks for Alpine coordination\n</h3><p>Create LiveView hooks to coordinate with Alpine when the DOM updates. For example, re-initialize Alpine components after an update using  inside a hook’s  method.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Avoid DOM conflicts by isolating concerns\n</h3><p>Make sure Alpine and LiveView don’t fight over the same DOM. Use proper scoping and  where necessary to isolate Alpine-managed parts from LiveView patches.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Test interop edge cases carefully\n</h3><p>When combining Alpine and LiveView, be cautious about DOM updates, race conditions, and duplicated events. Use LiveView test tools and browser debugging to ensure the hybrid behavior works reliably.</p><p>By combining Alpine.js with Phoenix LiveView, you get the best of both worlds: rich, reactive interfaces without a full SPA. Alpine adds a sprinkle of JavaScript where you need it, while LiveView keeps your app scalable, maintainable, and fast.</p>","contentLength":2900,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🧩 From REST to Events: Why Event-Driven Microservices Are the Upgrade You Didn’t Know You Needed","url":"https://dev.to/niel_morphius/from-rest-to-events-why-event-driven-microservices-are-the-upgrade-you-didnt-know-you-needed-p8k","date":1751369995,"author":"Moses Daniel Kwaknat","guid":178888,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>Building scalable systems today isn’t about throwing more servers at the problem, it’s about rethinking how your services talk to each other.</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve ever been burned by tightly coupled REST calls in a microservice architecture, long chains of service-to-service calls, failed transactions halfway through, retry hell, you’re not alone.</p><p>Been there.

While this works well for isolated sessions, there are many situations where LiveView processes need to share or coordinate state. Redis can serve as a fast, reliable bridge between LiveView sessions, enabling shared counters, collaborative editing, global feature toggles, and more. Here are ten tips for effectively integrating Redis into your LiveView applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Redis for global counters across sessions\n</h3><p>One of the simplest and most effective ways to use Redis is for global counters. Whether you are tracking active users, page views, or real-time votes, Redis allows for atomic increment and decrement operations. Using <code>Redix.command(conn, [\"INCR\", \"liveview:counter\"])</code> from your LiveView lets multiple users interact with the same state without race conditions. Pair this with PubSub broadcasts to push the updated count to all connected LiveViews in real time.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Back shared form state with Redis in collaborative UIs\n</h3><p>In collaborative apps where users fill out forms or work on shared documents together, Redis can act as a central store for intermediate state. Each keystroke or selection can be pushed to Redis with  and read by all other sessions working on the same resource. This makes it easier to support real-time collaboration features like co-editing or watching someone else’s cursor move across a form.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Set expiration times to manage temporary state\n</h3><p>Redis keys support expiration out of the box. Use  to store temporary values like verification codes, onboarding progress, or one-time tokens that should disappear after a short time. This keeps your data layer clean and allows LiveViews to reference ephemeral state without needing to create dedicated database tables or cleanup jobs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Leverage Redis PubSub for lightweight broadcasting\n</h3><p>While Phoenix has excellent built-in PubSub, Redis also provides a cross-platform publish and subscribe system. You can use Redis PubSub to push updates to worker nodes, non-Phoenix services, or third-party integrations. This is especially useful in polyglot systems where Elixir is just one part of the backend stack.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use JSON encoding for structured state\n</h3><p>When storing more complex state in Redis, always serialize it as JSON. This makes the data human-readable and portable. You can use  in Elixir to safely round-trip maps and structs through Redis. This approach helps when syncing structured UI state across multiple LiveViews, such as configuration panels or dashboards.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Avoid bottlenecks by namespacing keys\n</h3><p>When storing data in Redis, choose your key names carefully. Use consistent namespacing like  or <code>dashboard:project456:settings</code>. This prevents conflicts and helps you selectively delete or update related groups of keys. It also makes debugging and monitoring easier, as you can filter keys by namespace patterns.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Redis as a feature toggle backend\n</h3><p>For applications with live feature rollout needs, Redis can be used to manage toggles in real time. Set boolean flags like  or  in Redis and check them inside your LiveView mount functions. Because Redis updates are fast and in-memory, changes to toggles take effect across all users almost instantly without needing a redeploy.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Handle Redis disconnects with backoff and retry\n</h3><p>Redis is fast but not immune to failure. Always wrap your Redis interactions in retry logic, especially for writes that must succeed. Use exponential backoff and structured error logging to handle timeouts or connection issues gracefully. This ensures your LiveViews continue to function even when Redis becomes temporarily unavailable.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Watch Redis keys for change detection\n</h3><p>Although Redis does not natively support watching keys for change notifications in the same way a database might, you can simulate this using Redis PubSub. When one LiveView updates a key, it can publish a message on a related channel. Other LiveViews subscribed to that channel can then fetch the updated value from Redis and refresh their UI accordingly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Redis to share presence-like data outside Phoenix Presence\n</h3><p>Phoenix Presence is a great tool, but it can be overkill in some scenarios. If you need lightweight tracking of which users are viewing a page or working on a document, consider using a Redis set. Each LiveView can add its user ID to a set on mount and remove it on terminate. This pattern works well for presence outside of traditional channels, especially in systems that mix Phoenix and non-Phoenix clients.</p><p>By introducing Redis into your Phoenix LiveView stack, you gain access to a shared, fast state layer that is well-suited for real-time features, cross-session coordination, and integration with other services. It complements the LiveView process model and allows your app to scale horizontally while keeping UIs consistent and synchronized.</p>","contentLength":5006,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Agents, Clearly Explained","url":"https://dev.to/giri_f_437ca53c03d2fffb79/ai-agents-clearly-explained-156n","date":1751369908,"author":"Giri F","guid":178886,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Unlocking the Power of AI Agents: A Beginner's Guide</strong></p><p>Are you tired of feeling overwhelmed by the technical jargon surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI)? As someone who uses AI tools regularly but lacks a technical background, I was determined to learn more about AI agents and their capabilities. In this article, we'll embark on a journey to demystify AI agents, exploring what they are, how they work, and why they're essential for the future of AI.</p><p><strong>Level 1: Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong></p><p>Our first stop is Large Language Models (LLMs), the foundation of popular AI chatbots like ChatBT, Google Gemini, and Claude. These models are fantastic at generating and editing text based on their training data. For instance, if you ask an LLM to draft an email requesting a coffee chat, it will produce a polished response.</p><p>However, there are two key limitations to LLMs:</p><ol><li>: Despite being trained on vast amounts of data, LLMs lack access to proprietary information like personal or internal company data.</li><li>: LLMs wait for your prompt and then respond; they don't take initiative or make decisions.</li></ol><p>Next, we'll explore AI workflows, which build upon LLMs by introducing predefined paths set by humans. Imagine telling an LLM to perform a search query and fetch data from your Google calendar before responding to a question about a personal event. This workflow allows the LLM to access external tools and provide more accurate answers.</p><p>However, there's a catch: AI workflows can only follow predetermined paths set by humans. If you want to get technical, this path is also called the control logic. To illustrate this concept, let's consider an example where we add multiple steps to the workflow, including accessing weather data via an API and using a text-to-audio model to speak the answer.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong></p><p>You might have come across the term RAG, which stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. In simple terms, RAG is a process that helps AI models look things up before answering, like accessing your calendar or weather service. Think of it as a type of AI workflow.</p><p><strong>Real-World Example: Creating an AI Workflow</strong></p><p>Let's create a simple AI workflow using Make.com, where we compile links to news articles in Google Sheets, summarize them using Perplexity, and draft LinkedIn and Instagram posts using Claude. This workflow follows a predefined path set by us, with each step building upon the previous one.</p><p>Now, let's introduce the game-changer: AI agents. To become an AI agent, our workflow needs to replace human decision-making with LLMs. In other words, the AI agent must reason and act autonomously.</p><p>The three key traits of AI agents are:</p><ol><li>: The AI agent determines the best approach to achieve a goal.</li><li>: The AI agent takes action using tools to produce an interim result.</li><li>: The AI agent observes the interim result and decides whether iterations are required to produce a final output that achieves the initial goal.</li></ol><p><strong>Real-World Example: Andrew's Demo Website</strong></p><p>Let's explore a real-world example of an AI agent in action. Andrew, a prominent figure in AI, created a demo website that illustrates how an AI agent works. When you search for a keyword like \"skier,\" the AI vision agent reasons what a skier looks like and then acts by looking at video footage to identify the skier.</p><p>In conclusion, our journey through the three levels of AI has shown us that AI agents are not just a buzzword, but a powerful tool that can revolutionize the way we interact with technology. By understanding how LLMs, AI workflows, and AI agents work together, we can unlock new possibilities for automation, innovation, and productivity.</p><p>Whether you're a beginner or an expert in AI, I hope this article has provided you with a deeper understanding of AI agents and their capabilities.

You're not alone. As someone who uses AI tools regularly but lacks a technical background, you want to understand how AI agents work and how they can impact your life. In this post, we'll embark on a simple three-level learning journey to explore the world of AI agents, using relatable examples and avoiding jargon.</p><p><strong>Level 1: Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong></p><p>Let's start with popular AI chatbots like CHBT, Google Gemini, and Claude. These applications are built on top of LLMs, which are fantastic at generating and editing text. Here's how it works: you provide an input, and the LLM produces an output based on its training data. For instance, if you ask a chatbot to draft an email, your prompt is the input, and the resulting email is the output.</p><p>However, LLMs have two key limitations:</p><ol><li>: Despite being trained on vast amounts of data, they lack access to proprietary information like personal or internal company data.</li><li>: LLMs wait for your prompt and respond; they don't take initiative or make decisions on their own.</li></ol><p>Keep these traits in mind as we move forward.</p><p>Let's build on our example. What if you told the LLM to perform a search query and fetch data from your Google calendar before providing a response? With this logic implemented, the next time you ask about a personal event, the LLM will first check your calendar and then provide an answer.</p><p>Here's where it gets interesting:</p><ul><li>: AI workflows can only follow predefined paths set by humans. If you want to get technical, this path is also called the control logic.</li><li>: Even if you add multiple steps to the workflow, it's still just an AI workflow. The human decision-maker remains in control.</li></ul><p>You might have heard of terms like \"retrieval augmented generation\" (RAG). In simple terms, RAG is a process that helps AI models look things up before answering, like accessing your calendar or a weather service. Essentially, RAG is just a type of AI workflow.</p><p><strong>Real-World Example: Creating an AI Workflow</strong></p><p>Let's say you want to create social media posts based on news articles. You can use tools like Make.com to compile links to news articles in Google Sheets, summarize them using Perplexity, and then draft LinkedIn and Instagram posts using Claude. This is an example of an AI workflow because it follows a predefined path set by you.</p><p>However, if you test this workflow and don't like the final output, you'll need to manually go back and rewrite the prompt for Claude. This trial-and-error iteration is currently being done by you, a human.</p><p>So, what's the difference between an AI workflow and an AI agent? The key change is that an AI agent must  and  autonomously. In other words, the AI agent replaces the human decision-maker.</p><p>Using our previous example, an AI agent would:</p><ol><li>: Determine the most efficient way to compile news articles, such as using Google Sheets instead of Microsoft Word.</li><li>: Take action using tools like Perplexity and Claude to produce an interim result.</li><li>: Autonomously refine the output until it meets the desired criteria.</li></ol><p>The most common configuration for AI agents is the React framework, which allows them to reason and act in a flexible and adaptive way.</p><p><strong>Real-World Example: An AI Agent in Action</strong></p><p>Andrew, a prominent figure in AI, created a demo website that illustrates how an AI agent works. When you search for a keyword like \"skier,\" the AI vision agent in the background reasons what a skier looks like and then acts by looking at clips in video footage, trying to identify what it thinks a skier is, indexing that clip, and returning it to you.</p><p>This might not seem impressive at first, but remember that an AI agent did all this without human intervention. The programming behind the scenes is complex, but that's the point – the average user wants a simple app that just works.</p><p>In summary, we've covered three levels of AI:</p><ol><li>: Provide input and receive output based on training data.</li><li>: Follow predefined paths set by humans, with limited flexibility.</li><li>: Reason and act autonomously, iterating until a desired outcome is achieved.</li></ol><p>By understanding these levels, you'll be better equipped to harness the power of AI agents in your personal and professional life.

For developers building crypto-related applications, these sustained inflows indicate growing institutional API demands and infrastructure requirements.</p>\nThe distribution across providers tells an interesting story: BlackRock's IBIT captured $1.31 billion, Fidelity's FBTC added $504.4 million, and Ark/21 Shares' ARKB contributed $268.1 million. This diversification suggests that institutional-grade applications need to support multiple provider integrations and data feeds.\nThe institutional adoption of Bitcoin through ETF structures creates several technical considerations:</p><p>API Scalability: Over the past three weeks, cumulative inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs have now reached $4.63 billion. This volume suggests increasing demands on market data APIs and trading infrastructure.\nData Quality: Most Bitcoin ETF inflows are driven by long-only fundamental investors, not short-term traders, according to industry analysis. This indicates that institutional applications require different data granularity and historical analysis capabilities compared to retail trading platforms.<p>\nRegulatory Compliance: The ETF structure provides regulatory clarity that influences application architecture decisions, particularly around KYC/AML implementations and reporting requirements.</p></p><p>Market Data Considerations\nSince Bitcoin ETFs launched 18 months ago, they've attracted over $40 billion in total inflows. This institutional adoption creates opportunities for developers building:</p><p>Portfolio management tools for institutional clients\nRisk management systems for crypto exposure<p>\nData analytics platforms for institutional research</p>\nTrading infrastructure supporting large-volume transactions</p><p>The Ubleu Perspective\nAt Ubleu, we recognize that institutional adoption fundamentally changes the technical requirements for crypto-related applications. The sustained ETF inflows indicate that developers need to prioritize enterprise-grade solutions over purely retail-focused products.<p>\nThe weekly $501 million Friday inflow demonstrates that institutional trading patterns differ significantly from retail behavior. This creates opportunities for developers who understand institutional workflows and can build appropriate tooling.</p>\nTechnical Opportunities<p>\nThe ETF success story suggests several development priorities:</p></p><p>Enhanced market data feeds supporting institutional analysis\nPortfolio construction tools incorporating crypto ETF exposure<p>\nRisk management systems for traditional finance firms</p>\nCompliance and reporting solutions for institutional investors</p><p>For comprehensive market analysis and development insights, explore resources at <a href=\"https://www.idcxs.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.idcxs.com</a>.\nThe institutional revolution in crypto isn't just changing markets—it's creating new technical requirements and opportunities for developers who understand the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets.</p>","contentLength":3306,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"MCP vs API: Simplifying AI Agent Integration with External Data","url":"https://dev.to/giri_f_437ca53c03d2fffb79/mcp-vs-api-simplifying-ai-agent-integration-with-external-data-39ho","date":1751366771,"author":"Giri F","guid":178863,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>The Future of AI Integration: Unlocking the Power of Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong></p><p>As large language models continue to advance, their ability to interact with external data sources and services has become increasingly crucial. Until recently, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) were the primary means of facilitating this interaction. However, in late 2024, Anthropic introduced a game-changing open standard protocol called Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is revolutionizing the way applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this article, we'll delve into the world of MCP and APIs, exploring their similarities and differences, and examining how MCP is poised to transform the AI landscape.</p><p><strong>What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?</strong></p><p>Imagine a USB-C port for your AI applications – that's essentially what MCP represents. It standardizes connections between AI applications, LLMs, and external data sources, allowing them to communicate seamlessly. Just as a laptop's USB-C ports can accommodate various peripherals, MCP enables AI agents to interact with diverse services and tools using a common protocol.</p><p>At its core, MCP consists of an MCP host that runs multiple MCP clients. Each client opens a JSON RPC 2.0 session, connecting to external MCP servers via the MCP protocol. This client-server relationship exposes capabilities such as database access, code repositories, or email servers. The architecture is designed to address two primary needs of LLM applications: providing contextual data and enabling tool usage.</p><p>MCP offers three key primitives:</p><ol><li>: Discrete actions or functions that AI agents can call, such as a weather service or calendar integration.</li><li>: Read-only data items or documents that servers can provide on demand, like text files or database schema.</li><li>: Predefined templates providing suggested prompts.</li></ol><p>MCP servers advertise their available primitives, allowing AI agents to discover and invoke new capabilities at runtime without requiring code redeployment. This dynamic discovery mechanism is a significant advantage of MCP, enabling AI agents to adapt to changing server capabilities.</p><p><strong>APIs: A Traditional Approach</strong></p><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are another way for systems to access external functionality or data. APIs act as an abstraction layer, hiding internal details and providing a standardized interface for requesting information or services. RESTful APIs, in particular, have become the de facto standard for web-based interactions.</p><p>However, APIs were not designed specifically with AI or LLMs in mind, which means they lack certain assumptions that are useful for AI applications. Traditional REST APIs do not typically expose runtime discovery mechanisms, requiring clients to be updated manually when new endpoints are added.</p><p><strong>MCP vs. APIs: Similarities and Differences</strong></p><p>While both MCP and APIs employ client-server architectures and provide abstraction layers, there are significant differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Purpose-built vs. General-purpose</strong>: MCP is designed specifically for LLM applications, whereas APIs are more general-purpose.</li><li>: MCP supports runtime discovery of available capabilities, whereas traditional REST APIs do not.</li><li>: Every MCP server speaks the same protocol and follows the same patterns, whereas each API is unique.</li></ul><p>Interestingly, many MCP servers actually use traditional APIs under the hood to perform their work. This means that MCP and APIs are not mutually exclusive; instead, they can coexist as layers in an AI stack, with MCP providing a more AI-friendly interface on top of existing APIs.</p><p><strong>The Future of AI Integration</strong></p><p>As MCP continues to gain traction, we can expect to see a growing list of services integrated into AI agents using this standardized protocol. From file systems and Google Maps to Docker and Spotify, the possibilities for AI-powered applications are vast. By unlocking the power of MCP, developers can create more sophisticated AI models that interact seamlessly with external data sources and tools, paving the way for a new era of innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.</p><p>In conclusion, Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant leap forward in AI integration, offering a standardized and purpose-built solution for LLM applications. By understanding the similarities and differences between MCP and APIs, developers can harness the power of this emerging technology to create more intelligent, adaptive, and connected AI systems. As we embark on this exciting journey, one thing is clear: the future of AI has never looked brighter.</p>","contentLength":4569,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Understanding Content Security Policy (CSP) in JavaScript Apps","url":"https://dev.to/muhayminbinmehmood/understanding-content-security-policy-csp-in-javascript-apps-437l","date":1751366340,"author":"Muhaymin Bin Mehmood","guid":178862,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey folks, let’s dive into Content Security Policy (CSP) — a powerful yet often misunderstood tool that helps you lock down where your app can load resources from, protecting against XSS, click‑jacking, and more.</p><p>CSP is a browser‐enforced set of rules—sent via HTTP headers (or  tags)—that defines which sources your app can load scripts, stylesheets, images, frames, and other resources from</p><div><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' example.com;\n</code></pre></div><p>By default, only load assets from the same origin\nImages can also come from </p><ol><li>Block XSS attacks – Restrict script sources so injected code can’t run</li><li>Block click‑jacking – Prevent framing via frame-ancestors</li><li>Enforce HTTPS – Use upgrade-insecure-requests to force secure loads</li><li>Boost trust – Shows users you care about security</li></ol><ul><li>default-src – default fallback for everything</li><li>script-src, style-src, img-src, connect-src, etc. – control specific asset types </li><li>object-src 'none' – block Flash &amp; plugins</li><li>frame-ancestors 'none' – prevent embedding (stronger than X-Frame-Options)</li></ul><p>👉 Want to see the full breakdown with real‑world examples, error cases, and extra tips?

It transformed how we interact with our phones. The iOS 26 user experience goes beyond visuals. It shifts how you feel as you use your iPhone. This update quietly redefines interaction by blending form, function, and emotion into every tap and scroll.</p><p><strong>A Design That Feels Alive</strong></p><p>A glance at the updated lock screen clarifies that something has changed. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple’s Liquid Glass design</a> brings subtle depth to buttons, menus, and widgets. Instead of looking flat, elements now appear to float slightly above the background. They respond as you scroll or touch them. You might notice a gentle shifting of light or a soft reflection. These refinements do more than delight. They reduce friction. When your phone mirrors your motions so closely, it stops feeling like a tool and begins to feel like a well-tuned extension of your touch.\nThese changes affect every corner of the interface. Notification banners slide in with gentle expansiveness. Control Center panels collapse and expand smoothly. Even split view on an iPad or a Mac feels more integrated. This cohesion reinforces the sense that the iOS 26 user experience is more immersive and emotionally engaging.</p><p><strong>Everyday Interactions That Feel Natural</strong></p><p>Dig into Messages, Mail or Calendar and you will notice something familiar yet different. Transitions move more fluidly, replacing stuttery animations with something more responsive. Imagine opening a Message thread and seeing each bubble expand softly then return to its place. Widgets update at just the right moment. Schedules on the lock screen appear organically as your day changes rather than popping in suddenly.\nThese are not headline features. They are subtle refinements that align the system with human gestures. Each moment of interaction feels intentional and gentle. The result is that seemingly small changes have an outsized impact on how smooth your daily experience feels. Together, they create a more polished and intuitive iOS 26 user experience.</p><p><strong>Intelligence That Works with Your Rhythm</strong></p><p>This update is also about making your phone adapt to you rather than forcing you to adapt to the phone. With on-device intelligence built right into the system, capabilities like Smart Summaries in Safari and Mail now work instantly and privately. When you open a long email, a summary appears above it so you grasp the main point quickly. If you are reading an article you do not have time for, you can ask for a summary without sending anything to the cloud.\nLive translation within Messages and FaceTime feels nearly magical. Reply to a friend in another language and the suggestion appears instantly. All this happens offline. Apple trusts its on device models to deliver speed without compromising your privacy. This level of personal adaptation is central to the iOS 26 user experience and helps your phone feel like it knows you.</p><p><strong>Building Inclusivity Through Design</strong></p><p>Apple has long emphasized accessibility. With iOS 26, the company has raised the bar again. Voice Control responds faster when you speak, reducing the delay that might break your flow. Visual enhancements optimize contrast and font size based on screen conditions and app context. Live Speech captions spoken words across FaceTime and in meetings with improved clarity.\nThese upgrades make the system easier to use for more people. The keyboard gains smarter autocorrections. Text-to-speech reads messages in a more natural tone. Visual focus shifts intelligently when VoiceOver is on. Even on a visual level, the Liquid Glass design supports these improvements, helping elements stand out clearly without needing extra setup. This approach promotes inclusion not as a feature but as a core element of the latest iOS.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Apple provided developers with tools to bring these changes into third-party apps. In Xcode 26, developers find a new component set that embraces Liquid Glass visuals. SwiftUI now supports dynamically adaptive layouts and interactive translucency without writing complex rendering code. The system bridges the design between Apple’s apps and what users build on their own.\nImagine a photo editing app that animates button feedback as you scroll, or a finance app that smoothly updates balance figures as you swipe down. With these tools, developers can spotlight transitions in meaningful ways and match system-level polish. This alignment across apps builds consistency in the iOS 26 user experience.</p><p><strong>A Philosophical Shift in User Experience</strong></p><p>A feature-based update often lists what is new. iOS v26 is different. It is less about features and more about how everything feels. Apple has shifted toward experience being the hero. So rather than showcasing a dozen additions, the message to iPhone users is that their phone understands their rhythm, their intent, and their subtle touches.\nThe emphasis on emotional design echoes through every area of the system. From the lock screen to Safari, from translation to email summaries, the goal is the same: seamless interaction that feels human. That shift is why the iOS 26 user experience is poised to influence design across platforms and brands in the months ahead.</p><p><strong>How Qwegle Observes UX Evolution</strong></p><p>At <a href=\"http://qwegle.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Qwegle</a>, we follow changes like this not because they are exciting, but because they signal a shift in user expectations. Our experts study how small refinements like animation timing, gesture feedback, and micro interactions can improve engagement. We watch how developers adopt Apple’s tools to create consistent  experiences. These insights help our team guide clients in modern and intuitive designs.\nOur approach to UX is grounded in observing how real people use these design updates in daily life. We look at how updated UI elements affect user experience, reduce errors, and support accessibility. By keeping track of these factors, Qwegle can advise on product design that meets the new standard set by iOS 26's user experience.</p><p><strong>How to Explore It Yourself</strong></p><p>You do not need to wait until the public release to feel the change. The new iOS beta showcases responsive widgets, adaptive animations, translucent menus, and Smart Summaries in action. Play with the lock screen to see dynamic scheduling adaptation. Switch between apps to feel the fluidity in transitions.\nConsider installing a third-party app that uses translucent controls and motion. Watch how it aligns with system-level elements. If you are a designer or developer consider exploring Liquid Glass visuals in SwiftUI. You can learn how building consistent gestures, animations and visual depth can elevate your own app’s feel. The iOS 26 user experience sets a new bar not just for system apps but the apps people use every day.</p><p><strong>Looking Ahead to Broader Impact</strong></p><p>What starts with iOS 26 will likely ripple through software ecosystems. Android and cross-platform tools such as Flutter or React Native will feel pressure to increase the performance of animations and layer depth to match this level of emotional intelligence. Websites and web apps may adapt their scroll and hover effects to echo this same feel. In education, finance, retail, or healthcare apps, designers will begin to rethink how subtle animation and on‐device summarization can improve real tasks.\nThe result will be a more coherent user experience across digital products and platforms.

Not just “does it respond nicely,” but can it be tricked, misused, or pushed beyond its limits?</p><p>In 2025, red teaming has become a crucial part of building and deploying any system that generates responses, makes decisions, or interacts with users. It’s no longer just a checkbox for security teams. Developers, builders, and researchers now need to think like adversaries—because someone else eventually will.</p><p>That’s where red teaming tools come in. They help you test your system the way it will be tested in the wild—whether it’s a chatbot, a document assistant, a search tool, or an agent navigating multi-step workflows.</p><p>In this post, we’re breaking down four standout tools that do this job in different ways:\nPromptfoo, DeepTeam, PyRIT, and Garak.</p><p>This post isn’t a feature checklist or a sales pitch. It’s just a practical breakdown of what each tool does, who it’s built for, and where it makes sense to use it.</p><p>There’s no shortage of tools out there claiming to “test” your system. But these four have earned their spot by actually getting used—in real workflows, by real teams. Each takes a different route to the same goal: figuring out where your system might break when it matters most.</p><p>If you're building with constant iteration—pull requests, nightly tests, CI pipelines—Promptfoo fits right in. It doesn’t just throw canned prompts at your app. It digs into how your system works, then generates test cases tailored to your setup.</p><p>Whether it’s a chatbot, a RAG pipeline, or a multi-turn agent, Promptfoo builds prompts that make sense for what you built. Plus, it works cleanly with GitHub Actions, terminal scripts, or even a web-based dashboard if you want to see everything side-by-side.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa8nu2077iwy38v2obadc.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa8nu2077iwy38v2obadc.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\"></a></p><p>DeepTeam is what you grab when you want to throw a wide net—fast. It comes preloaded with a long list of common vulnerabilities and the tools to try and trigger them. The setup is quick, the results are readable, and it doesn’t ask much of you to get started.</p><p>It’s especially useful if you need a simple way to scan for known red flags across typical use cases. Think of it as a solid, out-of-the-box safety check.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F488ns61ass24xenwz6w6.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F488ns61ass24xenwz6w6.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\"></a></p><p>PyRIT is for people who go deep. Built to scale and designed for flexibility, it’s less of a “tool” and more of a full-on framework. You can write your own test logic, chain together attack steps, and run it across different types of models—even ones that handle vision or other input types. </p><p>It’s not plug-and-play, but that’s the point. It gives you full control to build custom red teaming flows that actually match the complex stuff you’re testing.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fq32jfd5b6kk4e8avu9et.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fq32jfd5b6kk4e8avu9et.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"553\"></a></p><p>Garak focuses on known problems—and hits them hard. It brings a giant library of prewritten attacks, tweaks them in subtle ways, and checks how your model holds up. You’re not customizing much here.</p><p>You’re letting Garak run through everything from jailbreaks to prompt injection tricks to training data leaks. It’s a go-to if you want to audit a system, export reports, or just see how your setup compares against established weak spots.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F41b4v76qmebadgjj4u7e.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F41b4v76qmebadgjj4u7e.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"443\"></a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How They Approach the Problem\n</h3><p>Still not sure which one fits? Here’s the no-nonsense breakdown:</p><ul><li>You’re building something real — RAG, agents, pipelines — and want to test it like a real app.</li><li>You care about CI/CD — testing on every pull request or nightly run.</li><li>You need visibility — the dashboard and side-by-side comparison make your life easier.</li><li>Your team has compliance or reporting requirements (OWASP, NIST, EU stuff).</li></ul><p>Promptfoo is the most application-aware tool in the lineup. If you want your tests to reflect what your actual users might try (or abuse), this is the one.</p><ul><li>You need something fast, clean, and ready to go — no config headaches.</li><li>You want broad coverage: 50+ vulnerability types tested automatically.</li><li>You’re not looking for deep customization — just solid safety signals across the board.</li></ul><p>DeepTeam is like a “grab-and-go” red teaming kit. It’s not going to adapt to your system logic, but it’ll hit the big, obvious vulnerabilities well.</p><ul><li>You have an actual red team or a security engineering team with cycles.</li><li>You want to build complex, multi-turn, even multimodal red teaming flows.</li><li>You’re in a Microsoft-heavy environment (Azure OpenAI, enterprise stack).</li></ul><p>PyRIT is a toolkit, not a tool. It’s flexible and powerful — but you’ll need time, code, and intent behind it.</p><ul><li>You want to run a big set of known exploits and see what breaks.</li><li>You’re doing periodic audits or pre-release compliance testing.</li><li>You like exporting to vulnerability trackers or NeMo Guardrails.</li></ul><p>Garak doesn’t learn or adapt — it hits you with everything it knows. If you survive the scan, you’re in a decent place.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Testing Styles and Automation\n</h3><p>Here’s how each tool plugs into your workflow:</p><p>: Built for automation. Run via CLI or GitHub Actions. Web dashboard for side-by-side comparisons. Supports multi-turn and app-contextual tests.</p><p>: Python CLI, one-off audits. Covers wide attack space, but no deep context. CLI style:python -m garak --model my-api --probes all</p><p>: Script-heavy, geared toward power users. Write scenarios, simulate stepwise attacks.</p><p>: Python-based, fast-start with predefined metrics. Not built for CI/CD but great for exploratory scans.</p><p>: Teams at Microsoft, Shopify, and Discord use it in day-to-day builds.</p><p>: Common in research labs and auditing teams, including work with NVIDIA NeMo.</p><p>: Popular with red teams inside Azure-based enterprises.</p><p>: Used by vision-language research projects and academic groups.</p><p>: Easy CLI. npm install -g promptfoo. YAML-driven configs. Smooth DevOps integration.</p><p>: Python, minimal setup. Requires endpoint or local model setup.</p><p>: Heavy Python scripting. Expect to code your flows.</p><p>: Script-based, requires knowledge of ML workflows. Minimal install, fast setup.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Four Paths to the Same Goal\n</h3><p>Every tool tests for safety, but their methods vary:</p><ul><li>Promptfoo: Generates contextual, real-time tests that evolve with your app.</li><li>DeepTeam: Scans through known weak spots with minimal friction.</li><li>PyRIT: Simulates risk scenarios, guided by policy.</li><li>Garak: Hits your system with a library of documented exploits.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Attack Generation: Dynamic vs. Curated\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  Promptfoo’s Dynamic Generation\n</h4><p>Promptfoo crafts prompts using your own app logic. It acts like a fuzz tester for natural language, generating:</p><ul><li>Policy-violating requests</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Garak’s Curated Attack Library\n</h4><ul><li>Buffs (translated, paraphrased variants)</li><li>Jailbreaks, leaks, filter bypasses</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  PyRIT’s Template-Based Generation\n</h3><ul><li>Write custom attack templates</li><li>Target specific compliance requirements</li><li>Chain together steps to simulate attacker behavior</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  DeepTeam’s Predefined Vulnerabilities\n</h3><ul><li>50+ built-in vulnerability types</li><li>Focused on metrics and quick feedback</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Security Coverage: Where Each Tool Excels\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  Core Vulnerability Testing\n</h4><p>Promptfoo and Garak both provide broad coverage. Promptfoo is more adaptable; Garak is wider in known issues. PyRIT offers structured attack paths based on policies. DeepTeam focuses on vision-text specific threats.</p><ul><li>Only Promptfoo deeply attacks RAG systems:</li></ul><p>Garak doesn’t go deep on RAG pipelines. PyRIT and DeepTeam are not designed for RAG contexts.</p><ul><li>Multi-step memory manipulation</li></ul><p>Garak focuses on one-shot prompts. PyRIT can simulate escalation sequences with manual design. DeepTeam doesn't support agent-based flows.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Testing Complex Applications\n</h3><ul><li>Promptfoo: REST, Python, browser automation, LangChain, stateful flows.</li><li>Garak: HTTP REST and basic prompt-level interfaces.</li><li>PyRIT: Custom risk-based multi-step attack flows possible.</li><li>DeepTeam: Mostly vision/text simulations; application testing limited.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Standards, Compliance, and Reporting\n</h3><ul><li>Promptfoo: Maps results to OWASP, NIST RMF, MITRE, EU Acts. Generates dashboards, alerts, and reports.</li><li>Garak: Pushes reports to community databases, integrates with NeMo.</li><li>PyRIT: Allows mapping to enterprise frameworks and compliance templates.</li><li>DeepTeam: Provides basic metrics, not tailored for policy alignment.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Verdict: What Should You Choose?\n</h3><ul><li>Promptfoo if you’re building custom apps, pipelines, or multi-step agents.

Accidentally Working Directly on </strong>\nThe Mistake: You started coding on the  branch out of habit or by mistake.\nThe Fix:<p>\nStash or commit your changes, create a new branch, and move them:</p></p><div><pre><code>git stash\ngit checkout -b new-feature-branch\ngit stash pop\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Now you're back on track without contaminating the main branch.</p><p><strong>5. Deleting the Wrong Branch</strong>\nThe Mistake: You delete a branch thinking it’s no longer needed, but it had unfinished or valuable work.\nBefore deleting, double-check using:</p><div><pre><code>git branch          # local\ngit branch -r       # remote\n\n</code></pre></div><p>If already deleted locally, you can sometimes recover with:</p><div><pre><code>git reflog\ngit checkout &lt;commit-hash&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>6.

As reported by SportQuake, annual investments by crypto brands in sports sponsorship rose by 20%, now surpassing . This growth signals a deliberate strategy: the crypto industry is leveraging the global scale and cultural influence of sports to expand brand reach, build trust, and drive user acquisition.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Sports and Crypto Are Strategic Allies\n</h2><p>Sport is a global industry with an unparalleled ability to capture public attention and foster emotional engagement. For crypto companies aiming to expand internationally and onboard mainstream audiences, sports represent a powerful entry point. This synergy is based on several strategic advantages:</p><p><p>\nBillions of people follow sports events, making it an ideal vector to introduce crypto products to large and diverse user groups.</p></p><p><p>\nMatches, tournaments, and athletes drive ongoing media exposure—TV, streaming, and social platforms—keeping crypto brands consistently in the public eye.</p></p><p><p>\nSports evoke loyalty, emotion, and personal identification. Fans are more likely to engage with products endorsed by their favorite teams or athletes.</p></p><p>As a result, sports sponsorships are not just advertising—they are infrastructure for onboarding, education, and long-term brand integration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Formats of Crypto-Sports Collaboration\n</h2><p>Several crypto firms have pioneered partnerships that show how sports can increase platform visibility, token adoption, and ultimately, capitalization.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Crypto.com: Multi-League Expansion and Brand Recognition\n</h3><p>Crypto.com has invested aggressively in sports, partnering with the NBA, Formula 1, and AC Milan. A pivotal moment came in 2021 when it secured naming rights for the former Staples Center, now . The impact was immediate:</p><p><strong>• CRO active wallets jumped from 2,000 to 10,000.</strong><strong>• Sports-related investments totaled $213 million.</strong><strong>• Capitalization reached $78 billion.</strong></p><p>In August 2024, Crypto.com became the first global crypto sponsor of the , securing placement in broadcasts and in-stadium activations.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  WhiteBIT: Long-Term Strategy with FC Barcelona and Juventus\n</h3><p>Since 2022, WhiteBIT has served as the official crypto partner of , integrating its brand into team events, sports platforms, and LED boards. Notable developments include:</p><p><strong>• Blockchain education initiatives with Barça Innovation Hub.</strong><strong>• $13 million total investment in sports.</strong><strong>• Capitalization of $38.9 billion.</strong></p><p>On , WhiteBIT signed a 3-year contract with . The result:</p><p><strong>• WBT token price surged 35% to an ATH of $52.27.</strong><strong>• Capitalization neared $40 billion.</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  OKX: Fan Engagement and Token Momentum\n</h3><p>OKX began its partnership with  in 2022, which rapidly boosted the OKB token’s value. Key achievements include:</p><p> A virtual fan engagement platform.<strong>• Sponsorship of men’s and women’s team sleeves in 2023.</strong><strong>• Co-launch of an NFT collection in April 2024.</strong><strong>• $71 million invested in sports, $45.9 billion capitalization.</strong></p><p>Strategic alignment with the sports industry enables crypto companies to scale rapidly, build trust, and generate long-term brand equity. With high visibility, passionate fan bases, and global distribution, sports serve as a scalable foundation for crypto growth and user adoption.</p><p>The data is clear: crypto companies that enter the sports ecosystem effectively are rewarded with increased capitalization, broader recognition, and stronger market positions.

This architecture simplifies debugging and testing, making state mutations explicit and traceable.</p><ul><li> Holds the entire state of the application.</li><li> Plain objects describing what happened.</li><li> Pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.</li><li> The method to send actions to the store.</li></ul><h2>Integrating Redux with React</h2><p>React-Redux is the official binding library that connects Redux with React components, providing hooks and higher-order components to access and manipulate the store.</p><h3>Setting Up a Basic Redux Store</h3><pre><code>import { createStore } from 'redux';\n\n// Initial state\nconst initialState = { count: 0 };\n\n// Reducer function\nfunction counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\n// Create store\nconst store = createStore(counterReducer);\n</code></pre><h3>Connecting React Components</h3><p>Using React-Redux hooks like  and  simplifies interaction with the store.</p><pre><code>import React from 'react';\nimport { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const count = useSelector(state =&gt; state.count);\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}&gt;Decrement&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Middleware for Async Operations</h3><p>Redux middleware like  or  enables handling asynchronous logic elegantly.</p><pre><code>import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk';\n\n// Async action creator\nconst fetchData = () =&gt; {\n  return async (dispatch) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n      const data = await response.json();\n      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });\n    } catch (error) {\n      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error });\n    }\n  };\n};\n\nconst store = createStore(counterReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));\n</code></pre><p>Redux Toolkit streamlines Redux development by reducing boilerplate and providing powerful utilities.</p><pre><code>import { configureStore, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: { count: 0 },\n  reducers: {\n    increment: state =&gt; { state.count += 1; },\n    decrement: state =&gt; { state.count -= 1; }\n  }\n});\n\nexport const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n});\n</code></pre><h2>Why React and Redux Are the Future</h2><p>The combination of React's declarative UI and Redux's predictable state management creates a powerful paradigm for building complex applications. As AI-driven interfaces and real-time data become ubiquitous, maintaining clear and manageable state logic is critical. Redux's architecture aligns perfectly with these futuristic demands, enabling developers to innovate without losing control.</p><p>Mastering React and Redux unlocks the potential to build next-generation web applications that are scalable, maintainable, and performant. By embracing their synergy, developers can navigate the complexities of state management with confidence and creativity, paving the way for a future where frontend development is both an art and a science.</p><p>Stay curious, keep experimenting, and let the React-Redux duo propel your projects into the future.</p>","contentLength":4410,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"📖 The Era of AI — A New Blog Series Begins","url":"https://dev.to/pjdeveloper896/the-era-of-ai-a-new-blog-series-begins-4epi","date":1751363245,"author":"Prasoon","guid":178807,"unread":true,"content":"<p> | Developer | Storyteller  </p><blockquote><p><em>\"Coding isn't just logic anymore — it's a vibe.\"</em><em>\"AI isn't just tech — it's a movement.\"</em><p>\nWelcome to my new poetic + dev-inspired blog series:</p></p></blockquote><p>This isn’t your regular AI blog. is a poetic + visionary journey — a 3-part series capturing the creative and emotional side of how Artificial Intelligence is transforming the developer world.</p><p>🧵 It’s not just about models and code.<p>\nIt’s about rhythm, revolution, and the future.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  📘 Volume 1: <em>Introduction to Vibe Coding</em></h3><p>A new wave of coding is here.<p>\nOne where artists become developers and developers become artists.</p><p>\nAI tools now turn thoughts into UI, ideas into code — and this changes everything.</p></p><blockquote><p><em>This volume is about how coding is becoming intuitive, emotional, and AI-assisted.</em></p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  📗 Volume 2: </h3><p>From ChatGPT to Stable Diffusion to generative design — AI has become a co-pilot, not a tool.<p>\nIn this part, we explore how it’s disrupting industries, workflows, and creative boundaries.</p></p><blockquote><p><em>This volume is about the power shift — from code-heavy work to AI-driven flow.</em></p></blockquote><p>What happens next?<p>\nWill AI replace devs?

Doing so reflects the data model into object counterparts, <strong>which leads to almost every concept in our “domain model” being coded as an Entity abounding with getter and setter methods.</strong></p></blockquote><p>here is the problem, we have entities we only getters and setters and no domain logic!</p><blockquote><p>We design a domain concept as an Entity when we care about its individuality, when distinguishing it from all other objects in a system is a mandatory constraint. <strong>An Entity is a unique thing and is capable of being changed continuously over a long period of time. Changes may be so extensive that the object might seem much different from what it once was. Yet, it is the same object by identity.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>It is the unique identity and mutability characteristics that set Entities apart from Value Objects</em></p><h2> 🙃\n</h2><blockquote><p>There are times when an Entity is not the appropriate modeling tool to\nreach for. Misappropriated use happens far more often than many are aware. Often a concept should be modeled as a Value. If this is a disagreeable notion, it might be that DDD doesn’t fit your business needs. It is quite possible that a CRUD-based system would be more fitting. <strong>When CRUD makes sense, languages and frameworks such as Groovy and Grails, Ruby on Rails, and the like make the most sense. If the choice is correct, it should save time and money.</strong></p></blockquote><h2>😉\n</h2><blockquote><p>When complexity grows, we experience the limitation of poor tool selection. CRUD systems can’t produce a refined business model by only capturing data. <strong>If DDD is a justifiable investment in the business’s bottom line, we use Entities as intended.</strong></p></blockquote><p>And if we talk about the fact to track changes of an entity, that entity has to have a unique identifier , and Eric Evans says : </p><p><em>When an object is distinguished by its identity, rather than its attributes, make this primary to its definition in the model. Keep the class definition simple and focused on life cycle continuity and identity. Define a means of distinguishing each object regardless of its form or history. The model must define what it means to be the same thing</em></p><h2><strong>E. Unique Identity for an Entity</strong></h2><blockquote><p>So that’s what we’ll do first. Having a range of available options for implementing identity is really important, as are those for ensuring that the uniqueness is preserved throughout time.</p></blockquote><p>We will go through each of the method for ensuring unique identity for an entity </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1️⃣ </h3><p>✅ : It appears to be a straightforward approach to have a user manually enter the details of unique identity. <strong>The user types a recognizable value or symbol into an input field or selects from a set of available characteristics, and the Entity is created.</strong></p><p>❌ : One complication is relying on users to produce quality identities. The identity may be unique but incorrect. Most times identities must be immutable, so users shouldn’t change them. <strong>Can users be relied upon to produce both unique and correct, long-lasting identities?</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2️⃣ <strong>Application generates identity</strong></h3><p>✅ : There are highly reliable ways to autogenerate unique identities, although care must be taken when the application is clustered or otherwise distributed across multiple computing nodes. There are identity creation patterns that can, to a much greater degree of certainty, produce a completely unique identity. The universally unique identifier (UUID), or globally unique identifier (GUID).</p><p>❌ : the identity is big and is not considered human-readable.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3️⃣ <strong>Persistence Mechanism Generates Identity</strong></h3><p>✅ : <strong>Delegating the generation of unique identity to a persistence mechanism has some unique advantages. If we call on the database for a sequence or incrementing value, it will always be unique.</strong> Depending on the range needed, the database can generate a unique 2-byte, 4-byte, or 8-byte value. In Java, a 2-byte short integer would allow for up to 32,767 unique identities; a 4-byte normal integer would afford 2,147,483,647 unique values; and an 8-byte long integer would provide up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 distinct identities. Even zero-filled text representations of these ranges are narrow, at five, ten, and 19 characters respectively.</p><p>❌ : <strong>One possible downside is performance. It can take significantly longer to go to the database to get each value than to generate identities in the application.</strong> Much depends on database load and application demand. <em>One way around this is to cache sequence/increment values in the application, such as in a Repository.</em></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4️⃣ <strong>Another Bounded Context assigns Identity</strong></h3><p>✅  : <strong>When another Bounded Context assigns identity, we need to integrate to find, match, and assign each identity.</strong> DDD integrations are explained in Context Maps and Integrating Bounded Contexts. Making an exact match is the most desirable. Users need to provide one or more attributes, such as an account number, username, e-mail address, or other unique symbol, to pinpoint the intended result.</p><p>❌ : <strong>This has synchronization implications.</strong> What happens if externally referenced objects transition in ways that affect local Entities? How will we know that the associated object changed?</p><p>💡 : This problem can be solved using an Event-Driven Architecture with Domain Events. Our local Bounded Context\nsubscribes to Domain Events published by external systems. When a relevant notification is received, our local system transitions its own Aggregate Entities to reflect the state of those in external systems.</p><p><em>Conclusion : An Entity is an object that  that runs through time and different states.  — its attributes may change, but it remains the same entity. <strong>Is distinguished by its ID</strong> rather than its attributes.</em></p>","contentLength":5870,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"North America IT Career Planning: How to Chart Your Path to Success","url":"https://dev.to/rac/north-america-it-career-planning-how-to-chart-your-path-to-success-3ea9","date":1751362990,"author":"Zack Rac","guid":178815,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Planning a <a href=\"https://www.drillinsight.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">career in North America’s IT industry</a> can be both exciting and overwhelming.

Your team has worked countless hours building what you believe is a game-changing mobile app. The designs are slick. The features are solid. The marketing is ready to go.</p><p>Crashes on newer Android devices. Laggy performance on older iPhones. UI elements that look perfect in staging but fall apart in real-world use.</p><p>I’ve been there. And trust me, there’s no punch to the gut quite like watching user reviews plummet on launch week, all because your mobile app testing strategy didn’t keep up with the times.</p><p> If your team is still treating mobile app testing like it’s 2015, you’re going to miss critical issues- and user trust. Below are five red flags that your strategy is outdated, along with how to bring it into 2025, where it belongs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. You're Only Testing Manually- or Mostly Manually\n</h2><p>Manual testing still has its place, especially for exploratory testing or UX checks, but if it’s your primary method, that’s a red flag.</p><p>Think about it: modern mobile apps need to work across dozens of device combinations, OS versions, screen sizes, and network environments. Testing each scenario by hand is not just inefficient, it’s impossible.</p><ul><li>Introduce automated testing frameworks like Appium, Espresso, or XCUITest.</li><li>Set up CI/CD pipelines with integrated test automation to run tests every time code is pushed.</li><li>Use cloud-based testing services like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to scale across real devices.</li></ul><p>It’s not about replacing testers- it’s about freeing them up to focus on the kinds of testing automation can’t do well (yet), like emotional user flows or edge-case discovery.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. You’re Ignoring Real-World Network Conditions\n</h2><p>One of the most common complaints from users is performance. And yet, many teams still test their  on lightning-fast Wi-Fi networks with stable connections and minimal latency.</p><p>Real users aren’t in that world.</p><p>They’re on 3G in elevators. They’re switching between cell towers while driving. They’re tapping your app with 10% battery and two other apps running in the background.</p><p><strong>Modern app testing needs to simulate reality.</strong></p><ul><li>Test under various network conditions (3 G, 4G, 5G, low bandwidth, high latency).</li><li>Use tools like Charles Proxy or Network Link Conditioner to simulate weak signals.</li><li>Include scenarios like airplane mode toggles, network loss, or limited data plans.</li></ul><p>It’s not about perfection. It’s about preparedness.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Your Device Coverage Is Limited- or Nonexistent\n</h2><p>Let’s be honest: many teams only test on the devices they have lying around. Typically, the latest iPhone, possibly one Samsung Galaxy, and the emulator that comes built into Android Studio.</p><p>But fragmentation is a very real thing. According to fictional-but-plausible internal data from Global Mobile Metrics 2025, <strong>70% of app crashes on Android happen on devices not covered in standard emulator testing.</strong></p><p>Different screen sizes, chipsets, and memory capabilities introduce subtle (and sometimes show-stopping) bugs.</p><ul><li>Build a device matrix based on your actual user base.</li><li>Use real-device cloud platforms to test at scale.</li><li>Prioritize testing on top devices by market share, not just the ones in your drawer.</li></ul><p>And don’t forget the long-tail devices. Sometimes your most loyal users are the ones still using their four-year-old phones. Don’t leave them behind.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. You're Not Testing for Accessibility\n</h2><p>In 2025, accessibility is no longer a “nice-to-have.” It’s an expectation- and in some regions, a legal requirement. Still, many teams forget to check whether their apps work with screen readers or if color contrast meets WCAG standards.</p><p>Ignoring accessibility doesn’t just leave users out it limits your audience and invites avoidable backlash.</p><ul><li>Incorporate accessibility checks into your QA checklist.</li><li>Use tools like Accessibility Scanner (Android) or VoiceOver (iOS) during testing.</li><li>Train developers and designers on accessible UI/UX best practices.</li></ul><p>One test session with a screen reader will open your eyes. I've done it. It was humbling, but it made our app better for everyone.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Your Feedback Loop Is Too Slow—or Nonexistent\n</h2><p>If you’re waiting until a sprint ends to test… or if bugs get reported by customers before your team even sees them… your feedback loop is broken.</p><p>In the age of rapid releases and user expectations, delays in bug discovery are costly, not just in development time, but in brand trust.</p><ul><li>Integrate testing into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.</li><li>Use crash analytics tools like Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry to monitor real-time issues post-release.</li><li>Close the loop between QA, development, and customer support. Bug reports should never get lost in translation.</li></ul><p>Think of testing not as a gatekeeper, but as a guidepost- constantly pointing the team toward a better product.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Upgrading Your Strategy: It’s About Mindset, Not Just Tools\n</h2><p>At the core, fixing your outdated testing strategy isn’t about chasing shiny new tools. It’s about shifting the way your team thinks about testing.</p><p>It's no longer a “final phase” activity. It’s embedded from the first line of code. It’s part of every build, every release, every conversation.</p><p>When you make that shift- when you embrace continuous, automated, real-world, user-first testing- you don’t just prevent bugs. You create confidence.</p><p>And confidence is what powers great mobile products.</p><p>Let’s face it- users don’t care about how hard you worked. They care about whether your app works for them, in their world.</p><p>And if you want to meet that standard, it’s time to embrace  as part of your core development strategy. It’s faster. Smarter. And ultimately, the key to delivering mobile experiences that earn loyalty, not one-star reviews.</p><p>Because the best app isn’t the one with the most features- it’s the one that works flawlessly, every time, everywhere.</p>","contentLength":5907,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Optimizing Inter-Departmental Data Flows with Receiver-Driven Transformation","url":"https://dev.to/imran_rizvi_e6c91252ff79f/optimizing-inter-departmental-data-flows-with-receiver-driven-transformation-51mf","date":1751362682,"author":"Imran Rizvi","guid":178810,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In large-scale enterprises managing complex supply-demand dynamics—spanning domains like supply chain, finance, and operations—inter-departmental data transfers are critical yet fraught with inefficiencies. Departments such as Procurement, Planning, Sales, Order Management, and Factory Systems often rely on one another to deliver data preformatted to specific requirements. However, sending teams, not directly vested in the receiving team’s objectives, lack incentive to prioritize data transformation, resulting in delays. When requirements evolve—such as needing additional data fields—iterative alignment and communication further impede progress. A robust solution for these internal workflows is to have sending teams share raw, untransformed data, with receiving teams owning the transformation process to align with their needs.</p><p>This receiver-driven model empowers departments to independently process schema-agnostic raw data using high-performance tools like in-memory data processing frameworks or orchestrated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. Receivers can efficiently parse, reformat, or enrich data to extract actionable insights, such as demand forecasts or inventory metrics, without awaiting sender-side adjustments. Lightweight serialization formats like Avro or Parquet optimize data exchange over internal networks, minimizing bandwidth usage and latency. By decoupling transformation from the sender, this approach eliminates dependency on misaligned priorities and iterative coordination, enabling faster, more autonomous decision-making.</p><p>This strategy is tailored for internal, inter-departmental data flows, not customer-facing systems like ticket booking applications, e-commerce checkout platforms, online banking forms, or customer support chatbots, where structured data is essential for seamless user interactions.

Large, “God components” are hard to test and maintain. Split big components into smaller, reusable ones.</p><p>✅ 2) <strong>Use Functional Components and Hooks</strong></p><p>Class components are outdated for most use cases. Embrace functional components with hooks for state, side effects, and more — they’re simpler and less verbose.</p><div><pre><code>function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n\n</code></pre></div><p>✅ 3) <strong>Destructure Props and State</strong></p><p>Avoid using props.someValue everywhere. Instead, destructure props and state for cleaner, more readable code:</p><div><pre><code>function Welcome({ name }) {\n  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Long, deeply nested JSX is hard to read. Break it up with helper functions or subcomponents.\n✅ Before: deeply nested JSX.<p>\n✅ After: break into smaller, clear components.</p></p><p>✅ 5) <strong>Use PropTypes or TypeScript</strong></p><p>Always validate your component props with PropTypes, or better yet, migrate to TypeScript for safer, self-documenting code.</p><p>✅ 6) </p><p>Use React Developer Tools in your browser to inspect component trees, props, and state — it will save you hours debugging tricky issues.</p><p>✅ 7) <strong>Memoize Expensive Operations</strong></p><p>Avoid unnecessary re-renders with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to optimize performance, especially for large lists or intensive calculations.</p><p>✅ 8) </p><p>When using useEffect, always clean up subscriptions, timers, or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.</p><div><pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {\n  const id = setInterval(() =&gt; console.log('Tick'), 1000);\n  return () =&gt; clearInterval(id); // cleanup!\n}, []);\n</code></pre></div><p>✅ 9) <strong>Keep State Local When Possible</strong></p><p>Don’t lift state unnecessarily. Local state reduces complexity and re-renders, making your components faster and easier to maintain.</p><p>✅ 10) </p><p>Always use clear, descriptive names for components, props, and hooks. Names like Button, handleClick, or isLoading make your code self-explanatory and easier for others to understand.</p><p>💡: small, focused components + hooks + meaningful naming = happy developers and maintainable apps! 🎉</p><p><em>Which best practice is your go-to?

That includes onboarding, support, and product guidance. If those things have improved, that’s additional value.</p><p><strong>Customers Say It’s “Cheap”</strong>\nThis one surprises people. If customers call your pricing “cheap,” it’s often a signal you’re undervalued, not affordable. “Affordable” means fair. “Cheap” means underpriced and possibly under-trusted.</p><p><strong>Your Early Pricing Was Temporary</strong>\nMost SaaS startups launch with “starter pricing.” But if you’re still charging like it’s day 1 and the product has moved ahead... It’s time to recalibrate.</p><p><strong>You’re Attracting the Wrong Customers</strong>\nLow pricing can pull in high-churn users. Updating your pricing strategy can improve retention and signal that your product is made for serious, committed users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Pricing Is a Product Decision, Not Just a Revenue One\n</h2><p>If your product has matured, your pricing needs to reflect that. Otherwise, you risk signaling that your value hasn't kept up. That can hurt trust, not just profit.</p><p>You don’t need to double your price. But you do need a strategy.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Raise Prices Without Pushing Users Away\n</h2><p>Here’s what works, especially in SaaS:</p><p><strong>Reward Existing Customers</strong>\nLet loyal users keep their current plan—either permanently or for a set time. It builds goodwill and reduces friction.</p><p>\nDon’t guess. Use product usage data and customer feedback to shape new tiers or price points.</p><p><strong>Change Tiers, Not Just Numbers</strong>\nInstead of a flat increase, consider adjusting the plan structure. Add features to higher tiers. Give people options.</p><p><strong>Frame the Change Around Value</strong>\nWhen announcing, focus on what’s improved. Make it about product maturity, not revenue needs.</p><p>Thread This Into Product-Led Growth</p><ul><li>Build features → Raise value → Raise prices → Reinvest → Repeat</li><li>The loop only works if your pricing reflects your product</li><li>Pricing is part of product-market fit</li></ul><p><strong>What’s your approach to pricing?

You need to quickly provision servers for a flash sale, scale your database during peak hours, and automatically roll back deployments if something goes wrong. Manually clicking through the DigitalOcean control panel for each of these tasks is slow, error-prone, and simply doesn't scale. This is where the DigitalOcean API comes in.</p><p>Today, businesses are increasingly adopting cloud-native architectures, embracing zero-trust security models, and managing hybrid identities. Automation is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity.  According to a recent Flexera 2023 State of the Cloud Report, 77% of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy, and automation is key to managing complexity across these environments. DigitalOcean powers over 800,000 developers and businesses, and a significant portion of their success relies on the power and flexibility of their API.  Companies like Algolia, a search-as-a-service provider, leverage APIs like DigitalOcean’s to automate infrastructure management, allowing them to focus on their core product.  This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to the DigitalOcean API, empowering you to automate your cloud infrastructure and unlock the full potential of DigitalOcean.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is the DigitalOcean API?\n</h2><p>At its core, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and specifications that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant: you (the application) tell the waiter (the API) what you want (a request), and the waiter brings you back the result from the kitchen (the server). </p><p>The DigitalOcean API allows you to interact with all DigitalOcean resources – Droplets, Spaces, Databases, Load Balancers, and more – programmatically.  Instead of using the DigitalOcean control panel, you can use code to create, manage, and delete resources. </p><ul><li> The DigitalOcean API is built on the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), meaning it uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources.</li><li> Data is exchanged in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight and human-readable format.</li><li>  You authenticate with the API using a Personal Access Token (PAT), ensuring secure access to your DigitalOcean resources.</li><li> Specific URLs that represent different resources or actions. For example,  is the endpoint for managing Droplets.</li><li>  To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, the API has rate limits.  Understanding these limits is crucial for building robust applications.</li></ul><p>Companies like Zapier and IFTTT heavily rely on APIs like DigitalOcean’s to connect different services and automate workflows.  A developer building a CI/CD pipeline might use the API to automatically provision new Droplets for testing and deployment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Use the DigitalOcean API?\n</h2><p>Before the widespread adoption of APIs, managing cloud infrastructure was a largely manual process.  This led to inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and increased operational costs.  Imagine needing to manually create 50 Droplets with specific configurations – a tedious and error-prone task.</p><p><strong>Common Challenges Before Using the API:</strong></p><ul><li> Slow and prone to human error.</li><li>  Difficult to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand.</li><li><strong>Inconsistent Configurations:</strong>  Maintaining consistent configurations across multiple servers is challenging.</li><li>  Difficult to automate complex workflows.</li></ul><p><strong>Industry-Specific Motivations:</strong></p><ul><li> Automate the creation and management of web servers.</li><li>  Dynamically scale game servers based on player activity.</li><li>  Provision and manage compute resources for data analysis and machine learning.</li><li>  Integrate infrastructure management into CI/CD pipelines.</li></ul><ol><li> A monitoring system detects high CPU usage on a Droplet. The API is used to automatically create a new Droplet and add it to a load balancer.</li><li>  In the event of a Droplet failure, the API is used to automatically create a replacement Droplet from a snapshot.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</strong>  Using tools like Terraform, the API is used to define and manage infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency and repeatability.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features and Capabilities\n</h2><p>The DigitalOcean API offers a wide range of features and capabilities. Here are ten key ones:</p><ol><li> Create, delete, resize, power on/off, and manage Droplets.\n\n</li><li> Create, manage, and share custom images.\n\n<ul><li>  Create a golden image with pre-installed software.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Image Creation -&gt; Image Available</li></ul></li><li> Create, attach, and manage block storage volumes.\n\n<ul><li>  Add persistent storage to a Droplet.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Volume Creation -&gt; Volume Attached</li></ul></li><li> Manage VPCs, firewalls, and floating IPs.\n\n<ul><li>  Securely connect Droplets within a private network.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Network Configuration -&gt; Network Active</li></ul></li><li><strong>Load Balancer Management:</strong> Create and manage load balancers to distribute traffic.\n\n<ul><li>  Improve the availability and scalability of a web application.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Load Balancer Creation -&gt; Load Balancer Active</li></ul></li><li> Create, manage, and scale managed databases.\n\n<ul><li>  Provision a database for a new application.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Database Creation -&gt; Database Ready</li></ul></li><li> Create and manage object storage spaces.\n\n<ul><li>  Store static assets for a website.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Space Creation -&gt; Space Available</li></ul></li><li> Monitor and manage Droplet actions (e.g., backups, upgrades).\n\n<ul><li>  Track the progress of a Droplet backup.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Action Initiation -&gt; Action Status Updates</li></ul></li><li> Add and manage SSH keys for secure access to Droplets.\n\n<ul><li>  Automate SSH key distribution to new Droplets.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; SSH Key Addition -&gt; Key Available</li></ul></li><li> Retrieve performance metrics for Droplets and other resources.\n\n<ul><li>  Monitor CPU usage and memory consumption.</li><li> API request -&gt; DigitalOcean API -&gt; Metric Retrieval -&gt; Metric Data Returned</li></ul></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Detailed Practical Use Cases\n</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Automated Web Application Deployment (Web Hosting):</strong></p><ul><li> Manually deploying a web application is time-consuming and error-prone.</li><li> Use the API to automatically provision a Droplet, install the necessary software (e.g., Nginx, PHP), and deploy the application code.</li><li> Faster and more reliable deployments, reduced operational costs.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Game Server Scaling (Game Development):</strong></p><ul><li> Game servers need to scale dynamically based on player demand.</li><li> Use the API to automatically create and destroy Droplets based on player count.</li><li> Improved game performance and player experience.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Automated Backup and Disaster Recovery (Data Security):</strong></p><ul><li> Protecting data from loss or corruption.</li><li> Use the API to schedule regular backups of Droplets and databases.

If the dosage is confusing, the pharmacist may need to call the clinic.</p><p>Keeping up with handwritten notes, stock issues, and customer lines becomes exhausting. </p><p>The delays and errors could even affect health.</p><p>In short, the system is outdated. It slows things down, and it leaves too much room for mistakes. And in today’s fast-paced, tech-enabled world, that simply doesn’t work anymore.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  People expect better, and they should\n</h2><p>We’ve come to expect convenience in our everyday lives. If we can order a coffee with one tap, why should our prescriptions be stuck in the past?</p><p> want faster service, fewer errors, and better access to their medicines. They want updates, reminders, and the ability to store and access their prescriptions anytime. </p><p>No more slips of paper. No more pharmacy hopping.</p><p> want more clarity and less stress. They want prescriptions that are legible, tracked, and easier to manage. They want better insights into stock and real-time orders.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So, what is a digital prescription?\n</h2><p>A digital prescription, also known as an e-prescription, is simply a prescription created, shared, and stored electronically.</p><p>Let’s understand its workflow step-by-step:</p><p> Instead of physically visiting a pharmacy with the paper slip, the patients or their relatives can upload the prescription details in the app. </p><p> That prescription is sent directly to the pharmacy. </p><p> The pharmacist receives it, prepares the order.</p><p> The patient or their relative can collect it or get it delivered.</p><p>It removes the need for handwriting, scanning, faxing, or even phone calls. Everything is clear, secure, and fast.</p><ul><li>For the patient, it means fewer steps. </li><li>For the pharmacist, it means fewer errors. </li><li>For the doctor, it means better records. Everyone wins.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  From pain to promise: The real benefits of On-demand medicine ordering solution\n</h2><p>Let’s break it down with everyday situations. </p><p> A mother managing multiple prescriptions for her child.  An elderly person living alone, trying to remember the medicine names.  A busy working adult rushing to pick up medicines before closing time.</p><p>In all these cases, digital prescriptions make life easier.</p><p>Patients no longer have to carry papers or rely on memory. Their prescription is safe, stored, and always available on their phone. No guesswork, no delay.</p><p>Pharmacists don’t need to interpret messy handwriting or call doctors to confirm instructions. The digital system shows exactly what’s needed. Medicines are ready faster. That means happier customers and better service.</p><p>Doctors, on the other hand, can track patient history, spot refill gaps, and adjust medications quickly. Their job becomes more efficient and focused.</p><p>And in emergencies, speed matters. A digital prescription can be shared in seconds, something that paper cannot do.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example: To understand why the medicine ordering solution is a lifesaver\n</h2><p><strong>Example 1 (customer POV):</strong> Take Megan, for example. She’s a young mother juggling work and a toddler with asthma. Her child’s prescription needs refilling every month. Before, she had to visit the clinic and wait in line to get the medicine. </p><p>Now, she directly sends it to the pharmacy, and it’s delivered to her home. No stress, no delay.</p><p><strong>Example 2 (pharmacist POV):</strong> Think of Paul, a pharmacist who used to spend hours sorting through illegible prescriptions. With digital ones, he now serves more customers with better accuracy and fewer returns due to wrong medications.</p><p>These aren’t just small wins; they add up to big changes.</p><p>Of course, like with any tech, some people worry. Is it safe? The simple answer is yes. </p><p>Digital prescriptions are encrypted and follow strict healthcare standards. In many regions, they’re even more secure than paper because they can’t be tampered with.</p><p><strong>Will older patients struggle?</strong> Not if it’s done right.  Good systems are designed to be simple. Most patients just get a message or PDF, no tech skills needed.</p><p><strong>Is it only for big hospitals?</strong> Not at all. Small clinics, local pharmacies, and even solo practitioners can use easy, affordable digital tools.</p><p>The goal is not to make things complicated. It’s to make them smarter and smoother for everyone involved.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Where the era of digitalization in healthcare industry headed\n</h2><p>This is just the beginning. Digital prescriptions are opening the door to more connected healthcare. </p><p>Soon, you could have your prescriptions, reports, and appointments all in one app. Medicines could be delivered automatically when it's time to refill. </p><p>Pharmacies could restock based on real-time demand. Pharmacists could get alerts about interactions between different medications. And patients could get reminders so they never miss a dose.</p><p>This isn’t some far-off dream. It’s already happening in parts of the world and spreading fast.</p><p>You don’t need to make a giant leap overnight. Just take small steps. As a pharmacist, explore the best medicine ordering and delivery software that reduces your manual workload and offers your customers the ease of getting medicine online.</p><p>Start with one change and feel the difference. Because the future of prescriptions is not about paper. It’s about people. And making their lives easier, safer, and better.</p><p>From queue to click, the journey has begun.

Their slim design, snappy feel, and space-saving form factor have carved out a niche among gamers, coders, and digital nomads alike.</p><p>But here’s the catch: <em>not all keycaps fit all switches</em>, especially when you enter the low-profile domain.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll demystify the compatibility puzzle and help you confidently pair the <strong>right low profile keycaps</strong> with —without sacrificing performance, aesthetics, or typing experience.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Low Profile Matters (And Who Should Care)\n</h2><p>Low profile mechanical keyboards have exploded in popularity for good reason:</p><ul><li>: Reduced key height lowers wrist strain, especially during extended typing sessions.</li><li>: Ideal for travel setups and minimal desk aesthetics.</li><li>: Shorter actuation distance means faster key response—vital for gaming and real-time applications.</li></ul><p>Whether you're building a productivity-focused board for work or a lightning-fast setup for gaming, low profile switches offer a compelling balance between performance and design.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Core Challenge: Compatibility\n</h2><p>Let’s get straight to it—<strong>the majority of low profile switches are not MX-compatible</strong>, which means you can’t just grab any Cherry MX keycap and expect it to work.</p><p>Here’s what makes things tricky:</p><ul><li>: Cherry MX-style stems are cross-shaped. Low profile switches may use flatter, shorter, or completely different stems (e.g., Kailh Choc vs Gateron LP).</li><li>: Traditional profiles like SA, DSA, or OEM are too tall and won’t work ergonomically or physically.</li><li>: Plate vs PCB mount matters more when the switch dimensions vary widely.</li></ul><p>So what can you pair safely—and stylishly?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Popular Low Profile Switches and Their Keycap Pairings\n</h2><p>Here’s a breakdown of the most common low profile switches and what keycaps are compatible with them:</p><ul><li>: Flat, rectangular (non-MX)</li><li>: Only  work. These are typically produced by manufacturers like MBK, XDA-Profile Choc, and custom makers on platforms like P3D or KPrepublic.</li><li>: Ultra-slim DIY builds, ortho layouts (like the Planck or Corne), low-profile wireless keyboards.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 <strong>Gateron Low Profile (LP) Switches</strong></h3><ul><li>: MX-style cross-stem (✓)</li><li>: Supports <strong>low profile MX-compatible keycaps</strong> (like the ones from Keychron or Akko). Traditional MX caps  but look awkward and feel unbalanced.</li><li>: Compact gaming keyboards (Keychron K series, Logitech G915), general-purpose low-profile boards.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 <strong>Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile (ULP)</strong></h3><ul><li>: Proprietary (flat hinge)</li><li>: <em>Only compatible with Cherry ULP keycaps</em>—typically used in high-end laptops or ultra-slim boards like Corsair K100 Air.</li><li>: Industrial designs, embedded keyboards, ultra-thin wireless layouts.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔹 <strong>Outemu LP / TTC LP Switches</strong></h3><ul><li>: Varies—often MX-compatible</li><li>: Stick with <strong>manufacturer-approved keycaps</strong>; don’t mix and match unless you confirm fit.</li><li>: Some clones are not 1:1 with Cherry specs and may cause wobble.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What to Look for in Low Profile Keycaps\n</h2><p>Keycaps are more than just decorative covers—they influence sound, feel, and accuracy.</p><p>When shopping for low profile caps, consider:</p><ul><li>: PBT resists shine and wears better than ABS. Choose double-shot or dye-sub for legends that last.</li><li>: MBK, XDA Choc, and ChocCaps are ergonomically sculpted for low travel. Avoid taller profiles like SA or MT3.</li><li>: If backlighting matters, go with shine-through caps. Otherwise, clean blank caps give a sleek minimalist look.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Pro Tip: Avoid Mix-and-Match Mistakes\n</h2><p>One of the most common pitfalls is buying a beautiful set of low profile keycaps only to find they don’t fit your switch stems. Always double-check:</p><ul><li>Stem type: MX-compatible or not?</li><li>Cap height: Will the profile clash with your keyboard’s intended design?</li><li>Layout fit: 60% keyboards, split boards, and ortholinear layouts all have specific sizing needs.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  For Tinkerers: 3 Great Builds to Try\n</h2><p>If you're building from scratch or looking to mod an existing board, here are some battle-tested combinations:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>Keychron K7 + Gateron LP Red + Keychron LP ABS Caps</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Great for beginners wanting a slim typing experience with hot-swappable convenience.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. <strong>KBDfans KBD67LP + Gateron LP Brown + PBT LP Keycaps</strong></h3><blockquote><p>A premium, quiet build for developers who care about sound and feel.</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. <strong>Corne LP + Kailh Choc V2 + MBK Legend Keycaps</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Ultimate ergonomic split setup for hardcore coders or typists.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts: Is It Worth the Extra Research?\n</h2><p>Absolutely. Matching the right <strong>low profile keycaps with compatible switches</strong> elevates your typing experience from just “okay” to “exceptional.” It’s not just about aesthetics—it’s about <strong>precision fit, feel, and function</strong>.</p><p>By understanding switch stem types, keycap profiles, and layout-specific needs, you save yourself the frustration (and return shipping) of poor pairings.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Resources &amp; Further Reading\n</h2><h2>\n  \n  \n  Want Help With Your Build?\n</h2><p>I’ve been building and modding keyboards for 6+ years—if you have a question, drop a comment below or connect with me on Mastodon @keebnerd.

But to make them work well, it’s not just about making smarter agents — it’s about getting them to share a common understanding of the world. That’s where the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> comes in: an emerging standard that acts as a universal connector, enabling agents to access tools and data in a consistent, scalable way.</p><p>When I started building with MCP for a work project, I hit a wall. Most tutorials focus on local MCP servers communicating over STDIN/STDOUT, which is great for prototyping. But I needed a , something robust and production-ready that could run on Kubernetes. Unfortunately, good resources were scarce.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Beyond APIs: Why MCP Matters in an Agentic World\n</h2><p>For decades, APIs have been the standard way systems talk to each other. Developers read docs, authenticate, and write custom code to integrate services. But that doesn’t scale when agents need to autonomously interact with dozens or hundreds of tools.</p><p>MCP offers a . It provides a standardized protocol—a common language—that lets tools present themselves to agents in a predictable way. Instead of agents learning how every API works, . This makes the integration layer simpler, smarter, and scalable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Code &amp; Deployment Blueprint\n</h2><p>Here’s a high-level overview of what goes into building and deploying a remote MCP server:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

Binding to  is Non-Negotiable\n</h3><p>Inside Docker or Kubernetes, binding to localhost means only the container can talk to itself. External traffic (even from other pods) won't reach it. Always bind your app to  to make it network-accessible.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Streamable HTTP is Not Plug-and-Play\n</h3><p>MCP relies on long-lived JSON-RPC-over-HTTP connections. Many HTTP servers and proxies aren't tuned for this. The Nginx Ingress Controller in particular <strong>buffers responses by default</strong>, breaking stream behavior. You have to explicitly disable buffering and increase timeouts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Debugging Ingress is Half the Battle\n</h3><p>Expect to spend a fair amount of time tweaking your Ingress config. Tools like  and  are invaluable here.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. FastMCP Just Works (Mostly)\n</h3><p>Despite the learning curve, FastMCP does a lot of heavy lifting for you.

It’s about creating a seamless workflow where issues are tracked efficiently, pull requests (PRs) are reviewed collaboratively, and the community feels empowered to contribute. If you want your project to thrive, you need to master these three key pillars: issues, PRs, and people.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Role of Issues in a Healthy Project</strong>\nIssues are the pulse of your project. They highlight what’s broken, what’s needed, and where improvements can happen. When managed well, they become a living roadmap that invites collaboration from both core contributors and newcomers.</p><p>To make issues work for you, it helps to provide structure. Templates ensure that bug reports and feature requests are submitted with the right details. Labels allow you to quickly sort and prioritize, whether you're identifying a critical fix or suggesting a feature for later. Milestones give contributors a sense of where the project is headed, while a simple encouragement to search existing issues before posting can reduce duplication and clutter.</p><p>But more than tools, it's the tone that counts. Responding with empathy, even when closing a suggestion, builds a welcoming space where people feel heard, not shut out.</p><p><strong>Pull Requests: Where Collaboration Meets Code</strong>\nPull requests are where ideas take shape and real development happens. A well-managed PR not only results in cleaner code but also brings your team closer together. Start by setting expectations with a PR template so contributors know what details to include, what the change does, why it matters, and any relevant screenshots or test results.</p><p>Automating checks with CI/CD tools helps catch issues early, but the real value comes from human review. This is where team culture shows. Reviews should be constructive and kind focused on clarity and shared learning, not criticism.</p><p>Keeping PRs small and focused also goes a long way. Large, monolithic changes are harder to review and more likely to break things. Encourage contributors to break work into manageable chunks that can be reviewed quickly and merged cleanly.</p><p>For teams managing multiple contributors, especially in active repositories, formalizing collaboration is essential. Structured learning like this <a href=\"https://www.edstellar.com/course/github-training\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Training Course</a> can help streamline workflows and build consistent review practices across your team.</p><p><strong>Cultivating a Community Around Your Code</strong>\nA successful GitHub project isn’t just functional, it’s alive. The README file sets the tone, explaining not just what your project does but why it matters. It should be written for people, not just machines. Follow this up with a CONTRIBUTING.md file to help new contributors understand how they can participate, and a Code of Conduct to ensure respectful interaction.</p><p>Beyond documentation, you also need conversation. GitHub Discussions or even issue threads can be powerful tools for open dialogue, feature brainstorming, or onboarding help. And don’t forget to celebrate your contributors, mention them in release notes, highlight their work in discussions, or simply thank them in comments. Recognition turns one-time contributors into long-term collaborators.</p><p>**Avoiding Common Mistakes That Hurt Projects\n**Despite the best intentions, many projects struggle due to poor communication or inconsistent maintenance. One of the biggest mistakes is going silent, leaving issues and PRs unanswered for too long. Contributors lose interest quickly when they feel ignored.</p><p>On the flip side, over-engineering the contribution process with too many rules can make your project feel inaccessible. The key is to strike a balance between structure and flexibility. Avoid hiding important decisions in private chats transparency builds trust.</p><p>And finally, remember to care for yourself as a maintainer. Burnout is real. Set boundaries, pace your involvement, and consider rotating responsibilities if your project grows large enough.</p><p>\nGitHub provides excellent tools to keep your project moving without chaos. GitHub Projects allows you to organize tasks visually, giving everyone clarity on what's being worked on and what's next. GitHub Actions can handle repetitive tasks like running tests or deploying code, freeing up your time for more meaningful collaboration.</p><p>Even small tools like saved replies, scheduled reviews, and linking PRs to issues can have a major impact when used consistently. The goal isn’t to do everything perfectly, but to build habits that support long-term momentum.</p><p>\nMastering issues, PRs, and community dynamics isn’t a one-time task, it’s an ongoing practice. But when done right, the rewards are huge: smoother workflows, higher-quality code, and a community that grows with your project, not apart from it.</p><p>Whether you're managing your first repository or scaling an active open-source ecosystem, investing in how you communicate and collaborate makes all the difference.</p>","contentLength":4971,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Advancements in Computational Linguistics: Exploring Themes and Innovations from Recent Research","url":"https://dev.to/khanali21/advancements-in-computational-linguistics-exploring-themes-and-innovations-from-recent-research-4akd","date":1751351845,"author":"Ali Khan","guid":178716,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This article is part of AI Frontiers, a series exploring groundbreaking computer science and artificial intelligence research from arXiv. We summarize key papers, demystify complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlight innovations shaping our technological future. The focus here is on sixteen research papers published between June 20 and June 30, 2025, which delve into the rapidly evolving field of computational linguistics. These studies collectively illuminate how machines interpret human language, address real-world challenges, and push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. The field of computational linguistics occupies a pivotal role at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. It seeks to enable machines to process, understand, and generate human language in ways that are both meaningful and contextually appropriate. This endeavor goes beyond simple word recognition, encompassing the subtleties of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. By teaching machines to decode not just explicit statements but also implicit meanings, computational linguistics facilitates advancements in applications such as automated translation, sentiment analysis, and conversational agents. Its significance lies in its potential to transform industries, from healthcare to education, by providing tools that enhance decision-making and communication. Among the major themes explored in the reviewed papers, fact-checking and information verification emerge as critical areas of interest. Researchers have developed systems aimed at discerning the veracity of claims across domains like medicine and finance. For instance, Joseph et al. (2025) introduced a framework for medical fact-checking that emphasizes the importance of interpretative reasoning over binary classifications. Another prominent theme is model safety, where efforts are directed toward mitigating biases and ensuring ethical behavior in large language models. Studies by Liu et al. (2025) revealed hidden demographic biases in how these models handle violent content, underscoring the need for rigorous testing and refinement. A third theme centers on multimodal processing, which integrates text, images, and other data types to create more holistic AI systems. Chen et al. (2025) demonstrated a prototype capable of analyzing medical imagery alongside textual records, offering insights that neither modality could provide independently. Methodological approaches vary widely across the papers, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of computational linguistics. Many studies employ deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based architectures, to process vast datasets efficiently. Others adopt hybrid methodologies, combining rule-based systems with neural networks to balance precision and flexibility. Experimental designs often involve controlled simulations or real-world case studies, allowing researchers to evaluate performance under diverse conditions. For example, Zhang et al. (2025) conducted experiments using fabricated social media posts to test the robustness of fact-checking algorithms against nuanced misinformation. Key findings from these works reveal both progress and persistent challenges. One notable discovery is the ideation-execution gap identified by Kumar et al. (2025), highlighting the disparity between theoretically promising AI-generated ideas and their practical implementation. Another significant finding comes from Wang et al. (2025), who demonstrated that collaborative human-machine systems outperform purely automated solutions in tasks requiring interpretive judgment. Comparisons across studies suggest that while technical capabilities continue to improve, contextual understanding remains a formidable hurdle. Influential works cited throughout this synthesis include Joseph et al. (2025), whose exploration of medical fact-checking provides a blueprint for future verification systems; Liu et al. (2025), whose analysis of bias in language models underscores the ethical dimensions of AI development; and Chen et al. (2025), whose multimodal framework exemplifies integrative approaches to complex problem-solving. Each of these contributions advances the field by addressing specific limitations and proposing innovative solutions. A critical assessment of recent progress reveals a field marked by rapid innovation yet constrained by certain fundamental challenges. While computational linguistics has made strides in automating routine tasks and enhancing user interactions, gaps remain in achieving true comprehension of human language. Future directions may involve refining interpretive algorithms, expanding training datasets to encompass broader linguistic diversity, and developing frameworks for continuous learning. Additionally, fostering collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and policymakers will be essential to ensure that advancements align with societal needs and ethical standards.

We summarize key papers, demystify complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlight innovations shaping our technological future. The research discussed spans June 25, 2025, showcasing cutting-edge developments in machine learning (cs.LG), with a focus on efficiency, robustness, fairness, and foundational upgrades. These advancements collectively push the boundaries of AI capabilities while addressing critical challenges in privacy, computational cost, and ethical considerations.  <strong>Field Definition and Significance</strong>  Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, involves the development of algorithms that enable systems to learn patterns from data autonomously. Unlike traditional programming, where rules are explicitly coded, machine learning models infer relationships through training on large datasets. The significance of recent advancements lies in their potential to make AI systems more efficient, secure, and equitable. For instance, innovations in GPU optimization and federated learning directly impact scalability and privacy, while fairness-aware algorithms address biases in recommender systems (Author et al., 2025).  <strong>Major Themes and Paper Examples</strong>  Three dominant themes emerge from the analyzed research: efficiency, robustness, and fairness. First, efficiency improvements are exemplified by <em>PLoP: Precise LoRA Placement</em>, which automates the placement of adapter modules in transformer models, significantly reducing computational overhead (Author et al., 2025). Second, robustness is highlighted in , a method for detecting gradient leaks in federated learning, thereby enhancing security against malicious actors. Third, fairness is addressed in <em>Producer-Fairness in Sequential Bundle Recommendation</em>, which ensures equitable exposure for lesser-known content creators in recommender systems.  <strong>Methodological Approaches</strong>  The methodologies employed across these studies vary but share a common emphasis on optimization and generalization. For instance, <em>RWFT (Reweighted Fine-Tuning)</em> introduces a novel approach to machine unlearning by reweighting output distributions rather than retraining models from scratch (Author et al., 2025). Similarly,  leverages evolutionary algorithms to auto-tune GPU code, eliminating the need for manual optimization. These approaches demonstrate a shift toward automation and scalability in AI development.  <strong>Key Findings and Comparisons</strong>  Among the most notable findings is the 50x speedup achieved by  in class unlearning tasks, alongside a 111% improvement in privacy preservation compared to prior methods (Author et al., 2025). Another breakthrough, , reduces federated learning time by 40% through encrypted hint-sharing among edge devices. When compared to traditional federated learning frameworks,  demonstrates superior efficiency without compromising data privacy. Additionally,  merges physics-based modeling with AI to accelerate simulations of 3D-printed metal heat flow by a factor of 10, showcasing the potential of hybrid methodologies.    Several papers stand out for their transformative contributions. <em>Omniwise: Predicting GPU Kernels Performance with LLMs</em> introduces a large language model capable of predicting GPU performance metrics with 90% accuracy (Author et al., 2025).  revises attention mechanisms for medical time-series data, achieving clinical-grade reliability in seizure detection. Lastly, <em>Leaner Training, Lower Leakage</em> demonstrates that fine-tuning with LoRA reduces data memorization by 30%, addressing critical privacy concerns in generative AI.  <strong>Critical Assessment and Future Directions</strong>  While these advancements mark significant progress, challenges remain. For instance, the scalability of machine unlearning techniques to larger models requires further validation. Future research should explore the integration of causal inference methods, as proposed in <em>Stochastic Parameter Decomposition</em>, to enhance model interpretability. Additionally, multimodal approaches like  for Earth observation highlight the growing importance of cross-domain AI applications. The trajectory of AI research points toward systems that are not only more capable but also more ethical and sustainable.    Author et al. (2025).

Không có gì khác! Khi bạn gán biến mới bằng một biến khác, nó chỉ lấy giá trị của biến mà bạn muốn gán, biến gốc này sẽ không có thay đổi hay ảnh hưởng gì khi bạn tác động lên biến mới.</p><p><strong>Kiểu tham chiếu: object, array, function</strong>\nObject, array, function là 3 kiểu tham chiếu trong Javascript, tức là, khi bạn khởi tạo 1 Object, V8 tạo ra một tham chiếu đến một vùng nhớ trên HEAP (vật lý là từ RAM) để lưu trữ giá trị. Mọi hành động của bạn tương tác với biến mà bạn lưu cái Object này là bạn tương tác với tham chiếu.</p><div><pre><code>let user_01 = {\n    name: 'me',\n    age: 23\n}\n\nlet user_02 = user_01\n\nuser_02.name='18 again'\nuser_01.age= 18\n\nconsole.log(user_01)\nconsole.log(user_02)\n</code></pre></div><p>Đoán xem chuyện quái gì sẽ xảy ra?\nCả 2 đều là <em>{name: '18 again', age: 18}</em>!\nĐúng rồi, vì chúng ta tạo 2 biến, nhưng gán biến 02 bằng biến 01, tức là tham chiếu biến 02 này đến vùng nhớ chứa giá trị của 01. Khi thay đổi 01 thì 02 sẽ thay đổi theo và ngược lại. Đó là lý do tại sao người ta gọi là tham chiếu.</p><p>\nScope hiểu đơn giản là \"vòng đời của một biến từ khi sinh ra đến khi biến mất\".<p>\nCó 3 loại Scope: Block, Function, Global</p>\nBlock thì có thể hiểu đơn giản là trong cặp ngoặc gần nhất mà biến được khai báo.</p><p>Funtion thì đơn giản là trong hàm.</p><p>Global tức là biến toàn cục, bạn định nghĩa ở đâu kệ bạn, đều dùng được ở tất cả mọi nơi.</p><p>OK, bây giờ bạn đã nắm được các kiến thức cần thiết. Chúng ta đi vào phần chính.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Sự khac biệt giữa let và var\n</h2><p><strong>let là block scope, var là function scope</strong></p><div><pre><code>function Test(){\n    if(1==1){\n        var v =100\n        let l = 200\n    }\n\n    console.log(v) //100\n    console.log(l) // not defined\n}\n\nTest()\n</code></pre></div><p>\nCả let và var đều được hoisting (kéo lên đầu khi chạy) nhưng sau đó thì lại khác nhau, biến khai báo bằng var được khai báo nhưng chưa gán giá trị, lúc này nó sẽ là undefined, còn let thì bạn không dùng được luôn.</p><div><pre><code>console.log(a)\nvar a = 10 //undefine\n\nconsole.log(b)\nlet b = 11 // b is not defined\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Khi khai báo biến toàn cục, var sẽ gán nó thành thuộc tính của trình duyệt (window) luôn, còn let thì không.</strong></p><div><pre><code>var a = 10\nconsole.log(window.a) //10\n\nlet b = 12\nconsole.log(window.b) // undefined\n</code></pre></div><p>Xét đoạn code này, kết quả sẽ là 3, 3, 3</p><div><pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000);\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Còn nếu thay thế var bằng let, kết quản lại là 0, 1, 2.</p><p>Tại sao lại vậy, vì mỗi vòng lặp với let, như đã nói ở trên, là block scope, nên EMCA sẽ tạo ra một block cho mỗi vòng lặp, ở đó sẽ định nghĩa một biến tạm lưu giá trị của i hiện tại:</p><div><pre><code>{\n  let i = 0;\n  {\n    const iCopy = i;\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(iCopy), 1000);\n  }\n  i++;\n\n  {\n    const iCopy = i;\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(iCopy), 1000);\n  }\n  i++;\n\n  {\n    const iCopy = i;\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(iCopy), 1000);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>còn với var, mọi thứ đơn giản hơn:</p><div><pre><code>var i = 0;\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000); // nhớ i (tham chiếu, không phải giá trị)\ni++;\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000); // vẫn nhớ biến i\ni++;\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; console.log(i), 1000); // tiếp tục nhớ biến i\ni++; // i = 3\n</code></pre></div><p>Vì vòng lặp chạy xong rất nhanh, chỉ vài microsecond đã đếm i đến 3, mà đợi xong một giây (1000ms) mới log ra i (3 lần) nên kết quản sẽ đều là 3.</p><p>Nói về const, nó không khác gì let ngoại trừ việc bạn không thể thay đổi nó, tuy nhiên vẫn có thể thay đổi thuộc tính của đối tượng được khai báo với const. </p><p>Hết.

How DevOps Improves Developer Experience\n</h2><p>\nWith Continuous Integration (CI), developers get rapid feedback on their code. This reduces wait time and rework.</p><p>\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) and containerization let developers spin up environments on-demand, test code, and deploy without waiting on ops.</p><p><strong>Less Blame, More Collaboration</strong>\nDevOps encourages shared ownership of production systems. Developers become part of incident resolution—not scapegoats for failures.</p><p><strong>Automation of Repetitive Tasks</strong>\nCI/CD pipelines eliminate manual deployments, flaky scripts, and human error. Less repetition = more innovation.</p><p><strong>Visibility and Observability</strong>\nLogging, monitoring, and alerting tools like Prometheus and Grafana give developers insight into how their code behaves in production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. DevOps and Delivery Speed: A Perfect Match\n</h2><p>DevOps doesn't just make developers happier—it makes them faster. Here's how:</p><ul><li>Smaller, more frequent releases reduce risk and make shipping feel safe</li><li>Rollback mechanisms and canary deployments allow for safer experimentation</li><li>Pipeline automation accelerates the entire software delivery lifecycle</li><li>Collaboration between dev and ops leads to faster problem-solving and decision-making</li></ul><p>With the right practices in place, some companies push code to production hundreds of times a day.</p><ul><li>83% of developers say DevOps improves their job satisfaction (Puppet State of DevOps Report)Source: <a href=\"https://www.perforce.com/press-releases/puppets-2024-state-devops-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puppet State</a></li><li>High-performing DevOps teams deploy 973x more frequently (DORA 2023)Source: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/announcing-dora-2021-accelerate-state-of-devops-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DevOps Teams</a></li></ul><p>Let’s say you're a developer on a team without DevOps:\nYou write your code, submit a pull request, wait two days for a         code review, another day for QA, and then someone from operations manually deploys it next week.<p>\nNow imagine the DevOps version:</p>\nYou push code to a Git repo → automated tests run → your code merges and deploys automatically to staging → canary tests pass → it rolls out to production in minutes. You get a Slack alert that your deployment succeeded.<p>\nWhich scenario do you think makes a developer feel more in control, productive, and satisfied</p></p><p><strong>Q: Isn’t DevOps just for big companies?</strong>\n A: Not at all. Startups benefit even more because DevOps helps them move faster with leaner teams.</p><p><strong>Q: Does DevOps mean developers have to do ops work?</strong>\n A: Not entirely. It means shared responsibility—developers understand and contribute to operations, but they’re not on call 24/7.</p><p><strong>Q: What if my team doesn't have automation yet?</strong>\n A: You can start small—CI tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI make it easy to begin automating builds and tests.</p><ul><li>DevOps improves developer experience through autonomy, collaboration, and automation</li><li>Happier developers ship better code, faster</li><li>DevOps enables safer, smaller, and more frequent deployments</li><li>It’s not just a toolset—it’s a culture shift that drives productivity and well-being</li></ul><p>DevOps is more than just a methodology—it's a mindset. One that values speed, safety, transparency, and most importantly: developer happiness.\nBy reducing bottlenecks, automating the boring stuff, and fostering real collaboration, DevOps transforms software development into a more joyful, sustainable, and high-performing process.<p>\nWhen developers are happy, software ships faster. And when software ships faster, developers are even happier. It’s a win-win loop—and DevOps is the engine behind it.</p></p><p>About the Author: <em>Nilesh is a Lead DevOps Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.addwebsolution.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AddWebSolution</a>, specializing in automation, CI/CD, and cloud scalability.

This isn't coming from an ego-driven perspective—it's based on real-world experience with teams struggling with build times exceeding an hour for simple React applications.</p><p>I've witnessed firsthand the consequences of poor monorepo implementations: teams of 20+ engineers waiting over an hour for builds on every push to the dev branch. The culprit? A React project with compressed Ant Design components being unzipped in the CI/CD pipeline, taking forever to compile. The solution was straightforward—use Ant Design's built-in theming or create a private npm package—but organizational resistance led to copy-pasting entire folders into source code just to reduce build times from 60+ minutes to 5 minutes.</p><p>This guide will teach you how to build monorepos the right way using Turborepo, taking you from complete beginner to proficient practitioner.</p><p>Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases designed specifically for monorepos. It solves the fundamental scaling problem that monorepos face: as your repository grows, build times become prohibitively slow.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Monorepo Scaling Problem\n</h3><p>Monorepos offer many advantages—shared code, consistent tooling, atomic commits across projects—but they struggle to scale efficiently. Each workspace has its own:</p><ul></ul><p>A single monorepo might need to execute thousands of tasks. Without proper tooling, this creates dramatic slowdowns that affect how teams build and ship software.</p><p><strong>Turborepo solves this through intelligent caching and task orchestration.</strong> Its Remote Cache stores the results of all tasks, meaning your CI never needs to do the same work twice.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Prerequisites and Platform Notes\n</h2><p> Turborepo works best on Unix-like systems. If you're on Windows 11, consider using WSL 2.0 as you may encounter platform-specific issues.

Imagine eliminating the headache of disconnected systems and manual data entry. This isn’t a far-off dream. It’s the power of integrating your IT inventory tracking software with your core business systems.</p><p>By syncing your inventory data with ERP, procurement, and finance, you unlock a smoother, more efficient workflow. No more delays. No more confusion. Just instant, accurate information that fuels smarter decisions and saves you time and money.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll show you why integrating your IT inventory software is a game-changer—and how it can help your business run like a well-oiled machine.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Understanding Your Current Systems and Requirements\n</h2><p>Before you dive into integrating your IT inventory tracking software, it's important to first take a good look at what you're working with. You might have different systems in place for inventory, procurement, and finance, but are they playing nicely together? Identifying the gaps now will save you headaches down the road.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Check How Well Your Systems Sync\n</h3><p>Start by seeing if your systems are talking to each other. Does your inventory data update automatically in your ERP or finance system, or are you still manually entering things? If your systems aren’t in sync, it’s time to figure out where the disconnect is. This will help you identify what needs to be fixed during integration.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Pinpoint What Data Really Matters\n</h3><p>Every department has its own priorities. Procurement might need real-time asset data to make fast decisions, while finance will care more about depreciation and value tracking. Understanding these needs will help you focus on the data that actually needs to flow between systems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Set Your Integration Goals\n</h3><p>Now that you know where things are going wrong, it’s time to think about what you want to achieve. Whether it’s cutting down on errors, speeding up reporting, or automating manual tasks, having clear goals will guide the whole integration process.</p><p>Getting a good grip on your existing systems and their requirements will set you up for a smoother, more effective integration, making everything work together seamlessly in the end.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Choosing the Right Integration Method\n</h2><p>Once you’ve got a clear understanding of your systems, it’s time to figure out how to connect them. The right integration method will depend on your specific needs, but don’t worry—it’s not as complicated as it might seem. Here’s how to make the right choice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  APIs: The Simple, Powerful Option\n</h3><p>Most modern IT inventory tracking software, ERP, and financial systems offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Think of APIs as bridges that allow systems to talk to each other and share data in real-time. If your software offers API support, this is usually the most efficient way to integrate. It’s fast, efficient, and reduces the risk of manual errors. If you’re looking for something quick and scalable, APIs are a great choice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Middleware: For the Complex Setups\n</h3><p>If your systems are a bit older or don’t support APIs, middleware could be your solution. Middleware is a software layer that sits between your systems, helping them communicate even if they weren’t built to work together. It’s a solid choice for more complex or legacy setups, though it might take a little extra time to set up. Still, it gets the job done.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cloud vs. On-Premise: Which Is Best for You?\n</h3><p>When it comes to integration, you’ll also need to decide whether to go with a cloud-based or on-premise solution. <a href=\"https://assetloom.com/blog/cloud-based-it-asset-management-software?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=it-inventory-tracking-software\">Cloud-based systems</a> are flexible and easy to scale, which makes them great for businesses that are growing or need to access their systems remotely. <a href=\"https://assetloom.com/blog/connect-on-premise-services-to-itam-software?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=it-inventory-tracking-software\">On-premise systems</a>, on the other hand, offer more control and security, though they can be a bit trickier to scale.</p><p>The key here is to match the method to your business needs. API is usually the most straightforward, but if you’re dealing with older systems or specific security concerns, middleware or on-premise might be a better fit.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Data Mapping and Synchronization\n</h2><p>With your integration method chosen, the next step is ensuring that your data flows smoothly between systems. This is where data mapping and synchronization come into play.</p><p>You need to make sure that the data from your IT inventory system matches the fields in your ERP, procurement, and finance systems. For example, the asset ID in your inventory system must align with the purchase order ID in your ERP. This mapping ensures that no data gets lost or mixed up.</p><p>Decide how often you want your systems to sync. Real-time syncing is ideal for fast-moving operations, like inventory updates or procurement, but it might be overkill for things like financial reporting, which could be done on a daily or weekly schedule.</p><p>Before going live, run tests to ensure that everything is syncing correctly. You’ll want to catch any issues before your systems are fully integrated. Do a dry run with sample data and check for errors—better to address them now than later.</p><p><a href=\"https://assetloom.com/blog/it-inventory-tracking?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=it-inventory-tracking-software\">IT inventory tracking strategies</a> are key here, as they help you establish clear rules for how data should flow between systems. This ensures everything stays aligned and running smoothly, making your processes more efficient.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Overcoming Integration Challenges\n</h2><p>Even the best integration plans face challenges, but with the right approach, these hurdles can be cleared quickly.</p><p>Different systems may use different data formats or communication protocols, which can create roadblocks. If you’re working with older systems, check compatibility early on. Make sure your integration tools support all the software versions you're using.</p><p>The integration process can get overwhelming if you try to tackle everything at once. Break it down into smaller phases. Start with integrating your IT inventory system with one other system (like procurement), and move on to the others once that’s running smoothly.</p><p>Testing each phase of the integration is crucial. Run multiple tests to make sure that everything is syncing as expected. The more testing you do, the fewer surprises you’ll have when it goes live.</p><p>By tackling potential challenges early on and testing thoroughly, you’ll be ready to handle any bumps in the road and ensure the integration is successful.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Training and Change Management\n</h2><p>Now that your systems are connected, it’s time to prepare your team for the change. Without proper training, even the best integration won’t yield its full benefits.</p><p>Make sure everyone knows how to use the integrated system. From procurement to finance, each department needs to understand how its role fits into the new process. Highlight the time-saving benefits and make sure they know where to find the information they need.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Communicate with Stakeholders\n</h3><p>Keep everyone in the loop. Regular updates about the integration process will reduce confusion and ensure smoother adoption. It’s also important to let team members know when they can expect the changes to take effect and what new features they can look forward to.</p><p>Change can be tough, especially when it involves new technology. Address any concerns your team might have and offer support during the transition. A little patience and guidance go a long way.</p><p>By focusing on effective training and managing change carefully, you can ensure a smooth transition and make the most of your new integrated system.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Continuous Monitoring and Optimization\n</h2><p>The integration doesn’t stop once everything’s up and running. Continuous monitoring ensures your systems stay in sync and continue to work efficiently.</p><p>Monitor the integration’s performance by setting up automated reports. Check for any discrepancies in data and track system downtime to make sure things are running smoothly. This will also help identify any areas for improvement.</p><p>As your business grows, your integration needs may evolve. Be ready to make adjustments as new systems, tools, or business needs arise. Regular maintenance is key to keeping everything running without hiccups.</p><p>Over time, you may need to scale the integration. This could mean adding new systems, expanding data sync rules, or adapting to new business units. Always plan for the future so your integration can grow with your company.</p><p>By continuously monitoring performance and optimizing the integration over time, you ensure that your systems stay aligned as your business evolves.</p><p>Integrating your IT inventory tracking software with ERP, procurement, and financial systems isn’t just about connecting the dots—it’s about creating a streamlined, efficient workflow that improves every aspect of your business. By following these practical steps and best practices, you’ll set up an integration that not only works well today but can evolve with your business tomorrow.</p><p>Ready to take your asset management to the next level? Start with a clear strategy and a well-planned approach to integration. The result? Seamless operations, better decision-making, and, ultimately, a stronger, more agile business.</p>","contentLength":9223,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SIMD Vectorized Computing（1751344674924200）","url":"https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/simd-vectorized-computing1751344674924200-51a4","date":1751344676,"author":"member_35db4d53","guid":178652,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications.

This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times.

Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions.

Canary deployments have emerged as a critical strategy for minimizing risk while maintaining continuous delivery. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to implement robust canary deployments using Flagger, a progressive delivery operator for Kubernetes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Canary Deployment?\n</h2><p>Canary deployment is a technique for rolling out new features or changes to a small subset of users before releasing the update to the entire system. Named after the \"canary in a coal mine\" practice, this approach allows you to detect issues early and rollback quickly if problems arise.</p><p>Instead of replacing your entire application at once, canary deployments gradually shift traffic from the stable version (primary) to the new version (canary), monitoring key metrics throughout the process. If the metrics indicate problems, the deployment automatically rolls back to the stable version.</p><p>Flagger is a progressive delivery operator that automates the promotion or rollback of canary deployments based on metrics analysis. Here's why it stands out:</p><ul><li><strong>Automated Traffic Management</strong>: Gradually shifts traffic between versions</li><li>: Uses Prometheus metrics to determine deployment success</li><li>: Works with NGINX, Istio, Linkerd, and more</li><li>: Supports custom testing and validation hooks</li><li>: Seamlessly works with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</li></ul><p>As shared above, Flagger provides multiple integration options but I used Nginx ingress controller and Prometheus for metrics. </p><ul><li> (v1.0.2 or newer)</li><li><strong>Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</strong> (HPA) enabled</li><li> for metrics collection and analysis</li><li> deployed in your cluster</li></ul><div><pre><code>\nkubectl get service  | nginx\n\n\nkubectl get hpa \nkubectl get all  flagger\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Installing Flagger\n</h2><p>Flagger can be deployed using Helm or ArgoCD.

By gradually shifting traffic while monitoring key metrics, it enables safe deployments with automatic rollback capabilities.</p><p>The combination of metrics-driven analysis, webhook integration, and seamless traffic management makes Flagger an excellent choice for teams looking to implement progressive delivery practices. Start with simple configurations and gradually add more sophisticated monitoring and testing as your confidence grows.</p><p>Remember that successful canary deployments depend not just on the tooling, but also on having appropriate metrics, sufficient traffic, and well-defined success criteria.

Buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory leaks not only affect program stability but can also become entry points for hacker attacks.</p><p>Traditional C/C++ languages, although excellent in performance, rely entirely on programmer experience and care for memory management.

Languages like Java and Python solve memory safety issues through garbage collection mechanisms, but the overhead of garbage collection becomes a performance bottleneck.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Power of Zero-Cost Abstractions\n</h2><p>One of Rust's most impressive features is zero-cost abstractions. This means we can use high-level abstract concepts without paying runtime performance costs. The compiler optimizes these abstractions into machine code equivalent to hand-written low-level code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Wisdom of Borrow Checker\n</h2><p>Rust's borrow checker is the core mechanism for achieving memory safety. It can detect most memory-related errors at compile time without requiring runtime checks. This allows us to write code that is both safe and efficient.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Through this deep exploration of the balance between memory safety and ultimate performance, I not only mastered the core technologies of safe programming, but more importantly, I developed a mindset for safe and efficient development.

Mastering these technologies will give me an advantage in future technological competition.</p><p><em>This article records my deep thinking as a junior student on the balance between memory safety and performance.

This chapter covers the theoretical foundations of vector search - the mathematical concepts, representation methods, and core techniques that power modern semantic search systems.</p></blockquote><ol><li>🔍 Introduction to Vector Search</li><li>🧮 Understanding Vectors and Embeddings</li><li>📊 Types of Vector Representations</li><li>⚡ Vector Search Techniques</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔍 Introduction to Vector Search\n</h2><p>Vector search is a modern approach to finding similar content by representing data as high-dimensional numerical vectors. Instead of searching for exact keyword matches like traditional search engines, vector search finds items that are semantically similar - meaning they have similar meanings or contexts.</p><p>: Imagine you're looking for movies similar to \"The Matrix.\" Traditional keyword search might only find movies with \"Matrix\" in the title. Vector search, however, would find sci-fi movies with similar themes like \"Inception\" or \"Blade Runner\" because they share semantic similarity in the vector space.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🌟 Why Vector Search Matters\n</h3><ol><li>: Captures the meaning behind words, not just exact matches</li><li>: Works with text, images, audio, and other data types</li><li>: Understands relationships and context between different pieces of information</li><li>: Enables natural language queries and similarity-based searches</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Real-World Applications\n</h3><ul><li>: Finding relevant documents based on meaning, not just keywords</li><li>: Suggesting products, movies, or content based on user preferences</li><li>: Retrieving relevant context for LLM-based chat systems</li><li>: Finding visually similar images</li><li>: Identifying similar or duplicate content</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧮 Understanding Vectors and Embeddings\n</h2><p>In the context of machine learning and search, a  is a list of numbers that represents data in a mathematical form that computers can understand and process. Think of a vector as coordinates in a multi-dimensional space.</p><ul><li>A 2D vector:  represents a point in 2D space</li><li>A 3D vector:  represents a point in 3D space</li><li>An embedding vector:  might have 768 dimensions representing a word or document</li></ul><p> are a special type of vector that represents the semantic meaning of data (like words, sentences, or images) in a continuous numerical space. They are created by machine learning models trained on large datasets.</p><p><strong>🎯 Key Properties of Good Embeddings</strong>:</p><ol><li>: Similar items have similar vectors</li><li>: The distance between vectors reflects semantic relationships</li><li>: Each dimension contributes to the meaning (unlike sparse representations)</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  🎭 How Embeddings Capture Meaning\n</h3><p>Consider these movie examples:</p><ul><li>\"Interstellar\" →  (high sci-fi, low drama, low comedy)</li><li>\"The Notebook\" →  (low sci-fi, high drama, low comedy)</li><li>\"Shrek\" →  (low sci-fi, low drama, high comedy)</li></ul><p>Movies with similar genres will have vectors that are close to each other in this space.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📊 Types of Vector Representations\n</h2><p>: The simplest way to represent categorical data as vectors. Each item gets a vector with a single 1 and the rest 0s.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>No semantic relationships (apple and banana don't appear similar)</li><li>Very high dimensionality for large vocabularies</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2️⃣ Dense Vectors (Embeddings)\n</h3><p>: Compact, dense numerical representations where each dimension captures some aspect of meaning.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Capture semantic relationships</li><li>Enable similarity calculations</li><li>Work well with machine learning models</li></ul><p><strong>🛠️ Creating Dense Vectors</strong>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3️⃣ Choosing the Right Dimensionality\n</h3><p><strong>🤔 How many dimensions do you need?</strong></p><ul><li>: 100-300 dimensions (Word2Vec, GloVe)</li><li>: 384-768 dimensions (BERT, MPNet)</li><li>: 512-1024+ dimensions</li><li>: 512-2048+ dimensions</li></ul><ul><li>: Better representation, more computational cost</li><li>: Faster processing, potential information loss</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚡ Vector Search Techniques\n</h2><p>Vector search relies on measuring how \"similar\" vectors are. Here are the most common metrics:</p><p>: The angle between two vectors (ignores magnitude): -1 to 1 (1 = identical, 0 = orthogonal, -1 = opposite): Text embeddings, normalized data</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Straight-line distance between points: 0 to infinity (0 = identical, larger = more different): Image embeddings, when magnitude matters</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Pure vector search sometimes misses exact matches or specific terms.</p><p>: Combine vector search (semantic) with keyword search (lexical).</p><ul><li>Query: \"18 U.S.C. § 1341\" (specific legal code)</li><li>Vector search might find semantically similar laws</li><li>Keyword search finds the exact code</li><li>Hybrid search combines both for better results</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  4️⃣ Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)\n</h3><p>For large datasets, exact search becomes too slow.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns\n</h2><p>Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:</p><p>Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Request/Response Compression\n</h3><p>Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.</p><p>API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication and Authorization\n</h3><p>Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h2><p>Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:</p><p>Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.</p><p>Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.</p><p>Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deployment and Scaling Strategies\n</h2><p>Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:</p><p>API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.</p><p>Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.</p><p>For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lessons Learned and Best Practices\n</h2><p>Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:</p><ol><li><p>: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.</p></li><li><p>: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.</p></li><li><p>: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.</p></li></ol><p>The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:</p><p>Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.</p><p>Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.</p><p>API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.</p><p>The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.</p><p>As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.</p><p><em>This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding API Gateway Architecture\n</h2><p>In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.</p><p>The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns\n</h2><p>Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:</p><p>Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dynamic Configuration Management\n</h3><p>The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.</p><p>While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Optimization Strategies\n</h2><p>In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive\n</h3><p>Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.</p><p>Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Request/Response Compression\n</h3><p>Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.</p><p>API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication and Authorization\n</h3><p>Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Input Validation and Sanitization\n</h3><p>Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting\n</h3><p>Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring and Observability\n</h2><p>Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:</p><p>Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.</p><p>Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.</p><p>Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deployment and Scaling Strategies\n</h2><p>Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:</p><p>API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.</p><p>Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.</p><p>For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lessons Learned and Best Practices\n</h2><p>Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:</p><ol><li><p>: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.</p></li><li><p>: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.</p></li><li><p>: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.</p></li><li><p>: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.</p></li></ol><p>The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:</p><p>Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.</p><p>Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.</p><p>Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.</p><p>API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure.

Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.</p><p><strong>The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital Age</strong></p><p>Modern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.</p><p>I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.</p><p>Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.</p><p><strong>Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency Safety</strong></p><p>The framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.</p><p>This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.</p><p>Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.</p><p><strong>Framework Design: Layered and Resilient Defenses</strong></p><p>Beyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization</strong>\nThe principle of \"Never trust user input\" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.<p>\nIt also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.</p>\nMy tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This \"secure by default\" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Session Management and Authentication</strong>\nSecure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.<p>\nWhile it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).</p>\nI observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.</p></li><li><p>\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Dependency Management</strong>\nContemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.\nThe framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error Handling and Information Concealment</strong>\nExposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.</p></li><li><p>\nHTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).</p></li></ol><p><strong>Practical Security Considerations in Implementation</strong></p><p>When implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong>: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.</li><li><strong>Audits and Penetration Testing</strong>: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.</li><li>: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.</li><li><strong>Timely Dependency Updates</strong>: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Log Monitoring</strong>: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.</li></ul><p>This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.</p><p><strong>Comparative Analysis with Other Frameworks</strong></p><p>Compared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.</p><p>When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.</p><p>Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Security as a Continuous Endeavor</strong></p><p>In the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.</p><p>This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.</p><p>As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.</p>","contentLength":8578,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Single Core Hundred Thousand Concurrency（1751327856613900）","url":"https://dev.to/member_de57975b/single-core-hundred-thousand-concurrency1751327856613900-463o","date":1751327857,"author":"member_de57975b","guid":177012,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have been troubled by a question during my high-concurrency programming learning: how to achieve hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections on a single-core processor?

Let’s get started!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔧 1. PHPUnit – The Engine Behind Laravel Testing\n</h2><p>Laravel uses  under the hood as its testing engine. If you've never heard of PHPUnit before — no worries. It's a popular testing framework for PHP that lets you write automated tests to verify your application works as expected.</p><p>Laravel comes bundled with PHPUnit support, so you don’t need to install it separately. Just make sure your dependencies are up to date:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📂 2. The  Directory – Where Tests Live\n</h2><p>Laravel has a dedicated  directory at the root of your project. This folder is  when you create a new Laravel app.</p><p>Inside this folder, you'll find :</p><p>Used for testing  — routes, HTTP requests, controllers, etc.\nThink of it as: <em>“How does my app behave from the outside?”</em></p><p>Used for testing <strong>individual classes or methods</strong> — things like helpers, services, or business logic.\nThink of it as: <em>“Is this specific method doing what I expect?”</em></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧠 3. What Is SUT (Subject Under Test)?\n</h2><p>In testing terminology,  stands for . It refers to the <strong>actual function, class, or feature</strong> you're trying to test.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, the  is your SUT. You're checking if the behavior () works as intended.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧪 4. TDD – Test Driven Development (Laravel Makes It Easy!)\n</h2><p> stands for , a technique where you:</p><ol><li>Write a failing test first.</li><li>Write just enough code to pass the test.</li><li>Refactor your code while keeping the test green.</li></ol><p>Laravel supports TDD beautifully, especially when combined with tools like Pest or Laravel Dusk (for browser testing).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚙️ 5. Configuration File: </h2><p>Laravel includes a pre-configured file named , which lives in your project root. This file contains default settings like:</p><ul><li>The environment settings for testing ()</li></ul><p>Unless you're customizing deeply, you usually don’t need to touch this file.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🏃‍♂️ 6. How to Run Your Tests\n</h2><p>Laravel gives you a simple artisan command to run your tests:</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the raw PHPUnit command:</p><p>Laravel’s test runner adds extra polish, including a beautiful output and even error highlighting.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🧱 7.

I'm writing this because I'm convinced that this was a great architecture choice and there aren't many examples of event sourcing and CQRS in the internet where it actually makes sense. You are very welcome to share your thoughts and whether you agree about this design choice or not :)</p><p>The client was a medium sized fintech company that has in-house developed a real time trading platform that was launched as a beta test version. The functionality included:</p><ul><li>Real time transaction tracking</li><li>Account with a little social media functionality (making posts, liking and commenting)</li><li>Mobile device notifications</li></ul><p>Their app was an MVP. It had a monolithic Spring boot backend and a simple React based web UI, everything hosted on Azure.</p><p>They hired us because of two main reasons: their MVP was not auditable and thus not compliant with financial regulations and also not scalable (high usage and fault tolerance).</p><p>We worked with the customer, not alone. Our team were about 10 people, experienced back end or full stack developers and me as a software architect. The client had about 20 developers, ranging from front end, back end to database experts and more. My role was to lead the architecture.</p><p>As said, the main issues to solve were auditability (compliance) and scalability (including performance and fault tolerance). I will start with an overview of the design including a super short repetition of what each technology is and later dive into detail in the next session, including discussing the trade offs and alternative solutions.</p><p>Our customer must by law always know past states. For example, customer A had exactly $901 on their account 2 months ago at 1:30 pm. This was not possible with the existing system so we needed to tackle it. I proposed to use event sourcing. Here is a very brief explanation of event sourcing.</p><blockquote><p>Event sourcing = Save events, not state</p></blockquote><p>So instead of having a state we update, we save events. We use these events to create the state when we need it. Consider this simple example:</p><div><pre><code>+--------------------------------------+\n| Table: Account_Balance               |\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Account_ID | Balance | Last_Updated  |\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Customer_A | $0      | 2025-04-29    | &lt;- Initial state\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Customer_A | $5      | 2025-04-29    | &lt;- After receiving $5 (overwrites $0)\n+--------------------------------------+\n| Customer_A | $12     | 2025-04-29    | &lt;- After receiving $7 (overwrites $5)\n+--------------------------------------+\n</code></pre></div><p>Problem: Past states (e.g., $5 at 1:30 PM) are lost unless separately logged.</p><div><pre><code>+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Table: Account_Events                                             |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Event_ID | Account_ID | Event_Type | Amount | Timestamp           |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 1        | Customer_A | Deposit    | $5     | 2025-04-29 13:30:00 | &lt;- Event: Received $5\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 2        | Customer_A | Deposit    | $7     | 2025-04-29 13:31:00 | &lt;- Event: Received $7\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n</code></pre></div><p>Reconstructing Balance at 2025-04-29 13:30:00:</p><ul><li>Sum events up to timestamp: $5 = $5</li></ul><p>Reconstructing Balance at 2025-04-29 13:31:00:</p><ul><li>Sum events up to timestamp: $5 + $7 = $12</li></ul><p>Reconstructing Balance 2 months ago:</p><ul><li>Sum all relevant events &lt;= timestamp</li></ul><p>This is event sourcing in a nutshell. For a more comprehensive explanation, please have a look <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> for example.</p><p>This is the right choice here because this gives us total control and transparency. When we want to know how much money a particular user had 2 months ago at 1:42 pm, we can just query the needed transactions and sum them up. We know everything with this approach. And this is required to be compliant. As a side note, accounting does the same thing but, of course, they don't call it event sourcing :)</p><p>But event sourcing comes with more advantages, including:</p><ul><li>Rebuild state: you can always just discard the app state completely and rebuild it. You have all info you need, all events that ever took place.</li><li>Event replay: if we want to adjust a past event, for example because it was incorrect, we can just do that and rebuild the app state.</li><li>Event replay again: if we have received events in the wrong sequence, which is a common problem with systems that communicate with asynchronous messaging, we can just replay them and get the correct state.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Alternatives to Event Sourcing\n</h4><p>Event sourcing definitely solves the auditability/compliance problem. But there are alternatives:</p><p>: Keep the current state tables but add comprehensive audit logs that track all changes. This is simpler to implement but doesn't provide the same level of detail as event sourcing. You track what changed, but not necessarily the business intent behind the change.</p><p><strong>2. Change Data Capture (CDC)</strong>: Use database-level tools to capture all changes automatically. Tools like Debezium can stream database changes, but this is more technical and less business-focused than event sourcing.</p><p>: Use database features (like SQL Server's temporal tables) to automatically version data. This provides history but lacks the rich business context that events provide.</p><p><strong>4. Transaction Log Mining</strong>: Extract historical data from database transaction logs. This is complex and database-specific, making it harder to maintain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)\n</h3><p>The second major architectural decision was implementing CQRS, though we didn't start with it immediately due to complexity. We kept it in mind during the initial design and tested it later through a proof of concept, then implemented it in production.</p><blockquote><p>CQRS = Separate your reads from your writes</p></blockquote><p>This is all. Often CQRS is presented as (among other things) having two separate DBs, one for writing and one for reading. But this is not true, you are doing CQRS already when you just separate read and write code, for example by putting them into separate classes.</p><p>However, the benefits we needed do indeed require separate DBs.</p><div><pre><code>Traditional Approach:\n┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐\n│   Client    │────│   Service    │────│   Database   │\n│             │    │              │    │              │\n│ Read/Write  │    │ Read/Write   │    │ Read/Write   │\n└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘\n\nCQRS Approach:\n┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐\n│   Client    │────│ Command Side │────│ Write Store  │\n│             │    │   (Writes)   │    │ (Event Store)│\n│             │    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘\n│             │           │                    │\n│             │           │ Events             │ Events\n│             │           ▼                    ▼\n│             │    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐\n│             │────│  Query Side  │────│  Read Store  │\n│             │    │   (Reads)    │    │ (Projections)│\n└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘\n</code></pre></div><p>The benefits of doing this are the following:</p><ul><li>Scale read and write resources differently\n\n<ul><li>By having two separate DBs, you can choose different technologies and scale them independently</li><li>If performance is critical in your app, this can definitely help, especially when reads and writes are not of a similar amount</li><li>In our case, we have a read heavy app</li></ul></li><li>You can have different models for reading and writing</li></ul><p>As hinted already, this was crucial for our trading platform because:</p><ul><li>Complex reports and dashboards need denormalized, optimized read models,</li><li>Read and write loads are completely different in trading systems, so we need independent scalability,</li><li>We can use different databases optimized for each purpose.</li></ul><p>However, CQRS with separate DBs comes at great cost again, for example, you need to deal with eventual consistency.</p><p>: We do NOT use CQRS on every service but only where it justifies the complexity.</p><p>You can try to get the benefits of CQRS in other ways, for example by using caching strategies and read replicas. I'll dive into the tradeoffs of these approaches in the detailed discussion section.</p><p>We also decided to break the monolith into microservices. The main reason for this decision was again independent scalability and higher fault tolerance. The existing monolith was often running on very high CPU usage due to report generation and real-time market data processing consuming most resources.</p><p>By separating these concerns into different services, even if our report generation service crashes due to heavy usage, other critical services like transaction processing are not impacted at all. This improves our overall system availability (MTBF - Mean Time Between Failures) and reduces recovery time (MTTR - Mean Time To Recovery).</p><p>An interesting part here was the migration from monolith to microservices using the strangler fig pattern, gradually replacing parts of the monolith.</p><p>Another decision was to use asynchronous messaging for inter-service communication instead of request-response communication.</p><div><pre><code>Synchronous (Traditional):\nService A ──HTTP Request──► Service B\n          ◄──Response─────\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Asynchronous (Our Approach):\nService A ──Event──► Message Queue ──Event──► Service B\n</code></pre></div><p>This event-driven approach has many benefits such as high decoupling. However, we were primarily interested in better fault tolerance:</p><p>Suppose Service A informs Service B to save data to its DB. If we use a traditional HTTP request and Service B is down, then the request is lost. Of course there are ways to combat this but if we use asynchronous messaging instead, then Service A just pushed that event to the message queue and if Service B is down, nothing happens. The event just stays on the queue. And as soon as Service B is up again, the event gets processed.</p><p>So using this approach gives us better fault tolerance in the case of network partitions.</p><p>Now asynchronous messaging has clear downsides too, mainly complexity, particularly when it comes to debugging, testing and things of that kind.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Detailed Discussion: Tradeoffs and Alternatives\n</h2><p>We identified services based on business capabilities as follows:</p><div><pre><code>Transaction-Portfolio Service:\n├── Owns: Account balances, transaction history, stock holdings\n├── Responsibilities: Money transfers, buy/sell orders, balance queries\n└── Database: PostgreSQL (ACID compliance critical)\n\nNotification Service:\n├── Owns: User preferences, notification history\n├── Responsibilities: Email, SMS, push notifications\n└── Database: MongoDB (flexible schema for different notification types)\n└── Event Sourcing: NOT used (simple CRUD operations)\n\nSocial Service:\n├── Owns: Posts, likes, comments\n├── Responsibilities: Social feed, user interactions\n└── Database: MongoDB\n└── Event Sourcing: NOT used (not critical for compliance)\n\nReport Service:\n├── Owns: Aggregated data, report templates\n├── Responsibilities: Generate complex reports\n└── Database: ClickHouse (optimized for analytics)\n└── CQRS: Read-only projections from other services\n\nUser Service:\n├── Owns: User profiles, authentication\n├── Responsibilities: Registration, login, profile management\n└── Database: PostgreSQL\n└── Event Sourcing: NOT used (user profiles change infrequently)\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Service Boundary Evolution</strong>: Initially, we considered separating Transaction Service and Portfolio Service. However, we discovered early in the design phase that this would be wrong. Due to very frequent boundary crossings and the need for distributed transactions when a trade affects both account balance and portfolio holdings, we decided to keep these as a single service. This eliminated the complexity of distributed transactions while maintaining other benefits.</p><p>In my opinion, the need of distributed transactions or sagas is always an indicator to check if your service boundaries are the right choice. Maybe you want to merge services instead. To quote Sam Newman in <em>Building Microservices (2nd edition)</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Distributed Transactions: Just Say No. For all the reasons outlined so far, I strongly suggest you avoid the use of distributed transactions like the two-phase commit to coordinate changes in state across your microservices. So what else can you do? Well, the first option could be to just not split the data apart in the first place. If you have pieces of state that you want to manage in a truly atomic and consistent way, and you cannot work out how to sensibly get these characteristics without an ACID-style transaction, then leave that state in a single database, and leave the functionality that manages that state in a single service (or in your monolith). If you're in the process of working out where to split your monolith and what decompositions might be easy (or hard), then you could well decide that splitting apart data that is currently managed in a transaction is just too difficult to handle right now. Work on some other area of the system, and come back to this later. But what happens if you really do need to break this data apart, but you don't want all the pain of managing distributed transactions? In cases like this, you may consider an alternative approach: sagas.</p></blockquote><p>So he also recommends to either merge the services or, if really needed, to use sagas. In our case we decided that this service boundary would be wrong since the scalibility needs to the transaction service and the portfolio service are not that different actually.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Where We Use Event Sourcing\n</h4><p>We used event sourcing only in the Transaction-Portfolio Service due to the strict compliance requirements for financial data. The other services used traditional CRUD patterns since they didn't require the same level of auditability.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of Event Sourcing\n</h4><p>Event sourcing has better performance when it comes to writing. Consider this example:</p><p>Traditional Update Pattern:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And it has even more advantages on the writing part:</p><ul><li>: Append-only writes are much faster than updates</li><li>: Multiple transactions can write simultaneously</li><li>: No need to lock rows for balance updates</li><li>: Sequential writes perform excellently on modern storage</li></ul><p>Although we talked about this already, here is a sample of how you could implement :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Performance Issue - Event Replay</strong></p><p>The main challenge we faced was performance degradation when reconstructing current state from thousands of events. For active trading accounts, we had up to 50,000 events per day.</p><p>Our solution was a hybrid approach:</p><ul><li>: Create snapshots after every 1,000 events per account</li><li>: Only replay events since the last snapshot</li></ul><p>This approach ensures that we never need to replay more than 1,000 events for any account, keeping reconstruction time predictable and fast.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This reduced our balance calculation time from 2-5 seconds to 50-200ms for active accounts.</p><p>Events accumulate rapidly. We implemented a tiered storage strategy:</p><ul><li> (Azure Premium SSD): Last 3 months ~ 2TB</li><li> (Azure Standard SSD): 3-12 months ~ 5TB</li><li> (Azure Archive): 1+ years ~ 50TB</li></ul><p>Total storage costs: $800/month vs $15,000/month if everything was on premium storage.</p><p>Event sourcing adds significant complexity. A part of the team needed training.</p><p>\nGetting current state requires aggregation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nEvents accumulate over time and require storage management strategies.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why We Rejected Alternatives\n</h4><p>Yes, we have decided to use event sourcing even though it comes with read performance issues - and performance was a main concern of our customer.</p><p>The reason is that event sourcing is simply much superior when it comes to audits. This was much more important to the customer than performance. Plus we managed to solve the performance issue.</p><p>: CQRS in the sense of having multiple DBs adds complexity and eventual consistency. This is why we decided  using it immediately but just kept it in mind. We later created a proof of concept to compare the performance benefits we would get in the Portfolio Service.</p><p>Our POC results showed for a test user account:</p><ul><li>: 30 seconds → 10 seconds</li><li>: 1 second → 400ms</li><li><strong>Complex query performance</strong>: about 2x improvement</li></ul><p>The result convinced us to implement it. We later added it to the Transaction Service for high-volume trading operations, but . Adding CQRS to all our services would have little benefits (we don't need the performance benefits or different read/write models at most services) but much complexity.</p><p>We implemented CQRS for the Transaction-Portfolio Service as follows. We had a Postgres DB for the write side (command side) and a MongoDB for the read side (query side). We chose a document store because we did not want a fixed schema plus we wanted very high read throughput.</p><p>So the service received a request and decided to write, it wrote to the Postgres DB and also emitted an event to our message broker (Azure Service Bus). This event was then processed by a different instance of the Transaction-Portfolio Service and we write to the MongoDB. Here we don't write the same data but a denormalized form, so that querying the data we need is faster.</p><p>Note we sacrifice ACID by doing this. This gave us eventual consistency between read and write sides, typically within 100-500ms.</p><p>The performance improvements came from:</p><ol><li>: Instead of complex JOINs across normalized tables, we had pre-computed aggregations</li><li>: Each MongoDB collection had indexes tailored for specific query patterns</li><li>: We could scale read replicas independently of the write database</li></ol><p>Consider this example of generating a user's portfolio performance report:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Major Challenges and How We Solved Them\n</h3><p><strong>1. Debugging Distributed Systems</strong></p><p>This was our biggest pain point initially. When a transaction failed, tracing the issue across multiple services and async message queues was a nightmare.</p><p>We solved this by implementing distributed tracing with correlation IDs that flow through every service call and message. Every log entry includes the correlation ID, making it possible to reconstruct the entire flow. We used Jaeger for distributed tracing and structured logging with consistent fields across all services.</p><p>Testing event sourcing and CQRS systems is fundamentally different. You can't just mock database calls - you need to verify that events are produced correctly and that projections are updated properly.</p><p>We created integration test environments that could replay production events against test instances. This allowed us to validate that code changes wouldn't break existing event processing. We also invested heavily in property-based testing to verify that event sequences always produce valid states.</p><p>I'm convinced this was the right architecture for our specific requirements. However, there are definitely things I would approach differently:</p><ul><li><p>We didn't have a clear strategy for evolving event schemas initially. When we needed to add fields to events or change event structure, it created compatibility issues with existing events.</p></li><li><p>Also our monitoring and logging was weak in the beginning and made everything even more complex to start.</p></li><li><p>I would consider using EventStore instead of Postgres for the Transaction-Portfolio Service. EventStore is purpose-built for event sourcing and provides features like built-in projections, event versioning, and optimized append-only storage. This would eliminate much of the custom event sourcing infrastructure we had to build on top of Postgres.</p></li></ul>","contentLength":20210,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Programming Entry Level: tutorial classes","url":"https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/programming-entry-level-tutorial-classes-2bnf","date":1751321717,"author":"DevOps Fundamental","guid":176963,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Tutorial Classes for Beginners\n</h2><p>So, you're starting your programming journey – awesome! You've probably heard about \"classes\" and maybe even \"tutorial classes.\" They can sound intimidating, but trust me, they're a fundamental building block of many programming languages and understanding them will unlock a lot of power.  This post will break down what tutorial classes are, why they're useful, and how to start using them.  Knowing this stuff is also super helpful in technical interviews, as it shows you understand core programming concepts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Understanding \"tutorial classes\"\n</h3><p>Imagine you're building with LEGOs. You could just pile bricks together randomly, but it's much more organized (and fun!) to follow instructions to build a specific model, like a car or a house.  </p><p>A \"class\" in programming is like those LEGO instructions. It's a blueprint for creating objects.  Think of an object as the finished LEGO model – a specific instance of the instructions. </p><p>Let's say you want to represent a dog in your program. A class called  would define what a dog  – it has a name, a breed, and can bark.  Each  dog (like your pet Fido or your neighbor's Spot) would be an  created from the  class. They all share the same characteristics (name, breed, bark), but each dog has its own  values for those characteristics.</p><p>Here's a simple way to visualize it using a diagram:</p><div><pre><code>classDiagram\n    class Dog {\n        - name : string\n        - breed : string\n        + bark() : void\n    }\n</code></pre></div><p>This diagram shows the  class has attributes (name and breed) and a method (bark).  Attributes are the data the object holds, and methods are the actions the object can perform.</p><p>Let's see how this looks in Python:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>: This line  a new class named .  It's like creating the blueprint.</li><li><code>def __init__(self, name, breed):</code>: This is a special method called the . It's automatically called when you create a new  object.   refers to the object being created.  and  are parameters you pass in when creating the dog.</li><li>: This line assigns the value of the  parameter to the  attribute of the  object.   does the same for the breed.</li><li>: This defines a method called .  Methods are functions that belong to the class.  Again,  refers to the specific  object that's barking.</li><li><code>print(\"Woof! My name is\", self.name)</code>: This line prints a message including the dog's name.</li></ol><p>Now, let's create some  objects:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code first creates two  objects,  and , using the  class.  Then, it calls the  method on each object.  You'll see the output:</p><div><pre><code>Woof! My name is Fido\nWoof! My name is Spot\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes or Misunderstandings\n</h3><p>Here are some common pitfalls beginners face when learning about classes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> For methods within a class, you  need to include  as the first parameter.   represents the instance of the class that the method is being called on.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>  The  method requires specific parameters (name and breed in our example). You need to provide those values when creating a new object.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> You can only access attributes that are defined within the class (either in the  method or added later).</p><p>Let's imagine you're building a simple game with different types of characters. You could use classes to represent each character type:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example shows how classes can be used to create reusable components for a larger project.  We have a base  class and then specialized classes like  and  that inherit from it.</p><p>Here are a few ideas to practice using classes:</p><ol><li>  It should have attributes for width and height and methods to calculate area and perimeter.</li><li>  Include attributes for account number and balance, and methods for deposit, withdraw, and check balance.</li><li>  Attributes could include make, model, and year. Methods could include start, stop, and accelerate.</li><li> Attributes: name, student ID, courses. Methods: add_course, remove_course, display_courses.</li><li><strong>Create a simple  class:</strong> Attributes: name, species. Methods: make_sound. Then create subclasses like  and  that override the  method.</li></ol><p>Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into the world of classes.  You've learned what classes are, how to define them, how to create objects from them, and how to use methods.  Remember, classes are blueprints for creating objects, and they're a powerful tool for organizing and structuring your code.</p><p>Don't be discouraged if it doesn't click immediately.

After running the command above, a  folder will automatically be created inside the  directory. This is where we’ll define the templates.\nInside , there will already be a sample file called , which we’ll remove since it won’t be used when running the generator.\nOnce the generator is created, it's time to define the templates that will serve as the base for autogenerating code.</p><p>For defining the templates, I will use the files from the Text component as a base.</p><ul><li>First template: the component itself</li></ul><p>For the first template, the  file will be used as the base:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From it, we can notice that what the components will have in common are the imports, the definition of the component’s types named , the styled-components types named <code>Styled{component name}Props</code>, the CSS properties defined with styled-components named , and finally, the component’s definition and its default export.\nWith these points in mind, inside the  folder, a file named  will be created, which will correspond to the creation of the component’s skeleton itself:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>&lt;%=name%&gt; and &lt;%=html%&gt; correspond to dynamic values that will be passed when running the generator, replacing those placeholders in the code above with, respectively, the component’s name and the html element it represents.\nThe  field defines where the autogenerated file based on this template will be created.

In this article, we’ll complete the answer to the question: “Why is the stack faster than the heap?”, and also touch on why the heap is typically larger, but slower than the stack.</p><p>A natural way to introduce heap memory is by showing a working example of how it’s used in programs.</p><p>Heap memory is a region that a program accesses by explicitly requesting a block of memory from the operating system. Unlike stack memory, data stored on the heap remains valid after a function exits.</p><p>For instance, when a function contains stack-allocated variables, those variables are automatically deallocated when the function returns. Attempting to access them afterward leads to undefined behavior, since the memory may have been overwritten.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Allocated memory at: 00000006C899F590\nAllocated memory at: 0000011A01D49540\nAllocated stack memory at: 00000006C899F590\nAllocated heap memory at: 0000011A01D49540\nStack memory value: -929434080\nHeap memory value: 0\n</code></pre></div><p> creates a zero-initialized array on the stack and returns a pointer to the array on the stack.  allocates a zero-initialized memory span on the heap and returns a pointer to the memory location.</p><p>In this case, the stack array we attempted to access contains corrupted values, not the zero we initialized it with. This is an example of stack corruption, where the memory was reused or overwritten after the function exited. This is due to the stack being a contiguous memory block which the program and functions use to perform operations they need. This is not how the stack is supposed to be used. Stack memory should not be accessed when it has left the scope, even though accessing it is still possible.</p><p>In contrast, the heap-allocated memory remains intact and returns the expected zero. This is because <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/calloc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calloc</a> initializes the allocated memory to zero, and the memory is allocated in an arbitrary location in the memory, making it much less susceptible to being randomly corrupted by other function calls or random memory access.</p><p>\nThe heap is also allowed to be much larger than the stack. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>(process 56272) exited with code -1073741571 (0xc00000fd). // Stack overflow\n</code></pre></div><p>Allocating  on the stack causes a stack overflow because it exceeds the default stack size (on Windows it's about ).</p><p>In contrast, the heap handles large allocations without crashing:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Allocated memory at: 0x1e2c1fd0070\n(process 53076) exited with code 0 (0x0).\n</code></pre></div><p>Heap memory is not subject to a strict size cap like the stack, and thus 800MB can be asked from the heap without much problem. It can also be allocated from arbitrary locations in virtual memory.</p><p>To understand heap allocation, it helps to know a few key terms:</p><ul><li>🍿Kernel: The core part of an operating system, responsible for managing CPU time, memory, and hardware interaction at the lowest level.</li><li>📄Page: A fixed-size memory block (typically 4096 bytes) used by the kernel to manage memory. Memory is allocated in pages rather than individual bytes for efficiency.</li></ul><p>\nHeap memory is allocated differently from the stack. The stack typically has a fixed size (e.g., 1MB on Windows), pre-allocated when a program starts. In contrast, the heap must be requested at runtime from the OS.</p><p>When you call malloc, the C standard library first tries to find space in memory pages already assigned to the process. If no space is available, it performs a system call to the kernel to request additional memory pages.</p><ul><li>    Return a pointer to the allocated memory,</li><li>    Or return MAP_FAILED to indicate allocation failure.</li></ul><p>This address is passed back through the system layers from the kernel to the C library to malloc, and finally to the caller.</p><p>This is much more complicated than the stack, where allocation is often just a pointer subtractions and pointer arithmetics.</p><p>The complexity of heap allocation — requiring coordination between:</p><ul><li>The operating system kernel,</li><li>Bookkeeping data structures for memory blocks and pages,</li></ul><p>…makes it significantly slower than stack allocation.</p><p>Additionally, heap memory must be manually managed with malloc and free, introducing more opportunities for bugs like memory leaks, double frees, and dangling pointers.</p><p>This means heap allocation is powerful but comes with cost:</p><ul><li>Slower due to system calls and metadata tracking,</li><li>Harder to manage due to manual deallocation,</li><li>Larger and more flexible than stack memory.</li></ul><p>Use heap memory only when necessary, such as when:</p><ul><li>The data must outlive a function,</li><li>The size is too large for the stack,</li><li>Or the lifetime is dynamic and unpredictable.</li></ul>","contentLength":4527,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"💥 That One Time globals.css Crashed My Next.js Build","url":"https://dev.to/jvicmaina/that-one-time-globalscss-crashed-my-nextjs-build-5e2m","date":1751319204,"author":"Victor Maina","guid":176950,"unread":true,"content":"<p>You ever update some colors in your tailwind.config.ts and suddenly your entire Next.js app refuses to compile?

It doesn't just blindly follow instructions one after another. It makes choices, repeats actions, and responds to different situations. That's where  comes in! Understanding control flow is absolutely fundamental to programming, and it's something you'll use . It's also a common topic in beginner programming interviews, so getting a good grasp of it now will really help you down the line.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Understanding \"Introduction Control Flow\"\n</h3><p>Imagine you're giving someone directions. You might say, \"If you see a red light, stop. Otherwise, keep going.\" Or, \"Walk down this street, then turn left, then walk straight until you see a park.\" These are examples of controlling the  of instructions.</p><p>In programming, control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program.  Instead of always running lines of code sequentially (one after the other), control flow statements allow us to change that order based on conditions or to repeat sections of code.</p><p>There are three main types of control flow we'll cover today:</p><ul><li> This is the default – code runs line by line, from top to bottom.</li><li>  This allows us to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false (like the red light example).  We use ,  (or ), and  statements for this.</li><li> This allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. We use  and  loops for this.</li></ul><p>Let's look at some examples!</p><p>Let's start with a simple conditional statement in JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> We declare a variable  and set it to 25.</li><li> The  statement checks if  is greater than 30.  It's not, so the code inside the first curly braces  is skipped.</li><li> The  statement checks if  is greater than 20. It  (25 &gt; 20), so the code inside  set of curly braces is executed, printing \"It's a pleasant day.\" to the console.</li><li> The  block is only executed if  of the previous conditions are true.  Since we already found a true condition, the  block is skipped.</li></ol><p>Now, let's look at a simple loop in Python:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> The  loop iterates (repeats) a block of code a specific number of times.</li><li> creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).</li><li> For each number  in the sequence, the code inside the loop (the  statement) is executed.</li><li><pre><code>Hello, world! 0\nHello, world! 1\nHello, world! 2\nHello, world! 3\nHello, world! 4\n</code></pre></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes or Misunderstandings\n</h3><p>Let's look at some common pitfalls:</p><p><strong>1. Forgetting Curly Braces (JavaScript)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> In JavaScript, curly braces  are used to define the blocks of code that belong to the  and  statements.  Without them, only the first line after the  or  will be considered part of the block.</p><p><strong>2. Incorrect Comparison Operator</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>  In most programming languages,  is used for assignment (setting a value to a variable), while  is used for comparison (checking if two values are equal).  Using  in an  condition will usually cause an error.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>  An infinite loop occurs when the condition in a  loop never becomes false. In the incorrect example,  is never incremented, so  will always be true.  Always make sure your loop has a way to eventually terminate!</p><p>Let's create a simple program to check if a number is even or odd.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This program uses a conditional statement () to determine if a number is even or odd. The  operator calculates the remainder of a division. If the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.  This is a very common pattern in programming!</p><p>Here are a few ideas to practice your control flow skills:</p><ol><li>  Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Use a  loop to keep asking until the user guesses correctly.</li><li>  Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the corresponding calculation. Use  to handle different operators.</li><li> Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, print \"Buzz\", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\".</li><li>  Write a program that takes a student's score as input and assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on predefined ranges.</li><li> Write a program that takes a number as input and counts down from that number to 0, printing each number along the way.</li></ol><p>Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into understanding control flow. You've learned about sequential execution, conditional statements (), and loops ( and ).  These are the building blocks of almost every program you'll ever write.</p><p>Don't be afraid to experiment and try different things. The best way to learn is by doing!  Next, you might want to explore more advanced loop techniques, nested control flow statements (putting one control flow statement inside another), and functions to organize your code. Keep practicing, and you'll become a confident programmer in no time!</p>","contentLength":4868,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Map, Filter and Reduce in JS","url":"https://dev.to/karo_io_/-493k","date":1751318073,"author":"Karo","guid":176946,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>I Finally Understood map, filter And reduce In JavaScript</h2>","contentLength":57,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/atwellpub/-22cp","date":1751318073,"author":"Hudson Atwell","guid":176947,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Introducing Perplexity AI Lookups for WordPress</h2><h3>GBTI Network for GBTI Network ・ Jun 30</h3>","contentLength":87,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Free Online Tools for Developers","url":"https://dev.to/hamzaashkar/free-online-tools-for-developers-1nen","date":1751318040,"author":"Hamza Ashkar","guid":176945,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I recently launched a personal project — <a href=\"https://toolskitpro.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ToolsKitPro.net</a> — a collection of 100+ free tools for developers, writers, and digital creators.</p><p>These are all  tools — no templates, no ads, no signup.</p><ul><li>Image Tools (SVG to PNG, etc)</li></ul><p>I’d love feedback, feature suggestions, or even collaborations!</p>","contentLength":292,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Crater Your Database, Part Five - Summary","url":"https://dev.to/aws-builders/how-to-crater-your-database-part-five-summary-37n7","date":1751317980,"author":"Seth Orell","guid":176944,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We are at the end of this whirlwind tutorial on turning your database into a smoking hole in the ground.

Please give it a hard look.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Pre-defined access patterns\n</h2><p>Before wrapping up, I want to address a common polemic when comparing DynamoDB to SQL: pre-defined access patterns. In DynamoDB's documentation, AWS encourages you to identify your data access patterns before building anything. This idea often receives pushback from SQLites, who argue that it is inflexible and impractical. Their anger is misguided. This has nothing to do with DynamoDB but with scalability more broadly.</p><p>Let's say you are using SQL in a scalable manner. You use no aggregations, foreign keys, or joins. I guarantee you that your indexes will follow your access patterns. This applies to any datastore, whether SQL, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch. It would be like DynamoDB, but without the guardrails.</p><p>And if a new access pattern were introduced, you'd have to do the work to incorporate it. You would figure out specific indexes and generate composite data keys for this new access pattern. You are optimizing for how your app works, not for flexible access patterns. This was hard for me to unlearn, but it's an essential distinction between OLTP and OLAP systems. Your app requires an OLTP database to scale, and you need to design it accordingly.</p><p>As Alex DeBrie wrote in The DynamoDB Book, \"[in DynamoDB,] You design your data to handle the specific access patterns you have, rather than designing for flexibility in the future.\" I want to expand this to say, \"In any scalable database system, you must design your data to handle the specific access patterns you have.\" If you have a problem with pre-defining your access patterns, you also have a problem with scalability.</p><p>Build for scalability. Consider using DynamoDB for its built-in guardrails and all the additional benefits it offers. Scale your business to new heights and profit from all your happy customers. And, after you do, I'd like to meet for coffee and hear all about it.</p>","contentLength":4297,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Part 2: Reading Smart Contract Data with web3.py - Your First Contract Interaction (No Faucets Needed!)","url":"https://dev.to/divine_igbinoba_fb6de7207/part-2-reading-smart-contract-data-with-web3py-your-first-contract-interaction-no-co7","date":1751317925,"author":"Divine Igbinoba","guid":176943,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome back to our web3.py series! In <a href=\"https://dev.to/divine_igbinoba_fb6de7207/part-1-your-python-gateway-to-blockchain-getting-started-with-web3py-3aok\">Part 1</a>, we got our development environment set up and learned how to connect to an Ethereum node to read basic blockchain data like block numbers and gas prices.</p><p>Now, it's time to interact with smart contracts. These are the self-executing programs stored on the blockchain that power decentralised applications (dApps). Just like you interact with a web API to get data from a traditional server, you'll use web3.py to \"talk\" to smart contracts on the blockchain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Smart Contracts: The Programmable Building Blocks of&nbsp;Web3\n</h3><p>A smart contract is essentially a piece of code that lives on the blockchain. Once deployed, it runs exactly as programmed, without any possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference.</p><p>To interact with a smart contract from web3.py, you primarily need two pieces of information:</p><ol><li><p>: This is its unique location on the blockchain (e.g., 0xDE893...).</p></li><li><p><strong>The Contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface)</strong>: This is a JSON description of the contract's public functions and events. Think of the ABI as the \"instruction manual\" for your web3.py client.</p></li><li><p>It tells web3.py what functions the contract has, what arguments they take, and what values they return. Without the ABI, web3.py wouldn't know how to correctly encode your function calls or decode the contract's responses.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Your First Smart Contract: The Simple&nbsp;Counter\n</h3><p>To make this hands-on, we're going to use a super simple Counter smart contract. This contract will store a single number (count) and allow us to read its current value.</p><p>Here's the Solidity code for our Counter contract:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>A  variable, initialised to 0. The  keyword automatically creates a  getter function for us.</p></li><li><p>A  function, which is explicitly declared as . Both  and  are view functions, meaning they only read the contract's state and do not modify it.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Hands-On: Deploying Your Contract to Ganache (Skip the Faucet Frustration!)\n</h3><p>When I first started learning blockchain development, I spent countless hours hunting for free testnet tokens from faucets. Every time I ran out, it was another delay, another break in my learning flow. It consumed so much of my valuable learning time.</p><p>This is exactly why local development with Ganache is crucial. You get instant transactions, unlimited \"test Ether,\" and complete control over your environment. No more waiting for faucets, no more empty wallets interrupting your flow, just pure, uninterrupted learning.</p><p>In Part 1, we learned about connecting web3.py to your local Ganache blockchain. Now, we'll deploy our Counter.sol contract directly to that Ganache blockchain using Remix IDE. This ensures your Python script can interact with the contract you've deployed!</p><p>For this project, we will be using <a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Remix IDE</a> for easy development and deployment. While we'll start with Remix's built-in deployment features, we may explore deploying through code later.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-step guide to deploy your Counter contract to Ganache with&nbsp;Remix:\n</h3><p>: First, ensure your Ganache Desktop application is open and running. You should see its \"Quickstart\" workspace active, showing accounts and current blocks.</p><ul><li><p>On the left sidebar, click on the \"File Explorer\" icon (looks like a folder).</p></li><li><p>Under \"contracts\", click the \"Create new file\" icon (a blank paper with a plus sign).</p></li><li><p>Name the file  and press Enter.</p></li></ul><p><strong>4. Paste the Contract Code</strong>: Copy the Counter.sol code from above and paste it into the Counter.sol file in Remix.</p><p><strong>5. Compile the Contract and Get the ABI</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Click on the \"Solidity Compiler\" icon on the left sidebar (looks like a Solidity logo).</p></li><li><p>Ensure the \"Compiler\" version matches our  (e.g., 0.8.20).</p></li><li><p>Click on \"Advanced configurations\" (it might be a dropdown or expandable section)</p></li><li><p>From the \"EVM version\" dropdown, select \"Paris\".</p></li></ul><ul><li>  Click on the light blue \"Compile Counter.sol\" button.</li></ul><ul><li><p>You should see a green checkmark on the compiler icon if compilation is successful (as in the image above).</p></li><li><p>Now, scroll down within the Solidity Compiler tab until you see the \"ABI\" section (it might be a button or a copy icon next to the ABI output). Click the copy ABI button.</p></li></ul><p><strong>6. Connect Remix to Ganache (Environment Setup)</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Click on the \"Deploy &amp; Run Transactions\" icon on the left sidebar (just below that \"Solidity Compiler\" icon).</p></li><li><p>In the \"Environment\" dropdown, select \"Customize this list...\"</p></li></ul><ul><li>  Scroll down in the \"Environment Customization\" list until you see \"DEV --- GANACHE PROVIDER\". Check its checkbox.</li></ul><ul><li>  Click the \"Environment\" dropdown again. Now you'll see \"DEV --- GANACHE PROVIDER\" on the list --- click it.</li></ul><ul><li>  Remix will likely pop up a small window asking for the Ganache RPC endpoint. Copy your Ganache RPC URL from your Ganache application's \"Accounts\" section (it's typically  by default) and paste it into the Remix prompt. Then click \"OK\".</li></ul><p><strong>7. Deploy the Contract to Ganache</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>In Remix, ensure \"Counter\" is selected in the \"Contract\" dropdown.</p></li><li><p>Click the orange \"Deploy\" button.</p></li></ul><ul><li>  You should see a new transaction appear in your Ganache Desktop application under the \"Transactions\" tab, confirming the deployment.</li></ul><ul><li><p>After successful deployment, expand the \"Deployed Contracts\" section below the Deploy button in Remix. You'll see your Counter contract listed with its address (e.g., COUNTER AT 0x...).</p></li><li><p>Click the copy icon next to the address to save it. This is your .</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  In case you're wondering why we changed the Remix EVM to 'Paris' for&nbsp;Ganache...\n</h3><p>The 'EVM version' in Remix and the 'Hardfork' setting in Ganache both refer to specific versions of the Ethereum protocol. These different versions incorporate various updates, bug fixes, and new features.</p><p>For successful interaction and deployment, it's crucial that your chosen EVM version in Remix (which determines how your contract's bytecode is compiled) is compatible with the hardfork setting of your local Ganache blockchain. This ensures that the environment where your contract is compiled and the environment where it's deployed understand and execute the same set of rules. Setting Remix to 'Paris' generally provides good compatibility with recent Ganache versions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Reading Your Contract's Data with&nbsp;web3.py\n</h3><p>Now that you have your  and  from your Ganache deployment, let's update our  script to interact with it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Make sure you replace  and the content of  with the exact values you copied from Remix after deploying to Ganache!</p><p>Now, run your  script again:</p><p>You should see output similar to this, showing the initial count of 0:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Troubleshooting Common&nbsp;Issues\n</h3><p>If you encounter errors, here are the most common causes and solutions:</p><p><strong>\"Error interacting with contract\"</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Double-check that your  is correct and matches what you copied from Remix</p></li><li><p>Ensure your  is valid JSON (no trailing commas, proper quotes)</p></li><li><p>Verify that Ganache is still running on the same port</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Make sure Ganache Desktop is running</p></li><li><p>Check that the RPC URL in your  matches Ganache's RPC server URL</p></li><li><p>Go back to <a href=\"https://dev.to/divine_igbinoba_fb6de7207/part-1-your-python-gateway-to-blockchain-getting-started-with-web3py-3aok\">Part 1</a> to double-check your RPC setup if you're still having connection issues</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Contract addresses should start with  and be 42 characters total</p></li><li><p>Make sure you copied the entire address from Remix</p></li></ul><p>Congratulations! You've successfully:</p><ul><li><p>Deployed your very own smart contract to your local Ganache blockchain</p></li><li><p>Used web3.py to read data directly from a smart contract</p></li><li><p>Set up a complete local development environment for blockchain applications</p></li></ul><p>This is a fundamental step in building any dApp that needs to display information from the blockchain. You now understand how to bridge the gap between your Python application and smart contracts running on Ethereum.</p><p>In the next post, things get even more exciting! We'll learn how to:</p><ul><li><p>Change the state of our smart contract (increment that counter!)</p></li><li><p>Send transactions that modify blockchain data</p></li></ul><p>Get ready to truly interact with the blockchain by writing data, not just reading it!</p>","contentLength":7799,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gemini CLI and I created our first project together.","url":"https://dev.to/argenkiwi/gemini-cli-and-i-created-our-first-project-together-7b6","date":1751316568,"author":"Leandro","guid":176925,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Sell VPN as a SaaS Using VMmanager — Setup in 3 Steps","url":"https://dev.to/mateor404/how-to-sell-vpn-as-a-saas-using-vmmanager-setup-in-3-steps-13je","date":1751316434,"author":"Mateo Rivera","guid":176924,"unread":true,"content":"<p>With VMmanager, you can quickly create a new service for your customers by selling VPN servers using the SaaS model.

Install your favorite browser\n</h2><p>First step is easy: just install your favorite browser—Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera, Brave—whatever you feel comfortable using and offers developer tools you like.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Use a better Windows terminal\n</h2><p>If you're on Windows, you might know CMD or Git Bash. They're okay, but I highly recommend <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windows Terminal</a>. In newer versions of Windows, it might already be installed, and if not, you can download it from the Microsoft Store.</p><blockquote><p>If you're using another terminal and everything else works fine, feel free to keep using it. If not, consider switching.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Enable and Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)\n</h2><p>Once you open Windows Terminal, it defaults to PowerShell. Use it to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">install WSL</a>:</p><p>This installs Ubuntu by default and will prompt you to create a username and password. When typing the password, nothing will appear (no ), but it's being typed. Use a secure password—you’ll need it later.</p><p>Once installation is complete, restart your computer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Configure the default terminal\n</h2><p>After restarting, Windows Terminal will still open in PowerShell. Let’s change the default profile.</p><p>And set  as your default profile:</p><p>You’re now ready to use the Ubuntu terminal!</p><p>To navigate easily to your current folder in the Windows file explorer, use:</p><p>You’ll also find your Linux files under this path:</p><p>Install zsh and <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oh-my-zsh</a> to improve your terminal experience:</p><div><pre><code>sudo apt update\nsudo apt install zsh\n</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>You'll be prompted to enter your Ubuntu user password and confirm with .</p></blockquote><div><pre><code>sh curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh</code></pre></div><p>With this, you'll get tab completion, Git status indicators, and an overall better UX:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Install NVM and Node.js\n</h2><p>There are many ways to install Node.js, but the most professional one is using a version manager like <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nvm</a>. Sometimes you’ll need to switch between Node versions for different projects.</p><div><pre><code>curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre></div><p>If  isn’t recognized, just .</p><p>Then install the latest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LTS</a> (Long-Term Support) version:</p><blockquote><p>Always use the LTS version unless a project requires something else. You can check <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Node.js releases</a> for more info.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Set Up SSH Keys for GitHub\n</h2><p>To clone, pull, and push code from your GitHub account securely, it's better to use SSH instead of HTTPS.</p><div><pre><code>ssh-keygen  ed25519 </code></pre></div><p>You'll be prompted to enter a path and passphrase. You can leave both blank if you prefer:</p><div><pre><code> Enter file which to save the key /home/your_user/.ssh/id_your_key:[Press enter]\n Enter passphrase empty no passphrase: Type a passphrase]\n Enter same passphrase again: Type passphrase again]\n</code></pre></div><p>Then, follow <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this guide</a> to add the public key (id_your_key.pub) to your GitHub account.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Test Your SSH Connection to GitHub\n</h2><p>Clone a test repository to make sure your SSH setup works:</p><div><pre><code>git clone git@github.com:kevinccbsg/react-router-tutorial-devto.git\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code> The authenticity of host  can</code></pre></div><p>If you get a <strong>“Permission denied (publickey)”</strong> error, run:</p><div><pre><code>ssh-agent\nssh-add /home/your_user/.ssh/id_your_key\n</code></pre></div><p>To avoid doing this every time, add these lines to your  file.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to set your Git user details globally:</p><div><pre><code>git config  user.name \ngit config  user.email </code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  9.

This means it comes with everything you need to build a production-ready web application — from  to , all built-in and ready to use.</p><p>Whether you want to build a , an , a , or a , Django provides the tools and structure to make it happen efficiently and securely.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Django's Architecture: The MVT Pattern\n</h2><p>Django follows the <strong>Model-View-Template (MVT)</strong> pattern, which is Django's interpretation of the popular <strong>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</strong> pattern. Understanding this architecture is crucial to becoming proficient with Django.</p><p>MVT separates your application into , each with specific responsibilities:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.  – Your Data Layer\n</h3><p>Models represent your  and . They define:</p><ul><li>Database tables and their relationships\n</li><li>Data validation rules and constraints\n</li><li>Business logic methods that operate on your data\n</li><li>How data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated\n</li></ul><p>Think of models as the <strong>blueprint for your database</strong>.</p><p>If you're building a blog, your models might include:</p><ul><li> (for authors and readers)\n</li><li> (for reader feedback)\n</li><li> (for organizing posts)\n</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.  – Your Logic Layer\n</h3><p>Views handle the  of your application. They:</p><ul><li>Process user requests (, , etc.)\n</li><li>Interact with models to retrieve or modify data\n</li><li>Apply business rules and validation\n</li><li>Prepare data for presentation\n</li><li>Return responses to users\n</li></ul><p>Views are where the  in your application.</p><ul><li>Receive a request to display a blog post\n</li><li>Fetch the post data from the database\n</li><li>Check if the user has permission to view it\n</li><li>Prepare the data for the template\n</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.  – Your Presentation Layer\n</h3><p>Templates define how your data is . They:</p><ul><li>Display data in a user-friendly format\n</li><li>Handle the visual presentation of your application\n</li><li>Include conditional logic for dynamic content\n</li><li>Manage the HTML structure and styling\n</li></ul><p>Templates are responsible for the  of your application.</p><ul><li>Display a blog post with proper formatting\n</li><li>Show different content for logged-in vs. anonymous users\n</li><li>Include navigation menus and footers\n</li><li>Handle responsive design for different screen sizes </li></ul><p>Here's the typical flow of a Django application:</p><ol><li><p><p>\n(e.g., visits a page or submits a form)</p></p></li><li><p> directs the request to the appropriate </p></li><li><p><strong>View processes the request</strong> and interacts with  as needed</p></li><li><p><strong>Models handle data operations</strong><p>\n(e.g., database queries, validation, etc.)</p></p></li><li><p> and selects a </p></li><li><p><strong>Template renders the response</strong> using the provided data</p></li><li><p><strong>Response is sent back to the user</strong></p></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of This Separation of Concerns\n</h2><p>This structure makes your Django code:</p><ul><li>: Changes to one layer don't necessarily affect others\n</li><li>: You can test each layer independently\n</li><li>: Components can be reused across different parts of your application\n</li><li>: You can optimize each layer separately as your application grows\n</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Your Django Development Environment\n</h2><p>Django requires Python .</p><p>To check your Python version, run the following command:</p><div><pre><code>python \npython3 </code></pre></div><p>If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org. Make sure to check \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation on Windows.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment\n</h3><p>Virtual environments are essential for Python development.\nThey keep your project dependencies isolated from other projects and your system Python installation.</p><div><pre><code>my_first_django_project\nmy_first_django_project\n\npython  venv venv\n\nvenvcriptsctivate\nvenv/bin/activate\n</code></pre></div><p>You'll know the virtual environment is active when you see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt.</p><p>With your virtual environment activated, install Django:</p><div><pre><code>pip django\n\n\npython  django </code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Create Your First Django Project\n</h3><div><pre><code>\ndjango-admin startproject myproject\nmyproject\n\n\npython manage.py runserver\n</code></pre></div><p>Visit <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:8000/</a> in your browser. You should see the Django welcome page - congratulations! You've successfully set up Django.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Creating Your First Django App\n</h2><p>Django projects are composed of multiple \"apps\" — each handling a specific feature or functionality. This modular approach makes your code organized and reusable.</p><p>Run the following command in your terminal:</p><div><pre><code>python manage.py startapp blog\n</code></pre></div><p>This creates a new directory structure:</p><div><pre><code>blog/\n├── __init__.py\n├── admin.py\n├── apps.py\n├── models.py\n├── tests.py\n├── urls.py\n└── views.py\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Register Your App\n</h3><p>Open myproject/settings.py and add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list:</p><div><pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ,  </code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Django Development\n</h2><ul><li>Keep apps focused on specific functionality\n</li><li>Use meaningful names for models, views, and templates\n</li><li>Follow Django's naming conventions\n</li><li>Organize your project structure logically\n</li></ul><ul><li>Use database indexes for frequently queried fields\n</li><li>Optimize database queries using  and </li><li>Cache expensive operations\n</li><li>Use pagination for large datasets\n</li></ul><ul><li>Always validate user input\n</li><li>Use Django's built-in security features\n</li><li>Keep dependencies updated\n</li><li>Follow the principle of least privilege\n</li></ul><ul><li>Write tests for all your models, views, and forms\n</li><li>Use test-driven development (TDD) when possible\n</li><li>Test both happy paths and edge cases\n</li><li>Maintain good test coverage\n</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Your Django Journey Begins\n</h2><p>Django is a powerful, flexible framework that can handle projects of any size. From simple blogs to complex enterprise applications, Django provides the tools and structure you need to build robust web applications.</p><p>The key to mastering Django is understanding the MVT pattern and how the different components work together.

But a solid foundation is just the beginning. To build a truly <strong>scalable and maintainable</strong> automation suite, we need a strong architectural frame. That frame is an advanced, expressive type system.</p><p>This article is for the power user. We're moving beyond basic types to show you how to leverage TypeScript's advanced patterns to eliminate entire classes of bugs <strong>before you even run a single test</strong>.</p><p>You will learn five essential patterns for a world-class QA framework:</p><ul><li> To manage fixed sets of constants and prevent typos.</li><li> To write highly reusable, type-safe code like an API client.</li><li> To validate API responses at runtime and eliminate manual type definitions.</li><li> To create types directly from runtime objects.</li><li> To create flexible variations of existing types without duplicating code.</li></ul><p>Mastering these concepts will transform your framework from a simple collection of tests into a scalable, self-documenting, and resilient asset.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🤔 The Problem: The Hidden Costs of a \"Simple\" Framework\n</h3><p>When a framework is small, it's easy to keep it clean. But as it grows, \"simple\" solutions introduce hidden costs that make the codebase brittle and hard to maintain.</p><ul><li> Using raw strings like  or  for roles or request methods is a ticking time bomb. A single typo () creates a bug that TypeScript can't catch.</li><li> Writing a new fetch function for every API endpoint (, , ) creates a maintenance nightmare. A change to authentication logic requires updating dozens of files.</li><li> You manually write a TypeScript  for an API response. The API changes—a field is renamed or removed. Your tests still compile, but they fail at runtime because your types lied.</li><li> You use the same massive  type for both creating a new article and updating its title. This is confusing and inefficient.</li></ul><p>These small issues compound, leading to a framework that is difficult and scary to refactor.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ The Solution, Part 1: Enums for Rock-Solid Constants\n</h3><p>The fastest way to eliminate \"magic string\" bugs is with . An enum is a restricted set of named constants.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Brittle Way (Magic Strings)\n</h4><p>Imagine a function that assigns a role. A typo in the string will pass silently through TypeScript.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By defining a  enum, we force developers to choose from a valid list of options, giving us autocompletion and compile-time safety.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> If you have a fixed set of related strings, use an Enum.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 The Solution, Part 2: Generics for Maximum Reusability\n</h3><p> are arguably the most powerful feature for writing scalable code. They allow you to write functions that can work with any type, without sacrificing type safety. The perfect use case is a reusable API request function.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Repetitive Way (No Generics)\n</h4><p>Without generics, you'd end up writing nearly identical functions for every API endpoint.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Scalable Fix (A Generic Function)\n</h4><p>We can write one function, , that can fetch any resource and return a strongly-typed response. The magic is the  placeholder.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When we call this function, we specify what  should be.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛡️ The Solution, Part 3: Zod &amp; z.infer for End-to-End Safety\n</h3><p>We've solved code duplication. Now let's solve \"Type Drift.\" The ultimate source of truth for your data is the API itself.  is a TypeScript library which lets us create a schema that validates against the real API response at runtime, and  lets us create a compile-time TypeScript type from that same schema.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  One schema. Two benefits. Zero drift.\n</h4><p>First, define a schema for your API response. This is an actual JavaScript object that describes the shape of your data.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, use the magic of  to create a TypeScript type from the schema without any extra work.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, in your test, you use both. The Zod schema validates the live data, and the inferred type gives you autocomplete and static analysis.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ The Solution, Part 4: typeof &amp; Utility Types for Flexibility\n</h3><p>Sometimes you need types for simple, ad-hoc objects, or you need to create slight variations of existing types for things like API update payloads.</p><h4> Types from Runtime Objects\n</h4><p>If you have a constant object in your code, you can use  to create a type that perfectly matches its shape.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4> &amp; : Types from Other Types\n</h4><p>Using our  type from Zod, what if we want to update an article? We probably only need to send a few fields, not all of them.  let us create these variations on the fly.</p><ul><li>: Makes all fields in T optional.</li><li>: Creates a new type by picking a few keys K from T.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Your Mission: Build an Unbreakable Framework\n</h3><p>You are now equipped with the patterns used in the most robust, enterprise-grade test automation frameworks. Go back to your own project and look for opportunities to level up:</p><ol><li> Find any hardcoded strings (, , ) and replace them with .</li><li><strong>Schema-fy Your Endpoints:</strong> Choose your most critical API endpoint, write a  schema for it, and use  to generate the type. Apply it in a test.</li><li> Identify two or more repetitive functions (like API calls) and refactor them into a single, reusable generic function.</li><li> Look for  or  requests and use  like  or  to create precise, minimal payloads.</li></ol><p>Adopting these advanced patterns is the final step in turning your test framework from a simple tool into a powerful, scalable, and truly dependable engineering asset.</p>","contentLength":5318,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Core Attributes of Distributed Systems: Reliability, Availability, Scalability, and More","url":"https://dev.to/sachin_tolay_052a7e539e57/core-attributes-of-distributed-systems-reliability-availability-scalability-and-more-23p6","date":1751312488,"author":"Sachin Tolay","guid":176900,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Whether you’re building a simple web app or a large distributed system, users don’t just expect it to work → they want it to be fast, always available, secure, and to run smoothly without unexpected interruptions.</p><p>These expectations are captured in what we call <strong>system quality attributes</strong> or <strong>non-functional requirements</strong>.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore the most critical attributes that any serious system should aim to deliver, especially in distributed environments.

(perspective of pre-hooks React developer). La perspectiva presentada me pareció bastante intrigante. El autor comenta cómo los desarrolladores que comenzaron su viaje directamente con React tienden a depender en gran medida de custom hooks para diversas funcionalidades o .</p><p>Inicialmente, pensé que esta perspectiva podría ser subjetiva o limitada a los desarrolladores dentro del círculo del autor. Sin embargo, llegue a explorar esto más a fondo en Reddit, donde encontré otra publicación que planteaba <strong>\"Cuando es recomendable utilizar custom hooks\"</strong>. Para mi sorpresa, la mayoría de las opiniones fueron que siempre se debería utilizar.\nAsí que me pareció un tema muy interesante del que investigar, ademas de agregar ciertas opiniones personales y recomendaciones.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Primero que nada, ¿Cuál es la recomendación de&nbsp;React?\n</h2><p>Los Custom Hooks en React son funciones JavaScript que siguen una convención de nombre específica: deben comenzar con \"use\" (por ejemplo, useEffect, useState). Estas funciones permiten encapsular lógica compleja y reutilizable en componentes de React. Según la documentación oficial de React, los Custom Hooks están diseñados para compartir lógica entre componentes de React sin la necesidad de copiar y pegar código.\nCuando se trata de utilizar Custom Hooks, React sugiere seguir algunas prácticas recomendadas:</p><p>**1. Convención de Nombres: **Los Custom Hooks deben comenzar con la palabra \"use\" para que React pueda identificarlos y aplicar ciertas optimizaciones.</p><p><strong>2. Extraer Lógica Reutilizable:</strong> Utiliza Custom Hooks para extraer lógica que se repite en múltiples componentes. Esto ayuda a mantener un código más limpio y modular.</p><p>**3. No Introducir Estado Global: **Evita introducir estado global en Custom Hooks, ya que esto puede complicar la gestión del estado y llevar a efectos secundarios inesperados.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Entonces, ¿Cuando se recomienda utilizar Custom&nbsp;Hooks?\n</h2><p>Entonces una vez definido lo que es un custom hook podemos empezar a definir puntos claves y escenarios en los que podemos utilizarlos:</p><p> Cuando la lógica de un componente se vuelve demasiado compleja, extraerla en un custom hook puede mejorar la legibilidad y el mantenimiento. Al abstraer los detalles de implementación, los custom hooks permiten que los componentes se centren en sus responsabilidades principales, promoviendo una separación más clara de las preocupaciones. Por otro lado, no siempre es necesario o beneficioso utilizarlos.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando usar custom hooks: ✅</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos un componente UserList que muestra una lista de usuarios y realiza una llamada a una API para obtener los datos. La lógica de obtener los datos y manejar posibles errores se ha vuelto demasiado compleja y queremos abstraerla en un Custom Hook llamado useFetchUsers.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando no es necesario usar un custom hook: ❌</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos un componente LoginForm que maneja la autenticación de usuarios. La lógica de validación de datos y el manejo del estado del formulario se manejan fácilmente dentro del propio componente, y no hay necesidad de extraerla en un Custom Hook.</p><p>En este caso, la lógica del formulario de inicio de sesión es lo suficientemente simple como para ser manejada dentro del componente LoginForm sin la necesidad de utilizar un Custom Hook. La abstracción adicional podría introducir complejidad innecesaria y hacer que el código sea menos claro y mantenible.</p><p> Debería de considerarse el uso de custom hooks cuando se observe que la lógica se repite en varios componentes. Esta es una oportunidad perfecta para escribir un custom hook que encapsule esa lógica, haciendo que su código sea DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) y más fácil de mantener.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando usar custom hooks: ✅</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos dos componentes CounterA y CounterB que comparten la lógica para manejar el estado de un contador. La lógica de incremento, decremento y reinicio del contador se repite en ambos componentes. Es una oportunidad perfecta para crear un Custom Hook llamado useCounter que encapsule esta lógica.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando no es necesario usar un custom hook: ❌</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos dos componentes ProductList y Cart que muestran una lista de productos y un carrito de compras, respectivamente. Cada componente tiene una función fetchData que realiza una llamada a la API para obtener datos. Aunque la lógica de llamada a la API es similar en ambos componentes, no es necesario encapsularla en un Custom Hook, ya que la implementación de cada llamada puede diferir según el contexto.</p><p><strong>3. Compartir lógica entre componentes:</strong> Los custom hooks facilitan el intercambio de lógica entre componentes no relacionados. Esto es particularmente útil para implementar cuestiones transversales como la autenticación, la tematización o la internacionalización, asegurando la coherencia en toda la aplicación.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando usar custom hooks: ✅</strong>\nSupongamos que tenemos un componente Header que muestra un botón de inicio de sesión y un componente Sidebar que muestra el nombre de usuario una vez que el usuario ha iniciado sesión. Ambos componentes necesitan acceder al estado de autenticación y a las funciones para iniciar y cerrar sesión.</p><p>En este ejemplo, el Custom Hook useAuth encapsula la lógica de autenticación, permitiendo que los componentes Header y Sidebar compartan fácilmente la misma lógica sin acoplamiento directo.</p><p><strong>Ejemplo de cuando no es necesario usar un custom hook: ❌</strong></p><p>Supongamos que tenemos un componente Form que maneja la lógica de un formulario de registro de usuarios. La lógica específica del formulario, como la validación de campos y el envío de datos, es única para este componente y no se comparte con otros componentes en la aplicación.</p><p>En este caso, la lógica específica del formulario está completamente contenida dentro del componente Form. No hay necesidad de extraer esta lógica en un Custom Hook ya que no se comparte con otros componentes y no se beneficiaría de su reutilización. Mantener la lógica dentro del componente hace que el código sea más claro y mantenible en este contexto.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚠️ Usar custom hooks con cautela ⚠️ Recomendaciones Personales\n</h2><p>Ciertos puntos que recomiendo a tener en cuenta cuando se este trabajando con custom hooks:</p><p><strong>1. Optimización prematura:</strong> Importante resistir la tentación de crear custom hooks para cada pieza de lógica. La optimización prematura puede generar complejidad y abstracción innecesarias, lo que dificulta la comprensión y el mantenimiento del código. En lugar de ello, hay que favorecer a la simplicidad y la claridad hasta que los patrones de repetición surjan orgánicamente.</p><p>**2. Lógica específica del componente: **No toda la lógica garantiza la extracción en un custom hook. Si una parte de la lógica está estrechamente relacionada con un componente específico y es poco probable que se reutilice en otro lugar, puede ser más apropiado mantenerla dentro del propio componente, evitando abstracciones innecesarias.</p><p><strong>3. Custom hooks demasiado abstractos:</strong> Los custom hooks demasiado abstractos con demasiadas responsabilidades pueden volverse difíciles de manejar y de entender. Habrá que a apuntar a logica de responsabilidad única que encapsule inquietudes específicas, promoviendo la claridad y la Componentización.</p><p>Ahora que hemos revisado todos estos ejemplos, espero que esta vez si puedas elegir entre si es un caso valido para poder usar custom hooks o no, centrándonos en su propósito inicial de abstracción y reutilización de código.\nNo podemos quitar que los Custom Hooks han demostrado mucha importancia en el desarrollo actual de React, porque ofrecen una manera elegante y eficiente de compartir lógica entre componentes. Ya sea para abstraer lógica compleja, eliminar la repetición de código o facilitar el intercambio de funcionalidades entre componentes no relacionados.<p>\nPersonalmente, creo que es importante saber entender estos conceptos para saber cuándo mantener nuestra lógica en nuestros servicios y cuándo utilizarlos como Custom Hooks. Me considero muy fan de manejar la mayoría de la lógica como un servicio y solo utilizar Custom Hooks para casos específicos muy comunes, hooks comunes como:** useFocus, useWindowSize, useFormUpdate**. Estos son ejemplos de hooks que suelo usar con frecuencia en mis proyectos y que me ayudan a manejar cierta lógica compartida entre componentes.</p></p><p>En otro blog podríamos profundizar en cómo implementar estos hooks si te parece interesante 🎯</p>","contentLength":8663,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Set Up a Cloudflared Tunnel on Your Homelab","url":"https://dev.to/tan1193/how-to-set-up-a-cloudflared-tunnel-on-your-homelab-27ao","date":1751310744,"author":"Tan","guid":176894,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Want to expose your private service to the world without revealing your real IP?

Consider a financial institution needing to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time from a stream of billions of events, while simultaneously performing complex risk analysis on historical data. Traditional batch processing falls short, and naive streaming solutions often struggle with state management and fault tolerance. This is where Apache Spark, and its ecosystem, become indispensable. </p><p>Spark isn’t a replacement for all other Big Data tools; it’s a crucial component within a broader architecture. Modern data platforms often integrate Spark with data lakes (S3, ADLS, GCS), stream processing engines (Kafka, Kinesis), data warehousing solutions (Snowflake, BigQuery), and metadata management tools (Hive Metastore, AWS Glue Data Catalog). The key drivers for adopting Spark are its ability to handle large-scale data processing with reasonable latency, its support for diverse workloads (batch, streaming, ML), and its relatively mature ecosystem.  Data volumes routinely exceed petabytes, velocity demands near-real-time insights, and schema evolution is constant.  Query latency requirements range from seconds for interactive dashboards to minutes for complex reporting. Cost-efficiency is paramount, demanding optimized resource utilization.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Spark in Big Data Systems?\n</h2><p>From a data architecture perspective, Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides a distributed computing framework that allows for parallel processing of data across a cluster of machines.  Unlike Hadoop MapReduce, Spark performs in-memory computation, significantly accelerating iterative algorithms and interactive queries. </p><p>Spark’s role varies depending on the use case. It can be used for data ingestion (reading from various sources), storage (through its resilient distributed datasets - RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets), processing (transforming and enriching data), querying (using Spark SQL), and even governance (integrating with metadata catalogs). </p><p>Key technologies underpinning Spark include:</p><ul><li> Parquet and ORC are the dominant columnar storage formats due to their efficient compression and schema evolution capabilities. Avro is often used for schema-on-read scenarios.</li><li> Kryo serialization is preferred over Java serialization for its performance and compact representation.</li><li> Spark uses a custom RPC protocol for communication between nodes, optimized for high throughput and low latency.</li><li> Spark’s DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) scheduler optimizes job execution by breaking down tasks into stages and scheduling them across the cluster.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Change Data Capture (CDC) Ingestion:</strong>  Spark Streaming (or Structured Streaming) is used to consume change events from databases (using Debezium or similar tools) and incrementally update a data lake. This enables near-real-time data synchronization.</li><li>  Processing a continuous stream of clickstream data from a website, enriching it with user profile information, and aggregating it into hourly dashboards.</li><li> Joining massive datasets (e.g., customer transactions with product catalogs) to generate personalized recommendations.  This often requires careful partitioning and broadcast joins.</li><li><strong>Schema Validation &amp; Data Quality:</strong>  Using Spark to validate data against predefined schemas and data quality rules, flagging anomalies and ensuring data integrity.</li><li>  Building and executing feature engineering pipelines for machine learning models, transforming raw data into features suitable for training and prediction.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  System Design &amp; Architecture\n</h2><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Data Sources (Kafka, S3, DBs)] --&gt; B(Spark Streaming/Batch);\n    B --&gt; C{Data Lake (S3, ADLS, GCS)};\n    C --&gt; D[Metadata Catalog (Hive, Glue)];\n    D --&gt; E[Query Engines (Spark SQL, Presto, Athena)];\n    E --&gt; F[BI Tools &amp; Applications];\n    B --&gt; G[ML Feature Store];\n    G --&gt; H[ML Models];\n</code></pre></div><p>This diagram illustrates a common architecture.

When shoppers arrive at your store facing hundreds or thousands of products, they expect one thing above all: to find what they want quickly. If your site navigation or filters frustrate them, they will abandon their cart without hesitation.</p><p>Navigation isn’t just about menus and links. It is a carefully planned structure that guides users to their target products while also encouraging them to explore related or trending items. In the fast-paced world of fashion, where new styles emerge each season, this challenge becomes even more critical.</p><p>Let’s explore how to design user-centric filters and navigation for large-scale fashion catalogs, covering UX best practices, frontend frameworks to support dynamic updates, and the power of search and recommendations. Along the way, I’ll highlight a real-world example of a  page that demonstrates these principles in practice.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Smart Navigation Drives Conversions\n</h2><p>Your site’s navigation structure directly affects your bottom line. According to the Baymard Institute, 21% of users will abandon their purchase if site navigation is too complicated. In fashion, where choice overload is common, this risk is even higher.</p><ul><li>: The faster customers find something they like, the more likely they’ll complete their purchase.\n</li><li>: Good navigation introduces shoppers to complementary or trending products.\n</li><li>: A seamless journey signals professionalism and reliability.</li></ul><p>When filters like size, color, price, or style are missing or hard to use, shoppers will bounce. A thoughtful, tested filter design can dramatically boost your conversion rates.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  UX Best Practices for Fashion Filters\n</h2><p>Let’s break down the components of an effective, user-centered filter system:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Prioritize Relevant Filters\n</h3><p>Fashion shoppers almost always look for:</p><ul><li>Category (dresses, suits, kurtas, etc.)</li></ul><p>Show these prominently above less essential attributes like pattern or embellishment. Especially on mobile, putting key filters first makes a big difference in usability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Support Multi-Select and Easy Deselect\n</h3><p>Users frequently want to explore multiple options at once — for example, “red” and “blue” dresses in size M within a ₹2000–₹4000 budget. Your filters should:</p><ul><li>Support multi-select within a facet\n</li><li>Show active filter chips so customers know what’s applied\n</li><li>Allow deselecting individual filters without starting over</li></ul><p>Modern frontend libraries like Redux (React) or Pinia (Vue) are great for managing this state efficiently.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Visual Elements Where Helpful\n</h3><p>Colors are best shown as swatches, not text labels. Likewise, thumbnails for patterns or materials help shoppers scan faster and with fewer mistakes.</p><p>A single “Clear all filters” button is essential. Many users will change their minds during exploration, and this gives them a quick fresh start.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Maintain Filter Persistence\n</h3><p>Filters shouldn’t disappear if a user goes back or reloads the page. You can persist their choices via URL query parameters or local storage, depending on your framework, to reduce frustration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Category Navigation\n</h2><p>Beyond filters, your main navigation needs to guide customers clearly and logically:</p><p>Broad top-level groups work best:</p><ul><li>Women\n\n<ul></ul></li></ul><p>Avoid too many deep subcategories at the top. Mega-menus on desktop and collapsible accordions on mobile usually deliver a smoother experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Highlight Seasonal or Trend-Based Sections\n</h3><p>Since fashion changes constantly, you should create clear entry points for shoppers to discover the newest products. Labels like , , or  immediately orient customers.  </p><p>If you call it “Kurtas” today, don’t rename it “Tunic Dresses” tomorrow. Consistent labels build trust and make return visits easier for customers to navigate.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Add Breadcrumbs and Quick Back\n</h3><p>Breadcrumbs are crucial in large catalogs. Combined with a “Back to Results” button on product pages, they give shoppers an easy way to retrace their steps without losing filter selections.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Frontend Frameworks to Power Dynamic Navigation\n</h2><p>A powerful, user-friendly filter and navigation system needs a robust frontend foundation. Here’s what developers typically lean on:</p><ul><li>: Excellent for component-driven product lists, with a mature ecosystem.\n</li><li>: Lightweight and flexible, good for faster experimentation.\n</li><li>: Optimized for server-side rendering and SEO, perfect for large catalogs.\n</li><li>: Vue’s answer to Next.js, also great for server-side performance.\n</li><li>: Works best in larger enterprise projects, though less common for fashion.</li></ul><p>State management is also vital for filters:</p><ul><li>Zustand or Jotai (React lightweight)\n</li></ul><p>Headless CMS solutions like Strapi, Sanity, or Contentful help merchants update seasonal categories and filters without a developer’s constant intervention.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Optimizing Search and Recommendations\n</h2><p>Search is the highest-converting navigation feature you have. Shoppers who search generally convert 2–3 times more than those who only browse.</p><p>Here’s what to prioritize:</p><p>Handle typos and partial matches gracefully. Algolia or Elasticsearch do this well even for massive product databases.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Semantic Understanding\n</h3><p>Search should interpret “blue suit set” as color + category, not just a keyword string. That means indexing metadata (color, pattern, style) separately.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Autocomplete Suggestions\n</h3><p>Show trending or recent terms in autocomplete results to guide discovery faster.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Personal Recommendations\n</h3><p>Add blocks like “You may also like” based on:</p><ul><li>Trending or seasonal products\n</li></ul><p>You can build this with collaborative filtering or simpler rule-based systems depending on your resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Engineering for Performance\n</h2><p>Large catalogs put a lot of strain on the frontend. Here’s how to keep things fast:</p><ul><li>Use infinite scroll or pagination wisely\n</li><li>Serve critical CSS upfront\n</li><li>Use modern image CDNs with WebP/AVIF</li></ul><p>Next.js with incremental static regeneration is a great way to update “New Arrivals” pages without a full rebuild, which is especially important during seasonal product drops.</p><p>Fashion is a fast-changing vertical. That means your navigation and filters should be flexible and open to change. Keep track of:</p><ul><li>Usability test results (every few months)\n</li><li>Analytics on which filters are most used\n</li><li>New categories based on current trends</li></ul><p>Personalizing filter orders or category placements for returning shoppers is a great next-level investment if you have the data to support it.</p><p>Designing user-focused filters and intuitive navigation is essential for large, ever-changing fashion catalogs. From logical hierarchies and persistent filters to well-built search and fast-loading pages, each piece supports the customer’s mission: finding their style, with confidence, in less time.</p><p>If you want a practical inspiration for a well-designed, seasonal  section with thoughtful categories and filters, you can check out <a href=\"https://www.juniperwholesale.com/categories/new-arrivals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this real-world implementation</a>.</p><p>Keep testing, keep listening to your shoppers, and keep evolving — because in fashion, great UX never goes out of style.</p>","contentLength":7195,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"让Cloud code更加自动化的执行任务，减少授权请求","url":"https://dev.to/dragon72463399/rang-cloud-codegeng-jia-zi-dong-hua-de-zhi-xing-ren-wu-jian-shao-shou-quan-qing-qiu-5h2","date":1751305718,"author":"drake","guid":176842,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tune LLM(Groq Model Tune Technique's)","url":"https://dev.to/sujeet_saxena_60b0b6a01e2/tune-llmgroq-model-tune-techniques-4ma9","date":1751305703,"author":"Sujeet Saxena","guid":176841,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Tune of Groq LLM, Its important to first understand:</p><p>.

At a glance looking at all of the APIs in React, it's a lot to grok in:-</p><ul><li>Server components &amp; Client components</li><li>Higher Order Component/Component Composition</li><li>Concurrent Rendering (React Fibre)  - UI updates are interruptable</li></ul><p>Those who has been doing React for years they know about how painful it was before even  was a thing. Just look at below image and see the difference. 😱😱</p><p>From creating the  to adding and updating the  via  syntax within the component, it was just too much boilerplate to write and maintain for the developers. On top of it the UI rendering was synchronous(means UI updates were blocking).</p><p>Enough of the introduction, let's focus on the topic that we are here for.</p><p>Before , we were used to create states within our  in Class component. And for modifying it, we needed to understand about  keyword. </p><p>And to solve all of the issues in existing eco-system of React, React Team from Meta(formerly know as Facebook) introduced the  in  release and which was a banger. It took away all of the boiler-plate code and made our component much simpler to write and maintain.</p><p> release was a shift toward the new  for writing React. Now we did not have to use , no  syntax anymore and we could use just simple javascript function and directly return our  as value. Pretty neet huh!!!  </p><p>But wait there's a catch,  can only recieve  and return , no state, no UI update, no interaction in our application. Just static UI!!</p><p>Basically  are stateless, they don't have any kind of state creation functionality within them.</p><p>So to make our component stateful or to add state within them, we have !!!. Yes you read it right.</p><p>Basically  are simple  which may return some values, which can be used within our Functional component and add make our component stateful. </p><p>So now we have understanding about hooks.

As readers, we’re drawn to experiences that feel intuitive, seamless, and, above all, human. That’s where a design-first content strategy comes in, and why UX writing is more than just a buzzword—it’s the secret sauce behind truly engaging digital experiences.\nWhat Does “Design-First” Really Mean?<p>\nWhen we talk about a design-first approach, we’re not just referring to how things look. It’s about how content and design work together to guide, inform, and delight users. It’s the difference between a website that feels like a maze and one that feels like a well-lit path.</p>\nA design-first content strategy means thinking about the user’s journey from the very beginning. It’s about asking:<p>\nWhat does the reader need at this moment?</p>\nHow can we make information clear, accessible, and actionable?<p>\nWhere might confusion or friction arise, and how can we smooth it out?</p>\nThe Role of UX Writing in Reader Engagement<p>\nUX writing is the connective tissue between design and content. It’s the microcopy on buttons, the helpful error messages, the onboarding flows that make new tools feel familiar. But it’s also the tone, the clarity, and the empathy that make users feel understood.</p>\nWhen UX writing is done well, readers don’t notice it—they just feel guided and empowered. When it’s done poorly, frustration creeps in, and engagement drops.\nThink about the last time you signed up for a new app. Did the instructions make sense? Did you know what to do next? If so, you probably have a UX writer to thank. If not, you might have abandoned the process altogether.<p>\nPractical Tips for a Design-First Content Strategy</p>\nCollaborate Early and Often<p>\nBring writers, designers, and developers together from the start. Content shouldn’t be an afterthought—it should shape the design.</p>\nPrioritize Clarity Over Cleverness<p>\nIt’s tempting to be witty, but clarity always wins. Make sure every word serves a purpose.</p>\nTest with Real Users<p>\nWatch how people interact with your content. Where do they hesitate? What questions do they have? Use these insights to refine your approach.</p>\nEmbrace Iteration<p>\nGreat UX writing is never finished. Keep refining based on feedback and analytics.</p>\nThe Takeaway<p>\nA design-first content strategy isn’t just about making things look good—it’s about making them work for real people. By weaving UX writing into every stage of the process, we can create experiences that don’t just inform, but truly engage.</p>\nLet’s put the user at the heart of our content—and watch engagement soar.</p>","contentLength":2618,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Your CRM is Holding Your Data Hostage.

Most modern CRMs are designed to keep your data siloed, not to serve you better, but to make the thought of leaving a logistical nightmare.</p><p><strong>It's time to challenge that model.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A New Philosophy: Powerful, Open, and Truly&nbsp;Yours\n</h2><p>What if your CRM wasn't a recurring bill you had to fight, but a permanent asset you controlled? Imagine a platform built on a different philosophy.</p><p>This is <a href=\"https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, a robust, modern CRM that rewrites the rules. It's built on four key principles:</p><ul><li>👑 : You can self-host it on your own servers, giving you complete control and sovereignty over your data. It's yours. Really.</li><li>💸 : The open-source software license is free. Your only costs are for the server you run it on and any maintenance. This means no arbitrary price hikes or paying extra just to export your own information via an API.</li><li>🔗 : A system should connect seamlessly with your existing tools and workflows, not force you into its closed ecosystem. Because it's open-source, Twenty can be integrated with anything.</li><li>❤️ : It's backed by a growing open-source community dedicated to building a better, more transparent future for business software.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Your New Superpowers: What You Can Actually&nbsp;Do\n</h2><p>Okay, so you own the platform. But is it powerful? Absolutely. Twenty is designed for modern business needs, allowing you to:</p><ul><li>🎨 : Create the exact views you need with advanced filters, sorting, grouping, and dynamic kanban and table views.\n</li></ul><ul><li><p>🔧 : Don't let your CRM dictate your process. Customize objects and fields to perfectly match how your business operates.</p></li><li><p>🔐 <strong>Manage Permissions with Ease</strong>: Create and manage custom roles to control precisely who can see and do what across the platform.</p></li><li><p>🤖 : Put repetitive tasks on autopilot with powerful triggers and actions, freeing up your team to focus on what matters.</p></li><li><p>✉️ : Seamlessly manage emails, calendar events, files, notes, and more — all linked to your customer records.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Easy Button: Get Started Without the&nbsp;Headache\n</h2><p>The idea of \"self-hosting\" might sound technical, but it doesn't have to be a barrier. You don't need to be a developer to unlock this freedom.</p><p>An expert team at  can do it all for you. Teknuro specializes in seamless integrations. They can install your Twenty CRM, migrate your data from your old system, and connect it to other essential tools like your ERP, ensuring a smooth transition.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Your Data, Your Rules.&nbsp;Period.\n</h2><p>Stop renting your customer relationships.

While I haven’t focused much on tools like PySpark or Hadoop, I’ve been deeply involved in handling large-scale data using Parquet files, performing data cleaning, designing robust pipelines, and deploying data workflows in a modular and scalable way.</p><p>Though my core expertise lies in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I’ve also taken on the role of a Data Engineer for several years, working across backend systems and real-time pipelines.</p><p>I'm happy to be part of this community, and I look forward to sharing more technical insights and learning from all of you.</p><p>Let’s dive into the world of Data Engineering!</p><h3><strong>What is Data Engineering?</strong></h3><p>Data Engineering is a critical discipline within the broader data ecosystem that focuses on building and maintaining the architecture, pipelines, and systems necessary for the collection, storage, and processing of large volumes of data. It is the foundation that supports data science, analytics, and machine learning operations. At its core, data engineering deals with designing robust and scalable systems that move data from various sources into forms that are usable by downstream applications.</p><p>A data engineer is responsible for ensuring that data is not only collected but also cleaned, structured, and made available in a timely manner. This involves a strong understanding of databases, distributed systems, scripting, and workflow orchestration tools. It is not a one-size-fits-all role; depending on the scale and nature of the organization, a data engineer might wear many hats—ranging from data ingestion and transformation to cloud infrastructure setup and pipeline optimization.</p><p>A central task in data engineering is the implementation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines.</p><p>ETL is the traditional method where data is first extracted from source systems such as transactional databases, APIs, or flat files. It is then transformed—cleaned, aggregated, and reshaped—before being loaded into a destination system, often a data warehouse. This approach works well when transformation is done outside the warehouse, especially when transformation logic is complex or the warehouse is compute-constrained.</p><p>On the other hand, ELT has gained popularity with the rise of cloud-native data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. In ELT, raw data is loaded directly into the warehouse, and all transformations are performed post-load. This method benefits from the massive parallelism and compute power of modern data warehouses and keeps raw data accessible for reprocessing.</p><h3><strong>Working with Data Lakes (IBM Cloud Object Storage)</strong></h3><p>A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store all structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale. Unlike a data warehouse that requires predefined schemas, data lakes support schema-on-read, allowing more flexibility for exploration and modeling. Schema definitions are more important to maintain the folder structure, it is even more important in Parquet files to define schema in a proficient way.</p><p>IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) is a popular choice for building data lakes, especially in hybrid cloud environments. It offers durability, scalability, and support for open data formats like Parquet and ORC. Engineers often use IBM COS as a staging ground for raw and processed data before it is ingested into analytics or machine learning workflows.</p><p>In practice, data engineers use services like IBM COS to store logs, streaming data, and backup files. The stored data is accessed using Python libraries such as  or .</p><p><strong>Accesssing COS Bucket technically:</strong></p><div><pre><code>import ibm_boto3\nfrom ibm_botocore.client import Config\n\ncos = ibm_boto3.client(\"s3\",\n    ibm_api_key_id=\"API_KEY\",\n    ibm_service_instance_id=\"SERVICE_ID\",\n    config=Config(signature_version=\"oauth\"),\n    endpoint_url=\"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud\"\n)\n\n# List files in a bucket\ncos.list_objects_v2(Bucket=\"my-bucket\")['Contents']\n</code></pre></div><h3><strong>Pandas, SQL, Parquet, DuckDB, and PyArrow</strong></h3><p>Data engineering often involves working with various tools and formats for transformation and storage. Here’s how these technologies fit into a typical stack:</p><ul><li><p>: A go-to Python library for data manipulation, ideal for small to medium datasets. While not optimal for big data, it is excellent for rapid prototyping and local transformations.</p></li><li><p>: Structured Query Language remains a cornerstone of data transformations. Whether running in PostgreSQL, Snowflake, or embedded systems like DuckDB, SQL is used to clean, join, filter, and aggregate data.</p></li><li><p>: A columnar storage format that supports efficient querying and compression. It is widely used for storing processed datasets in data lakes due to its performance benefits in analytics.</p></li><li><p>: An in-process SQL OLAP database that can query Parquet files directly without loading them into memory. It allows data engineers to write complex SQL queries on large datasets stored in files, making it excellent for fast, local experimentation.</p></li><li><p>: A Python binding for Apache Arrow, enabling efficient serialization of data between systems. PyArrow is used under the hood by many libraries (including Pandas and DuckDB) to enable zero-copy reads and writes, boosting performance.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these tools form a powerful suite for local and scalable data processing. A typical use case might involve reading a Parquet file from IBM COS using PyArrow, manipulating it with Pandas or DuckDB, and exporting it to a data warehouse via an ELT pipeline.</p><p><strong>Why DuckDB is a Better Fit Than Modin or Vaex for Large-Scale Data Processing</strong></p><p>Using DuckDB over Modin or Vaex is often a more robust and scalable approach when working with large datasets—particularly in Parquet format. DuckDB is highly efficient at processing queries directly on disk without loading the full dataset into memory. Attempting to perform complex operations like correlation or aggregations directly on massive in-memory dataframes is not only memory-intensive but can also be error-prone or slow. A better pattern is to convert the DataFrame to Parquet and use DuckDB to query and process the data efficiently. This offers both speed and scalability in a single-node environment.</p><p>Moreover, complex operations like <strong>joins, filters, aggregations</strong>, and  are optimized inside DuckDB’s vectorized execution engine. It handles query planning and execution more efficiently than the implicit operations in Modin or Vaex, which often delegate tasks to backends like Dask or rely on caching in RAM.</p><h3><strong>Some basic code level Implementations</strong></h3><p>Certainly! Here's a concise yet informative overview of the <strong>NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data</strong> dataset you're using:</p><h3><strong>Dataset Overview: NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records (2023)</strong></h3><p>The <strong>NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Dataset</strong> is a public dataset provided by the <strong>New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC)</strong>. It contains detailed records of individual taxi trips taken in NYC, collected directly from the taxi meters and GPS systems.</p><p>For this example, we're using data from:</p><blockquote><p>\nParquet File URL:<code>https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2023-01.parquet</code></p></blockquote><div><table><tbody><tr><td>ID of the taxi provider (1 or 2)</td></tr><tr><td>Timestamp when the trip started</td></tr><tr><td>Timestamp when the trip ended</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Distance of the trip in miles</td></tr><tr><td>Rate type (standard, JFK, Newark, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>If trip record was stored and forwarded due to loss of signal</td></tr><tr><td>Type of payment (credit card, cash, etc.)</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Additional charges (e.g., peak hour)</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Tolls charged during trip</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Total charged to the passenger</td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul><li><strong>~7 to 10 million rows per month</strong></li><li>File size ranges from  in  format</li><li>Data is stored in a , making it efficient for analytics</li></ul><ol><li>Trip duration calculation</li><li>Average fare per distance bucket</li></ol><div><pre><code>import duckdb\n\n# Connect DuckDB\ncon = duckdb.connect()\n\nparquet_url = \"https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2023-01.parquet\"\n</code></pre></div><p><strong><em>1.

Apache Airflow solves this by allowing engineers to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using Python.</p><p>Airflow supports task dependencies, scheduling, retries, logging, and alerting out-of-the-box. Each task in Airflow is executed by an operator. For instance, a  might run a transformation script, while a  could trigger a shell script to ingest data.</p><p>A typical Airflow pipeline might look like this:</p><ol><li>Pull data from an API using a Python script.</li><li>Load the raw data into IBM Cloud Object Storage.</li><li>Run a DuckDB transformation on the stored Parquet files.</li><li>Export the clean data into a data warehouse.</li><li>Trigger a Slack or email notification on completion.</li></ol><p>Airflow's extensibility, combined with its scheduling and monitoring features, makes it the default choice for modern data engineering teams.</p><p>Data Engineering is both a foundation and a force multiplier for modern analytics and AI systems. From building reliable ETL/ELT pipelines to managing petabytes of data in cloud storage, the role demands a mix of software engineering, data modeling, and system design skills.</p><p>As the data landscape evolves, so do the tools and techniques. Technologies like DuckDB and PyArrow are transforming how we process data locally, while orchestrators like Airflow and cloud platforms like IBM COS make it easier to scale and automate data workflows. A successful data engineer needs to stay deeply technical, understand the underlying principles, and always design systems with scalability, reliability, and maintainability in mind.</p>","contentLength":11568,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Entity Framework ou Dapper ?","url":"https://dev.to/daniloopinheiro/entity-framework-ou-dapper--4a2m","date":1751298103,"author":"Danilo O.

It turns out I’m not alone, studies show static analysis tools alone can detect up to 70% of potential code defects. Even more impressively, advanced AI code-review systems claim to catch around 90% of common issues. Intriguing, right?</p><p>By combining the right tools, from AI-driven code review to automated tests and monitoring, I managed to boost the number of bugs we catch before release by roughly 70%.</p><p>I started embedding Entelligence’s real-time AI reviewer directly in my IDE and immediately saw results. It’s like having a savvy teammate checking my code as I type. In fact, the makers of <a href=\"https://dub.sh/L1Iq9Jv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Entelligence</a> boast that this IDE integration “helps you catch bugs and improve code quality instantly”. The AI flags issues and even suggests fixes before I commit to GitHub. Because it supports dozens of languages, I could use it across our whole stack (<a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JavaScript</a>, Java, etc.). Using Entelligence, I routinely caught subtle logic and design flaws early, massively cutting down the number of defects slipping into code reviews or production.</p><p>Next, I set up SonarQube scans as part of our build. SonarQube is a static analysis tool that “detects bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells” across 29+ languages. Whenever new code is pushed, SonarQube’s automated quality gate kicks in, highlighting issues immediately. This makes clean-up proactive: developers fix unsafe patterns or unused variables before merging. In practice, we found this was powerful – it turns out static analysis can catch roughly 70% of defects before runtime. By addressing these flagged issues in SonarQube early, our team drastically reduced the trivial bugs that used to blow up later, improving overall code reliability and maintainability.</p><p>I also overhauled our CI/CD pipelines (using Jenkins/GitHub Actions) to run thorough test suites on every commit. Now, each pull request triggers automated unit and integration tests (JUnit, Jest, etc.) along with the static scans. This meant catching bugs the moment they appear. Tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions “trigger automated unit tests after each code commit,” effectively catching software bugs at the early stages of development. </p><p>In my experience, this CI-driven testing caught countless edge cases and regressions right away – issues that otherwise would have reached QA or production. Automating tests in the pipeline has not only stopped obvious bugs (like broken API responses) from merging, but also given me quick feedback so my team can fix defects immediately.</p><p>Despite all the up-front checks, some bugs inevitably slipped through – that’s where Sentry came in. Sentry is an application monitoring and error-tracking tool that automatically captures exceptions, crashes, and slowdowns in real time. In practice it was a lifesaver: once Sentry was integrated, I began seeing every production and staging error with full context. </p><p>As one summary puts it, “Sentry helps engineering teams identify and fix bugs faster by automatically capturing exceptions, crashes, and … performance transactions”. Using Sentry, whenever an error popped up in our distributed services, I got notified immediately with stack traces. This meant catching user-impacting bugs instantly (often before customers even noticed) and reducing downtime. Today Sentry is used by 100,000+ organizations, and it’s been a huge help in making sure no runtime bug goes unnoticed.</p><p>Finally, I wouldn’t ignore the basics: linting and type-checking tools. Linters like ESLint (for JavaScript) or Pylint (for Python) automatically scan code for common mistakes or style issues as you write. These tools “automate checking of source code for programmatic errors”. In fact, using lint tools can “reduce errors and improve overall quality” by forcing developers to fix mistakes earlier. We also gradually converted key modules to TypeScript and enabled strict mode. The result was that trivial bugs (like undefined variables or wrong function calls) were caught by the compiler or linter before testing even began. By treating linter warnings as errors in CI, I eliminated a huge number of small bugs and inconsistencies up-front.</p><p>Each of these tools tackles bugs at different stages – from writing code to shipping it – and together they formed a safety net across our entire stack. The combined effect was clear: our bug count dropped dramatically.</p><p><em>In the enterprise world, delivering quality code is non-negotiable, and skipping any of these tools leaves gaps.</em></p><p>Don’t miss out on Entelligence for instant AI feedback, SonarQube for deep static scans, CI pipelines with automated tests for early regression checks, Sentry for runtime visibility, or good old linters/type checking for first-line defense. Adopting all of them means catching issues at every step. I’ve seen it personally. Ready to up your quality game? Start integrating these tools today and watch those elusive bugs vanish.</p><p><em>Let me know if you use any tool in the same space in the comment section below!!!</em></p>","contentLength":5105,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tricky javascript codes part 3","url":"https://dev.to/md_ashraf_dev_to/tricky-javascript-codes-part-3-1mkh","date":1751293800,"author":"MD ASHRAF","guid":176728,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>We have 3 nested boxes (box1, box2, box3).

Often split into ITLB and DTLB.</li><li> To provide the fastest possible address translation for frequently accessed pages, minimizing latency for the most critical memory operations.</li><li> Very low (e.g., 0.5-1 clock cycle).</li></ul></li><li><strong>L2 TLB (Level 2 TLB) / Last-Level TLB (LLTLB or STLB - Second-Level TLB):</strong><ul><li> Larger and slower than L1 TLBs, but still much faster than accessing page tables in main memory. It might be unified or shared among multiple cores.</li><li> To handle TLB misses from the L1 TLB, providing a larger capacity to store translations for a wider range of pages, thus reducing the number of times the system needs to walk the page tables in main memory.</li><li> When an L1 TLB miss occurs, the L2 TLB is checked. If found, it's still a TLB hit, but with slightly higher latency than an L1 hit.</li><li> The L2 TLB aims to have a very high hit rate to prevent page table walks.</li></ul></li></ul><ol><li>When the CPU generates a virtual address, it first checks the L1 TLB.</li><li>If there's an L1 TLB hit, the physical address is returned quickly, and the memory access proceeds.</li><li>If there's an L1 TLB miss, the request is forwarded to the L2 TLB.</li><li>If there's an L2 TLB hit, the physical address is retrieved from the L2 TLB, and the L1 TLB is updated with this translation (often, the newly accessed entry is brought into L1).</li><li>If there's an L2 TLB miss (a \"full TLB miss\"), then the MMU (Memory Management Unit) or the operating system (depending on whether it's hardware-managed or software-managed) must walk the page tables in main memory to find the translation. This is the slowest scenario, incurring a significant \"miss penalty\" (10-100 clock cycles or more). Once the translation is found, it's typically loaded into both the L1 and L2 TLBs for faster future access.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  10.

It involves a combination of skills, mindset, and strategies to build strong relationships, contribute effectively, and grow professionally. Whether you're a new employee or a seasoned professional, these tips will help you succeed in any workplace environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>Understand the Company Culture</strong></h2><p>Every company has its own unique culture, values, and way of doing things. Take the time to observe and learn the unwritten rules. Are meetings formal or casual? Is collaboration encouraged, or is independent work valued more? Aligning yourself with the company culture shows that you’re adaptable and committed to fitting in while still bringing your unique perspective.</p><ul><li>: Ask questions during onboarding and pay attention to how colleagues interact. If your company has a mission statement or core values, familiarize yourself with them and reflect those in your work.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. </h2><p>Clear and concise communication is key to building trust and avoiding misunderstandings. Whether you're sending an email, presenting in a meeting, or chatting with a coworker, ensure your message is well-articulated and respectful.</p><ul><li>: Practice active listening. When someone speaks, focus on understanding their point of view before responding. This builds stronger connections and shows that you value others’ input.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. <strong>Set Clear Goals and Prioritize Tasks</strong></h2><p>Success in a company often comes down to managing your time and workload effectively. Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to stay focused on what matters most. Break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p><ul><li>: Use tools like Trello, Asana, or even a simple to-do list to keep track of deadlines and priorities. Review your progress regularly to stay on course.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. <strong>Build Relationships with Colleagues</strong></h2><p>Networking within your company is just as important as external networking. Building positive relationships with your coworkers and supervisors creates a supportive work environment and opens doors for collaboration and mentorship.</p><ul><li>: Take initiative by joining team activities, offering help when needed, or simply engaging in casual conversations during breaks. A friendly demeanor goes a long way in fostering camaraderie.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. <strong>Be Proactive and Take Initiative</strong></h2><p>Don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do. Look for opportunities to solve problems, suggest improvements, or take on additional responsibilities. Being proactive demonstrates your commitment and can set you apart as a valuable team member.</p><ul><li>: If you notice an area for improvement, propose a solution rather than just pointing out the problem. This shows leadership potential and a willingness to contribute.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. <strong>Seek Feedback and Act on It</strong></h2><p>Constructive feedback is a powerful tool for growth. Don’t shy away from asking for input on your performance from your manager or peers. More importantly, act on the feedback you receive to show that you’re dedicated to self-improvement.</p><ul><li>: Schedule regular check-ins with your supervisor to discuss your progress and areas for development. Approach feedback with an open mind, even if it’s critical.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. <strong>Stay Organized and Punctual</strong></h2><p>Organization and punctuality reflect professionalism and reliability. Keep your workspace tidy, manage your calendar effectively, and always meet deadlines. Showing up on time for meetings and delivering work as promised builds trust with your team.</p><ul><li>: Set reminders for important tasks and meetings. If you anticipate a delay, communicate it early and provide a realistic timeline for completion.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. <strong>Invest in Continuous Learning</strong></h2><p>The workplace is constantly evolving, and staying relevant means keeping your skills up to date. Take advantage of training programs, workshops, or online courses offered by your company or available externally. Learning new skills not only benefits you but also adds value to your team.</p><ul><li>: Identify skills that are in demand in your industry and set a goal to master them. Share your learning with your team to position yourself as a resource.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  9. <strong>Maintain a Positive Attitude</strong></h2><p>A positive mindset can make a huge difference in how you’re perceived at work. Challenges and setbacks are inevitable, but approaching them with optimism and resilience will inspire confidence in your abilities.</p><ul><li>: Focus on solutions rather than dwelling on problems. Celebrate small wins and acknowledge the efforts of your colleagues to create a motivating atmosphere.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  10. <strong>Respect Work-Life Balance</strong></h2><p>While dedication to your job is important, overworking can lead to burnout and decreased productivity. Respect your personal time and encourage a healthy balance between work and life. A well-rested and balanced employee is more effective and engaged.</p><ul><li>: Set boundaries by avoiding work-related tasks during personal time, unless absolutely necessary. Communicate your availability to your team to manage expectations.</li></ul><p>Thriving in a company is a journey that requires intentional effort, adaptability, and a commitment to growth. By following these tips, you can build a strong reputation, foster meaningful relationships, and achieve long-term success in your career. Remember, every workplace is different, so tailor these strategies to fit your unique environment and personal goals. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your professional life flourish!</p>","contentLength":5501,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Debugging Techniques and Problem Location Strategies Methodology for Rapid Problem Location in Complex Systems（1751293119637400）","url":"https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/debugging-techniques-and-problem-location-strategies-methodology-for-rapid-problem-location-in-5d02","date":1751293120,"author":"member_35db4d53","guid":176723,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

The Invisible Post Office Powering Modern Software</em></strong></p><p>Imagine a busy day at the local post office. You drop your letter into the mailbox and leave, trusting it will be delivered. Behind the scenes, postal workers collect mail from boxes, sort it at central facilities, and deliver it to recipients, all without needing you to wait. This system allows senders to move on with their day, postal workers to handle delivery at their own pace, and the entire operation to run efficiently without direct handoffs or delays. </p><p><strong><code>This is exactly how a Message Queue works in software.</code></strong></p><p><strong><em>Why Do We Need Message Queues in Distributed Systems?</em></strong></p><p>In modern software, applications are often composed of multiple independent components i.e. payment processors, inventory services, email dispatchers, etc. These components <strong>need to communicate asynchronously</strong> so that one system can pass information to another without waiting for an immediate response.\nThis is where  works, they serve as a buffer, enabling smooth communication between services.</p><p><strong><em>Understanding the Core Components of a Message Queue System</em></strong></p><p>Let’s visualize it as a digital post office:</p><ul><li>\nThis is the part of the system that creates and sends the message.</li></ul><p>📌 Example: A user uploads a video.

It encompasses the ability of individuals to control who can access, use, and share their digital information. In today's data-driven society, digital privacy is paramount because a vast amount of sensitive personal data, from financial records to health information, is generated and stored on digital platforms. Misuse of this data can lead to significant issues, making it essential for individuals to maintain control over their online presence and personal information.</p><p>While often used interchangeably, #DigitalPrivacy and #DataSecurity are distinct, though related, concepts. Data security focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft through technical safeguards like encryption and firewalls. It's about the  – how data is protected. Digital privacy, on the other hand, is concerned with the  and  – what data is collected, for what purpose, and who has access to it. It ensures that data collection, usage, and storage comply with an individual's rights and applicable regulations.</p><p>Digital privacy encompasses several key facets:</p><ul><li> Control over the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, such as browsing history, purchase records, and health data.</li><li> The secrecy and integrity of personal communications (emails, messages, calls) from unauthorized interception.</li><li> Control over one's physical whereabouts and movements as tracked by digital devices and services.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Digital Minefield: Common Privacy Threats\n</h2><p>The digital landscape is rife with threats designed to compromise personal privacy. Understanding these common types is the first step towards protection:</p><p>Digital #Surveillance involves the monitoring of online activities, often without explicit consent. This ranges from government agencies tracking communications for national security to corporations collecting vast amounts of user data for targeted advertising, a concept known as #SurveillanceCapitalism. While some surveillance serves legitimate purposes, it raises significant concerns about the erosion of individual freedoms and the potential for data misuse.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Impact of Digital Privacy Threats\n</h3><p>The consequences of #DigitalPrivacyThreats extend far beyond mere inconvenience, affecting individuals and society on multiple levels:</p><ul><li> Direct financial losses through unauthorized transactions, fraudulent accounts, or the costs associated with identity recovery services.</li><li><strong>Reputational and Psychological Impacts:</strong> Severe reputational damage and deep psychological distress, leading to anxiety, stress, and a pervasive sense of vulnerability.</li><li> Repeated privacy violations erode trust in digital platforms, institutions, and governments, impacting willingness to engage in online activities.</li><li> Mass surveillance can lead to self-censorship, while data exploitation can influence public opinion and democratic processes, undermining personal autonomy and a secure digital society.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Corporate Data Collection: Practices, Ethics, and Responsibilities\n</h2><p>In the modern enterprise landscape, #DataCollection is the systematic process of gathering information from various sources to gain insights, identify trends, and make informed decisions. Data is no longer just a byproduct; it is a critical asset that fuels growth, innovation, and competitive advantage.</p><p>By meticulously collecting and analyzing data, companies can enhance decision-making, personalize customer experiences, forecast market trends, and mitigate risks. This allows businesses to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs, fostering long-term success.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Corporate Data Collection Practices\n</h3><p>Corporations employ diverse methods to collect data from internal and external sources:</p><ul><li><strong>Internal Data Collection:</strong> Generated within the company's operations.\n\n<ul><li> From sales, purchases, and billing records (POS, e-commerce, ERP).</li><li><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems:</strong> Store customer interactions, preferences, and history.</li><li><strong>Website and Application Analytics:</strong> Track user behavior (Google Analytics, mobile apps).</li><li> Supply chain, inventory, production, and employee performance.</li><li><strong>Surveys and Feedback Forms:</strong> Direct collection from customers, employees, or stakeholders.</li></ul></li><li><strong>External Data Collection:</strong> Sourced from outside the company for broader market insights.\n\n<ul><li> Data on market size, trends, competitors, and consumer demographics.</li><li> Analyzing public conversations and sentiment.</li><li> Government statistics, economic indicators, industry reports.</li><li><strong>Third-Party Data Providers:</strong> Purchasing aggregated and anonymized demographic or behavioral data.</li><li> Programmatically extracting information from public websites (with ethical/legal considerations).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Ethical Considerations in Data Collection\n</h3><p>The pervasive nature of data collection brings #DataEthics to the forefront, demanding a commitment to ethical principles that prioritize individual rights and societal well-being:</p><ul><li> Respecting individuals' right to control personal information.

It was... okay, but often felt clunky. Now, Jetpack Compose is changing the game. It's a new way to build UIs, focusing on  code. Instead of telling the system  to build the UI step-by-step, you describe  you want, and Compose takes care of the rest. It's a pretty big shift, and honestly, it makes things a lot easier.</p><h3>Describing Your UI, Not Instructing It</h3><p><strong>The core idea behind Jetpack Compose is to describe your UI's desired state, and let the framework handle the actual rendering.</strong> This is different from the old way, where you'd manually update UI elements. Think of it like this: instead of giving someone instructions on how to draw a circle, you just tell them, \"Draw a circle.\" Compose figures out the best way to do it. This approach leads to cleaner code and fewer bugs. It's also easier to reason about your UI, because you're working with a clear, high-level description.</p><h3>The Power of the prompt to compose ui Paradigm</h3><p>With Jetpack Compose, you're essentially writing code that describes the UI based on its current state. When the state changes, Compose automatically updates the UI to reflect those changes. This is called , and it's a key part of how Compose works. It's also pretty efficient; Compose only updates the parts of the UI that need to be changed. This <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ramadan123sayed/understanding-imperative-vs-declarative-programming-in-kotlin-and-jetpack-compose-vs-xml-2271650fc3d2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">declarative approach</a> makes it easier to build dynamic and responsive UIs.</p><ul><li>Easier to test UI components.</li><li>More predictable UI behavior.</li></ul><blockquote>Jetpack Compose really shines when you start building complex UIs. The declarative approach makes it easier to manage state and keep your UI consistent. It's a bit of a learning curve at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll never want to go back to XML.</blockquote><h2>Streamlining Development with Jetpack Compose</h2><p>Jetpack Compose isn't just about a new way to describe your UI; it's about making the whole development process smoother and faster. I remember the days of wrestling with XML layouts, and honestly, Compose feels like a breath of fresh air. It's like they actually listened to developers' pain points and built a tool to address them. Let's look at some ways Compose streamlines development.</p><h3>Efficient State Management for Dynamic UIs</h3><p><strong>State management is a big deal in any UI framework, and Compose handles it beautifully.</strong> Instead of manually updating views when data changes, Compose automatically recomposes the UI based on the current state. This means less boilerplate code and fewer opportunities for bugs. It's a game changer.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of how Compose simplifies state management:</p><ul><li> makes components more reusable and testable.</li><li> and  are your best friends for managing local state.</li><li>ViewModel integration makes it easy to handle complex state logic and survive configuration changes.</li></ul><blockquote>Managing state used to be a headache, but Compose makes it almost enjoyable. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to reason about how your UI behaves, and the built-in state management tools are incredibly powerful.</blockquote><h3>Visualizing Your Design with UI Previews</h3><p>One of my favorite features of Compose is the ability to create UI previews directly in the IDE. No more deploying to a device or emulator just to see if your layout looks right! You can quickly iterate on your design and see the results in real-time. This saves a ton of time and frustration. The <a href=\"https://codifysol.com/swiftui-vs-jetpack-compose-who-wins-in-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UI previews</a> are a huge win for productivity.</p><p>Here's why UI previews are so awesome:</p><ul><li>Instant feedback on your UI changes.</li><li>Support for multiple devices and themes.</li><li>Easy to create and customize previews.</li></ul><p>With UI previews, you can catch design issues early and often, leading to a more polished and professional-looking app. It's like having a visual debugger for your UI, and it's something I can't imagine developing without anymore.</p><p>Making apps is way easier with Jetpack Compose. It helps you build cool stuff faster and with less hassle.

In the realm of multimodal AI, a significant contender has recently made its mark: the latest  vision model. This compact yet powerful model recently debuted at number two on the OCRBench leaderboard, making it the most performant multimodal model under 7B parameters. This remarkable achievement highlights its capabilities in document understanding and sets a new benchmark for smaller, more efficient AI models in this critical domain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  TL;DR: What are vision model LLMs?\n</h3><p>Vision Model Large Language Models (LLMs), often referred to as Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence by bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. Unlike traditional LLMs that exclusively process text, VLMs are designed to understand and interact with both visual data (like images and videos) and textual data simultaneously. At their core, these models integrate a vision encoder, which extracts meaningful features and representations from visual inputs (e.g., recognizing objects, textures, and spatial relationships), with a language model, which excels at understanding and generating human-like text. These two components work in conjunction, often through sophisticated alignment and fusion mechanisms, to map visual and textual information into a shared embedding space. This allows VLMs to perform a variety of complex tasks, such as generating descriptive captions for images, answering questions about visual content, and even enabling visual search. By unifying perception and expression, VLMs enable AI systems to interpret and communicate about the world in a more holistic and intuitive manner, much closer to how humans perceive information.</p><p>To practically test the capabilities of the granite-vision-3.3-2b model, I've leveraged the provided code to run it locally on my machine. A key enhancement to this local setup is the implementation of a conversational interface. Instead of static queries, this allows for dynamic interaction, where I can pose questions or prompts to the model about a given image in a continuous chat format. This interactive mode offers a more flexible and insightful way to explore the model's understanding of visual content and its ability to respond to natural language queries, simulating a real-world application scenario.</p><p>Here we go with the test ⬇️</p><div><pre><code>python3  venv venv\nvenv/bin/activate\n\npip  pip\n</code></pre></div><p>And install the requirements ⬇️</p><div><pre><code>pip  Pillow torch huggingface_hub\n</code></pre></div><p>And then the sample application 👨‍💻</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>The sample image will be downloaded with rest of necessary files in the huggingface cache directory.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code>/Users/xxxxxx/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--ibm-granite--granite-vision-3.3-2b/snapshots/7fe917fdafb006f53aedf9589f148a83ec3cd8eb\n</code></pre></div><p>Results and outputs of the sample code are provided below;</p><div><pre><code>--- Model Output ---\n\nA chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Even on a CPU-only laptop, the inference process completes within a reasonable timeframe. This efficiency is particularly noteworthy given that such models often benefit greatly from GPU acceleration, underscoring the model's optimization for more accessible hardware environments.</p><p>In summary, the IBM Granite 3.3 2B vision model represents a significant leap forward in multimodal AI, notably securing a top position on the OCRBench leaderboard as the most performant model under 7B parameters. This achievement underscores the growing power of Vision Model LLMs, which seamlessly integrate visual and textual understanding to process complex information. Our practical exploration demonstrated this model’s capabilities in a local, interactive chat environment, allowing for dynamic engagement with visual content. Critically, the granite-vision-3.3-2b model exhibited commendable and reasonable execution times even on a CPU-only laptop, highlighting its efficiency and potential for broader accessibility beyond high-end, GPU-accelerated systems. This combination of strong performance and efficient local execution positions IBM Granite Vision as a compelling solution for various document understanding and multimodal AI applications.</p>","contentLength":5154,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ForwardMX alternative: Email Forwarding with Kubernetes & LDAP","url":"https://dev.to/oursinet/forwardmx-alternative-email-forwarding-with-kubernetes-ldap-1326","date":1751286659,"author":"Benoît Vannesson","guid":176635,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>TL;DR: I replaced my $10/month forwardmx subscription with a self-hosted forwarding-only mail server setup, using OpenLDAP and docker-mailserver on my Kubernetes cluster.

This article explains the step-by-step process to develop a digital twin that focuses on forecasting equipment failures before they happen. By integrating sensor data, real-time analytics, and machine learning, organizations can shift from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies—maximizing productivity while minimizing risk.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Predictive Maintenance Needs Digital Twins\n</h2><p>Traditional maintenance is often reactive (fix it when it breaks) or preventive (fix it on a schedule). Predictive maintenance, however, relies on data-driven insights that show  a machine is likely to fail. Digital twins make this possible by replicating equipment behavior and comparing live sensor data with expected norms.</p><p>With this virtual model constantly running in parallel with your physical asset, you can catch early warning signs—like temperature drifts or vibration changes—long before the equipment actually fails.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Use Cases for Predictive Maintenance Twins\n</h2><ul><li> Detect motor misalignments, worn bearings, or hydraulic issues before breakdowns occur.</li><li> Monitor engine vibration, oil quality, and structural fatigue in real time.</li><li> Track turbine conditions and optimize servicing schedules.</li><li> Predict elevator maintenance, HVAC component wear, or lighting system faults.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set Clear Maintenance Objectives\n</h2><p>Before building your twin, define what success looks like. Examples include:</p><ul><li>Reducing machine downtime by 30% over 6 months\n</li><li>Lowering maintenance costs by 20% annually\n</li><li>Predicting 90% of failures at least one week in advance\n</li></ul><p>Start with a pilot project focused on one high-impact machine or system. This helps prove value without stretching your resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Identify Key Equipment and Failure Modes\n</h2><p>List the assets you want to monitor—motors, compressors, pumps, or CNC machines. Then identify the most common failure types. For example, a pump might fail due to impeller wear, bearing friction, or overheating.</p><p>Determine which sensor data can reveal early indicators of these failures, such as:</p><ul></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Build a Data Collection Framework\n</h2><p>Use IoT sensors or industrial monitoring systems (like SCADA or PLCs) to feed data into your system. Make sure your data pipeline supports:</p><ul><li>Real-time streaming (using MQTT, OPC-UA, or Kafka)\n</li><li>Historical logging (with time-series databases like InfluxDB)\n</li><li>Data validation and cleaning\n</li></ul><p>Implement edge computing near the machines when low-latency processing is needed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Model Machine Behavior and Anomalies\n</h2><p>The digital twin should simulate normal behavior using physics-based or data-driven models. Start by analyzing historical data from healthy equipment to create baselines.</p><p>Use machine learning algorithms—like anomaly detection, clustering, or regression—to learn what \"normal\" looks like and to flag deviations.</p><p>Popular ML models include:</p><ul><li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n</li><li>Neural networks (especially for complex patterns)\n</li></ul><p>Validate the model by testing it against known failure events. Fine-tune until predictions are consistently accurate.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Deploy Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts\n</h2><p>Once your model is trained, connect it to live data feeds and create alert mechanisms.

With smart factories becoming the new standard in Industry 4.0, leaders are revisiting the value of  frameworks to enable real-time insights, automation, and predictive operations. While often used interchangeably, these technologies solve very different problems—and combining them may be the key to unlocking full operational intelligence.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes a Factory “Smart”?\n</h2><p>A smart factory uses IIoT sensors, connected devices, edge computing, and cloud analytics to optimize every process across the value chain. These factories continuously collect, analyze, and act on data from physical assets, leading to faster decisions and more efficient resource use.</p><p>Common features of smart factories include:</p><ul><li>Real-time machine monitoring</li><li>Digital work instructions</li><li>Autonomous production adjustments</li><li>Closed-loop quality control</li></ul><p>These improvements hinge on robust data infrastructure, where digital thread and digital twin technologies play foundational roles.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Role of IIoT in Manufacturing Optimization\n</h2><p>IIoT connects industrial machines, robots, and systems to collect telemetry data—temperature, vibration, speed, and output. This information is analyzed locally at the edge or streamed to the cloud, allowing for instant feedback loops and performance dashboards.</p><ul><li>Reduced downtime via predictive alerts</li><li>Better asset utilization through live diagnostics</li><li>Remote visibility into production status</li><li>Safer operating conditions by detecting anomalies early</li></ul><p>But data alone isn’t useful unless it’s structured and contextualized. That’s where the digital thread and digital twin concepts add value.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Digital Thread and Digital Twin in Smart Factory Architecture\n</h2><p>A digital thread is a connected data backbone that links information across a product’s lifecycle—from design and prototyping to production and servicing. In a smart factory, digital thread architecture ensures all systems “speak the same language,” connecting CAD files, ERP orders, shop floor instructions, and quality logs in one integrated view.</p><p>A digital twin is a real-time virtual replica of a physical asset. In smart factories, these models simulate the behavior of machines, production lines, or even entire plants. They allow teams to:</p><ul><li>Test configuration changes without downtime</li><li>Run “what-if” scenarios for throughput</li><li>Forecast wear based on stress data</li><li>Synchronize operations with real-time input</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Combining Both Technologies Matters\n</h2><p>It’s not a question of <strong>digital thread vs digital twin</strong>—smart factories require both. The digital thread makes sure the right data is available from every system and process. The digital twin interprets that data dynamically to model behavior, simulate future states, and make recommendations.</p><p>: A packaging robot shows irregular torque behavior.  </p><ul><li>The  logs prior maintenance, part replacements, and operator notes.\n</li><li>The  simulates motor failure probability based on current conditions.\nTogether, they guide timely replacement and avoid a breakdown.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Implementation Roadmap\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Deploy Foundational IIoT Infrastructure\n</h3><p>Install sensors on key assets to collect energy, cycle time, environmental, and operational metrics. Use edge devices for local filtering.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Build a Digital Thread\n</h3><p>Map out data sources across systems—MES, PLM, ERP, SCADA—and unify them into a single metadata model. Ensure version control and traceability of product and process data.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Develop Digital Twin Models\n</h3><p>Start small. Build digital twins for high-impact assets (e.g., CNC machines or conveyor belts). Include real-time sensor feeds and historical failure modes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Integrate Visualization and Alerts\n</h3><p>Use dashboards to track both live and historical data. Visual overlays on CAD models can show temperature gradients, motor load, or vibration anomalies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Enable Predictive Workflows\n</h3><p>Combine machine learning models with digital twin data to forecast part failure, optimize shift schedules, or reduce scrap rates.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Visualization Tools That Power Smart Factories\n</h2><p>Smart factories rely on intuitive data visualization to support decision-making.</p><ul><li> show asset KPIs, energy usage, and process alerts.</li><li> (e.g., AR headsets or tablet apps) visualize live performance against the digital twin.</li><li> pull from the digital thread to uncover systemic process issues.</li></ul><p>Tools like Siemens MindSphere, PTC ThingWorx, and GE Predix provide flexible IIoT platforms that integrate digital twins with digital thread data.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Measurable Benefits of Integration\n</h2><p>Companies that implement smart factory solutions with a combined digital thread/twin approach report:</p><ul><li> in unplanned downtime\n</li><li> in asset utilization\n</li><li> in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)\n</li><li><strong>Faster new product introduction</strong> due to better design-feedback loops\n</li></ul><p>These improvements are driven not by sensors alone, but by structured data pipelines and real-time simulation.</p><p>Smart factories require more than connected machines—they need intelligent systems that interpret data in meaningful ways. The <strong>digital thread vs digital twin</strong> conversation should not be a binary choice. They are complementary tools in the IIoT ecosystem, with the thread providing context and the twin enabling action. As manufacturers face greater complexity and demand for agility, integrating both technologies offers a scalable, future-proof path toward operational excellence.</p>","contentLength":5484,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["devto"]}
