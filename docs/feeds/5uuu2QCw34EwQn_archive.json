The Latvia-Russia connection at 8, and now ours around 9 a.m.\"</p><p>Asked why the disconnection in Estonia occurred at 9:09 a.m., not precisely at 9 o'clock, Köster explained that such switchovers never happen at a precise minute.</p><p>The disconnection had no impact on consumers, and all systems are stable and secure, Elering said.</p><p>\"Right now, everything seems to be in tip-top shape,\" the spokesperson said, adding that there is no need to worry.</p><p>Elering also confirmed that the Baltic states have the necessary frequency reserves for Saturday, and that the system's frequency is being managed in coordination between the three TSOs at their respective control centers.</p><p>The BRELL agreement formally expired at 11:59 p.m. on Friday.</p><p><strong>Island mode operation testing to begin</strong></p><p>The synchronization of the Baltic states with CESA is slated to take place on Sunday afternoon, before which the three TSOs will conduct island or isolated operation testing.</p><p>At this time, the Baltic power grid will function independently, without being part of any other frequency area. Electricity demand during this period will be met via local power plants and direct current Estonian-Finnish and Lithuanian-Swedish connections.</p><p>During the island operation test, the three Baltic TSOs will independently monitor the system's frequency, testing its resilience to various disturbances and readiness for isolated operation as well as performing frequency and voltage stability tests. This testing is expected to continue through Sunday afternoon.</p><p>\"For a few hours, we'll simply be in this island state — the Baltic countries will be completely separate, and we'll be managing our system ourselves,\" Köster explained.</p><p>\"We will start testing around midday,\" he continued. \"We'll test how the system responds if the frequency is adjusted slightly, and whether it can properly restore the [right] frequency. But this is a miniscule fluctuation that certainly won't reach consumers; we're simply testing our systems.\"</p><p>Everything is calm and everything is fine at the moment, the spokesperson added.</p><p><strong>Baltics to connect to Europe on Sunday</strong></p><p>The connection of the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian power grids to Continental Europe via Poland is scheduled to begin around 2 p.m. on Sunday, Köster noted.</p><p>\"These switchovers can't be planned ahead down to the exact minute,\" he said. \"Nothing has changed. Tomorrow morning we'll be testing voltage fluctuations, and then, starting around midday, we'll start activities for connecting to Continental Europe. And these should be finished by around 2 p.m.\"</p><p>The synchronization process with Continental Europe is scheduled to be completed on Sunday, February 9.</p><p>Once synchronized, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will join the world's largest synchronous grid, serving more than 400 million consumers across 26 countries.</p><p>Synchronization with CESA will allow for the independent, stable and reliable frequency control of the Baltics' energy grids, and will boost energy security in the region.</p><p>The Baltic TSOs have been preparing for this transition by investing in the development of transmission infrastructure and equipment necessary for the safe operation of their electricity systems, Elering said.</p><p>Elering CEO Kalle Kilk has also previously emphasized that synchronization with the European grid is a security matter as well.</p><p>The Baltic power grids' synchronization process has been supported by the EU and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), including via co-funding for infrastructure investments as well as technical and operational support, which facilitated the process.</p><p>The synchronization of the three Baltic countries with CESA via Poland has cost €1.6 billion to date, 75 percent of which has been co-financed by the European Union and the rest of which has been covered by congestion revenue funds.</p><p>Approximately €350 million in investments have been made in Estonia alone.</p><p>Investments have included the construction or reconstruction of 1,400 kilometers of high-voltage power lines across the Baltics, construction of new substations as well as upgrades of nearly 40 existing substations.</p><p>Six synchronous condensers have also already been built across the three countries, with three more still under construction.</p><p>While Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania hadn't purchased electricity from Russia or Belarus for several years, until Saturday morning they had remained operating within the Russian IPS/UPS system, whose frequency is centrally regulated in Moscow.</p><p>Baltic TSOs Elering, AST and Litgrid first submitted their application to join the Continental European grid to the then-existing Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) in 2007.</p><p>Plans to disconnect the Baltics from the electricity system that tied them to the former Soviet Union had been discussed for decades, but gained momentum after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

It happened with Google, which updated its <a rel=\"noopener, noreferrer\" href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\">privacy policy</a> in 2023 to say that it’ll “use publicly available information to help train Google’s AI models.” It’s also evident with OpenAI, which used millions of texts, many of them copyrighted, to train ChatGPT. Perplexity recently came under scrutiny for bypassing the “rules of the Internet” to feed its AI model.</p><p><strong>Internet theft is being normalized.</strong> What’s remarkable is that as companies increasingly skirt the rules and violate copyright, this behavior is starting to be seen as normal. There seems to be little time for outrage, and people often treat it as an accepted practice so they can continue with their business.</p><p><strong>Is this really “fair use”? </strong>Many companies rely on the concept of “fair use,” which allows for limited use of protected material without requiring permission. While copyright infringement lawsuits are emerging in the world of generative AI, they often seem to take a backseat as these large companies continue to thrive.</p>","contentLength":2803,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ik7gw1/new_meta_emails_reveal_that_the_company/"},{"title":"Tariffs could have \"the wrong effect on jobs,\" says expert #shorts #tariffs #wallstreetweek","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6xrTb9Jpns","date":1738965451,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":497,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Tariffs could have \"the wrong effect on jobs,\" says the Council on Foreign Relations' Shannon O'Neil.

One group reportedly advanced from Makhnovka toward Cherkasskaya Konopelka, Fanaseyevka, and Ulanok, while another attempted an assault from Dmitriukov toward Russkaya Konopelka – the latter attack was reportedly repelled.</p><p>There is disagreement among Russian sources over Ukrainian gains. A Kremlin-affiliated milblogger claimed that Ukraine had seized Cherkasskaya Konopelka, but others denied this. Some reports suggested Ukrainian forces broke through to or even seized Ulanok, though this claim is also disputed. ISW has not yet verified geolocated evidence of Ukrainian forces operating in Ulanok.</p><p>The Russian Telegram channel “Zapiski Veterana” [Veteran’s Notes] <a href=\"https://t.me/notes_veterans/21809\">reported</a> after 9 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 6 that Ukrainian troops had engaged in intense battles for the settlements of Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Fanaseyevka.</p><p>According to the channel, fierce fighting was ongoing in the area, with Ukrainian forces launching six attacks in this sector on Thursday. Later, “Zapiski Veterana” <a href=\"https://t.me/notes_veterans/21810\">warned</a> that the situation on the Kursk front could deteriorate significantly by Friday morning, alleging that the AFU were moving significant reinforcements toward Sudzha.</p><p>In a subsequent update, the channel claimed that Ukrainian troops had encircled Cherkasskaya Konopelka.</p><p>On Thursday evening, Stanislav Bunyatov, a junior sergeant in the 24th Aidar Assault Battalion, wrote on <a href=\"https://t.me/stanislav_osman/8187\">Telegram</a>: “We are really making progress in Kursk Oblast.”</p><p>Bunyatov emphasized the strategic importance of these assaults, stating: “If we withdraw, the enemy is seriously intent on entering the Sumy region.”</p><p>He acknowledged that Russian drones pose a significant challenge, though saying it was expected. Meanwhile, Russian sources reported that poor weather conditions on Feb. 6 had hindered their drone operations.</p><p>By Friday, several Russian Telegram channels reported that the commander of the 11th Airborne Brigade had been removed from his post. The alleged reason was his failure to react in time to both the pontoon deployment and the sudden Ukrainian advance toward Ulanok the previous day. However, there are no official confirmations of his dismissal.</p><p>In its Friday <a href=\"https://t.me/notes_veterans/21816\">morning report</a>, posted after 11 a.m., the Zapiski Veterana channel claimed that Ukrainian troops had been spotted on the dam in Cherkasskaya Konopelka. According to the post, Ukrainian military sources allegedly marked this settlement as under AFU control.</p><p>“There is information that Fanaseyevka has also been occupied by the enemy,” the report added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the “War Correspondents of the Russian Spring” Telegram channel <a href=\"https://t.me/RVvoenkor/85830\">published</a> a summary, stating that after the Thursday offensive on Ulanok, Ukrainian forces had suffered heavy losses in armored vehicles but had still managed to land a significant force.</p><p>According to their report, between half a battalion and a full battalion of Ukrainian infantry remains engaged in the forests and the areas around Fanaseyevka and Cherkasskaya Konopelka.</p><p>“Reports from the field indicate that fighting has continued since last night and into the morning in the areas around Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Fanaseyevka, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces have managed to secure several positions,” the channel wrote.</p><p>The Telegram post further suggested that the Ukrainian command might deploy additional reinforcements to support its units.</p><p>In its Feb. 7 briefing on the situation in Kursk Oblast, the Ukrainian General Staff <a href=\"https://t.me/generalstaff_ua/13393\">reported</a> at 8:44 a.m.:</p><p>“In the operational zone in Kursk Oblast, units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine have repelled five Russian attacks over the past 24 hours.”</p><p>According to the summary, Russian forces launched 47 airstrikes, deploying 76 guided bombs, and conducted 612 artillery attacks on Ukrainian positions and settlements in the region, including 11 strikes from multiple launch rocket systems.</p><p>Despite this being the second day of Ukraine’s new offensive in Kursk, the General Staff has not explicitly confirmed the operation. Instead, its report only mentions the repelling of Russian attacks.</p><p>In its midday report, the Russian Defense Ministry <a href=\"https://t.me/mod_russia/48645\">stated</a> that “the Russian Armed Forces continue to defeat AFU formations in Kursk Oblast.”</p><p>According to the report, units from the “North” group of troops thwarted a Ukrainian counteroffensive near Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Ulanok.</p><p>“All enemy attacks have been repelled,” the ministry claimed.</p><p>However, according to an ISW report, some Russian milbloggers voiced concerns that continued Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast could threaten Russian supply lines and rear positions south of Sudzha, particularly around Guyevo, where Russian forces are currently engaged.</p><p><strong>Putin acknowledges strain on Russian troops in Kursk Oblast</strong></p><p>On Feb. 5, Russian leader Vladimir <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/topic/putin\">Putin</a> praised elite Airborne Forces (VDV) and naval infantry units defending in Kursk Oblast, highlighting that the Ukrainian incursion has tied up a full combined-arms army’s worth of Russian troops in the region for over six months.</p><p>During a meeting with acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein, Putin listed key Russian formations still engaged in Kursk:</p><ul><li>155th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet)</li><li>810th Naval Infantry Brigade</li></ul><p>He promised future rewards for these forces. However, ISW outlines that this prolonged deployment has prevented Russia from redeploying these elite units to high-priority fronts, such as the Donetsk region.</p><p>According to ISW, Russia has amassed around 78,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, including 11,000 North Korean personnel and elements of nearly all elite Russian Airborne Forces and naval infantry units, to expel Ukrainian forces from the region.</p><p>Despite this, Putin has yet to prioritize fully reclaiming Kursk Oblast, instead focusing on slow advances in Donetsk.

annex Canada, in part to gain access to its critical minerals, revealing how the U.S. President in their most recent conversation suggested the Prime Minister familiarize himself with a 1908 treaty that set the boundaries between the two countries.</p><p>The Prime Minister’s remarks were made behind closed doors, but The Globe and Mail spoke to four sources who confirmed what he said. The Globe is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.</p><p>His comments represent the most frank acknowledgment that what the federal government once dismissed as a joke – Mr. Trump’s talk of making Canada the 51s state – is now regarded by the Prime Minister’s Office as a genuine interest on the part of the U.S. President.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau made his assessment to an audience of about 200 business leaders, trade experts and union executives in Toronto who had gathered to map out ways to boost economic growth and attract new capital investment in the face of the looming threat of U.S. protectionism. He talked about two phone conversations he had with Mr. Trump on Monday before the President agreed to delay steep tariffs on Canadian goods for 30 days.</p><p data-sophi-feature=\"interstitial\"><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-tariffs-canada-usa-latest-updates-explainer/\">The Canada-U.S. tariff war is on pause, but not over. Here are the latest updates and what they mean for your finances</a></p><p>During the calls, the Prime Minister recalled, Mr. Trump referred to a four-page memo that included a list of grievances he had with Canadian trade and commercial rules including the President’s false claim that U.S. banks are unable to operate in Canada. Other complaints included Canada’s sheltered dairy industry which is protected from foreign competition by a wall of tariffs, as well as the federal goods and services tax.</p><p>In the second conversation with Mr. Trump on Monday, the Prime Minister told the summit, the President asked him whether he was familiar with the Treaty of 1908, a pact between the United States and Britain that defined the border between the United States and Canada. He told Mr. Trudeau he should look it up.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau told the summit he thought this treaty had been superseded by other developments such as the repatriation of the Canadian Constitution – in other words, that the border cannot be dissolved by repealing that treaty. He told the audience that international law would prevent the dissolution of the 1908 Treaty from leading to the erasure of the border. For example, various international laws define sovereign borders, including the United Nations Charter of which both countries are signatories and which has protections for territorial integrity.</p><p>A source familiar with the calls said Mr. Trump’s reference to the 1908 Treaty was taken an as implied threat. Soon after winning the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump began talking about making Canada the 51st state and suggesting Canadians could avoid his tariff threats by agreeing to a political union. The Trudeau cabinet at the time shrugged off the comments. In early January, however, Mr. Trump expanded on his proposal, publicly referred to the U.S.-Canada border as “an artificially drawn line” and said he would be willing to use “economic force” to coerce Canada into being annexed.</p><p data-sophi-feature=\"interstitial\"><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trump-threats-are-inspiring-canada-to-tackle-trade-war-from-within/\">Trump tariffs are inspiring Canada to tackle trade war from within</a></p><p>Canadian officials have been unable to determine the architect of the memo, the Prime Minister told the summit. Mr. Trudeau said that his team spoke with U.S. commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and two other officials that should have been involved in crafting the four-page memo Mr. Trump read from, but they were unaware of the document or its contents.</p><p>Asked at the summit about Mr. Trudeau’s interpretation of Mr. Trump’s motives, Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon said the sense he got from the gathering and those assembled is that “Canada is free, Canada is sovereign and Canada will choose its own destiny, thank you very much.”</p><p>Transport Minister Anita Anand said Canadians are united in rejecting annexation. “There will be no messing with the 49th parallel,” she said, a reference to the Canada-U.S. border.</p><p>Beth Burke, CEO of the Canadian American Business Council, said Americans do not take seriously Mr. Trump’s talk of taking over Canada. She said people in the United States view the President’s persistent mention of annexation as a “position of negotiation and posturing and using it as leverage in the conversation.”</p><p>She said Canada can use access to its abundant critical minerals as leverage in coming renegotiations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is due for renewal in 2026.</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/NR5STWCMMBDDNNXRLPRSAMCIQY.JPG?auth=ddecbb40c6f3e9cd005d40356661ef50ae6c31f66a688a8071c5037af077bf14&amp;width=600&amp;height=400&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" data-photo-viewer-index=\"1\"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier at the gathering, Mr. Trudeau had pleaded with provinces and territories to dismantle internal barriers that discourage greater east-west trade inside Canada.</p><p>Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Mr. Trump’s decision to levy steep tariffs on Canada – now delayed after a last-minute deal Monday – is a “wake-up call” for the country.</p><p>The prospect of much more difficult relations with the United States must drive Canada to find other means of attracting business investment, of generating economic growth and diversifying trade beyond American customers, he said.</p><p data-sophi-feature=\"interstitial\"><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-tariff-threats-already-affecting-canadas-economy-bocs-macklem-says/\">Tariff threats already affecting Canada’s economy, BoC’s Macklem says</a></p><p>Mr. Trudeau said a good start would be looking at interprovincial trade barriers put in place by provincial governments that make it easier for Canadians to trade with the United States rather than other provinces and territories.</p><p>“It’s about time we had genuine free trade within Canada,” Mr. Trudeau told the summit.</p><p>He said many of these barriers, which hinder the movement of goods and workers within the country, make no sense. The Prime Minister cited recognizing teaching certifications and tire requirements for trucks as two examples. This will make it easier for Canadians to do business “across Canada, east-west and not just north-south.”</p><p>A 2019 paper published by the International Monetary Fund found that Canada’s internal trade barriers – excluding those related to geography, such as challenges with transporting goods across a country this large – were equivalent to an average tariff of 21 per cent in 2015. The study found that lifting all internal barriers would result in 4-per-cent growth in Canada’s real gross domestic product per capita.</p><p>Mr. Champagne said the most important task right now for Canada is restoring business confidence.</p><p>This meeting of business and labour leaders at Toronto’s Evergreen Brick Works takes place just days after a potential shock to the Canadian economy was averted – one that threatened to shutter businesses and cost jobs. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump held off imposing steep tariffs on Canadian imports – a potentially devastating shock that drew fresh attention to Canada’s reliance on the U.S. market. More than 75 per cent of this country’s merchandise exports go to the United States.</p><p>Mr. Champagne said the Trump tariff threat must force Canada to act quickly to safeguard its economic fortunes and standard of living.</p><p>“The rules have changed, and so Canadians understand that we need to bring our resources to market. We need to diversify our economy. This is our moment as Canada,” Mr. Champagne said. “We make sure that we build what needs to be done here in this country to succeed and to prosper.”</p><p>Rising U.S. protectionism is damaging business investment in Canada, business leaders say.</p><p>One of Mr. Trump’s goals in threatening tariffs on allies, Canadian officials have repeatedly said, is to force investors to relocate manufacturing to the United States – at the expense of America’s trading partners. In addition, Mr. Trump has vowed to cut taxes and regulations, measures that could make the U.S. a more attractive market for businesses.</p><p>Other protectionist threats from the Republican White House include talk of more tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper. And by April 1, U.S. government departments and agencies are supposed to report to the White House on the country’s trade deficits with major trading partners and recommend measures to rebalance.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-trump-wants-us-banks-in-canada-he-says-after-speaking-with-trudeau/\">delayed tariffs</a> of 10 per cent on Canadian energy and critical minerals and 25 per cent on the rest of Canadian goods for 30 days after Ottawa agreed to more measures to fight organized crime and the illegal production and distribution of <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-fentanyl-trafficking-canada-us-border/\">fentanyl</a>.</p><p>Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford, who is campaigning for re-election as Ontario Premier, criticized the federal economic summit as a waste of time on Friday and urged Ottawa to tighten up the border to stop the flow of drugs on both sides. He suggested former chief of the defence staff Rick Hillier as an option for border czar. His office later clarified that Mr. Ford meant fentanyl czar, a position Mr. Trudeau said would soon be created.</p><p>“A message to the federal government: enough’s enough. I don’t need to be in a room looking at the people I’ve talked to a thousand times and coming up with this idea. You know what the Trump administration wants? They’ve been very very clear. They’ve been clear to me, they’ve been clear to everywhere in North America. They need to tighten up the border,” Mr. Ford said at a campaign stop in Scarborough.</p><div><p>Plenty of items are marked product of Canada or made in Canada, but what do these terms really mean?
