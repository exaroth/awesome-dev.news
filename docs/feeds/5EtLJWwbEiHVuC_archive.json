Additionally, we implemented centralized policy management for each client using OPA (Open Policy Agent) and policy language, significantly improving maintenance efficiency.\n\nThis session will provide practical and scalable design strategies and implementation methods for building robust systems that address authorization strategies using OPA.</article>","contentLength":1462,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/lTEgUizqTg4?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sponsored Keynote: Hitachi’s Keycloak Journey - Evolution of Business and Community - Michito Okai","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUR9_gZZOfY","date":1750427381,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":163580,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

According to the MCP specification, OAuth 2.1 needs to be used for that, which implies that there is the possibility of using Keycloak for end user authentication and authorization because Keycloak supported OAuth 2.1.\n\nFirstly, Takashi talks about MCP briefly and describes end user authentication and authorization of MCP in more detail.
