Molly Roberts: Why have some companies decided finally that having offices full of employees is better for them? 

Heather Long: It's a loaded question, but I would say, unfortunately, 2025 is the year of operational efficiency, and that's corporate speak for save money at all costs. How do you save money? The easiest way is to get people to quit. What are these return to office mandates, particularly the five day a week in office mandates? We have a lot of data on this now, and it shows people will quit and you don't even have to pay them severance to do it. 

Molly Roberts: It's not about productivity for the people who are in the office, then, you think. It's more about just cutting down on the size of the workforce generally. 

Heather Long: I do think so. There has been a decent amount of research so far on fully remote, hybrid and fully in office. It's a mixed bag for fully remote. That's why I think if you look at the Fortune 500, only about 16 companies are fully remote, but a lot of them are hybrid. The reason that so much companies are hybrid is because that's the sweet spot. There is no productivity difference between the hybrid schedule and fully in the office five days a week. But what you do see a big difference is employee satisfaction and happiness and employee retention.... 
I think if what we're talking about is places that have been able to do work from home successfully for the past several years, why are they suddenly in 2025, saying the whole world has changed and we need to come back to the office five days a week? You should definitely be skeptical. 
"Who are the first people to leave in these scenarios? It's star employees who know they can get a job elsewhere," Long says (adding later that "There's also quantifiable data that show that, particularly parents, the childcare issues are real.") Long also point out that most of Nvidia's workforce is fully remote ‚Äî and that housing prices have spiked in some areas where employers are now demanding people return to the office. 

But employers also know hiring rates are now low, argues Long, so they're pushing their advantage ‚Äî possibly out of some misplaced nostalgie. "[T]here's a huge, huge perception difference between what managers, particularly senior leaders in an organization, how effective they think in offices versus what the rank and file people think. Rank and file people tend to prefer hybrid because they don't want their time wasted." 

Their discussion also notes a recent Harvard Business School survey that found that 40% of people would trade 5% or more of their salaries to work from home....]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Reality of Alzheimer&apos;s Research</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN3obqnV8tY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BN3obqnV8tY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:10:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The cost of caring for people with Alzheimer's in the United States is expected to increase to $1 trillion by 2060, but much of the research to find a cure is coming into question.

The stadium‚Äôs latest $560M renovation‚Äìfrom the concession stands to the seating bowl‚Äìhelped save it from demolition after Hurricane Katrina. NFL games have increasingly become more expensive with the addition of amenities like luxury field suites and club lounges, but all of these redesigns are done in order to increase revenue and efficiency. WSJ spoke with the architect behind the Superdome‚Äôs plan, who explains how stadium design is evolving to create more revenue streams.

I always wanted to try something new but kept putting it off. Finally I decided to give Rust a shot to see what all the hype was about.I‚Äôm still learning, and there‚Äôs definitely a lot more to explore, but after using Rust (casually) for about a month, I wanted to share my thoughts so far. And hopefully maybe get some feedback from more experienced Rust users.Coming from C/C++, having a package manager that "just works" feels amazing. Honestly, this might be my favorite thing about Rust.The first week was rough, I almost gave up. But once things clicked, I started feeling way more confident. And what I mean by "productive" is that feeling when you can just sit down and get shit done.Having a solid C background and a CS degree definitely helped, but I actually didn't struggle much with ownership/borrowing. It‚Äôs nice not having to worry about leaks every time I‚Äôm working with memory.Rust‚Äôs documentation is amazing. Not many languages have this level of high quality learning material. The Rust Book had everything I needed to get started.Things I Don‚Äôt Like About RustOkay, maybe this is just me being stuck in my OOP habits (aka skill issues), but Rust feels a little weird in this area. I get that Rust isn‚Äôt really an OOP language, but it‚Äôs also not fully functional either (at least from my understanding). Since it already has the  keyword, it feels like there was some effort to include OOP features. A lot of modern languages mix OOP and functional programming, and honestly I think having full-fledged classes and inheritance would make Rust more accessible for people like me.I haven‚Äôt looked into the details of how the Rust compiler works under the hood, but wow! some of these compile times are super painful, especially for bigger projects. Compared to C, it‚Äôs way slower. Would love to know why.All in all, my experience has been positive with Rust for the most parts, and I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to getting better at it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US military in Germany | Mapped Out</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uD_prW5sbQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-uD_prW5sbQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 13:17:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[No country in Europe hosts more US military personnel than Germany.

Bodil Stokke - Functional Programming Hipster & Computer Programmer at Sinopia Olive @bodilpwnz 

ABSTRACT
There‚Äôs no such thing as the perfect programming language. I‚Äôm sorry, but there isn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôll explain why.

On the other hand, if you were set the task of designing the perfect language, how close could you get, how would you go about it, and what would it look like in the end? We‚Äôre going to explore this problem space with a tour along the bleeding edge of modern language design, giving you some insight into what‚Äôs already out there, what tradeoffs each new idea comes with, and what sort of tools you might be working with in a future where programming is slightly less awful than it is today.

For over four decades, no one was able to pass the game's 117th screen (aka level 22-1) due to a glitch in the game's bonus timer that kills Mario well before he can reach the top of the stage's girders. That was true until last weekend, when Mario speedrunner Kosmic shared the news that he had passed the kill screen using a combination of frame-perfect emulator inputs, a well-known ladder movement glitch, and a bit of luck. And even though Kosmic's trick is functionally impossible to pull off with human reflexes on real hardware, the method shows how the game's seemingly insurmountable kill screen actually can be overcome without modifying the code on an official Donkey Kong arcade board.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to set necessary permissions to use oidc from github actions to aws eks?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ikmlns/how_to_set_necessary_permissions_to_use_oidc_from/</link><author>/u/HumanResult3379</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 12:52:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I want to run ,  and  in github actions workflow to operate kubernetes cluster in AWS EKS.If use AWS' OIDC, create a role for github actions, how many permissions are necessary to set?Also, is it okay just create an OIDC role in AWS?

Last year, the ICC issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the nation's former defense minister over the military campaign in Gaza. Earlier this week, Trump said more than 2 million residents of Gaza should move abroad so US companies could clear the landscape and rebuild it after the Israel-Hamas war.

Former UK Ambassador to the UK, Nigel Sheinwald, says President Trump's vision for the future of Gaza remains unclear, as many doubt the immediate ramification of the conflict and ceasefire. "The idea that extending the McKinley doctrine of a century and a quarter ago, to taking scraps of land around the world, that does not make sense today," Sheinwald says.

Sheinwald joined "The Pulse with Francine Lacqua" on Bloomberg TV on Feb. 7, 2025.

ScienceAlert reports: "These are really high-energy electrons and protons that have found their way into Earth's inner magnetic environment," says astronomer David Sibeck of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who was not involved with the research. "Some might stay in this place for a very long time." In fact, the belts remained intact for much longer than previous temporary radiation belts generated by solar storms: three months, compared to the weeks we'd normally expect.
 
Subsequent solar storms in June and August of 2024 knocked most of the particles out of orbit, significantly diminishing the density of the belts. A small amount, however, still remains up there, hanging out with Earth. What's more, the proton belt may remain intact for over a year. Ongoing measurements will help scientists measure its longevity and decay rate.
 
This is important information to have: particles in Earth orbit can pose a hazard to satellites hanging out up there, so knowing the particle density and the effects solar storms can have thereon can help engineers design mitigation strategies to protect our technology. At the moment, though, the hazard posed by the new radiation belts is unquantified. Future studies will be needed to determine the risks these, and future belts, might pose. The findings have been published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>fasterthanlime: The case for sans-io</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYHYiXMJdZI</link><author>/u/Orange_Tux</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 09:44:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Protest held in Amman against Trump‚Äôs proposals for Gaza</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW0_kRC7514</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HW0_kRC7514?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 09:26:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The march in downtown Amman was organized by the Muslim Brotherhood Party and several opposition parties.

"Both Estonia and the other Baltic countries have left Russia's frequency area."All three countries have successfully disconnected from the Russian-controlled and BRELL agreement-managed IPS/UPS system, and Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian transmission system operators (TSOs) Elering, Augstsprieguma tƒ´kls (AST) and Litgrid are currently operating independently in island mode, Elering said in a press release Saturday morning.The Baltic TSOs will conduct isolated operation testing before synchronizing with the Continental European Synchronous Area (CESA) on Sunday, Elering said in a press release on Saturday."We managed just fine," K√∂ster confirmed."The whole process lasted nearly three hours," he explained. "Our southern neighbors began operations at 6 a.m. The lines between Lithuania and the K√∂nigsberg [Kaliningrad] area went offline at around 6:40,the Lithuania-Belarus lines at 7:30. The Latvia-Russia connection at 8, and now ours around 9 a.m."Asked why the disconnection in Estonia occurred at 9:09 a.m., not precisely at 9 o'clock, K√∂ster explained that such switchovers never happen at a precise minute.The disconnection had no impact on consumers, and all systems are stable and secure, Elering said."Right now, everything seems to be in tip-top shape," the spokesperson said, adding that there is no need to worry.Elering also confirmed that the Baltic states have the necessary frequency reserves for Saturday, and that the system's frequency is being managed in coordination between the three TSOs at their respective control centers.The BRELL agreement formally expired at 11:59 p.m. on Friday.Island mode operation testing to beginThe synchronization of the Baltic states with CESA is slated to take place on Sunday afternoon, before which the three TSOs will conduct island or isolated operation testing.At this time, the Baltic power grid will function independently, without being part of any other frequency area. Electricity demand during this period will be met via local power plants and direct current Estonian-Finnish and Lithuanian-Swedish connections.During the island operation test, the three Baltic TSOs will independently monitor the system's frequency, testing its resilience to various disturbances and readiness for isolated operation as well as performing frequency and voltage stability tests. This testing is expected to continue through Sunday afternoon."For a few hours, we'll simply be in this island state ‚Äî the Baltic countries will be completely separate, and we'll be managing our system ourselves," K√∂ster explained."We will start testing around midday," he continued. "We'll test how the system responds if the frequency is adjusted slightly, and whether it can properly restore the [right] frequency. But this is a miniscule fluctuation that certainly won't reach consumers; we're simply testing our systems."Everything is calm and everything is fine at the moment, the spokesperson added.Baltics to connect to Europe on SundayThe connection of the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian power grids to Continental Europe via Poland is scheduled to begin around 2 p.m. on Sunday, K√∂ster noted."These switchovers can't be planned ahead down to the exact minute," he said. "Nothing has changed. Tomorrow morning we'll be testing voltage fluctuations, and then, starting around midday, we'll start activities for connecting to Continental Europe. And these should be finished by around 2 p.m."The synchronization process with Continental Europe is scheduled to be completed on Sunday, February 9.Once synchronized, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will join the world's largest synchronous grid, serving more than 400 million consumers across 26 countries.Synchronization with CESA will allow for the independent, stable and reliable frequency control of the Baltics' energy grids, and will boost energy security in the region.The Baltic TSOs have been preparing for this transition by investing in the development of transmission infrastructure and equipment necessary for the safe operation of their electricity systems, Elering said.Elering CEO Kalle Kilk has also previously emphasized that synchronization with the European grid is a security matter as well.The Baltic power grids' synchronization process has been supported by the EU and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), including via co-funding for infrastructure investments as well as technical and operational support, which facilitated the process.The synchronization of the three Baltic countries with CESA via Poland has cost ‚Ç¨1.6 billion to date, 75 percent of which has been co-financed by the European Union and the rest of which has been covered by congestion revenue funds.Approximately ‚Ç¨350 million in investments have been made in Estonia alone.Investments have included the construction or reconstruction of 1,400 kilometers of high-voltage power lines across the Baltics, construction of new substations as well as upgrades of nearly 40 existing substations.Six synchronous condensers have also already been built across the three countries, with three more still under construction.While Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania hadn't purchased electricity from Russia or Belarus for several years, until Saturday morning they had remained operating within the Russian IPS/UPS system, whose frequency is centrally regulated in Moscow.Baltic TSOs Elering, AST and Litgrid first submitted their application to join the Continental European grid to the then-existing Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) in 2007.Plans to disconnect the Baltics from the electricity system that tied them to the former Soviet Union had been discussed for decades, but gained momentum after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, strong supporters of Kyiv, stopped purchasing electricity from Russia.The BRELL agreement-managed electricity grid was the last remaining link between the three countries and Russia, after they regained independence in the collapse of the Soviet Union and joined the EU and NATO in 2004, Reuters noted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Gold In Bank Of England&apos;s Vault Is Trading At A Discount</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbcMUXg0H7E</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UbcMUXg0H7E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 08:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gold in the Bank of England vault is trading at a discount as fears of Trump tariffs spark a scramble for bullion.

With respectto Minix, it seems you did the latter, but I don't know whether or not youdid that with Amoeba.>>If this was the only criterion for the "goodness" of a kernel, you'd be>>right.

Maybe.  Multiple users means multiple things being done simultaneously.  Iwouldn't bet on the buffer cache buying you so much that multithreadingmakes no difference.

As long as you don't sacrifice too much in the way of performance orarchitectural elegance in order to gain this.  Unfortunately, that's*exactly* what happened with Minix: in attempting to implement it onhardware of the lowest caliber, you ended up having to make designdecisions with respect to the architecture and implementation that havemade vintage Minix unusable as anything more than a personal toy operatingsystem.  For example: why didn't you implement a system call server asa layer between the file system and user programs?  My guess: you didn'thave enough memory on the target machine to do it.Put another way: you hit your original goal right on target, and are tobe applauded for that.  But in doing so, you missed a lot of othertargets that wouldn't have been hard to hit as well, with someconsideration of them.  I think.

Modify itso that it can take advantage of 386 protected mode.  Fix the tty driverso that it will give you multiple consoles.

As a working operating system (i.e.,one intended for a multi-user environment), however, I'd hesitate torecommend it, except that there really aren't any good alternatives(except Linux, of course, at least tentatively.

This powerful build orchestration tool takes the hassle out of managing complex builds and offers simplicity, flexibility, and performance for teams of all sizes.Docker Bake is an orchestration tool that streamlines Docker builds, similar to how Compose simplifies managing runtime environments. With Bake, you can define build stages and deployment environments in a declarative file, making complex builds easier to manage. It also leverages BuildKit‚Äôs parallelization and optimization features to speed up build times.While Dockerfiles are excellent for defining image build steps, teams often need to build multiple images and execute helper tasks like testing, linting, and code generation. Traditionally, this meant juggling numerous  commands with their own options and arguments ‚Äì a tedious and error-prone process.Bake changes the game by introducing a declarative file format that encapsulates all options and image dependencies, referred to as . Additionally, Bake‚Äôs ability to parallelize and deduplicate work ensures faster and more efficient builds.Challenges with complex Docker Build configuration:Managing long, complex build commands filled with countless flags and environment variables.Tedious workflows for building multiple images.Difficulty declaring builds for specific targets or environments.Requires a script or 3rd-party tool to make things manageableDocker Bake tackles these challenges with a better way to manage complex builds with a simple, declarative approach.Key benefits of Docker Bake: Replace complex chains of Docker build commands and scripts with a single  command while maintaining clear, version-controlled configuration files that are easy to understand and modify.: Express sophisticated build logic through HCL syntax and matrix builds, enabling dynamic configurations that adapt to different environments and requirements while supporting custom functions for advanced use cases.: Maintain standardized build configurations across teams and environments through version-controlled files and inheritance patterns, eliminating environment-specific build issues and reducing configuration drift.: Automatically parallelize independent builds and eliminate redundant operations through context deduplication and intelligent caching, dramatically reducing build times for complex multi-image workflows.: One simple Docker buildx bake command to replace all the flags and environment variables.Use cases for Docker Bake1. Monorepo and Image BakeryDocker Bake can help developers efficiently manage and build multiple related Docker images from a single source repository. Plus, they can leverage shared configurations and automated dependency handling to enforce organizational standards. Teams can maintain consistent build logic across dozens or hundreds of microservices in a single repository, reducing configuration drift and maintenance overhead. Shared base images and contexts are automatically deduplicated, dramatically reducing build times and storage costs. Enforce organizational standards through inherited configurations, ensuring all services follow security, tagging, and testing requirements. A single source of truth for build configurations makes it easier to implement organization-wide changes like base image updates or security patches.Docker Bake provides seamless compatibility with existing docker-compose.yml files, allowing direct use of your current configurations. Existing Compose users are able to get started using Bake with minimal effort. Teams can incrementally adopt advanced build features while still leveraging their existing compose workflows and knowledge. Use the same configuration for both local development (via compose) and production builds (via Bake), eliminating ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù issues.: Access powerful features like matrix builds and HCL expressions while maintaining compatibility with familiar compose syntax.: Seamlessly integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines that already understand compose files while adding Bake‚Äôs advanced build capabilities.3. Complex build configurationsCross-Platform Compatibility: Matrix builds enable teams to efficiently manage builds across multiple architectures, OS versions, and dependency combinations from a single configuration. HCL expressions allow builds to adapt to different environments, git branches, or CI variables without maintaining multiple configurations. Custom functions enable sophisticated logic for things like version calculation, tag generation, and conditional builds based on git history. Variable validation and inheritance ensure consistent configuration across complex build scenarios, reducing errors and maintenance burden. Groups and targets help organize large-scale build systems with dozens or hundreds of permutations, making them manageable and maintainable.With Bake-optimized builds as the foundation, developers can achieve more efficient Docker Build Cloud performance and faster builds.Enhanced Docker Build Cloud Performance: Instantly parallelize matrix builds across cloud infrastructure, turning hour-long build pipelines into minutes without managing build infrastructure. Leverage Build Cloud‚Äôs distributed caching and deduplication to dramatically reduce bandwidth usage and build times, which is especially valuable for remote teams. Save cost with DBC  Bake‚Äôs precise target definitions mean you only consume cloud resources for exactly what needs to be built. Teams can run complex multi-architecture builds without powerful local machines, enabling development from any device while maintaining build performance. Offload resource-intensive builds from CI runners to Build Cloud, reducing CI costs and queue times while improving reliability.What‚Äôs New in Bake for GA?Docker Bake has been an experimental feature for several years, allowing us to refine and improve it based on user feedback. So, there is already a strong set of ingredients that users love, such as targets and groups, variables, HCL Expression Support, inheritance capabilities, matrix targets, and additional contexts. With this GA release, Bake is now ready for production use, and we‚Äôve added several enhancements to make it more efficient, secure, and easier to use:Deduplicated Context Transfers Significantly speeds up build pipelines by eliminating redundant file transfers when multiple targets share the same build context. Enhances security and resource management by providing fine-grained control over what capabilities and resources builders can access during the build process. Simplifies configuration management by allowing teams to define reusable attribute sets that can be mixed, matched, and overridden across different targets. Prevents wasted time and resources by catching configuration errors before the actual build process begins.Deduplicate context transfersWhen you build targets concurrently using groups, build contexts are loaded independently for each target. If the same context is used by multiple targets in a group, that context is transferred once for each time it‚Äôs used. This can significantly impact build time, depending on your build configuration.Previously, the workaround required users to define a named context that loads the context files and then have each target reference the named context. But with Bake, this will be handled automatically now.Bake can automatically deduplicate context transfers from targets sharing the same context. When you build targets concurrently using groups, build contexts are loaded independently for each target. If the same context is used by multiple targets in a group, that context is transferred once for each time it‚Äôs used. This more efficient approach leads to much faster build time.¬†Read more about how to speed up your build time in our docs.¬†Bake now includes entitlements to control access to privileged operations, aligning with Build. This prevents unintended side effects and security risks. If Bake detects a potential issue ‚Äî like a privileged access request or an attempt to access files outside the current directory ‚Äî the build will fail unless explicitly allowed.To be consistent, the Bake command now supports the flag to grant access to additional entitlements. The following entitlements are currently supported for Bake.Build equivalents
 Allows executions with host networking.--allow security.insecure Allows executions without sandbox. (i.e. ‚Äîprivileged)File system: Grant filesystem access for builds that need access files outside the working directory. This will impact context, output, cache-from, cache-to, dockerfile, secret Grant read and write access to files outside the working directory. Grant read access to files outside the working directory.--allow fs.write=<path|*>  Grant write access to files outside the working directory.ssh
‚Äì Allows exposing SSH agent.Several attributes previously had to be defined in CSV (e.g. ). These were challenging to read and couldn‚Äôt be easily overridden. The following can now be defined as structured objects:target "app" {
		attest = [
			{ type = "provenance", mode = "max" },
			{ type = "sbom", disabled = true}
		]

		cache-from = [
			{ type = "registry", ref = "user/app:cache" },
			{ type = "local", src = "path/to/cache"}
		]

		cache-to = [
			{ type = "local", dest = "path/to/cache" },
		]

		output = [
			{ type = "oci", dest = "../out.tar" },
			{ type = "local", dest="../out"}
		]

		secret = [
			{ id = "mysecret", src = "path/to/secret" },
			{ id = "mysecret2", env = "TOKEN" },
		]

		ssh = [
			{ id = "default" },
			{ id = "key", paths = ["path/to/key"] },
		]
}As such, the attributes are now composable. Teams can mix, match, and override attributes across different targets which simplifies configuration management. target "app-dev" {
    attest = [
			{ type = "provenance", mode = "min" },
			{ type = "sbom", disabled = true}
		]
  }

  target "app-prod" {
    inherits = ["app-dev"]

    attest = [
			{ type = "provenance", mode = "max" },
		]
  }
Bake now supports validation for variables similar to Terraform to help developers catch and resolve configuration errors early. The GA for Bake also supports the following use cases.To verify that the value of a variable conforms to an expected type, value range, or other condition, you can define custom validation rules using the  block.variable "FOO" {
  validation {
    condition = FOO != ""
    error_message = "FOO is required."
  }
}

target "default" {
  args = {
    FOO = FOO
  }
}
To evaluate more than one condition, define multiple  blocks for the variable. All conditions must be true.variable "FOO" {
  validation {
    condition = FOO != ""
    error_message = "FOO is required."
  }
  validation {
    condition = strlen(FOO) > 4
    error_message = "FOO must be longer than 4 characters."
  }
}

target "default" {
  args = {
    FOO = FOO
  }
}
Dependency on other variablesYou can reference other Bake variables in your condition expression, enabling validations that enforce dependencies between variables. This ensures that dependent variables are set correctly before proceeding.variable "FOO" {}
variable "BAR" {
  validation {
    condition = FOO != ""
    error_message = "BAR requires FOO to be set."
  }
}

target "default" {
  args = {
    BAR = BAR
  }
}
In addition to updating the Bake configuration, we‚Äôve added a new ‚Äìlist option. Previously, if you were unfamiliar with a project or wanted a reminder of the supported targets and variables, you would have to read through the file. Now, the list option will allow you to quickly query a list of them. It also supports the JSON format option if you need programmatic access.Quickly get a list of the targets available in your Bake configuration.docker buildx bake --list targetsdocker buildx bake --list type=targets,format=jsonGet a list of variables available for your Bake configuration.docker buildx bake --list variablesdocker buildx bake --list type=variables,format=jsonThese improvements build on a powerful feature set, ensuring Bake is both reliable and future-ready.Get started with Docker BakeReady to simplify your builds?

Once linked, the two pieces of hardware could be treated as a single quantum computer, allowing simple algorithms to be performed that involved operations on both sides of the 2-meter gap. [...] The Oxford team was simply interested in a proof-of-concept, and so used an extremely simplified system. Each end of the 2-meter gap had a single trap holding two ions, one strontium and one calcium. The two atoms could be entangled with each other, getting them to operate as a single unit.
 
The calcium ion served as a local memory and was used in computations, while the strontium ion served as one of the two ends of the quantum network. An optical cable between the two ion traps allowed photons to entangle the two strontium ions, getting the whole system to operate as a single unit. The key thing about the entanglement processes used here is that a failure to entangle left the system in its original state, meaning that the researchers could simply keep trying until the qubits were entangled. The entanglement event would also lead to a photon that could be measured, allowing the team to know when success had been achieved (this sort of entanglement with a success signal is termed "heralded" by those in the field).
 
The researchers showed that this setup allowed them to teleport with a specific gate operation (controlled-Z), which can serve as the basis for any other two-qubit gate operation -- any operation you might want to do can be done by using a specific combination of these gates. After performing multiple rounds of these gates, the team found that the typical fidelity was in the area of 70 percent. But they also found that errors typically had nothing to do with the teleportation process and were the product of local operations at one of the two ends of the network. They suspect that using commercial hardware, which has far lower error rates, would improve things dramatically. Finally, they performed a version of Grover's algorithm, which can, with a single query, identify a single item from an arbitrarily large unordered list. The "arbitrary" aspect is set by the number of available qubits; in this case, having only two qubits, the list maxed out at four items. Still, it worked, again with a fidelity of about 70 percent.
 
While the work was done with trapped ions, almost every type of qubit in development can be controlled with photons, so the general approach is hardware-agnostic. And, given the sophistication of our optical hardware, it should be possible to link multiple chips at various distances, all using hardware that doesn't require the best vacuum or the lowest temperatures we can generate. That said, the error rate of the teleportation steps may still be a problem, even if it was lower than the basic hardware rate in these experiments. The fidelity there was 97 percent, which is lower than the hardware error rates of most qubits and high enough that we couldn't execute too many of these before the probability of errors gets unacceptably high.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AnyOf&lt;L, R&gt; : Neither | Either&lt;L, R&gt; | Both&lt;L, R&gt;</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ikdp13/anyofl_r_neither_eitherl_r_bothl_r/</link><author>/u/OkResponsibility9677</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 03:17:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My first crate mature enough to talk about:.‚ÑπÔ∏è This library allows you to use the  type, which is a sum type of a product type of two types.‚ÑπÔ∏è It enables you to represent anything in a type-safe manner.

Mechanisms and HeterogeneityC.13. Mechanisms: Descriptive Evidence on Demand SideA relevant question is whether the effects of contagious slant are driven by supply or demand ‚Äì that is, a direct influence on news producers, or else theirs response to changes in reader preferences. Newspaper readers, influenced by their cable news consumption, might demand more slanted news content. On the supply side, owners, editors, or journalists exposed to certain channels may borrow the associated slanted content and push it to consumers.\
The previous literature has produced mixed evidence, with some work showing that slant across U.S. newspapers reflects the political preferences of readers rather than producers (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010), while other work has shown that media owners do influence news content (Gilens and Hertzman, 2000; Martin and McCrain, 2019; Mastrorocco and Ornaghi, 2020; Szeidl and Szucs, 2021). Given the declining revenues in the local news industry during the 2005-2008 time period (Evans, 2009; Rolnik et al., 2019; Djourelova et al., 2021), it could be that newspapers have less leeway to deviate from consumer preferences in favor of producer preferences. On the other hand, lower revenues might also reduce newsmaking resources. Then, borrowing content from national platforms may provide a cheap production alternative to original reporting.\
The features of the institutional setting make direct influence of journalists, either through production costs or ideological preferences, a less likely or at least less salient mechanism for the observed 2SLS effects. A journalist can easily access cable news and borrow material, regardless of the local channel position (assuming that journalists are relatively sophisticated news consumers). Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) discuss this issue in the context of voting, where one would expect cable news to influence swing voters who don‚Äôt have a strong partisan commitment. Ash and Poyker (2019) make a similar point for judges: cable news influences criminal sentencing through voters and judicial elections rather than persuading judges directly.\
Here, we provide some descriptive evidence on the demand side by comparing the effects of cable-channel exposure on news content to the parallel effects on Republican vote share documented in previous work (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017; Ash et al., 2021). If the contagious-slant effects are driven by responses to a cable news-induced demand shift among readers, we would expect newspapers to react most in counties where the FNC effect on Republican voting is the largest. To test for this possibility, we use a machine-learning approach to model heterogeneous treatment effects across counties in the response to the channel-position instrument. This generalized model ‚Äì a causal forest from Athey et al. (2019) ‚Äì allows the reduced form effect of channel position to vary flexibly with local covariates. After collapsing the data to the county level, we train two models ‚Äì one with newspaper slant as the outcome and a second with 2008 Republican vote share as the outcome.\
Using the trained causal forests, we predict county-specific treatment effects for both outcomes. Figure C.6 shows that the predicted effect sizes for each outcome are highly correlated across counties (with a Pearson‚Äôs correlation of 0.25). Further, Table C.16 shows that similar covariates predict a strong response for both news similarity and Republican vote share. Overall, these findings suggest that the types of counties who are responsive to cable news exposure in their voting are also responsive in the associated news content similarity.

In Table C.14, re-run our main specification, but instead of bigram-based similarity with FNC, we regress vocabulary size (normalized by the total size of the corpus, column 1), average word length (column 2), average sentence length (column 3), and average article length (column 4) on instrumented FNC viewership relative to MSNBC and CNN. As before, we include demographic and channel controls. We also account for the size of the newspaper-specific corpus. [22] None of the coefficients are significant or close to significant. These results are consistent with the interpretation that our main results are driven by FNC-specific bigrams that diffuse into local newspaper content. [23][22] The number of articles scraped is given by the availability on NewsLibrary. It does not seem to follow a pattern: the correlation between corpus size and circulation by newspaper is rather small, around 0.3. The correlation between similarity with FNC and corpus size is, if anything, negative (around -0.21).\

The underlying reasons for this widespread adoption have been discussed extensively elsewhere and will not be reiterated here.The high level of Starlink usage sparked a successful petition backed by 70% of the island‚Äôs population. This petition demanded both a reduction of the ¬£5,400 FIG VSAT licence fee and formal approval for Starlink‚Äôs operation in the Falkland Islands.In response, a Starlink Select Committee ‚Äì comprising all of the island‚Äôs MLAs ‚Äì convened from July to October 2024. The committee formally endorsed the petition‚Äôs demands, and the proposal was subsequently forwarded to the Falkland Islands Government (FIG) for implementation. However, the effective date for this approval has now been delayed until April.Because Sure International holds an exclusive monopoly telecommunications licence, Starlink‚Äôs use in the islands is currently illegal. Nonetheless, this restriction has not prevented the widespread installation of hundreds of Starlink terminals, which remain unlicensed.At this time, Starlink has not received an official government statement endorsing its use in the Falkland Islands ‚Äì a prerequisite for adding the territory to Starlink‚Äôs approved list of service areas. As a result, using Starlink in the islands continues to be illegal and is considered a criminal offence.The ¬£5,400 FIG VSAT licenceIn addition to the hundreds of unlicensed Starlink terminals operating on the islands, two groups of users are deemed ‚Äúlegal‚Äù by FIG ‚Äì even though Starlink has not yet received formal permission to provide service in the Falkland Islands.Starlink‚Äôs low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are classified as very small aperture terminal (VSAT), a contentious categorisation. This definition was partly adopted to prevent islanders from self-provisioning internet services, thereby protecting Sure International‚Äôs telecommunications monopoly. Notably, the original legislation included an exemption for Falkland Islands government entities, allowing them to use Starlink without requiring a VSAT licence.In 2024, several government departments took advantage of this exemption to install Starlink terminals ‚Äì a move that garnered widespread support. Among the early adopters were FIG‚Äôs IT department and the Falkland Islands Development Corporation (FIDC). The KEMH is ‚Äòearmarked‚Äô for Starlink use, but it has yet to be installed.That same year, rising demand from individuals and local businesses prompted the Communications Regulator to issue a limited number of FIG VSAT licences. Although the exact number remains undisclosed outside of government circles, estimates suggest that approximately fourteen licences were granted, including, among others, most of the island‚Äôs fishing companies, the inter-island ferry, and International Tours & Travel the local agent for LATAM flights.It is important to emphasize that until FIG formally permits Starlink to operate in the Falkland Islands, any use of Starlink remains officially illegal. Consequently, neither of these two user groups are operating within a fully legal framework no differently than the hundreds of consumer ‚Äòillegal‚Äô users.Questionable FIG-issued VSAT licences effectively permit Starlink usage from a FIG perspective, even though the service is still legally classified as a criminal act.Starlink users who have paid ¬£5,400 for a FIG VSAT licence are not, in any way, in a beneficial position compared to the hundreds of¬† ‚Äòillegal‚Äô consumer users and cannot be considered to be so.A message from the Communications Regulator was distributed this morning.I‚Äôve had reports this morning that some users have had their Starlink services disabled. If you have got back to me already with the below information, then this has already been passed to a team at Starlink who I understand will work to keep the service on. If you haven‚Äôt got back to me with the information below, then please do so asap. ¬† I hope that you haven‚Äôt lost access and please be assured I am working to address this. So sorry for any inconvenience caused ‚Äì which I am sure would be significant! ¬† Many thanks ‚Äì and do give me a call if you need!‚ÄùThere is currently no ethical or legal basis for Starlink to differentiate between supplying service to users holding FIG VSAT licences and the hundreds of unlicensed users on the Falkland Islands.Requesting such differentiation is highly controversial. It would force Starlink into an ethically and legally precarious position ‚Äì essentially endorsing a select group of users while its service remains a criminal offence under Falkland Islands law. In this context, holding a FIG VSAT licence does not change the legal status of Starlink usage.An emergency needs emergency actions.The sudden shutdown of Starlink services clearly qualifies as a National Emergency due to the widespread and unforeseen consequences such an action would have. Moreover, the government finds itself in a difficult position concerning holders of a FIG VSAT licence as they are threatened too.For instance, if Sure Falkland Islands Intelsat satellite(s) were damaged by space debris ‚Äì thereby cutting off the islands‚Äô communications ‚Äì the situation would undoubtedly be classified as a National Emergency.Allowing the current situation to continue until April seems untenable, especially since many more Starlink users risk losing service as their roaming periods expire in the coming months. This issue could be resolved in a number of days if a National Emergency were declared.During the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, a National Emergency was declared within half a day, demonstrating how quickly decisive action can be taken when circumstances demand it. ‚ÄúNothing contained in or done under the authority of a law shall be held to be inconsistent with or in contravention of any of the provisions of this Chapter, except for sections 2, 3, 4, 6(2)(a), 6(5), 6(6), 6(7) and 6(‚Ä¶), to the extent that the law authorises the taking of measures during any period of public emergency that are reasonably justifiable for addressing the situation in the Falkland Islands during that period.‚ÄùIt is important to note that the declaration of a National Emergency can only be made by the Falkland Islands Government following an emergency meeting of the EXCO.Surely, it must be to everyone‚Äôs benefit to get this situation resolved as soon as possible by permitting Starlink to operate in the Falkland Islands now?Sure‚Äôs post this morning.Chris Gare, OpenFalklands February 2025, copyright OpenFalklands]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cable News&apos; Effects on Newspaper Content: A Deeper Insight</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/cable-news-effects-on-newspaper-content-a-deeper-insight?source=rss</link><author>Tech Media Bias [Research Publication]</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 02:33:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[6.

While the law remains in limbo due to industry influence and legal challenges, broader enforcement issues persist across multiple states, with corporations often ignoring right-to-repair laws despite their legal passage. Techdirt reports: A little over a year ago, Maine residents voted overwhelmingly (83 percent) to pass a new state right to repair law designed to make auto repairs easier and more affordable. More specifically, the law requires that automakers standardize on-board diagnostic systems and provide remote access to those systems and mechanical data to consumers and third-party independent repair shops. But as we've seen with other states that have passed right to reform laws (most notably New York), passing the law isn't the end of the story. Corporate lobbyists have had great success not just watering these laws down before passage, but after voters approve them. They've also been swarmed by coordinated industry lawsuits and falsehood-spewing attacks.
 
Maine's popular right to repair law just took effect after a year of hashing out the fine details, but the bill's still being changed as the state tries to sort out enforcement. Large automakers have been looming over that process to try and weaken the law. But the Alliance For Automotive Innovation also just filed a new lawsuit saying the law isn't fully cooked and therefore violates the law: "This is an example of putting the cart before the horse. Before automakers can comply, the law requires the attorney general to first establish an 'independent entity' to securely administer access to vehicle data. The independent entity hasn't been established. That's not in dispute. Compliance with the law right now is not possible."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LinuxPlay ‚Äì A Fast, Open-Source Remote Desktop for Linux</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ikc564/linuxplay_a_fast_opensource_remote_desktop_for/</link><author>/u/Techlm77</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:58:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been working on LinuxPlay, a low-latency, fully open-source remote desktop solution designed specifically for Linux.

But it‚Äôs ultra-useful if you can close the loop between the LLM and the execution environment (with an ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù setup). There‚Äôs lots to say about this, but for the moment: it‚Äôs a semi-effective antidote to hallucination: the LLM generates the code, the agent scaffolding runs the code, the code generates errors, the agent feeds it back to the LLM, the process iterates. So, obviously, the issue here is you don‚Äôt want this iterative development process happening on your development laptop, because LLMs have boundary issues, and they‚Äôll iterate on your system configuration just as happily on the Git project you happen to be working in. A thing you‚Äôd really like to be able to do: run a closed-loop agent-y (‚Äúagentic‚Äù? is that what we say now) configuration for an LLM, on a clean-slate Linux instance that spins up instantly and that can‚Äôt screw you over in any way. You get where we‚Äôre going with this.Anyways! I would like to register a concern.Emacs hosts the spiritual forebearer of remote editing systems, a blob of hyper-useful Elisp called ‚ÄúTramp‚Äù. If you can hook Tramp up to any kind of interactive environment ‚Äî usually, an SSH session ‚Äî where it can run Bourne shell commands, it can extend Emacs to that environment.So, VSCode has a feature like Tramp. Which, neat, right? You‚Äôd think, take Tramp, maybe simplify it a bit, switch out Elisp for Typescript.Unlike Tramp, which lives off the land on the remote connection, VSCode mounts a full-scale invasion: it runs a Bash snippet stager that downloads an agent, including a binary installation of Node. The agent runs over port-forwarded SSH. It establishes a WebSockets connection back to your running VSCode front-end. The underlying protocol on that connection can:Wander around the filesystem
Launch its own shell PTY processes
In security-world, there‚Äôs a name for tools that work this way. I won‚Äôt say it out loud, because that‚Äôs not fair to VSCode, but let‚Äôs just say the name is murid in nature.I would be a little nervous about letting people VSCode-remote-edit stuff on dev servers, and apoplectic if that happened during an incident on something in production. It turns out we don‚Äôt have to care about any of this to get a custom connection to a Fly Machine working in VSCode, so none of this matters in any kind of deep way, but: we‚Äôve decided to just be a blog again, so: we had to learn this, and now you do too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s 7-Year Slog To Improve Chrome Extensions Still Hasn&apos;t Satisfied Developers</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/07/2246202/googles-7-year-slog-to-improve-chrome-extensions-still-hasnt-satisfied-developers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Register's Thomas Claburn reports: Google's overhaul of Chrome's extension architecture continues to pose problems for developers of ad blockers, content filters, and privacy tools. [...] While Google's desire to improve the security, privacy, and performance of the Chrome extension platform is reasonable, its approach -- which focuses on code and permissions more than human oversight -- remains a work-in-progress that has left extension developers frustrated.
 
Alexei Miagkov, senior staff technology at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who oversees the organization's Privacy Badger extension, told The Register, "Making extensions under MV3 is much harder than making extensions under MV2. That's just a fact. They made things harder to build and more confusing." Miagkov said with Privacy Badger the problem has been the slowness with which Google addresses gaps in the MV3 platform. "It feels like MV3 is here and the web extensions team at Google is in no rush to fix the frayed ends, to fix what's missing or what's broken still." According to Google's documentation, "There are currently no open issues considered a critical platform gap," and various issues have been addressed through the addition of new API capabilities.
 
Miagkov described an unresolved problem that means Privacy Badger is unable to strip Google tracking redirects on Google sites. "We can't do it the correct way because when Google engineers design the [chrome.declarativeNetRequest API], they fail to think of this scenario," he said. "We can do a redirect to get rid of the tracking, but it ends up being a broken redirect for a lot of URLs. Basically, if the URL has any kind of query string parameters -- the question mark and anything beyond that -- we will break the link." Miagkov said a Chrome developer relations engineer had helped identify a workaround, but it's not great. Miagkov thinks these problems are of Google's own making -- the company changed the rules and has been slow to write the new ones. "It was completely predictable because they moved the ability to fix things from extensions to themselves," he said. "And now they need to fix things and they're not doing it."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elf Beauty shares crater; company in part blames TikTok, LA fires | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGt-LVlHnG8</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iGt-LVlHnG8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:22:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shares of cosmetics company Elf Beauty plunged after it cut its annual net sales and profit forecasts.

Kennedy also invoked a moral responsibilty, pointing to America's economic obligations as the wealthiest people in a world of largely poor people. Six decades later USAID provides tens of billions of dollars of humanitarian aid to countries around the world.

But that is about to change. In a move to slash wasteful spending, spearheaded by Elon Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump White House this week began slashing most of USAID's workforce. It's feared that the decision to defund USAID by Donald Trump and Elon Musk, two of the world's richest people could hurt millions of the world's poorest people.

Though security researchers doubt on the legitimacy of the breach, the AI company stated that it takes the claims seriously, advising users to enable two-factor authentication and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Decrypt reports: Daily Dot reporter Mikael Thalan wrote on X that he found invalid email addresses in the supposed sample data: "No evidence (suggests) this alleged OpenAI breach is legitimate. At least two addresses were invalid. The user's only other post on the forum is for a stealer log. Thread has since been deleted as well."

Established in 1875, HSHS works with over 2,200 physicians and has around 12,000 employees. It also operates a network of physician practices and 15 local hospitals across Illinois and Wisconsin, including two children's hospitals. The non-profit healthcare system said in data breach notifications sent to those impacted that the incident was discovered on August 27, 2023, after detecting that the attacker had gained access to HSHS' network.
 
After the security breach, its systems were also impacted by a widespread outage that took down "virtually all operating systems" and phone systems across Illinois and Wisconsin hospitals. HSHS also hired external security experts to investigate the attack, assess its impact, and help its IT team restore affected systems. [...] While the incident and the resulting outage have all the signs of a ransomware attack, no ransomware operation has claimed the breach. Following the forensic investigation, HSHS found that the attackers had accessed files on compromised systems between August 16 and August 27, 2023.
 
The information accessed by the threat actors while inside HSHS' systems varies for each impacted individual, and it includes a combination of name, address, date of birth, medical record number, limited treatment information, health insurance information, Social Security number, and/or driver's license number. While HSHS added that there is no evidence that the victims' information has been used in fraud or identity theft attempts, it warned affected individuals to monitor their account statements and credit reports for suspicious activity. The health system also offers those affected by the breach one year of free Equifax credit monitoring.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tariffs, the Future of Cancer and Alzheimer&apos;s, Global Debt Cycles | Wall Street Week</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM4s4yvI3xs</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DM4s4yvI3xs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.

It also seemed to put Treasury Secretary¬†Scott Bessent¬†in the middle of a delicate standoff between bureaucrats at the agency he is charged with leading and President¬†Donald Trump‚Äôs loudest adviser.

With Trump‚Äôs blessing, Musk, the world‚Äôs richest man and chief executive of automaker¬†Tesla Inc., has been leading a tornadic campaign to remake the federal bureaucracy that some critics have called illegal.

Wendy Schiller, professor of political science at Brown University, examines how public sentiment could impact the president's willingness to allow Musk to continue with his cost-cutting mandate. Professor Schiller speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

From the report: The Culture, Media and Sport Committee and Science, Innovation and Technology Committee asked composer Max Richter how he would know if "bad-faith actors" were using his material to train AI models. "There's really nothing I can do," he told MPs. "There are a couple of music AI models, and it's perfectly easy to make them generate a piece of music that sounds uncannily like me. That wouldn't be possible unless it had hoovered up my stuff without asking me and without paying for it. That's happening on a huge scale. It's obviously happened to basically every artist whose work is on the internet."
 
Richter, whose work has been used in a number of major film and television scores, said the consequences for creative musicians and composers would be dire. "You're going to get a vanilla-ization of music culture as automated material starts to edge out human creators, and you're also going to get an impoverishing of human creators," he said. "It's worth remembering that the music business in the UK is a real success story. It's 7.6 billion-pound income last year, with over 200,000 people employed. That is a big impact. If we allow the erosion of copyright, which is really how value is created in the music sector, then we're going to be in a position where there won't be artists in the future."
 
Speaking earlier, former Google staffer James Smith said much of the damage from text and data mining had likely already been done. "The original sin, if you like, has happened," said Smith, co-founder and chief executive of Human Native AI. "The question is, how do we move forward? I would like to see the government put more effort into supporting licensing as a viable alternative monetization model for the internet in the age of these new AI agents."
 
Matt Rogerson, director of global public policy and platform strategy at the Financial Times, said: "We can only deal with what we see in front of us and [that is] people taking our content, using it for the training, using it in substitutional ways. So from our perspective, we'll prosecute the same argument in every country where we operate, where we see our content being stolen." The risk, if the situation continued, was a hollowing out of creative and information industries, he said. [...] "The problem is we can't see who's stolen our content. We're just at this stage where these very large companies, which usually make margins of 90 percent, might have to take some smaller margin, and that's clearly going to be upsetting for their investors. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't. It's just a question of right and wrong and where we pitch this debate. Unfortunately, the government has pitched it in thinking that you can't reduce the margin of these big tech companies; otherwise, they won't build a datacenter."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Market Talk: Trump&apos;s &apos;radical&apos; tariffs could gut some company profits | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15MBLrbzwMw</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/15MBLrbzwMw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 23:13:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[George Cipolloni, PMEFX portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, said he hopes the Trump administration is listening to CEOs, such as Ford's Jim Farley, who say the president's tariff proposals would have a deleterious effect on their businesses.

However, Amazon assured customers in a statement on Friday that there is no risk of losing access to Prime Video because the decision affects only a limited functionality related to casting videos between devices.
 
"Prime Video will comply with this local judgement and is currently considering next steps. However, there is absolutely no risk at all for customers losing access to Prime Video," Amazon's Prime Video spokesperson told Reuters. Meanwhile, Nokia's chief licensing officer, Arvin Patel, said: "...the innovation ecosystem breaks down if patent holders are not fairly compensated for the use of their technologies, as it becomes much harder for innovators to fund the development of next generation technologies."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wanted to share with my super not interesting findings.

One employee named Melanie Kambadur expressed her refusal to participate in this kind of data collection in October 2022.‚ÄúTorrenting from a corporate laptop doesn‚Äôt feel right,‚Äù Nikolay Bashlykov, a Meta engineer responsible for this data collection, said in an April 2023 message. He added that the company needed to be cautious about the IP address from which they downloaded the materials. In September 2023, Bashlykov cautioned that torrenting could lead to ‚Äúseeding,‚Äù which ‚Äúcould be legally not OK.‚Äù These internal discussions suggest that Meta recognized this type of activity as unlawful, according to authors who have sued the company. In an internal message, Meta researcher Frank Zhang said that the company took measures to avoid using its servers when downloading the data set. This was to prevent anyone from being able to trace the seeding and the entity downloading the content.According to , new evidence indicates that Meta downloaded at least 81.7 TB of data from several libraries that offered copyrighted books via torrents. A recent document from the ongoing legal process revealed that at least 35.7 TB were downloaded from sites like Z-Library or LibGen (which was shut down in the summer).Meta seeks to dismiss the allegations. The company has filed a motion to dismiss these charges. Meta claims there‚Äôs no evidence that any of its employees downloaded books via torrents or that they were distributed by Meta.  has contacted the company for comments on the case and will update this post if we receive a response.This issue highlights the questionable practices that AI companies employ to train their models. It happened with Google, which updated its privacy policy in 2023 to say that it‚Äôll ‚Äúuse publicly available information to help train Google‚Äôs AI models.‚Äù It‚Äôs also evident with OpenAI, which used millions of texts, many of them copyrighted, to train ChatGPT. Perplexity recently came under scrutiny for bypassing the ‚Äúrules of the Internet‚Äù to feed its AI model.Internet theft is being normalized. What‚Äôs remarkable is that as companies increasingly skirt the rules and violate copyright, this behavior is starting to be seen as normal. There seems to be little time for outrage, and people often treat it as an accepted practice so they can continue with their business.Is this really ‚Äúfair use‚Äù? Many companies rely on the concept of ‚Äúfair use,‚Äù which allows for limited use of protected material without requiring permission. While copyright infringement lawsuits are emerging in the world of generative AI, they often seem to take a backseat as these large companies continue to thrive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fintech Rapyd seeks funding at $3.5B valuation, a steep drop from $9B</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/fintech-rapyd-seeks-funding-at-3-5b-valuation-a-steep-drop-from-9b/</link><author>Marina Temkin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 22:15:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rapyd Financial Network is reportedly looking to raise $300 million in a new funding at a steep valuation cut from its 2021 high.¬© 2024 TechCrunch.

Do not be fooled, however: WWE 2K20 and eFootball 2022 are just the outliers, arriving so poorly crafted as to cause notable outcry and an actual change to development plans. Most licensed professional sports games come out yearly, whether fully baked, notably improved, or not, and fans who have few other options to play with their favorite intellectual property learn to make do with them.
 
Not so with fans of Football Manager, a series that can be traced back in some form to 1992 that has released a game almost every year, minus one ownership shift in the early 2000s. Sports Interactive, the company behind the franchise, released a statement on Thursday (in British time) that says that "following extensive internal discussions and careful consideration," Football Manager 25 is canceled. The game was "too far away from the standards you deserve," so they are focusing on the 2026 version. [...]
 
The developer's statement notes that preorder customers are getting refunds. Answering a question that has always been obvious to fans but never publishers, the company notes that, no, Football Manager 2024 will not get an update with the new season's players and data. The company says it is looking to extend the 2024 version's presence on subscription platforms, like Xbox's Game Pass, and will "provide an update on this in due course." Fans eager to build out their dynasty team and end up with Bukayo Saka may be disappointed to miss out this year. But a developer with big ambitions to meaningfully improve and rethink a long-running franchise deserves some consideration amid the consternation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HackerNoon vs Bitcoin - The Ultimate Showdown You Didn&apos;t Ask For</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/hackernoon-vs-bitcoin-the-ultimate-showdown-you-didnt-ask-for?source=rss</link><author>M-Marvin Ken</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 22:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I explore with simplistic mathematical models to help me, how HackerNoon stacks up against Bitcoin, the most successful publishing machine on earth.

            Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a business gathering on Friday that US President Donald Trump‚Äôs threat to annex Canada ‚Äúis a real thing,‚Äù two Canadian business leaders who were at the meeting confirmed to CNN.
    
            Trudeau‚Äôs comments, first reported by the Toronto Star, were picked up on an open microphone when Trudeau believed the media had been escorted out.
    
            ‚ÄúMr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country and it is a real thing. In my conversations with him on‚Ä¶,‚Äù Trudeau said, according to audio from the Canada-US Economic Summit in Toronto shared by CBC News, before the microphone cut out.
    
            Trudeau made the comments after delivering an opening address at the summit, and after journalists had left the room, CBC reported.
    
            In an interview with CNN before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Trudeau said that Trump‚Äôs comments about turning Canada into the United States‚Äô 51st state are just a distraction from the consequences of Trump‚Äôs tariff threats.
    
            He added that Canada becoming another US state was ‚Äúnot going to happen.‚Äù
    
            ‚ÄúCanadians are incredibly proud of being Canadian. One of the ways we define ourselves most easily is, well, we‚Äôre not American,‚Äù he told CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Lead with Jake Tapper‚Äù in the interview in early January.
    
            ‚ÄúPresident Trump, who is a very skillful negotiator, is getting people to be somewhat distracted by that, by that conversation, to take away from the conversation around 25% tariffs on oil and gas and electricity and steel and aluminum and lumber and concrete,‚Äù Trudeau said in the CNN interview.
    
            Trump followed through with his threats to impose tariffs on Canada last week, announcing a new 25% duty on most Canadian goods imported into the US. However, after Trudeau made commitments to bolster security at Canada‚Äôs border, Trump announced Monday a pause on the proposed tariffs for at least a month.
    
            After a call with Trump, Trudeau said Canada would be implementing its previously announced $1.3 billion border plan, as well as committing to appointing a ‚Äúfentanyl czar‚Äù and listing cartels as terrorists.

One effective approach to protecting this data is  (for passwords and certain types of confidential information) and  (or encryption) when transmitting and storing data in event streams.\
Without these measures, a system can suffer not only from direct hacking but also from inadvertent leaks, for example, when logs are sent to a public repository or when Kafka access settings are misconfigured.\
In this article, we will explore the most commonly used algorithms, how they look in Go, and why these steps get special attention in information security. secures passwords and personal data, making them virtually irrecoverable for attackers. (or encryption) safeguards the information in event streams (Kafka), preventing third parties from reading it in case of leaks. and clearly defined  reinforce security and avert accidental leaks in the console or consumer group.Following gold-standard rules (a separate database for each service, migrations for any modifications, secure storage of passwords and keys, etc.) makes a system more resilient against cyberattacks.1. Hashing Data in the DatabaseSecurity in the event of database compromise: If someone gains access to your database (by dumping it or obtaining root privileges), hashed passwords or other sensitive information remain unreadable in plaintext form.Protecting brand and reputation: Leaking hashed credentials without the possibility of easily restoring the original data is much less damaging to a company‚Äôs reputation than leaking passwords in plain text.: Designed specifically for passwords; it has a customizable ‚Äúcost‚Äù parameter that hinders brute-force attempts by increasing computational complexity.: Suitable for hashing data not related to passwords when speed is important but cryptographic strength must still be maintained.Short Go example (bcrypt)package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt"
)

func hashPassword(password string) (string, error) {
    hash, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), bcrypt.DefaultCost)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return string(hash), nil
}
 generates a hash with the recommended complexity settings.Short Go example (SHA-256)package main

import (
    "crypto/sha256"
    "encoding/hex"
)

func hashData(data string) string {
    hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(data))
    return hex.EncodeToString(hash[:])
}
This method creates a cryptographically strong hash. It‚Äôs used for other types of data not necessarily linked to passwords.2. Obfuscation (Encryption) in Data Streaming\
When a system generates events (for example, through Event Sourcing) for marketing or analytics and sends them to Kafka (or another streaming service), there‚Äôs a risk that these messages may contain personal user data (email addresses, phone numbers, etc).  helps ensure this data won‚Äôt be accessible in plain text.\
Use case: Marketing and user dataMarketers need the data to segment the audience or evaluate user behavior.Each user event (registration, clicks, purchases, etc.) is sent to Kafka.If the events contain unencrypted personal data, accidental leaks, or a ‚Äúrogue‚Äù consumer connecting to the topic could result in serious consequences. with a strong algorithm, such as AES. to enable secure authentication and on-the-wire encryption. to Kafka topics via ACLs (Access Control Lists) and role-based policies.package main

import (
    "crypto/aes"
    "crypto/cipher"
    "crypto/rand"
    "encoding/base64"
    "fmt"
    "io"
)

func encryptAES(plaintext, key string) (string, error) {
    block, err := aes.NewCipher([]byte(key))
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    cipherText := make([]byte, aes.BlockSize+len(plaintext))
    iv := cipherText[:aes.BlockSize]

    if _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, iv); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    stream := cipher.NewCFBEncrypter(block, iv)
    stream.XORKeyStream(cipherText[aes.BlockSize:], []byte(plaintext))

    return base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(cipherText), nil
}

func main() {
    key := "myVerySecretKey12" // AES-128/256
    data := "User Email: user@example.com"

    encrypted, err := encryptAES(data, key)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println("Encrypted Data:", encrypted)
}
Thus, even if someone gains access to a message, they won‚Äôt be able to decrypt its contents without the key.3. Exceptions and Additional MeasuresDespite obfuscation being crucial, certain business scenarios demand de-identified data for analytics (for example, age or country). In those cases, you need to: (full name, exact email, phone number), replacing them with anonymized identifiers.Use certificates and authentication in Kafka so that no one without sufficient privileges can ‚Äújoin‚Äù your consumer group or read messages directly from the console.\
Sample command for secure topic access:kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
  --topic user-events \
  --consumer.config client-ssl.properties
The  file will contain the necessary certificate and key information for authentication.By combining hashing and obfuscation, as well as properly configuring access roles and migration processes, you achieve a multi-layered defense for user data. This not only lowers the potential risk of leaks but also enhances user and regulatory confidence in your system.¬†Each microservice should have its own database to isolate breaches and prevent unwanted cross-service access.Each user has a unique account: No shared accounts or passwords \u2014 this simplifies audit trails and accountability.Access roles clearly defined by policy: All data operations should be governed by predetermined rules (who can read, who can modify, etc.).All database changes via migrations only: Avoid arbitrary manual modifications to the database schema. Migrations provide transparency, versioning, and control.All passwords in Vault or k8s secrets (including the ‚Äúsalt‚Äù for decoding): Sensitive data should never be stored in code or exposed in Git. Use specialized solutions (HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, etc.).\
By following these recommendations, you significantly strengthen security in your infrastructure and minimize financial and reputational risks when dealing with user data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia takes the mining town Toretsk, as its troops close on the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk| DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDEUinDpfow</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HDEUinDpfow?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 21:30:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russia says it has captured the key mining town of Toretsk in eastern Ukraine after months of fighting.

One increasingly popular strategy to keep costs low is to shift hiring outside the US. From a report:√Ç Salesforce and Workday are simultaneously cutting jobs and highlighting the cost savings from adding workers internationally. "Do we need to hire everybody in San Francisco?" Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said at an event hosted by Barclays in December. "Or can we think about other locations that are cheaper where we can get really incredible labor like India and Mexico City." 

US-based employees at Salesforce dropped to 51% from 58% in the four years ending in January 2024. In early 2023, it announced a reduction of roughly 8,000 jobs. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the San Francisco-based software company would cut more than 1,000 positions in large part to make room for new AI-focused hiring. [...] Human resources software maker Workday, based in Pleasanton, California, announced Wednesday that it would eliminate about 1,750 jobs. Last year, Chief Executive Officer Carl Eschenbach emphasized a new focus on expanding margins, saying hiring more in countries like Costa Rica would help in this effort.√Ç]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After damage by scientists, Inuit group closes off access to Earth‚Äôs oldest rocks</title><link>https://www.science.org/content/article/after-damage-scientists-inuit-group-closes-access-earth-s-oldest-rocks</link><author>/u/ubcstaffer123</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 21:11:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: ExpenseOwl ‚Äì Simple, self-hosted expense tracker</title><link>https://github.com/Tanq16/ExpenseOwl</link><author>import-base64</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 20:56:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[media] cargo run rust projects with vscode&apos;s debugger attached using cargo-debugger!</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ik5gf6/media_cargo_run_rust_projects_with_vscodes/</link><author>/u/jkelleyrtp</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 20:55:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One of Elon Musk‚Äôs young DOGE engineers explains how he won the $700K Vesuvius Challenge</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/one-of-elon-musks-young-doge-engineers-explains-how-he-won-the-700k-vesuvius-challenge/</link><author>Margaux MacColl</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 20:44:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk has reportedly picked fresh-faced six engineers to run DOGE.¬†I spoke to one of them in 2023, when his life looked very, very different. ¬© 2024 TechCrunch.

One group reportedly advanced from Makhnovka toward Cherkasskaya Konopelka, Fanaseyevka, and Ulanok, while another attempted an assault from Dmitriukov toward Russkaya Konopelka ‚Äì the latter attack was reportedly repelled.There is disagreement among Russian sources over Ukrainian gains. A Kremlin-affiliated milblogger claimed that Ukraine had seized Cherkasskaya Konopelka, but others denied this. Some reports suggested Ukrainian forces broke through to or even seized Ulanok, though this claim is also disputed. ISW has not yet verified geolocated evidence of Ukrainian forces operating in Ulanok.The Russian Telegram channel ‚ÄúZapiski Veterana‚Äù [Veteran‚Äôs Notes] reported after 9 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 6 that Ukrainian troops had engaged in intense battles for the settlements of Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Fanaseyevka.According to the channel, fierce fighting was ongoing in the area, with Ukrainian forces launching six attacks in this sector on Thursday. Later, ‚ÄúZapiski Veterana‚Äù warned that the situation on the Kursk front could deteriorate significantly by Friday morning, alleging that the AFU were moving significant reinforcements toward Sudzha.In a subsequent update, the channel claimed that Ukrainian troops had encircled Cherkasskaya Konopelka.On Thursday evening, Stanislav Bunyatov, a junior sergeant in the 24th Aidar Assault Battalion, wrote on Telegram: ‚ÄúWe are really making progress in Kursk Oblast.‚ÄùBunyatov emphasized the strategic importance of these assaults, stating: ‚ÄúIf we withdraw, the enemy is seriously intent on entering the Sumy region.‚ÄùHe acknowledged that Russian drones pose a significant challenge, though saying it was expected. Meanwhile, Russian sources reported that poor weather conditions on Feb. 6 had hindered their drone operations.By Friday, several Russian Telegram channels reported that the commander of the 11th Airborne Brigade had been removed from his post. The alleged reason was his failure to react in time to both the pontoon deployment and the sudden Ukrainian advance toward Ulanok the previous day. However, there are no official confirmations of his dismissal.In its Friday morning report, posted after 11 a.m., the Zapiski Veterana channel claimed that Ukrainian troops had been spotted on the dam in Cherkasskaya Konopelka. According to the post, Ukrainian military sources allegedly marked this settlement as under AFU control.‚ÄúThere is information that Fanaseyevka has also been occupied by the enemy,‚Äù the report added.Meanwhile, the ‚ÄúWar Correspondents of the Russian Spring‚Äù Telegram channel published a summary, stating that after the Thursday offensive on Ulanok, Ukrainian forces had suffered heavy losses in armored vehicles but had still managed to land a significant force.According to their report, between half a battalion and a full battalion of Ukrainian infantry remains engaged in the forests and the areas around Fanaseyevka and Cherkasskaya Konopelka.‚ÄúReports from the field indicate that fighting has continued since last night and into the morning in the areas around Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Fanaseyevka, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces have managed to secure several positions,‚Äù the channel wrote.The Telegram post further suggested that the Ukrainian command might deploy additional reinforcements to support its units.In its Feb. 7 briefing on the situation in Kursk Oblast, the Ukrainian General Staff reported at 8:44 a.m.:‚ÄúIn the operational zone in Kursk Oblast, units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine have repelled five Russian attacks over the past 24 hours.‚ÄùAccording to the summary, Russian forces launched 47 airstrikes, deploying 76 guided bombs, and conducted 612 artillery attacks on Ukrainian positions and settlements in the region, including 11 strikes from multiple launch rocket systems.Despite this being the second day of Ukraine‚Äôs new offensive in Kursk, the General Staff has not explicitly confirmed the operation. Instead, its report only mentions the repelling of Russian attacks.In its midday report, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that ‚Äúthe Russian Armed Forces continue to defeat AFU formations in Kursk Oblast.‚ÄùAccording to the report, units from the ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù group of troops thwarted a Ukrainian counteroffensive near Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Ulanok.‚ÄúAll enemy attacks have been repelled,‚Äù the ministry claimed.However, according to an ISW report, some Russian milbloggers voiced concerns that continued Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast could threaten Russian supply lines and rear positions south of Sudzha, particularly around Guyevo, where Russian forces are currently engaged.Putin acknowledges strain on Russian troops in Kursk OblastOn Feb. 5, Russian leader Vladimir Putin praised elite Airborne Forces (VDV) and naval infantry units defending in Kursk Oblast, highlighting that the Ukrainian incursion has tied up a full combined-arms army‚Äôs worth of Russian troops in the region for over six months.During a meeting with acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein, Putin listed key Russian formations still engaged in Kursk:155th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet)810th Naval Infantry BrigadeHe promised future rewards for these forces. However, ISW outlines that this prolonged deployment has prevented Russia from redeploying these elite units to high-priority fronts, such as the Donetsk region.According to ISW, Russia has amassed around 78,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, including 11,000 North Korean personnel and elements of nearly all elite Russian Airborne Forces and naval infantry units, to expel Ukrainian forces from the region.Despite this, Putin has yet to prioritize fully reclaiming Kursk Oblast, instead focusing on slow advances in Donetsk. ISW suggests that this delayed response is fueling domestic discontent as Ukrainian forces continue to hold ground in Russian border areas.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Do-nothing scripting: the key to gradual automation (2019)</title><link>https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/</link><author>tehnub</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 19:48:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every ops team has some manual procedures that they haven‚Äôt gotten around to automating yet. Toil can never be totally eliminated.Very often, the biggest toil center for a team at a growing company will be its procedure for modifying infrastructure or its procedure for provisioning user accounts. Partial instructions for the latter might look like this:Create an SSH key pair for the user.Commit the public key to Git and push to master.Wait for the build job to finish.Find the user‚Äôs email address in the employee directory.Send the user their private key via 1Password.This is a relatively short example. Sometimes there are 20 steps in the process. Sometimes there are branches and special cases to keep track of as you go. Over time, these procedures can become unmanageably large and complex.Procedures like this are frustrating because they‚Äôre focus-intensive yet require very little thought. They demand our full attention, but our attention isn‚Äôt rewarded with interesting problems or satisfying solutions ‚Äì just another checkbox checked. I have a word for a procedure like this: a .We know that this procedure is ripe for automation. We can easily see how to automate any given step. And we know that a computer could carry out the instructions with far greater speed and accuracy than we can, and with less tendency toward practical drift.However, automating slogs sometimes feels like an all-or-nothing proposition. Sure, we could write a script to handle step 2, or step 5. But that wouldn‚Äôt  make the procedure any less cumbersome. It would lead to a proliferation of single-purpose scripts with different conventions and expectations, and you‚Äôd still have to follow a documented multi-step procedure for using those scripts.This perception of futility is the problem we really need to solve in order to escape from these manual slogs. I‚Äôve found an approach that works pretty reliably: .Almost any slog can be turned into a . A do-nothing script is a script that encodes the instructions of a slog, encapsulating each step in a function. For the example procedure above, we could write the following do-nothing script:import sys

def wait_for_enter():
    raw_input("Press Enter to continue: ")

class CreateSSHKeypairStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Run:")
        print("   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/{0}".format(context["username"]))
        wait_for_enter()

class GitCommitStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Copy ~/new_key.pub into the `user_keys` Git repository, then run:")
        print("    git commit {0}".format(context["username"]))
        print("    git push")
        wait_for_enter()

class WaitForBuildStep(object):
    build_url = "http://example.com/builds/user_keys"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Wait for the build job at {0} to finish".format(self.build_url))
        wait_for_enter()

class RetrieveUserEmailStep(object):
    dir_url = "http://example.com/directory"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to {0}".format(self.dir_url))
        print("Find the email address for user `{0}`".format(context["username"]))
        context["email"] = raw_input("Paste the email address and press enter: ")

class SendPrivateKeyStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to 1Password")
        print("Paste the contents of ~/new_key into a new document")
        print("Share the document with {0}".format(context["email"]))
        wait_for_enter()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    context = {"username": sys.argv[1]}
    procedure = [
        CreateSSHKeypairStep(),
        GitCommitStep(),
        WaitForBuildStep(),
        RetrieveUserEmailStep(),
        SendPrivateKeyStep(),
    ]
    for step in procedure:
        step.run(context)
    print("Done.")
This script doesn‚Äôt actually  any of the steps of the procedure. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a do-nothing script. It feeds the user a step at a time and waits for them to complete each step manually.At first glance, it might not be obvious that this script provides value. Maybe it looks like all we‚Äôve done is make the instructions harder to read. But the value of a do-nothing script is immense:It‚Äôs now much less likely that you‚Äôll lose your place and skip a step. This makes it easier to maintain focus and power through the slog.Each step of the procedure is now encapsulated in a function, which makes it possible to replace the text in any given step with code that performs the action automatically.Over time, you‚Äôll develop a library of useful steps, which will make future automation tasks more efficient.A do-nothing script doesn‚Äôt save your team any manual effort. It lowers the activation energy for automating tasks, which allows the team to eliminate toil over time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Setting up your own Bluesky feed in Go</title><link>https://dhawos.dev/site/en/articles/bluesky-custom-feeds</link><author>/u/dhawos</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 19:38:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bluesky is a decentralized alternative to Twitter. It is a platform that praises itself on being more open and putting users at the center of the ecosystem. One of the features that derives from this mantra is the ability for anyone to create their own custom newsfeed. Other users can then discover those feeds and display then on their homepage.This opens up the possibility for anyone to build their own algorithm and select content based on specific topics or based on popularity metrics such as reposts and likes.However, making such a feed is a pretty technical task. The purpose of this blog post is to walk you through the steps required to setup your own custom newsfeed, using the Go programming language. You don‚Äôt need to be a Go expert to understand what I‚Äôm going to explain, but some level of knowledge of the language will make following through a bit easier. You should also know that the official documentation provides examples in Typescript. There are also community made templates for Python and RubyTo build you own newsfeed, you will have to complete several steps:1.Register the newsfeed on your Bluesky account:
This part is simply about running a script that will make the correct API calls to Bluesky to register your newsfeed. You will need to have a Bluesky account as the feed will appear under your profile. You will also need a domain that you own, that will also be used to host the custom feed server later.2.Index the content created on Bluesky:
Before being able to choose which posts users are going to see. You must first know what posts are available. To do we will record events that occur on the Bluesky network and save them inside our database to later decide which posts a user should see on our feed.
The last task will be building a web server that will listen to Bluesky specific requests (as described in the protocol). The server‚Äôs job will be to decide which posts the user should see based on the request and make that reply to Bluesky, who will take care of fetching the posts information and hydrating the view.Let‚Äôs see that in more detailsIt is the simplest task in the process. For our newsfeed to be usable, it must first be registered with Bluesky. It will then show up under our profile. To do so, we will use a little script which will use the indigo library which is the Bluesky SDK for Go.Here is what it will look like (I‚Äôm omitting a portion of the code here for the sake of clarity). You will need to declare some information that will describe your feed:Then, we will setup our client to talk to Bluesky API. For that, you will need your Bluesky handle (our nickname + domain). In my case this is @dhawos.bsky.social. You will also need an ‚Äúapplication password‚Äù which you can generate hereIf everything went well, please save the output carefully, you will need it later.
You should now also be able to see your new feed on your profile.2. Indexing content from BlueskyNow that your feed is created on Bluesky‚Äôs end, you need to set it up on your side. To suggest posts to your users, you first need to know which posts exist on the network.We‚Äôll use Jetstream for this purpose, an open-source service provided by Bluesky that simplifies retrieving all content produced on the network. Note, however, that this service is not part of Bluesky‚Äôs official specifications and may change in the future. For now, it‚Äôs more user-friendly than the official(Firehose feed.We‚Äôll also need a database, which we‚Äôll use PostgreSQL. We‚Äôll utilize its full-text search capabilities.To implement this, we‚Äôll create a process that runs continuously to monitor activity on the network and save relevant information to our database. This involves defining a struct that listens for events and saves pertinent data.Now we will instanciate the listener in our main functionWe have the basic structure for our program. Now, we need to implement the function that will listen for events. Before that, let‚Äôs understand the foundation of AtProto, which is the protocol BlueSky is built on. Each user has a ‚Äúrepository‚Äù similar to Git. Everything you produce as a user results in a new commit within a specific collection. That is what we did when we created our feed earlier. We created a new commit in the  collection with the relevant informationsFor now, we‚Äôll focus on listening to events related to the creation of commits. Other types of events, such as updates or deletions, are not relevant for our current purpose.We still need to write the function that will save the post to the database:We only need to call that function at the end of our :With that set up, and the PostgreSQL running in the background, it should be possible to start the program with the command:If all went well, you should be able to see posts coming to your database. Be warned that it might fill up pretty quickly as there can be a lot of activity on the network. We‚Äôll see later how we can avoid the database growing forever.3. Writing your custom feed serverWith our database filling up, we should be able to build the last piece of the puzzle. To do so we will write a small webserver which will have two features:Validate our identity with BlueskyFulfill feed requests from BlueskyFirst, let‚Äôs set up the building blocks for our server. We‚Äôll write a controller that will answer requests cominginThen in our server‚Äôs  file :Before sending us a request for a given custom feed, Bluesky will ensure that our identity is valid. There are several methods to assert our identity, namely  and . Here we‚Äôll use the  method as it is the easiest to setup. Be mindful that it has a limitation. It does not support domain migration, so ensure that the domain you chose is the correct one as changing it later on will prove difficult.To assert our identity we just need to produce the correct response which in my case looks like this:Here is the code snippet that generates such a response :We are at the end of our little journey. We now only need to setup the actual custom feed implementation. But first let‚Äôs summarize what happens when a user requests a feed from Bluesky.The user load is newsfeedBluesky will fetch the information related to that feedBluesky will check the identity linked to that feed (which we just implemented)Bluesky will send a request to the feed‚Äôs domain name. This request will be made against the following endpoint :Here is an example of a valid response for this requestThe cursor field in the request and the response will be used for pagination. This is an opaque field that‚Äôs just generated by our server and sent back by Bluesky on the next request. This value has no meaning for Bluesky and its meaning is the responsibility of the custom feed developer. In our case we we‚Äôll use the ID of the last post that we returned. That way, we will be able to send the next batch of posts when we receive a request for the next page.
Since theses IDs are generated sequentially, we know for a fact that we will get the posts from newest to oldestHere is how to generate such a response in our code.Here is the implementation for my custom feed for posts about cycling and commuting on a bicycle:I use  to generate the code that will execute the SQL requests. Here is the request I used (I‚Äôm not including the generated boilerplate code as it is not really relevant for this post).This request will fetch any post in a given language, for which the ID is below the cursor. We also use the  function of PostgreSQL to perform a full text search and retrieve posts that contain terms for our query. Finally we limit the number of posts to retrieve with the given limit parameter given by Bluesky.For the pagination to work correctly, we must ensure that the result of this request is stable and does not change over time. This is why we use the ID of the post (which is equivalent to the order in which the posts were indexed).With that done, you should now be able to run this code and setup your domain name to point either to your local machine or to a server on which this code is deployed. Once that is done, you can go on your Bluesky profile to find your feed and navigate to it to see if everything works as expected.Set-up garbage collectionIf everything works well, congratulations. Although there is a last step that you must perform if you don‚Äôt want your database to grow infinitely over time. As there is quite a lot of traffic on Bluesky, the database can grow pretty quickly so regular cleanup is important.To do so, we will simply launch a goroutine alongside the indexing process. This goroutine will simply run a cleanup command on a regular interval to delete posts older than 48 hours.Thanks for reading along. I hope those explanations allowed you to see more clearly the tasks needed to set up your own Bluesky custom newsfeed.

Looked interesting based on a cursory look, but being actually pretty satisfied with Git, and not having major problems with it, I haven‚Äôt checked it out.That is, until last week, when I finally decided to give it a go! I dived into a couple blog posts for a few of hours, and surprisingly (noting that we‚Äôre talking about a VCS) I found myself enjoying it a lot, seeing the consistent design, and overall simplicity it managed to achieve. This post is meant to give you a feel for what‚Äôs special about jj, and also describe a few patterns that have been working well for me, and which really are the reason I‚Äôm enjoying it.Before we dive in, one last thing you should take note of, is that most people use jj with its Git backend. You can use jj with your existing Git repos and reap its benefits in a way that is completely transparent to others you‚Äôre collaborating with. Effectively, you can treat it like a Git frontend.Before I get to the meat, something that will surely be very useful for any of your experimentation with jj, and something I would‚Äôve loved to have had in Git when I was learning it - you can undo any jj operation using , and view an operation log using .Changes are the core primitive you‚Äôll be working with in jj. In Git you had commits, in jj you have changes. A jj change is, however, . A change can be modified. It‚Äôs ID, however, is immutable and randomly generated - it stays constant while you iterate on the change. A change refers to a  (otherwise called a snapshot) which for our purposes is always a Git commit. As you keep working on and modifying a change, the commit SHA it refers to will change.So to recap - immutable change IDs, mutable changes, mutable revision IDs (Git SHAs), immutable underlying revisions (snapshots - commits). Changes may eventually be marked as immutable - by default this happens (more or less) when they become part of the main branch or a Git tag.While in Git you generally organize your commits in branches, and a commit that‚Äôs not part of a branch is scarily called a ‚Äúdetached HEAD‚Äù, in jj it‚Äôs completely normal to work on changes that are not on branches.  is the main command to view the history and tree of changes, and will default to showing you a very reasonable set of changes that should be relevant to you right now - that is (more or less) any local mutable changes, as well as some additional changes for context (like the tip of your main branch).Changes in jj  be marked with bookmarks (what jj calls branches), but you‚Äôd generally do that only for the purpose of pushing to a remote Git server, like GitHub, not local organization.Let‚Äôs see a sample of a  invocation:Quick tip: you can use aha to convert colorized shell output to HTML.The IDs on the left side are change IDs, while on the right size you have revisions (commit SHAs). Unique prefixes of those IDs are marked in color, and you can use those prefixes instead of the full form when referring to changes. A change can be reffered to in jj commands by its ID, the underlying commit SHA, or any bookmark referring to it.There is one more, slightly crazy, thing about jj changes. Git has a special feature called the Git index to hold any as of yet uncommitted changes (where you , and then  them). In jj any files you modify are always in the scope of a change. Any modifications you make automatically become part of the current change, which is called the working copy. In the  output, this working copy is indicated by the  symbol. You create a new working change using  (by default as a child of the current change), and give it a description using  (it starts out having an empty message). You can use  to get the metadata of the current change.This much said, here‚Äôs a quick demo of changing a file as part of a new change.Editing a file in a jj repo on its own is an alias for .Most jj commands default to operating on the current working change, but let you operate on an arbitrary change (or set of changes!) via the  flag.This whole thing about the working copy being a Change may sound weird, but it brings with it an important feature - you can operate on the working copy like on any other change. Personally, I‚Äôm a frequent user of . When I‚Äôm working on something, I often want to pause for a moment and work on / try something else, only to later come back to what I was working on (while leaving that other experiment as yet another stash).In jj, I can just , which will start a new change from the parent of my current working copy - leaving my working copy as a normal change with all its file modifications ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù, so I can later come back to it via .The  after the  means "go one level up". It's basically "take the working copy change, and go to its parent". We'll come back to this briefly later, but suffice it to say that there's a whole sensible expression language here, and  is similarly valid to refer to your grandparent change.Editing Changes in Weird Places#Another cool thing about changes is that you can freely edit any mutable change.  lets you ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù and edit a given change. You can also squish a new change right after another (between it and its children). You can then keep modifying files in the context of that change, and any descendants will automatically be rebased on top of it (with their underlying commit SHAs likely changing, but change IDs staying the same). That sounds a bit scary if you‚Äôre used to Git (and dealing with conflicts in the middle of a rebase) but fear not, it‚Äôs actually pretty seamless, and we‚Äôll come back to it later.You can pass  and  to  to indicate that you want to squish a new change after, or before, another change.With this, when I notice a mistake in a change 3 levels back, I can just  (with my working copy remaining there for me to come back to), make a fix, which will auto-rebase all following changes (including my original working change), and then  to go back to my original working change.Editing previous changes with automatic rebaseOccasionally you also need to rebase (move) a set of changes onto some change x, you can do that by using jj rebase -s <change-id-to-rebase> -d <destination-change>. The  will bring all descendants along with the rebased change, and there are other variations of this command for different scenarios. E.g. jj rebase -b <branch> -d <destination-change> will rebase the entire given branch onto a change, and with no arguments it just defaults to , so the current branch. In other words, to rebase the current branch onto main, it‚Äôs enough to run .Pattern: Squishing a Fix Before the Current Change#You noticed a mistake in your last change, don‚Äôt want to fix it as part of this one, and instead want to squish a fix right before it, but you have already done some ‚Äúuncommitted‚Äù work? Just do . The  means it‚Äôs squished before the current working change (referred to via ), and after the previous one (its parent). After you make the fix, you can go back to the original working change via  ( is the opposite of ). You could also make the fix in the original working change and run  to use your favorite diff ui to select what to push down to a separate change placed right before the current one.In jj, instead of branches we have bookmarks. You create them using jj bookmark create <name> (abbreviated to ). You update a bookmark to point the current change using . You track remote bookmarks (which will create local corresponding bookmarks that update on ) by doing .When you add changes on top of a change that a bookmark is attached to, the bookmark won‚Äôt automatically move to your new change (like it would with a branch in Git), you have to  it manually. You can push bookmarks attached to the current change via .  will fetch updates to bookmarks from your remote (so generally updates to branches).A common use case with services like GitHub is to split up a big change into multiple PRs, let‚Äôs say Multipart 1, Multipart 2 and Multipart 3 (from branches multipart-1, multipart-2, and multipart-3 respectively). Each of them is based on the previous one, so you effectively have the following graph, with bookmark pointers on the way:Now let‚Äôs say Multipart 1 got reviewed and you need to fix something. In Git, once you add a commit to it (or modify an existing one), you would have to manually rebase all the other branches. Annoying!How does jj help us here? We can just run  ( is a unique prefix of the broken change id), or , make the fix, and run jj git push -b "glob:multipart-*". Everything will be automatically rebased, and all the bookmarks will be updated and pushed. Effortless!Making fixes in stacked PRsMerges in jj are pretty boring - in a good way. You just create a change with multiple parents. E.g.  will create a change with three parents.One topic I haven‚Äôt mentioned yet, and is surely by now giving you an unsettling feeling deep inside about all I‚Äôve said before, are conflicts. With all this rebasing, that‚Äôs  to become a pain, right? Well, it doesn‚Äôt!As opposed to Git, where conflicts kind of break your workflow, in the sense that you have to resolve them prior to doing anything else, jj handles conflicts in a first-class manner. A change can just ‚Äúbe conflicted‚Äù. You can switch away from a conflicted change, you can create a new change on top of an existing conflicted change (and that will in turn also start out conflicted), you can edit a conflicted change, you can do anything.  and  will mention the conflict, but it won‚Äôt block you.
‚îú‚îÄ‚ïÆ  
‚îÇ ‚óã  
‚îÇ ‚îÇ  add 'cccc'
‚óã ‚îÇ  
‚îú‚îÄ‚ïØ  add 'bbbb'
‚óã  
‚îÇ  add 'aaaa'

Working copy changes:

file.txt    
Working copy : 
Parent commit:  add 'bbbb'
Parent commit:  add 'cccc'
The conflict will be represented in the code via conflict markers:aaaa
<<<<<<< Conflict 1 of 1
%%%%%%% Changes from base to side #1
+bbbb
+++++++ Contents of side #2
cccc
>>>>>>> Conflict 1 of 1 ends
and you can either manually resolve this conflict by editing the code itself, or use  to bring up your favorite three-way-merge tool (e.g. I‚Äôve configured my jj to bring up a visual conflict resolver in Goland) and resolve it there.Once you fix the conflict in a change, all descendants of this change will also cease being conflicted. You could leave a change conflicted and only resolve the conflict in a follow-up child change - that is a completely valid and supported approach.Merge conflict resolutionPattern: Working on Two Things at the Same Time#I‚Äôve mentioned stacked PRs, but another situation you might have is working on two independent things in parallel. Let‚Äôs say on bookmarks  and .In order to have both things simultaneosuly active in your codebase, you can create a development change via jj new thing-1 thing-2 -m "dev", that will be a merge between both of them, but will stay local and you‚Äôll never push it ( just lets you give a description to a change when creating it, without a separate  invocation). You will however  this development change to do your work.Then, whenever you want to move some modifications into one of the branches, you can use jj squash --into <target-change-id> <files> to move all modifications to a set of files down into one of the branches. There‚Äôs also  where you can use a diff tool to choose modifications to squash into another change, and finally there‚Äôs a newer  command which can automate this process in certain scenarios.Editing files in a merged dev-change andselectively squashing the changes into branchesIn conclusion, you can keep working in a local-only merge-change of your branches, and selectively push down any modifications to the relevant branch (This setup would‚Äôve seemed pretty scary before jj, right? I hope it‚Äôs a bit less scary now.), and then push just those branches themselves to the remote.jj commands operate on revisions or sets of revisions (revsets). You can refer to those directly, or use a special expression language to describe them. You‚Äôve seen me refer to a change previously via . That was a very simple expression that evaluated to the parent.There is, however, much more. There are functions - like  to get the parents of a change - and operators - like  to refer to the child of x, or  for all descendants of x including x. accepts a revset expression, so you can use it to experiment with them. The default revset it displays is also configurable. Overall, the expression language is powerful and consistent, with simple things being generally easy, and harder things being (presumably, I‚Äôve honestly spent too little time with it) possible.See this article for a much more extensive exploration of the jj expression language, and the jj docs themselves.Pattern: Partial Stashes#Another kind of stash I occasionally like to do is partial, where I temporarily roll back changes to a set of files to verify the before-after (e.g. confirm that a passing test was failing before).In jj the split command works well for this. Just jj split --parallel modifiedFile.txt will move the file into a parallel change. You can do whatever you want to do, and later run jj squash --from parallel_change_id to get the file modifications back into the current change.Partial stash using Setting Up jj with an Existing Git Repo#It‚Äôs trivial to start using jj with an existing git repo, though I‚Äôd advise cloning it fresh into a new directory.In a directory where you already have a git repo, you can just run . Your  directory will stay in place, and jj will keep it updated, so e.g. your editor won‚Äôt be confused what‚Äôs happening. It integrates fairly well, with e.g. the working change - even though it‚Äôs backed by a commit - being presented as the git index, so your editor can still show files ‚Äúmodified in this change‚Äù.The cost of switching is low, as it integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow. It frankly also takes a day tops to get used to, and there‚Äôs something to be said for using  things. Sure, you can make excellent tea in any food-safe kettle, but if you have a nice tea kettle, you‚Äôll enjoy it every time you make tea. I use my vcs quite a lot, so why not make that pleasant too?I hope the above gave you an intuition for what Jujutsu, the VCS, is all about, and ideally even encouraged you to take a look at it.If you‚Äôd like to do some more readings about jj, I‚Äôve used the below articles and guides when learning it, and a lot of what I wrote above is inspired by parts of them.

Instead, we could use the same fiber optic cables that we utilize in classical communication.\
Fibre optic cables or optical fibers transmit light particles, signals, or pulses. They contain glass fibers wrapped in another glass layer called cladding, a buffer tube, and a jacket, the final layer. After quantum teleportation became more than a theoretical scientific milestone, there was another problem‚Äîhow to teleport information with quantum computing while preserving the data. But why's this a problem, and what's quantum teleportation in the first place?\
This article will explain quantum teleportation, how it works, and how it could affect modern-day communication.What is Quantum Teleportation?To understand quantum teleportation, we must first start with its parent field‚Äîquantum computing. And to understand quantum computing, we must know what quantum mechanics is.\
As the DOE explains,  is the field of physics that explains how extremely small objects have the characteristics of particles and waves simultaneously. For instance, the atom consists of subatomic particles like electrons that exhibit this wave-particle duality. In other words, while they exist as a small discrete unit in a bound state, they are also constantly shifting.\
The discovery of these microscopic objects, known as quanta, spurred a series of discoveries in the field. Quantum computing was the first, leading to the birth of quantum computers, which could solve problems that even the most powerful classical computers couldn't.\
At the heart of this field lies quantum teleportation. It is a faster, more secure method of transmitting information over significant distances without direct transfer through a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.Key Principles and Terms of Quantum TeleportationUnderstanding quantum teleportation requires you to grasp the underlying concepts that form its basis. These include:, also known as qubits, are the fundamental units that make up the parts of a quantum system. While classical computers store information in 0 or 1 bits, quantum bits can exist as 0, 1, or both 0 and 1.John Preskill, professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology, explains it as the  between parts of a quantum system. These parts, known as qubits, are linked in a way that allows them to exchange information without physically transporting it. When the state of one is changed, the other one automatically assumes the altered state.Superposition is one of the most important principles of quantum mechanics. Due to its wave-particle dual nature, a quantum particle can exist in multiple states. However, these superpositions are mathematical probabilities of the particle having a specific property.Bell state, also called EPR states or pairs, is the simplest form of quantum entanglement. When a qubit's state takes on a value, the correlating qubit will also take on a value. Each quantum entanglement formed from two cubits can result in 4 bell states.A quantum state is simply the physical properties of a quantum system. However, it is usually mathematically represented by a vector containing all the information about that system. Quantum states are usually written as |Œ®‚ü©.The big question is how these all come together to cause quantum teleportation as we know it. In 1993, four scientists‚ÄîBennett, Brassard, Cr√©peau, Jozsa, Peres, and Wootters‚Äîcame together to form . But it wasn't until 1997 that Anton Zeilinger and Sandu Prospecu took it from pages to a real experiment.\
The teleportation protocol exists for one sole reason‚Äîto transfer quantum states from one particle to another without physically moving them. It involves preparing entangled particles, performing specific operations on them (like measurements and classical communication), and finally sending the states.\
Instead of classical gates that use bits, the protocol uses quantum gates to build quantum circuits at the start of the teleportation process. These gates are called the Hadamard and CNOT gates and are used to create an EPR qubit or Bell state described earlier. Here's a full breakdown of the  published by Mario Mastriani.What Does Quantum Teleportation Mean for Us?Now that we're making progress with quantum teleportation, what does it mean for us as humans?Of all the benefits of quantum teleportation, the most talked about is quantum encryption. No doubt, quantum teleportation will make current cybersecurity practices laughable. Forget what you know about firewalls, VPNs, and encryption. They all rely on the assumption that hackers can't intercept data. Well, until now.\
Quantum encryption can prevent many security breaches, especially now that security threats have become more advanced. When someone attempts to intercept information, the quantum state of the particles involved will be disrupted, and both parties will be alerted.Although we're not there yet, quantum teleportation will soon set a new communication speed standard. If the quantum internet becomes a thing, you can transfer data across continents almost immediately.\
This could be helpful in many areas, such as business, healthcare, and education. It might allow people to work together in real time, no matter where they are.Space technology could've gone farther than this if only communication with spacecraft or satellites had been faster. But it hasn't because signals must travel long distances before they reach space.\
But it's not just space. Several other technologies and industries will develop much faster with quantum teleportation. Information discovery and sharing is the backbone of any invention. Maybe we really could use the quantum push.Quantum teleportation still has a long way to go. If we've come this far, I have no doubt that we will see surprising advancements before the next decade is over.\
We still have much to do regarding quantum repeaters, as well as the effect of temperature and electromagnetic radiation on quantum systems. But I have no doubt that we will soon build quantum communication networks that can operate reliably outside of controlled lab environments.\
I can't wait for us to have more secure, instantaneous data systems. This will likely cause change in almost every field known to man, whether it's cybersecurity or global communications.\
One day, in the future, you may look back and realize that our current communication methods were much slower, just as you'd say about the Abacus right now.\
So, the next time someone talks about quantum teleportation, remember it's no longer a sci-fi dream. It's already here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Startups face the recurring dilemma of whether to partner</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/startups-face-the-recurring-dilemma-of-partnering-or-not/</link><author>Anna Heim</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 18:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to Startups Weekly ‚Äî your weekly recap of everything you can‚Äôt miss from the world of startups.

While most people hope never to need one, they are essential to society. Since they are so important, it is reasonable to think they are some of the most efficient institutions in the country. However, that assumption could not be further from the truth.\
Many emergency communication centers are underfunded and understaffed, resulting in unanswered 911 calls and lengthy dispatch times. Those delays can cost lives. While the clear solution is hiring more people, urban and rural centers have trouble finding candidates. Could artificial intelligence solve this seemingly unsolvable problem?1. Handles Nonemergency CallsEven though most people are taught from a young age that 911 is for emergencies only, PSAPs receive an incredible number of nonemergency calls. Factoring in spam and misdials, call-takers spend an inordinate amount of time handling situations that don‚Äôt matter.\
The director of government affairs for the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch (IAED) said using AI for nonemergency calls  and a huge benefit because it enables dispatchers to focus on the calls that really matter. If a machine learning model picks up instead of them, they don‚Äôt have to waste their time on noncritical situations.\
AI can identify spam calls, resolve misdials and route nonemergency calls to the proper agencies, reducing the volume of calls on the administrative line. For example, if someone calls about a loose dog, it can transfer them to animal control.\n Already, 911 call centers have deployed AI this way. For instance, Charleston County‚Äôs Consolidated Emergency Communications Center ‚Äî which  annually on average ‚Äî used machine learning to automate its nonemergency line fully. The center‚Äôs director said it helps dispatchers provide better assistance.2. Creates Transcripts of CallsGenerative models can automatically create written records of audio communications. These transcripts can be used for reference during dispatch or later training. Since all 911 calls are already recorded, implementation would be relatively straightforward.\n Automatic transcription and summarization would be a massive help during frantic conversations. What has happened, who needs help and where the crisis is unfolding are the most important pieces of data in an emergency. AI can help dispatchers understand the situation‚Äôs scope and collect their thoughts, improving decision-making efficiency.3. Conducts Sentiment AnalysisA machine learning model can leverage natural language processing to conduct sentiment analysis, allowing it to identify and react to mood. This technology  when deployed in emergency services systems.\
While dispatchers are trained to respond to an array of crises, every person who calls 911 reacts to danger differently. The algorithm can detect these subtle differences, enabling helpful tone, wording and intervention recommendations.4. Reviews Dispatch Data for AccuracyMany 911 dispatchers are overworked. One investigation into the D.C. Office of Unified Communications (OUC) payroll revealed that almost  are overtime. Many work 12-hour shifts ‚Äî sometimes multiple in one week.\
Long hours and sleepless nights lead to human error. Call-takers may send first responders to the wrong address or leave a caller on hold for minutes. In a field where every second counts, these delays are unacceptable. Besides, forced overtime will eventually result in burnout, compounding the sector‚Äôs labor shortage.\
AI can automate repetitive job functions and analyze information before relaying it, lightening the workload and ensuring accuracy. In addition to increasing efficiency, it can minimize human error, helping save lives.\
Embedding AI into emergency vehicles helps dispatchers retain control of the situation while they remain on the line with callers. It can relay critical information, provide accurate arrival time estimates and even automate some driving functions, helping teams focus on what matters.\n On top of improving efficiency, it could make driving safer. Research shows incorporating forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking systems could , saving 850 lives annually. While fire truck and ambulance accidents are uncommon, they happen. Preventing them saves precious time.5. Provides Training for all SituationsWhile 911 call center operators receive extensive training, many don‚Äôt feel prepared to handle all possible situations. Just because they‚Äôre used to burglaries and trespassing doesn‚Äôt mean they know how to respond to a bomb threat or an active shooter.\
According to a National Emergency Number Association survey,  feel equipped to handle any situation. They are also ill-prepared to deal with the administrative side of their work. Around 36% agreed management was the most stressful aspect of their job, ranking it above taking incoming 911 calls.\
A machine learning model can create personalized training material to maximize improvements, helping dispatchers excel in areas where they previously lagged behind. Also, it can help establish individualized workflows to improve their management and administrative capabilities.6. Handles Incident-Specific Call SurgesDuring events that cause mass panic, PSAPs are flooded with 911 calls. Those that are understaffed due to retention and hiring issues ‚Äî which is most of them ‚Äî will have trouble helping everyone.\
A nationwide staffing survey by IAED revealed that 911 call center  in 2022, meaning one in four positions was unfilled. This figure represents a five-percentage-point increase from before the COVID-19 pandemic.\
Even if dispatchers can handle their regular call volume without trouble, these unexpected situations can easily cause prioritization and management issues. A machine learning model can handle incoming calls, freeing up their time. Since this technology can evolve, it can adapt to never-before-seen crises.\
AI can relay relevant, helpful information to callers to ensure everyone receives help. This is especially helpful for people who aren‚Äôt connected to mass panic events because it ensures they receive a timely response.7. Responds to Text-to-911 MessagesThe ability to reach 911 operators from a mobile device is called the text-to-911 service. It is increasing in popularity. According to the National 911 Program, people in 38 states  in 2021, up from 492,328 in 2020. While this program could be revolutionary, it poses some challenges.\
What happens when the sender misspells a word or types slowly? AI can increase efficiency by generating response prompts, reading the message aloud or fixing spelling mistakes. Contrary to popular belief, most people won‚Äôt be put off by receiving AI-generated texts. Research shows they  than work produced by human experts.AI Can Make Every Second Count in 911 Call CentersAI will never replace human operators. Instead, it will enhance their jobs, increasing their efficiency and narrowing their focus so they can focus on what matters. This technology could be revolutionary for the nation‚Äôs vast number of understaffed, underfunded PSAPs, helping save lives and improve citizens‚Äô perception of local emergency services.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A brief history of code signing at Mozilla</title><link>https://hearsum.ca/posts/history-of-code-signing-at-mozilla/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:51:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shipping large software to end-user devices is a complicated process. Shipping large software  to end-user devices is even more complicated. Signing the things that ship to end-user devices is one of those complications, and it gets even more complicated when you sign thousands of artifacts per day.Mozilla has been signing Firefox in some form beginning with Firefox 1.0. This began with detached GPG signatures for builds, and progressed to Authenticode signing for Windows installers in Firefox 1.0.1. Since then it has evolved over time to encompass other platforms, other types of files within our products, and other ways that we ship (such as our own update packages). This post will provide a overview of the what, when, why, and how of code signing at Mozilla over the past ~20 years.Early GPG & Authenticode SigningWhen we first began signing, it happened on a Windows machine. Late in the release process, after Windows installers had been built, we would download all of the release artifacts to this machine, sign the Windows installers, and generate detached GPG signatures for those before pushing the artifacts elsewhere.At this time, the private keys and certificates were held on a USB stick that was kept removed from the machine at-rest. A Release Engineer needed to be physically present in Mountain View to perform this step. Once inserted, signing could be done via Remote Desktop rather than at the physical machine (but don't forget to remove the USB stick afterwards!).GPG signing was done with the standard GPG tools, running in cygwin. Authenticode signing was also done with the standard (at the time) Microsoft 'signcode.exe' tool. An annoying fact about that tool, is that it only accepted the necessary passphrase from a GUI dialog. To work around this, we had an AutoIt script running in the background that injected the passphrase into this dialog whenever it popped up. This interesting way of automating the process meant that mouse movements or keyboard interaction at the wrong time could interfere with the signing process.This process was partly scripted, but there was still a series of ~15 commands someone had to run by hand (and not mess up) to get everything done. You can see these commands for yourself in our now-ancient Unified Release Process documentation.Windows internal file signingCareful readers may have noted that early Authenticode signing only covered the Firefox installer itself, not the EXEs and DLLs inside of it. At some point (I haven't gone to the effort of tracking down exactly where...) we started signing these inner files as well. This process seems to have been lost to the sands of time, but I seem to recall it worked very similarly to the installer signing process, but without the GPG parts.Improved signing on WindowsThe first notable improvement we had to this process was to automate most of the copy/pasting that was done from the wiki. This came in the form of a Makefile that with a few mere inputs, would download, sign, and re-upload the signed builds. The main benefit of this was reduced opportunity for human error.Despite the signing process now being very quick once it gets started, it could still sometimes take hours or longer to begin the process. Typically this would happen if our build and repack processes finished at a time when no Release Engineer was around to begin signing. This was solved with what we called "autosign". Rather than require a Release Engineer to be around at the right moment, we adjusted our scripts to allow them to be started ahead of time, and be smart enough to know when all of the files it needs to sign are ready. This work eliminated all wait time between builds being ready and signing running.Signing Windows builds...on Linux!In 2011, signing was rearchitected altogether. In short, the idea was to move signing to a highly secured Linux server, and sign builds through an API as part of the build process. This allowed builds to be signed as they were produced, and reduced the number of times builds had to move from one server to another before they shipped.

An obvious question here is how we would manage to sign Windows binaries on Linux...as it turns out, the mono project had its own version of signcode that ran natively on Linux that we were able to make use of.Shortly after (and perhaps even motivating - I'm not sure at this point) the aforementioned signing server work, we began signing our MAR (Mozilla ARchive) packages that update users from an older version of Firefox to a newer version. Thanks to the earlier work, it was fairly trivial to use the same architecture to sign these files.Unfortunately, there were no tools available at the time to sign macOS builds on anything except a fairly modern macOS machine. For this reason, we had to run additional copies of our signing server on macOS and sign those builds with them. (If you've ever had to run macOS as a server you'll know just how unfortunate this was...)Taskcluster/signingscript/iscriptIn 2018, Mozilla migrated its CI and Release automation from our aging Buildbot systems to Taskcluster. As part of this, signing tasks moved to specialized Taskcluster workers known as "signingscript" and "iscript", used for signing non-macOS and macOS builds respectively. These specialized workers continued to outsource the actual work of signing to the previously discussed signing servers.An important part of this change is the introduction of Chain of Trust, a significant security enhancement that helps ensure that only authentic artifacts are signed to this day.Autograph is Mozilla's modern code signing service. It was built specifically to provide a signing service that allowed us to keep private key material in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Migrating release signing to it was a huge improvement over the existing signing server where Release Engineers had direct access to such things. It was initially used for signing XPIs and APKs, but by the end of 2019 we had migrated all non-macOS signing to it and retired the old Linux signing servers.In addition to the security enhancements it brought, we saw great performance wins with it as well, largely in thanks to it's support for  only requiring a hash of the bytes being signed to be sent over the wire. (This requires that the client has some advanced knowledge of the file being signed, but it saves a  amount of network traffic at our scale.)

Notarization with rcodesign

In 2023 we started making use of rcodesign to notarize and staple our macOS builds. While actual macOS code signing itself continues to happen on macOS machines, this allowed us to move at least some of our operations into the cloud and reduce our reliance on mac hardware.

I've mentioned a number of tools and technology that we use as part of signing, but I've purposely glossed over some details in the interest of brevity. The following section is a glossary of sorts, and introduces some more under the hood tools that we use as part of signing. If you're interested in the gory details, the links below should be enough to find them for yourself! Or you can stop by #firefox-ci on Matrix to ask questions!Winsign is a python library for signing and manipulating Authenticode signatures. It relies on osslsigncode for writing signatures, and supports signing directly with a private key, or outsourcing the signing process to a passed in function. The latter is what we use, and it's how we inject a call to Autograph into the signing process.In 2021 we began shipping Firefox as an MSIX package. As part of this we discovered that osslsigncode does not support signing MSIX packages. Luckily for us, Microsoft's MSIX packaging tools are open source and run on Linux, and we found a fork that contained most of what was needed to support signing. With a few additional modifications, we were able to support signing these packages in our existing systems.apple-codesign is a very exciting project from Gregory Szorc which provides 3rd party tools capable of signing, notarizing, and stapling .app bundles and other Apple formats such as .pkg and .dmg. These tools run on Linux, and as noted above, we're already making use of them to notarize and staple our .app bundles.

We're extremely excited about this project, and grateful to Gregory Szorc for all the effort he's bit into it. In the future we're looking forward to migrating our actual code signing to these tools which would (finally) allow us to retire our dedicated macOS signing machines.mardor is a python tool to manage, and most importantly, sign, MAR files. In the days before Autograph it was used to directly sign MAR files. These days we only use it to inject signatures made by Autograph into the files, similar to our usage of osslsigncode.signingscript is the glue between our CI system (Taskcluster) and Autograph. Through a combination of the tools listed above, custom code in signingscript itself, and communication with Autograph it produces signed builds. It is additionally responsible for notarizing and stapling our macOS builds.iscript is essentially a pared down version of signingscript (in fact their code is both derived from our early signing server code), and is responsible for signing our macOS builds. iscript runs on a small cluster of mac minis, which are a huge pain in the butt to manage.


As noted in an earlier section Autograph is our modern code signing service. It has a simple HTTP API that accepts signing requests and returns signed data or files. In addition to signing various artifacts that we ship it also makes Content Signatures on behalf of addons.mozilla.org, aus5.mozilla.org/Balrog (our update server), and some other backend services that Firefox communicates with, helping to ensure the security and integrity of requests made between Firefox and Mozilla-run services.

What a ride it's been over the last 20 years! We've gone from signing nothing to signing nearly everything in some form. Signing started off as a very manual process, and now happens seamlessly thousands of times per day.I don't think it would be possible to name everyone that contributed to this, but it took the ideas and efforts of tens, if not hundreds, of people to get to this point: release engineers, build system experts, security folks, and many others were all critical to getting us where we are today.I've got this post as brief as possible, but if you're interested in more details on any parts here feel free to reach out!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bpifrance will invest $10B in the French AI ecosystem by 2029</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/bpifrance-to-invest-10b-in-french-ai-ecosystem-by-2029/</link><author>Romain Dillet</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:46:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[France‚Äôs public investment bank announced that it plans to invest as much as ‚Ç¨10 billion (around $10.3 billion at current exchange rates) in the artificial intelligence ecosystem in France.

It's designed for high concurrency, scalability and fault tolerance. Most programming languages have a framework that implements it, but some programming languages like Erlang/Elixir are designed with this model in mind.The actor model was created in 1973, inspired by physics and some programming languages like Smalltalk, Lisp and others. It was designed to handle highly parallel computer machines consisting of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of independent microprocessors, each with its own local memory and communications processor, communicating via a high-performance communications network.In Object-Oriented Programming, we treat everything as an object, in the actor model we treat everything as an actor.It treats the actor as a basic block of concurrency, where an actor reacts to a message, by changing your states, modifying our behaviour for the next message, and sending more messages. In other words, an actor can:Send a finite number of messages to other actorsCreate a finite number of new actorsDesignate the behaviour to be used for the next message it receives.Message is a unit of communication between actors, a message should be serializable and be transmitted over networks.The mailbox is how an actor reads messages, every message it receives goes to a mailbox, typically Actor Sysmte uses FIFO(First-In First-Out) but depending on the case, we can implement a Mailbox using a different approach if you need, for example, to prioritize a message over otherState it's the actor state, it can be read from other actors, but only the actor itself can modify your state.The behaviour is how an actor will react to a message.Process Identification (PID) or Actor Reference it's the actor's address, with this address an actor can send a message to another actor, this address can be local or on the remote machine.Supervision is how the Actor Model coordinates your tasks and ensures resilience.\
So imagine, you create an actor and you ask to that actor do an action and fails to do it, how are you going to handle this failure? Should you retry? Should you stop the all process? Should you stop only that actor?\
When the actor fails it‚Äôll emit a signal to the supervisor and it decides what to do, stop only that actor, stop all actors or send the signal to its supervisor and let the layer above define what to do.\
All actors are supervisors.The virtual actor is a concept created by Microsoft on the Orleans project where you don't need to know the Actor ID, you will have a unique identifier and the actor framework will find the corresponding actor (or create a new one if case it doesn't find it). \n Virtual Actor seems to fit very well with DDD and event source, where you can use the Actor ID as the Domain ID, and the message you received you can store in some database, so when you load the domain you can easily reply to all message to get the current state (or save the state as a snapshot).The framework to use the Actor Model will depend on the programming language, I can only talk about it for C#¬†is an Actor Model implementation from Microsoft, but it doesn't implement the Actor Model completely, only the Virtual Actor, also Microsoft decided to change some terms, like Silos = Node, Grain = Virtual Actor. One advantage of Microsoft Orleans is it's very easy to use and requires a minimal setup, but it doesn't implement the supervision like it's described in the book, so you have less flexibility.¬†is a good framework (it's a port from Java), it has almost all concepts of the Actor Model, is very flexible and seems easy to use. The main disadvantage is Akka doesn't implement a Virtual Actor Model, so if you want to implement DDD with Akka, it can be a challenge to mimic the Virtual Actor Model.¬†is the best framework for the Actor Model (you can use it with Go), it is implemented by the book (like Akka) Actor Model and supports the Virtual Actor Model (like Orleans). I would give a change for this frameworkElixir/Erlang is based on BEAM VM, which is based on the Actor Model, so you won't need any framework. Because the Virtual Actor model is a kind of new concept Elixir doesn't have native support for it, so you need to use an external library. I highly recommend you study about themThe actor model is very interesting, if you are also interested in it I recommend that you look deep. We use the actor model to create high-scale applications and it can be combined with Domain-Driven Design, Event Source and CQRS, in the next article I'll show can we can combine them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Create a Server Driven CLI from your REST API</title><link>https://zuplo.com/blog/2025/02/02/generate-cli-from-api-with-climate</link><author>/u/ZuploAdrian</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:24:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This article is written by Rahul D√©, a VP of
Site Reliability Engineering at Citi and creator/maintainer of popular tools
like babashka,
bob, and now
climate. All opinions expressed are
his own.APIs, specifically the REST APIs are everywhere and the
OpenAPI is pretty much a standard.
Accessing them via various means is a fairly regular thing that a lot of us do
often and when it comes to the CLI (Command Line Interface) languages like Go,
Rust etc are quite popular choices when building. These languages are mostly of
statically typed in nature, favouring a closed world approach of knowing all the
types and paths at compile time to be able to produce lean and efficient binary
for ease of deployment and use.Like with every engineering choice, there are trade-offs. The one that's here is
the loss of dynamism, namely we see a lot of bespoke tooling in these languages
doing fundamentally the same thing: make HTTP calls and let users have a better
experience than making those calls themselves. The need to know all the types
and paths beforehand causes these perceived maintenance issues:Spec duplication: the paths, the schemas etc need to be replicated on the
client side again. eg when using the popular Cobra lib
for Go, one must tell it all the possible types beforehand.Tighter coupling of client and server: As we have to know each of the paths
and the methods that a server expects, we need to essentially replicate that
same thing when making the requests making a tight coupling which is
susceptible to breakage when the API changes. API is a product having its own
versioning. eg kubectl only supports
certain versions of
kubernetes. Similarly podman or docker CLIs.Servers can't influence the client: Ironically to the previous point, as we
now have replicated the server spec on the client side we effectively have a
split brain: changes on the server like needing a new parameter etc need to be
copied over to the client.All of this put together increases the maintenance overhead and its specially
true for complex tooling like kubectl.I work primarily on the infra side of this, namely Platform and Site Reliability
Engineering which involves me having other developers as my users and this
cascading effect of an API breakage is quite painful. There are way to work
around this issue and from my experience, being
spec-first
seems to offer the best balance of development and maintenance velocities.I am quite a big fan of being spec-first, mainly for the following reasons:The API spec is the single source of truth: This is what your users see and
not your code. Make this the first class citizen like your users and the code
should use this and not the other way round.This keeps all the servers and clients in sync automatically with less
breakage.This keeps a nice separation between the business logic (the API handler code)
and the infra thereby allowing developers to focus on what's important.Another project of mine Bob can be seen as an
example of spec-first design. All its tooling follow that idea and its
CLI inspired Climate. A lot of Bob uses
Clojure a language that I cherish and who's ideas make
me think better in every other place too.Although codegen is one of the ways to be spec-first, I personally don't
subscribe to the approach of generating code:Introduces another build step adding complexity and more layers of debugging.Makes the build more fragile in keeping up with tooling and language changes.The generated code comes with its own opinions and is often harder to
change/mould to our needs.It is static code at the end, can't do much at runtime.restish: Inspired some of the ideas behind this. This is a
project with different goals of being a fully automatic CLI for an OpenAPI
REST API and is a bit hard to use as a lib.navi: Server side spec-first library I
wrote for Clojure which inspired the handler mechanism in Climate.Keeping all of the above into consideration and the fact that Go is one of the
most widely used CLI languages,
Climate was built to address the
issues.As the name implies, its your mate or sidekick when building CLIs in Go with the
intentions of:Keeping the REST API boilerplate away from you.Keep the CLI code always in sync with the changes on the server.Ability to bootstrap at runtime without any code changes.Decoupling you from API machinery, allowing you to focus on just the handlers,
business logic and things that may not the part of the server calls.It does just enough to take the machinery out and not more like making the
calls for you too; that's business logic.Every OpenAPI3 Schema consists of one or more
Operations
having an . An Operation is a combination of the HTTP path, the
method and some parameters.Overall, Climate works by with these operations at its core. It:Parses these from the YAML or JSON file.Transforms each of these into a corresponding Cobra command by looking at
hints from the server.Transform each of the parameters into a Flag with the type.Build a grouped Cobra command tree and attach it to the root command.Climate allows the server to influence the CLI behaviour by using OpenAPI's
extensions.
This is the secret of Climate's dynamism. Influenced by some of the ideas behind
restish it uses the following extensions as of now:: A list of strings which would be used as the alternate names
for an operation.: A string to allow grouping subcommands together. All operations
in the same group would become subcommands in that group name.: A boolean to hide the operation from the CLI menu. Same
behaviour as a cobra command hide: it's present and expects a handler.: A boolean to tell climate to omit the operation completely.: A string to specify a different name. Applies to operations and
request bodies as of now.As of now, only the primitive types are supported:More support for
types like
collections and composite types are planned. These are subject to limitations of
what Cobra can do out of the box and what makes sense from a CLI perspective.

It's a versatile, platform-independent language that's widely used in a variety of industries, from Android app development to enterprise software solutions.However, despite its popularity, Java is often surrounded by myths and misconceptions that can discourage beginners from learning the language. In this post, we'll debunk some of the most common myths about Java and explore the benefits of learning this powerful language.Myth #1: Java is too hard to learnOne of the most common myths about Java is that it's a steep learning curve for beginners. While it's true that Java can be a complex language, the reality is that the learning curve depends largely on the instructor or resource you're using. If you're learning from someone who struggled to grasp Java themselves, it's likely to be a more challenging experience. However, with the right guidance and resources, Java can be a relatively accessible language to learn, even for beginners.Myth #2: Java is not suitable for lightweight, quick tasksAnother myth about Java is that it's not suitable for lightweight, quick tasks. While it's true that Java is better suited for larger and more complex applications, this doesn't mean it can't be used for smaller tasks. In fact, Java's versatility and platform independence make it a great choice for a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex enterprise systems. And with the rise of multi-file source code and shebang execution under Linux, Java is becoming an increasingly popular choice for quick and lightweight tasks.Myth #3: Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) is not open sourceOne of the most common misconceptions about Java is that the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) is not open source. However, this is not true. OpenJDK is a completely open-source implementation of the JDK, and it's where the majority of Java development happens. Oracle Java developers contribute to the OpenJDK project, ensuring that Java remains a community-driven and open-source language.Myth #4: Java is an "old" languageAnother myth about Java is that it's an "old" language, with some developers viewing it as outdated or obsolete. However, the reality is that Java's age is actually a benefit. Java's maturity means it's a well-established and widely used language, with a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. This also translates to excellent documentation and a large community of developers who can provide support and guidance.Myth #5: There are too many Java programmersFinally, some developers believe that there are too many Java programmers, making it a less desirable skill to have. However, the reality is that having a large community of Java developers is actually a benefit. With so many Java developers out there, it's easy to find people who can help you out and mentor you, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk&apos;s X faces criminal probe in France over algorithm manipulation concerns</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/07/elon-musks-x-faces-criminal-probe-in-france-over-algorithm-concerns.html</link><author>/u/Puginator</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:09:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[French prosecutors on have opened an investigation into Elon Musk's X over allegations that it distorted its algorithms to manipulate discourse taking place on the social media platform.The Paris public prosecutor's office said it received a report from a French lawmaker on Jan. 12 criticizing X over "biased algorithms" that were "likely to have distorted the operation of an automated data processing system."Magistrates and specialized assistants of the office's cybercrime section have been tasked with¬†analyzing the report¬†and carrying out initial technical checks on the platform, the prosecutor's office told CNBC Friday, in emailed comments.CNBC has contacted X for comment.X, which was formerly known as Twitter, has been dogged by concerns surrounding shortcomings on content moderation since Musk bought the platform in 2022 for $44 billion.According to French radio station Franceinfo, the French lawmaker who sent the report to the prosecutor's office was Eric Bothorel, an MP in President Emmanuel Macron's own Ensemble Pour La Republique party.Meanwhile, the European Union has been investigating X for potential violations of the Digital Services Act, a law that requires social media firms to tackle the spread of harmful content on their platforms.Last month, the European Commission which is the executive arm of the EU asked X to hand over internal documents about its algorithms by Feb. 15, as part of its ongoing DSA investigation into the company.X has been accused of manipulating its systems to give far-right posts and politicians greater visibility over other political groups.Musk has made several public statements in Germany voicing support for the country's far-right Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party, even making a surprise virtual appearance at a campaign event last month.The AfD was polling second ahead of Germany's upcoming Feb. 23 general election.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your Dream Life is a Trap</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/your-dream-life-is-a-trap?source=rss</link><author></author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:09:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, an entrepreneur in my mentorship group shared his "dream life" vision board. Beach houses. Supercars. Private jets. The whole aspirational package.\
"But how's your Tuesday looking?" I asked.\
The silence was telling.We've got it backwards in entrepreneurship. We obsess over these massive future milestones while treating our daily experience as something to endure. Something to push through until we "make it."\
But here's the brutal truth about building a business: Your Tuesday afternoon matters more than your five-year vision.\
I'm reminded of an old Irish folktale about a man who spent his entire life chasing leprechauns, convinced that if he caught one, he'd find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. He crossed oceans, climbed mountains, and explored every forest‚Äîalways just one step behind.\
Years later, on his deathbed, he discovered that his own backyard had been built on an ancient gold mine.\
This is the entrepreneur's paradox: We chase the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow while ignoring the gold beneath our feet. The present moment isn't just a stepping stone to some future paradise‚Äîit's the foundation of everything we'll build.\
Think about the entrepreneurs you admire most. The ones actually building remarkable things. They're not grinding through miserable days dreaming about some future paradise. They've engineered daily experiences that energize them, challenge them, and light them up.\
The greatest lie in entrepreneurship is that you need to suffer now to enjoy life later.\
I watched a founder burn through three years of his life building an eight-figure business. Classic hustle story. Working weekends. Missing his kids' events. Treating his health like an inconvenience. He finally hit his numbers, bought the dream house, and realized something terrifying: He had trained himself to hate every day.\
The vision board fantasy keeps us stuck because it creates a dangerous bargain: trade your present life for a promised future. But business growth doesn't work that way. You can't sustainably build something great from a place of daily misery.\
Most of us already have access to 80% of what makes a day great. Deep work. Movement. Real conversations. Problems worth solving.\
But we're too busy fantasizing about future billions to design the day right in front of us.Let's get brutally honest about how life actually works. Your year isn't made up of highlight reel moments. It's built from ordinary Wednesdays. Regular mornings. Normal afternoons.\
Do the math: You'll live about 250 workdays this year. Maybe 10-15 "dream life" days if you're lucky.\
Imagine you have two jars:Jar A contains 250 marbles representing your workdaysJar B contains 10 marbles representing your "dream" days\
Most entrepreneurs focus all their energy on optimizing those 10 marbles while treating the other 250 as disposable. It's like having a bank account with $250,000 but only caring about $10,000 of it.\
Yet I watch entrepreneurs pour their energy into optimizing those rare peak moments while treating the other 250 days like something to survive. The math doesn't work. It's like focusing all your attention on New Year's Eve while ignoring the rest of December.\
Your life happens in 24-hour blocks. Not in five-year leaps.\
Think about how business growth actually happens. It's not in breakthrough moments. It's in consistent execution. Regular client meetings. Daily decisions. Small improvements stacked on top of each other.\
I've seen businesses implode because their founders built systems they hated running. They designed their days around some imagined future instead of what actually works for them right now. Their perfect business plan looked great on paper but was miserable to execute on a random Thursday.\
The entrepreneurs who win aren't waiting to start living. They're building businesses that fit their natural rhythm.¬†They understand a fundamental truth: You can't build a thriving business from a place of daily drain.\
This isn't about lowering your ambitions. It's about sequencing them properly. Instead of fantasizing about your dream life, what if you started by designing a day that energizes you? A day that plays to your strengths instead of fighting against them?\
Because here's what nobody tells you about those big entrepreneurial success stories: They're built on a foundation of well-designed ordinary days.Most business advice focuses on exceptions. Launch days. Big presentations. Major deals. But your success and satisfaction live in the routine. The regular rhythm. The unsexy middle.\
Your average day is your actual life.\
When I shifted from chasing outcomes to designing experience, everything changed. I stopped seeing my daily schedule as an obstacle to my goals and started treating it as¬†the foundation of everything I wanted to build.\
Here's what I learned: The best daily design starts with energy, not time. Most entrepreneurs do this backwards. They try to squeeze more into their calendar without understanding their natural rhythm.\
Pay attention to when your mind is sharpest. When you naturally focus best. When you feel most creative.\
These aren't preferences. They're data points.\
I know a founder who fought her night owl tendencies for years because "successful people wake up early." She finally stopped fighting. Redesigned her day around her peak evening hours. Her business doubled in 18 months because she stopped wasting energy forcing an unnatural rhythm.\
Success isn't about copying someone else's schedule. It's about honoring how you actually work.\
Start with your non-negotiables. The things that make you feel human. Movement. Deep work. Real connection. Then build your business day around protecting these elements instead of sacrificing them.\
The entrepreneurs who sustain success aren't just good at business. They're good at designing days they can actually sustain. Days that energize instead of drain. Days worth repeating.\
Because a business that requires you to hate your daily experience isn't really an asset. It's just a well-disguised trap.Most entrepreneurs think business growth and personal satisfaction are opposing forces. That you have to choose between building something great and having days you actually enjoy.\
This might be the most expensive myth in business.\
Think about how this plays out: You push through endless draining days, telling yourself it's temporary. Just until you hit the next milestone. Just until you can hire more help. Just until things "settle down."\
But business doesn't settle down. It settles up.\
What actually happens is you train yourself to operate from a place of constant strain. You build systems and habits around that strain. You make decisions from that strain.¬†And your business becomes a reflection of that strained energy.\
The counterintuitive truth? Daily satisfaction is a business multiplier. When you're operating from a place of genuine energy and engagement, everything works better:\
Your decision-making improves because you're not running on fumes.Your team performs better because they're not absorbing your stressed energy.Your clients get better results because you're fully present for them.\
A business built on days you love becomes an asset that compounds. A business built on days you hate becomes a liability that extracts.Let's get tactical about building days worth repeating. This isn't about dramatic overhauls. It's about intentional micro-adjustments that compound over time.\
Start with an energy audit.¬†Not a time audit. Track when you naturally hit your stride each day. When you think most clearly. When you feel most creative. When you need to recharge.¬†These patterns are your building blocks.\
Most entrepreneurs discover they're fighting their natural rhythm without realizing it. Scheduling critical work when their energy dips. Taking important calls when they're mentally drained. Small misalignments that create constant friction.\
Design your day around energy protection instead of time management.\
I rebuilt my entire schedule around three peak focus hours in the morning. No calls. No meetings. No distractions. Just pure creation and critical thinking. It felt almost irresponsible at first. But protecting those hours changed everything.\
The key is starting small. Don't try to revolutionize your entire day at once. Pick one window of time that matters most. One type of work that deserves your best energy.¬†Protect that first. Let the rest of your schedule adapt around it.\
Then watch for the ripple effects. Better energy leads to better decisions. Better decisions create more space. More space allows for better boundaries.¬†It's a positive spiral that starts with one protected block of time.\
Pay attention to what drains you. Those "small" calls that leave you exhausted. The low-value tasks you dread. The meetings that could be emails.¬†These aren't just irritations. They're data points showing you where to make changes.\
Your perfect day already exists in pieces. You've experienced fragments of it. Moments when everything clicked. Hours when you were in complete flow.¬†The art is in stringing those pieces together intentionally.The hardest part isn't designing your ideal day. It's protecting it as your business grows.¬†Success has a way of trying to pull you back into old patterns.\
More opportunities mean more demands on your time. More revenue brings more complexity. More visibility creates more distractions. The very growth you're working toward will test every boundary you set.\
This is where most entrepreneurs slip backward.¬†They build a great daily rhythm, then abandon it at the first sign of pressure. They treat their ideal day like a luxury instead of a necessity.\
But your daily experience isn't just another business variable. It's the foundation everything else is built on.\
Think about the compounding effect of your daily experience. Every time you compromise your ideal day, you're not just affecting those 24 hours. You're setting patterns that will shape your next month, quarter, and year.\
The entrepreneurs who sustain long-term success aren't just good at building businesses. They're masters at protecting their energy as those businesses grow.\
This isn't about being rigid. It's about being intentional. Your ideal day will evolve as your business does. But that evolution should come from conscious choice, not external pressure.\
Stop waiting for some future moment to start enjoying your life. Stop treating your daily experience like a sacrifice on the altar of success.¬†Because the truth is devastatingly simple: Your dream life already exists in the day right in front of you.\
The only question is whether you'll have the courage to build it.\
P.S. The next time you're tempted to grind through another draining day in service of some future goal, remember: Your life isn't waiting in your vision board. It's happening right now, in the next 24 hours. Make them count.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DeFi&apos;s Not Doing so Great Right Now</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/defis-not-doing-so-great-right-now?source=rss</link><author>maxo1st</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:06:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This picture was AI-generated with perchance.orgHow DeFi went from revolutionary to repetitive: Chasing yields, dodging rug pulls, and watching protocols rebrand. Sometimes you need to point out the problems to make things better.I speak for every DeFi user who has been around since 2020 when I say that it feels like DeFi is stagnating. What exactly do I mean by this? Nowadays, hardly any new, innovative and, above all, trustworthy and user-friendly new protocols are being launched that appeal to a regular user. I‚Äôm not trying to sound melancholic and say that everything was better in the past. There have been plenty of hacks and complete failures of major protocols such as Euler Finance (lost value: $179,000,000) or similar. (I only take Euler Finance as an example, I have nothing against the protocol, or the team and was not affected) [1]. However, you can‚Äôt get rid of the feeling that DeFi is no longer progressively evolving but stagnating.The large DeFi institutions, such as Uniswap, Aave, and Compound, have established themselves and are still essential. When these protocols were launched around 2020, they greatly advanced the development of DeFi and were its true beginning. This is also due to the fact that DeFi did not really exist before and therefore simple products such as swapping, lending, and borrowing were considered ‚Äònew and innovative‚Äô. In the long run, however, they have proven to be reliable, trustworthy, and user-friendly and have thus become the DeFi giants they are today and continue to enjoy great popularity. For example, Uniswap has a daily volume of $2 to 3 billion on average [2], while Aave and Compound have a TVL of $21 billion and $2.8 billion respectively [3][4].The Copycat Crisis ‚Äî Recycled Products, Recycled ProblemsOver the course of time, these protocols have naturally been joined by similar spin-offs, which also play a major part today and also have their ‚Äúraison d‚Äô√™tre‚Äù, such as Jupiter and PancakeSwap for example [5][6]. Behind these front row protocols, many copycats have emerged. These new protocols want a piece of the pie and offer identical products. In order to try to be competitive, ever newer protocols emerge, which then artificially keep the yields high with their new shiny tokens to attract new users to their platforms. This is the eternal cycle that continues to this day.At a certain point, you have to ask yourself what the point is. The added value is no longer apparent. Far too often, a valued concept is recycled without there being any innovative thought behind it that improves the existing concept. As I already mentioned, the yields are often inflated by new protocols to attract users, just so that the creator team can dump the team tokens after a few months to make a profit. (Joshua Field wrote a good article about Real Yield in 2023 [7]).This pattern repeats frequently. Protocols are either abandoned or rebranded to hide their problems. Take Alpha Finance, oops I mean Stella Finance of course, oh no oops, after the latest rebrand I mean LitLayer of course [8]. You see what I mean.The user journey turns into a constant fund-moving from protocol to protocol to collect artificially inflated yields and sell the protocol tokens faster than the teams can do it, or as Joshua Field called it ‚Äú‚Äù [7]. This user journey is extremely unfriendly to users and new DeFi users will wake up to the bitter reality that the tokens they earned through lending, for example, have virtually no value (anymore) at the end and the actual yield is now much lower than what they hoped for.Obviously, competition is good in itself and stimulates the market, but it is questionable whether this works in the current DeFi sector. Far too often the same product is repackaged, and the competition doesn‚Äôt try to stand out from the crowd with innovative products or improvements.When Innovation Actually Means SomethingIt is probably time to highlight Pendle here. Although the protocol has actually existed since 2021 [9], it only really experienced an upswing and hype at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, with its market capitalisation growing from $200 million in December 2023 to around $6.5 billion within 6 months [10]. Why is that? Clearly because of the Eigenlayer Points [11] that were in hype at the time and could be farmed with Pendle, but also because it is a new and innovative protocol that has never existed in this form before.To describe Pendle effectively in the words of the Messari website: ‚ÄúPendle offers a market for fixed and floating rates of supported yield-bearing tokens by which users can earn fixed yield, long yield (e.g., speculate on the yield of the underlying token increasing), and provide liquidity to the Pendle pool for the underlying token.‚Äù [12]Pendle, although relatively complicated, is an example of innovation in the DeFi sector. The product‚Äôs complexity may limit its adoption, especially for new users without a financial background. However, that‚Äôs a topic for another article. The point here is that the DeFi sector can do more than just repackage and exploit the ever-same products, and Pendle is a very positive standout example of this.The Reality of DeFi TodayThus, one can conclude from these developments of the last 2‚Äì3 years that DeFi is developing in an unproductive direction, which makes no sense for the adoption of crypto and DeFi. So it is hardly surprising that a ‚Äònewbie‚Äô buys a useless meme token with a cute dog as a logo and a funny name, because that is understandable and simple. A meme token has no purpose and no utility but is usually the entry point into crypto these days.We can no longer deny it: DeFi has evolved, but is currently a shadow of its original promise. Instead of promoting financial inclusion and pushing boundaries, we‚Äôve allowed fraud, pointlessness, and the repackaging of the same old products to dominate the DeFi Space.Personally, as a user of several DeFi protocols, I have found myself in the same old situation again and again: My funds rotate from protocol to protocol so that I can generate some yield. However, knowing that there might often be a cash grab behind the protocols, I naturally have to sell my tokens and move on to another. And the cycle repeats, after all, I am just a normal DeFi user trying to navigate the current DeFi space.This is my opinion and even though my attitude towards DeFi is very gloomy at the moment, and I myself notice how my interest is decreasing more and more, I love DeFi. And that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm writing this article. Out of my love for DeFi, which is of course why I hope that we can improve the sector together. After all, I don‚Äôt seem to be the only one who has noticed the problem:\

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?

Filmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. 

Emilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.

In this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. 

The film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.

The crypto market has evolved significantly, shifting from speculative investment to a cornerstone of modern finance. As we enter 2025, it presents remarkable opportunities driven by technological innovation, regulatory advancements, and institutional interest. With decentralized finance (DeFi) gaining momentum, blockchain-based solutions offer unprecedented competition to traditional financial systems, promoting transparency, security, and inclusivity.\
Crypto exchanges are essential platforms in digital assets, facilitating the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies. These exchanges are essential for anyone looking to delve into cryptocurrencies. The year 2025 laid the groundwork for a crypto renaissance, shifting from volatile speculation to mainstream integration. Major milestones included the launch of successful Bitcoin ETFs, significant price surges, and the rise of pro-crypto sentiment in Washington.Emerging Crypto Trends in 2025Forecasts for 2025 suggest that cryptocurrency price fluctuations could decrease due to mass acceptance, liquidity consolidation, and stronger immunity against market swings. The cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 is witnessing several emerging trends set to shape the future of digital finance. The evolving crypto market will bring newfound stability and opportunities for investors and institutions.\
From Bitcoin's growing role as a store of value to the rise of stablecoin competitors and platforms focusing on long-term wealth-building, cryptocurrency's impact will deepen across the financial landscape. Bitcoin will be the primary secured asset for standard finance and DeFi loans, while stablecoins will become the most popular means of financial transactions.\
The price of Bitcoin is anticipated to go beyond $200,000 with the help of increasing adoption and Bitcoin ETF inflows. Apart from that, Ethereum and Solana may also see new peaks when smart contracts, DeFi platforms, and layer-2 solutions attract the masses. On the other hand, altcoins such as memecoins and AI-driven tokens could be a new wave of investment opportunities and bring back a great sum of money.Cryptocurrency exchanges are the backbone of the digital asset ecosystem, providing essential infrastructure for trading, liquidity, and innovation.

I don't mind paying them but I'm not a fan of all the effort involved in collecting all the forms and making sure to fill out all the boxes correctly or else risk getting audited. It's especially painful for me because my job gives me RSUs which are automatically sold to cover taxes and at the end of the year, sends me a 1099-B with every single sale of every single stock grant which usually amounts to 90+ sales that I have to report.In theory, I could file a summary of sales and send out a Form 8949 but the first year I did this, I didn't do the process properly which resulted in me getting audited.Ever since that incident, I've diligently copied every single row from my 1099 to TurboTax which usually took 3 hours and sometimes 2 people. This year I decided to change things up. Most of the process is extremely repetitive - you read a row, click on the form, fill the required details, and then move on to the next row. Seemed like the perfect job for autohotkey.Step 1: Figuring out where to clickI could do this using trial and error but it was much simpler to automate this part too. I wrote a script that would tell me my mouse cursor position for each clickF6::
MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos
FileAppend, %xpos%`, %ypos%`n, mouse_positions.txt
return
One thing that I needed to keep in mind was that I wouldn't be able to scroll so I had to shrink the text size to make everything fit. And with that, I had a list of all the places I'd need to click and what to enter at each locationI could probably automate the PDF parsing as well, but it turned out to be much simpler to just copy paste the details into a text file. After cleaning up all the unnecessary details using Sublime's regex find and replace, I ended up with a text file  like this:Step 3: Writing the automation scriptNow for the fun part. I hadn't worked with autohotkey before but I knew that this was the exact kind of thing that it was built for. Turns out I was right and for once in my life the coding went by pretty smoothly.The main structure of the program was like this:#Persistent
#SingleInstance Force
SetTitleMatchMode, 2

; Give time to focus the TurboTax window
Sleep, 2000

dataFile := "data.txt" ; Specify the text file to read from
Loop, Read, %dataFile% {
    line := A_LoopReadLine
    elements := StrSplit(line, " ") ; Split the line by spaces

    ; open dropdown
    MouseClick, left, 252, 419
    Sleep, 100

    ; select from drop down
    MouseClick, left, 259, 462
    Sleep, 100

    ; go to description field
    MouseClick, left, 244, 556
    Sleep, 50

    ; enter description
    Send, % elements[1] . " UBER"

    ....
    ; check for wash sale
    if (elements.Length() >= 7) {
        ... ; enter wash sale adjustment
        ; click submit
        MouseClick, left, 524, 1220
        Sleep 5000
    } else {
        ; click submit
        MouseClick, left, 516, 957
        Sleep 5000
    }
    
    ; add new row
    ; can't use a mouseclick here because the "Add new" button moves down as the table grows
    SetKeyDelay, 50
    Loop, 4
    Send, {rshift down}{tab}{rshift up}
    SendInput, {enter}
    SetKeyDelay, -1

    Sleep, 3000
}

return

; Exit script on Escape key
Esc::ExitApp
A few interesting things that I figured out while testingWhen adding a new row, I needed to cycle through the buttons using tab backwards since the "Add new row" button position changes as the table size grows with each new row.The most time consuming part ended up being tuning the delays. TurboTax starts out fast but after entering a few rows, it slows to a crawl and even a 5 second delay isn't enough. Things never really got into a rhythm and I had to keep adjusting the wait time to give the app time to keep up with the script.TurboTax only allows 25 rows per page so halfway through, I needed to change the script again to account for the new location of the "Add new row" button. Instead of 4 tabs back, I needed to change it to 7 (and then again to 8. and then 9... the table grew pretty large)With the script ready, it was time to run it. And boy did it run. Right away, it finished submitting around 15 rows before I even figured out what I was planning on doing with all my new found free time.The excitement was short lived though because I hit a snag pretty quickly. TurboTax would occasionally take an extra second loading but my script didn't care and would go on clicking all over the place so I'd have to babysit it and make sure to press Escape before it did anything crazy.Whenever I stopped the script, I had to find the last row that was submitted and delete all the data that was processed from the txt file. In total, I had to do this about 25 times.All things considered I'd consider it a success. The script took me about 45 minutes to write and debug and then around another 30 minutes to run/fix any hidden errors. Even if it took me around 1 minute to manually enter each row, it was already almost twice as fast and I can reuse this script next year.Also, whenever I did this manually, I usually made at least one data entry error so it would usually take another 10-15 minutes double checking all my data to figure out where the error was. In this case, once the script completed, I just checked the totals to make sure everything lined up - either I'd get a perfect answer or I'd get something radically off. It worked on the first try.I'm not sure what the moral of the story here is but maybe there are some cases where it actually does make sense to automate things in my life. I'll be looking out for those opportunities more now. #Programming Written by @preethamrn: Software developer at Uber with a degree in CS. Go, Storage, Distributed Systems, Bouldering, Rubik's Cubes.

In this post, I‚Äôll walk through my thought process for testing React components that rely on context, using Testing Library. My aim is to explore a different approach to testing these components, examining the pros and cons of using mocks versus testing without mocking the context. We‚Äôll look at how each approach impacts the tests‚Äô reliability, and I‚Äôll share insights on when and why one method may be more beneficial than the other in real-world applications.What reactjs is used for (probably you have written some apps already)The ReactJS context emerged as a solution to a common problem in the structure of ReactJS components: prop drilling. Prop drilling occurs when we have a chain of components that need to access the same set of data. The context mechanism allows components to share the same set of data as long as the context itself is the first descendant.\
In the reactjs documentation, the context for holding the theme is used, as other component might need this information the docs use the context to handle that instead of passing the value via props. Another example is the usage of context to hold the layout of the application, in the json-tool example the App.tsx wraps the application with a DefaultLayout context that is available for all the application.For the example that follows the theme app will be used. It is an application that allows users to switch between light/dark themes. The app is also used in the reactjs official documentation. This application consist of a simple toggle that switches between light theme mode and dark theme mode. The application is as simple as it gets and we can plot everything in a single file:import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'
const ThemeContext = createContext('light')

function Page() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)
  return (
    <div>
      <p>current theme: {theme}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <button
        className={theme}
        onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}
      >
        Toggle
      </button>
      <Page />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

export default App
\
In this application, we have two main components:  and . The  component serves as the main component and contains the state for the current theme, which can be either ‚Äúlight‚Äù or ‚Äúdark‚Äù. It also includes a button that toggles the theme between light and dark modes. The  component is a child of  and consumes the theme context to display the current theme. The button in the  component is a simple toggle button that, when clicked, switches the theme and updates the context value accordingly.Usually in any application we would have to focus on what kind of test we want to do, and which slice we want to tackle. For example, we could target a single component, instead of the entire application. In our example, we will start with the Page component. Which will require us to use test-doubles to test it.\
The test-double comes from the app structure itself, as it depends on the context, to change it, the value in the context needs to change as well.To get started with our testing approach with context in reactjs we will start writing the first test:import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { Page } from './Page'

describe('<Page />', () => {
  it('should render light as default theme', () => {
    render(<Page />)
    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
\
This test will pass as expected, given that the light theme is set to be the default one in the ThemeContext. We could even test drive this first example as well, however, the things get interesting in the second test, when we are interested in the dark theme. To get in to the dark theme, we need to start using test-doubles, given that we depend on the reactjs context to do that. The second test brings the  to the mix as well as the . Note that the second test to be written also required the first one to be changed.import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { Page } from './Page'
import { useContext } from 'react'

vi.mock('react', () => {
  return {
    ...vi.importActual('react'),
    useContext: vi.fn(),
    createContext: vi.fn()
  }
})

describe('<Page />', () => {
  it('should render light as default theme', () => {
    vi.mocked(useContext).mockReturnValue('light')
    render(<Page />)
    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should render dark theme', () => {
    vi.mocked(useContext).mockReturnValue('dark')
    render(<Page />)
    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: dark')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
\
Both test cases now are using a fake to test drive the application. If we change the return data from the context, the test will also change. The points of attention here are:We are mocking reactjs context which hurst the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mock what you don‚Äôt own principle‚ÄùThe test become more verbose, since we are required to use mocking to do thatThe two tests we have written don‚Äôt reflect the user interaction with the application. We know that the theme will change when the toggle button is hit.The next approach is to use the context embedded into our application, without isolating it or using any test-double. If we take this approach with TDD, we can start with a very simple test that simulates how the user will behave:import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('should render toggle button', () => {
    render(<App />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Toggle')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
\
Then following to the second test, that we would like to set the light theme by default:import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('should render toggle button', () => {
    render(<App />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Toggle')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should render light as default theme', () => {
    render(<App />)
    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
\
and last but not least the theme switching:import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('should render toggle button', () => {
    render(<App />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Toggle')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should render light as default theme', () => {
    render(<App />)
    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: light')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should render dark theme on toggle', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup()
    render(<App />)

    await user.click(screen.getByText('Toggle'))

    expect(screen.getByText('current theme: dark')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
\
Points of attention to this strategy:Test-doubles are not required, it makes the test with less codeThe behaviour of the test matches what the user will do in the real applicationPros and cons of each approachIn this sections we will go over the pros and cons of each approach in regards to different properties.Using a test-double for the context makes the test fragile for this kind of change. Refactoring the usage of useContext with props automatically makes the test to fail even when the behaviour doesn‚Äôt. Using the option that doesn‚Äôt use test-doubles supports refactoring in that sense. In the book ‚ÄúRefactoring in Large Software Projects‚Äù the authors Stefan Roock and Martin Lippert depicted a scenario that is similar to what I am stating in here. One of the problems that they discussed is relatated with refactoring and changing class structures, they quote the C3 project:About every 3 or 4 iterations we do a refactoring that causes us to toss or otherwise radically
modify a group of classes. The tests will either go away or be changed to reflect the classes‚Äô new
behavior. We are constantly splitting classes up and moving behavior around. This may or may not affect the UnitTests
\
Ideally to overcome this situation the unit tests would be written based on a ‚Äústable api‚Äù and the target system under test would not be touched, however, sometimes changing the api is also needed. For that, the solution proposed by the authors is to imply automated acceptance tests.Creating a custom contextThe same happens to using a custom context instead of relying on the context provider from reactjs directly. Using the option without test-doubles enables refactoring.In this guide, we explored how to test components that rely on context, without the need for test-doubles, making the tests more straightforward, closer to real user interactions and contrasting pros and cons of each approach. Whenever possible, using the simples approach that reflects the user interaction should be followed. However, when test-doubles are required, they should be used targeting the maintainability of the test code. Having a simple test enables refactoring in the production code with confidence.Try testing more complex scenarios involving multiple contexts or nested providers.While we avoided mocks in this guide, there are cases where mocking is necessary. Explore advanced mocking techniques for those scenarios.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake TikTok videos show hundreds of thousands marching for AfD in Germany</title><link>https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/07/fake-tiktok-videos-show-hundreds-of-thousands-marching-for-afd-in-germany</link><author>/u/MichaelW85</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 16:54:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I created a little GUI tool that lets you schedule system shutdowns.

It always starts simple, right? "Does the user want the Weekly Email?" But then features grow, and suddenly you're dealing with tons of settings:  themes, notifications, currencies, time zones, the list goes on.  If you're building something complex, like Double ‚Äì which is for investing ‚Äì  settings get  important.We have to manage things like fraud settings, drift limits and wash sale prevention settings. Some of these we want to be user controlled, some should only be editable by an admin user. How you store and handle these settings really matters for your app's speed, how well it scales, and how easy it is to maintain.  I've tried a bunch of ways to manage user settings, and some are way better than others.  Let's look at common mistakes first, and then I'll show you a schema that we came up with recently that's been working really well for us.Common Mistakes:  What  To DoOne common mistake to avoid is the wide table trap, where the initial thought for managing new settings is to simply keep adding columns. It may seem easy at first; for example, setting up daily emails might look as simple as adding a  boolean column to your  table with a quick  command. However, this approach quickly leads to columns getting out of control.Before long, you'll need columns for newsletters, app notifications, dark mode, time zones, and other features, causing your  table to become a massive, wide structure. Wide tables can negatively impact performance, as queries take longer because the database has to process huge rows, many of which are sparsely populated. Indexes become more complicated, and backups and restores take significantly longer.Schema changes also become a pain point. Adding another setting involves another risky  operation in a live application. Remembering the purpose of each column becomes a documentation nightmare, and changing or removing old settings becomes a major project.Finally, because most users only modify a few settings, your  table becomes filled with wasted space in the form of numerous NULL values, further slowing down queries and wasting storage.Another approach that may seem appealing after rejecting wide tables is the "grab bag" table, often implemented as a generic  table with columns like , , and .At first glance, this key-value structure appears flexible, because it promises easy addition of new settings without altering the main table. However, bulk updates soon become a significant challenge. For example, adding a new setting to all users could require millions of insert operations, resulting in large, risky database transactions.  This can lead to server instability and data inconsistencies, often necessitating complex error handling, retry mechanisms, and background jobs to ensure data integrity.Data quality also becomes a concern because the  field can accommodate any data type ‚Äì text, numbers, booleans ‚Äì making it difficult for the database to enforce consistency.  Consequently, all data validation and type handling logic must be implemented in the application code, increasing complexity and the potential for bugs.  Finally, user signup processes can become slower.Setting default settings for new users may require inserting numerous rows into the  table, adding latency to the signup flow and increasing the chances of failures during this critical operation.3. The Schemaless TemptationAnother tempting approach, especially with the rise of NoSQL databases like MongoDB, is to store settings as JSON documents directly within each user's record.  The schemaless nature of NoSQL databases initially appears advantageous, and using JSON for settings feels like a natural fit.  Adding a new setting seems as simple as adding a new key to the JSON document. However, querying across users for specific settings becomes challenging.While document databases excel at retrieving all data for a single user, asking questions about a particular setting across all users becomes slow and inefficient.  For instance, answering "How many users use dark mode?" could require a full database scan, which does not scale efficiently.Furthermore, the perceived benefit of being "schemaless" diminishes when data consistency is required. Ensuring that every user has a specific setting or validating data types becomes the application's responsibility, as the database provides no inherent mechanisms for these rules.Finally, while NoSQL promises flexibility, settings migrations over time remain complex.  Updating settings across numerous NoSQL documents often necessitates custom scripts and background jobs, mirroring the same challenges encountered with the "grab bag" SQL table approach in terms of complexity and potential issues.A Better SQL Schema: /After struggling with these problems, I've found a SQL schema that actually works well. It balances flexibility, performance, and keeps your data sane.  It uses two key tables:  and . Table:  The Master List of SettingsThink of  as the single place where you define all possible settings in your app.  It's like the blueprint for your settings system.Unique name for the setting (primary key).The default value everyone gets.ENUM('boolean', 'string', 'integer', 'enum')What is the data type of this setting?(Optional, for 'enum' type)  List of valid choices as JSON.['daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'] (for rebalance cadence)Can users change this setting themselves? (for rebalance cadence),  (for internal flags) Table:  User-Specific Changes only stores settings where a user has changed the default.  It's kept lean and efficient.Links to the  table (part of primary key).Links to  (part of primary key).The user's chosen value for the setting.When the user made this change.When the user last updated this setting.This system is designed to be simple and effective in practice.  Adding a new setting is straightforward; you only need to insert a single row into the  table.  Here, you define the setting's name, its default value, the data type, any valid options, and whether users are allowed to edit this setting.  Crucially, this process requires no database schema alterations and avoids mass data modifications.To retrieve a user's setting, the  function (or its equivalent in your ORM) efficiently handles the logic.  It prioritizes checking the  table. If a user-specific setting exists there, that value is used.  Otherwise, the function falls back to the default value defined in the  table.SELECT COALESCE(so.value, sd.value) AS setting_value
FROM default sd
LEFT JOIN override so ON sd.name = so.name AND so.user_id = :user_id
WHERE sd.name = :setting_name;
Retrieving multiple settings for a user simultaneously remains efficient through the use of joins and filters.  Furthermore, data validation is enforced at the SQL level. When a setting is modified, a new row is inserted into the  table.  Before saving this override, validation can be performed based on the  and  columns defined in , allowing the system to reject invalid setting changes proactively.For user settings management, users can easily retrieve all their settings, encompassing both their personalized overrides and the system defaults, or filter specifically for settings they are permitted to modify.  Users can then update their settings via the application's API, which incorporates built-in validation checks and persists valid changes to the  table. This approach offers several advantages. It scales well, allowing for fast addition and retrieval of settings.  Since only user modifications are stored, the database remains efficient. Data consistency is ensured by  which establishes data types and valid options, with database-level checks promoting reliability.Settings management is simplified with  acting as a central list, eliminating ambiguity about setting definitions. The design inherently maintains data consistency, negating the need for supplementary background processes to synchronize settings.The system is clean and organized, clearly separating defaults from user-specific changes, enhancing overall system clarity and usability.   provides control over user modifications, enabling specification of settings users can adjust, which is beneficial for sophisticated applications.Finally, it facilitates efficient bulk operations and the creation of user-facing settings interfaces, making it easy to retrieve numerous settings at once. This system also presents some drawbacks. The primary disadvantage is its complexity compared to simpler methods like wide tables or key-value based approaches.Additionally, gaining easy insight into historical settings is limited. As user settings rely on two tables, tracking a setting's value at a specific past time is not straightforward, requiring periodic snapshots of both tables for reconstruction, which is less than ideal.Lastly, retrieving settings necessitates querying the application's backend to access the database (or use a cache). While slightly slower than direct column access from a  table, the benefits generally outweigh this minor performance difference. Database views can also be implemented to mitigate this speed concern in many scenarios.In Short: Ditch Giant Tables, Use The Default-Override MethodFor apps that need to be reliable and handle lots of users, especially complex ones like investing platforms, how you store settings really matters.  Moving away from simple wide tables and using a structured schema like / has been a great move for us here at Double.  It's cleaner, scales better, easier to maintain, and keeps our data in good shape.What's your experience with handling user settings?  Run into similar problems?

The Globe is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.His comments represent the most frank acknowledgment that what the federal government once dismissed as a joke ‚Äì Mr. Trump‚Äôs talk of making Canada the 51s state ‚Äì is now regarded by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office as a genuine interest on the part of the U.S. President.Mr. Trudeau made his assessment to an audience of about 200 business leaders, trade experts and union executives in Toronto who had gathered to map out ways to boost economic growth and attract new capital investment in the face of the looming threat of U.S. protectionism. He talked about two phone conversations he had with Mr. Trump on Monday before the President agreed to delay steep tariffs on Canadian goods for 30 days.The Canada-U.S. tariff war is on pause, but not over. Here are the latest updates and what they mean for your financesDuring the calls, the Prime Minister recalled, Mr. Trump referred to a four-page memo that included a list of grievances he had with Canadian trade and commercial rules including the President‚Äôs false claim that U.S. banks are unable to operate in Canada. Other complaints included Canada‚Äôs sheltered dairy industry which is protected from foreign competition by a wall of tariffs, as well as the federal goods and services tax.In the second conversation with Mr. Trump on Monday, the Prime Minister told the summit, the President asked him whether he was familiar with the Treaty of 1908, a pact between the United States and Britain that defined the border between the United States and Canada. He told Mr. Trudeau he should look it up.Mr. Trudeau told the summit he thought this treaty had been superseded by other developments such as the repatriation of the Canadian Constitution ‚Äì in other words, that the border cannot be dissolved by repealing that treaty. He told the audience that international law would prevent the dissolution of the 1908 Treaty from leading to the erasure of the border. For example, various international laws define sovereign borders, including the United Nations Charter of which both countries are signatories and which has protections for territorial integrity.A source familiar with the calls said Mr. Trump‚Äôs reference to the 1908 Treaty was taken an as implied threat. Soon after winning the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump began talking about making Canada the 51st state and suggesting Canadians could avoid his tariff threats by agreeing to a political union. The Trudeau cabinet at the time shrugged off the comments. In early January, however, Mr. Trump expanded on his proposal, publicly referred to the U.S.-Canada border as ‚Äúan artificially drawn line‚Äù and said he would be willing to use ‚Äúeconomic force‚Äù to coerce Canada into being annexed.Trump tariffs are inspiring Canada to tackle trade war from withinCanadian officials have been unable to determine the architect of the memo, the Prime Minister told the summit. Mr. Trudeau said that his team spoke with U.S. commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and two other officials that should have been involved in crafting the four-page memo Mr. Trump read from, but they were unaware of the document or its contents.Asked at the summit about Mr. Trudeau‚Äôs interpretation of Mr. Trump‚Äôs motives, Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon said the sense he got from the gathering and those assembled is that ‚ÄúCanada is free, Canada is sovereign and Canada will choose its own destiny, thank you very much.‚ÄùTransport Minister Anita Anand said Canadians are united in rejecting annexation. ‚ÄúThere will be no messing with the 49th parallel,‚Äù she said, a reference to the Canada-U.S. border.Beth Burke, CEO of the Canadian American Business Council, said Americans do not take seriously Mr. Trump‚Äôs talk of taking over Canada. She said people in the United States view the President‚Äôs persistent mention of annexation as a ‚Äúposition of negotiation and posturing and using it as leverage in the conversation.‚ÄùShe said Canada can use access to its abundant critical minerals as leverage in coming renegotiations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is due for renewal in 2026.Earlier at the gathering, Mr. Trudeau had pleaded with provinces and territories to dismantle internal barriers that discourage greater east-west trade inside Canada.Innovation Minister Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne said Mr. Trump‚Äôs decision to levy steep tariffs on Canada ‚Äì now delayed after a last-minute deal Monday ‚Äì is a ‚Äúwake-up call‚Äù for the country.The prospect of much more difficult relations with the United States must drive Canada to find other means of attracting business investment, of generating economic growth and diversifying trade beyond American customers, he said.Tariff threats already affecting Canada‚Äôs economy, BoC‚Äôs Macklem saysMr. Trudeau said a good start would be looking at interprovincial trade barriers put in place by provincial governments that make it easier for Canadians to trade with the United States rather than other provinces and territories.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time we had genuine free trade within Canada,‚Äù Mr. Trudeau told the summit.He said many of these barriers, which hinder the movement of goods and workers within the country, make no sense. The Prime Minister cited recognizing teaching certifications and tire requirements for trucks as two examples. This will make it easier for Canadians to do business ‚Äúacross Canada, east-west and not just north-south.‚ÄùA 2019 paper published by the International Monetary Fund found that Canada‚Äôs internal trade barriers ‚Äì excluding those related to geography, such as challenges with transporting goods across a country this large ‚Äì were equivalent to an average tariff of 21 per cent in 2015. The study found that lifting all internal barriers would result in 4-per-cent growth in Canada‚Äôs real gross domestic product per capita.Mr. Champagne said the most important task right now for Canada is restoring business confidence.This meeting of business and labour leaders at Toronto‚Äôs Evergreen Brick Works takes place just days after a potential shock to the Canadian economy was averted ‚Äì one that threatened to shutter businesses and cost jobs. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump held off imposing steep tariffs on Canadian imports ‚Äì a potentially devastating shock that drew fresh attention to Canada‚Äôs reliance on the U.S. market. More than 75 per cent of this country‚Äôs merchandise exports go to the United States.Mr. Champagne said the Trump tariff threat must force Canada to act quickly to safeguard its economic fortunes and standard of living.‚ÄúThe rules have changed, and so Canadians understand that we need to bring our resources to market. We need to diversify our economy. This is our moment as Canada,‚Äù Mr. Champagne said. ‚ÄúWe make sure that we build what needs to be done here in this country to succeed and to prosper.‚ÄùRising U.S. protectionism is damaging business investment in Canada, business leaders say.One of Mr. Trump‚Äôs goals in threatening tariffs on allies, Canadian officials have repeatedly said, is to force investors to relocate manufacturing to the United States ‚Äì at the expense of America‚Äôs trading partners. In addition, Mr. Trump has vowed to cut taxes and regulations, measures that could make the U.S. a more attractive market for businesses.Other protectionist threats from the Republican White House include talk of more tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper. And by April 1, U.S. government departments and agencies are supposed to report to the White House on the country‚Äôs trade deficits with major trading partners and recommend measures to rebalance.On Monday, Mr. Trump delayed tariffs of 10 per cent on Canadian energy and critical minerals and 25 per cent on the rest of Canadian goods for 30 days after Ottawa agreed to more measures to fight organized crime and the illegal production and distribution of fentanyl.Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford, who is campaigning for re-election as Ontario Premier, criticized the federal economic summit as a waste of time on Friday and urged Ottawa to tighten up the border to stop the flow of drugs on both sides. He suggested former chief of the defence staff Rick Hillier as an option for border czar. His office later clarified that Mr. Ford meant fentanyl czar, a position Mr. Trudeau said would soon be created.‚ÄúA message to the federal government: enough‚Äôs enough. I don‚Äôt need to be in a room looking at the people I‚Äôve talked to a thousand times and coming up with this idea. You know what the Trump administration wants? They‚Äôve been very very clear. They‚Äôve been clear to me, they‚Äôve been clear to everywhere in North America. They need to tighten up the border,‚Äù Mr. Ford said at a campaign stop in Scarborough.Plenty of items are marked product of Canada or made in Canada, but what do these terms really mean?

Is there a way to reuse some sort of buffer to avoid reallocating on the heap every time it makes an HTTP call? According to the process memory, it makes pretty significant spike when a burst of HTTP calls are made. I'm concerned that this is causing some kind of memory fragmenting? I recently swapped the memory allocator to jemalloc instead of the default. However, after monitoring for a few days, the memory still seems to be slowly creeping up. I've done extensive memory profiling and cannot really isolate a "leak". However, according to my metrics, when bursts in HTTP calls are made, the memory similarly spikes up and never really seems to recover fully. For example, if the process was sitting at 100mb, bursts up to 150mb, it may go back down to 110mb but not 100mb. And after long periods of time I'm observing a steady increase. Am I sweating over nothing? Is this just standard allocator behavior, holding on to pages of memory to reuse later? The docker containers limit is 512mb, the server started up at around 150mb, and after running for 2 days continuously it is sitting at 220mb. Under the default allocator, this behavior was observed all the way until it reached 512mb and OOMd (took a few weeks). Is jemalloc smarter? Will jemalloc eventually stable out somewhere and not go all the way to 512mb and kill itself?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Torvalds&apos; take on the latest Rust-Kernel drama</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ijxber/linus_torvalds_take_on_the_latest_rustkernel_drama/</link><author>/u/Non-taken-Meursault</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 15:17:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So at the end it wasn't sabotage.

Currently we're using only one shared Kubernetes cluster (via Openshift) aside from prod which we call preprod. Obviously this comes with plenty of hardships - our preprod environment is consistently broken and everytime we want to test some code we need to configure plenty of deployments to match prod's deployments, make the changes we need to test our code and pray no one else is going to override our configuration.I've been hearing that the standard today is to create an isolated dev environment for each developer in the team, which, as far as I understand, would require a different Kubernetes cluster/namespace per developer.We don't have enough resources in our cluster to create a namespace per developer, plus we don't have enough resources in our personal computers to run a Kubernetes cluster locally. We do however have enough resources to run a copy of the prod cluster in a VM. So the natural solution, as I see it, would be to run a Kubernetes cluster (pereferably with Openshift) on a different VM for every developer, or alternatively one Kubernetes cluster with a namespace per developer.What tools do you recommend to run a Kubernetes cluster in a VM with good DX when working locally? Also how would you suggest to mimic prod's cluster configuration as good as possible (networking configuration, etc)? I've heard plenty about TIlt and wondered if it'd be applicable here.If you have an alternative suggestion or something you do differently in your company, please share!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Robustness, Detectability, and Data Privacy in AI // Vinu Sankar Sadasivan // #289</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Robustness--Detectability--and-Data-Privacy-in-AI--Vinu-Sankar-Sadasivan--289-e2ui4si</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98160978/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-7%2F394458992-44100-2-ab419176af6b.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 14:44:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[is a CS PhD ...

Fingerprints have long been known to be completely unique. They also don‚Äôt change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.

Fingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person ‚Äî the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we‚Äôve previously known.

Critics have labeled the legislation the "Snooper's Charter," as it authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence.An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the revelation, though the law actually makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government even made such a demand. Likewise, the Home Office told the publication that its policy was not to discuss any technical demands. "We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices," a spokesman said.One of the people briefed on the situation, a consultant advising the United States on encryption matters, said Apple would be barred from warning its users that its most advanced encryption no longer provided full security. The person deemed it shocking that the UK government was demanding Apple's help to spy on non-British users without their governments' knowledge. A former White House security adviser confirmed the existence of the British order.Apple May Drop UK iCloud Services Over Secret Encryption Access OrderApple is likely to stop offering encrypted storage in the UK, rather than break the security promises it made to its users, people familiar with the matter told the publication. However, that would not affect the UK order for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States. Apple has previously said it would consider pulling services such as FaceTime and iMessage from the UK rather than compromise future security.The order would compromise Apple's Advanced Data Protection, which the company launched in 2022. The feature gives users the option to end-to-end encrypt many additional iCloud data categories, including Photos, Notes, Voice Memos, Messages backups, device backups, and more, making their data inaccessible to anyone else ‚Äì including Apple.Google has enforced default encryption for Android phone backups since 2018. When asked by  whether any government had requested a backdoor, Google spokesman Ed Fernandez did not provide a direct answer but suggested none exist: "Google cannot access Android end-to-end encrypted backup data, even with a legal order," he stated.The IPA was updated in 2023 to allow the Home Office to outlaw certain encrypted services using a technical capability notice. Apple at the time called the then proposed amendments "an unprecedented overreach by the government," saying that if the update was enacted, "the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers."Apple CEO Tim Cook has consistently insisted that providing back-door access past its encryption for authorities would open the door for "bad guys" to gain access to its users' data. Cyber security experts agree that it would only be a matter of time before bad actors discover such a point of entry. Apple's stance was enhanced in 2016 when it successfully fought a US order to unlock the iPhone of a shooter in San Bernardino, California.US law enforcement's longstanding objections to encryption have recently taken a backseat to concerns over large-scale cyber intrusions attributed to Chinese state-backed hackers. The attackers infiltrated major telecommunications providers, granting them unfettered access to private phone calls. During a December press conference alongside FBI officials, a Department of Homeland Security representative cautioned Americans against assuming traditional phone networks offer privacy, instead advising them to use encrypted communication whenever feasible.That same month, the FBI, National Security Agency, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint advisory detailing numerous countermeasures against the Chinese cyber campaign. Among their recommendations: "Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible."In a statement, privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch said: "This misguided attempt at tackling crime and terrorism will not make the UK safer, but it will erode the fundamental rights and civil liberties of the entire population."Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

And Bashlykov's warnings seemingly landed on deaf ears, with authors alleging that evidence showed Meta chose to instead hide its torrenting as best it could while downloading and seeding terabytes of data from multiple shadow libraries as recently as April 2024.Meta allegedly concealed seedingSupposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers, an internal message from Meta researcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as being in "stealth mode." Meta also allegedly modified settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a deposition.Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that Meta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be deposed again because the new facts allegedly "contradict prior deposition testimony."Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to have no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models. But unredacted messages show the "decision to use LibGen occurred" after "a prior escalation to MZ," authors alleged.Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment and has maintained throughout the litigation that AI training on LibGen was "fair use."However, Meta has previously addressed its torrenting in a motion to dismiss filed last month, telling the court that "plaintiffs do not plead a single instance in which any part of any book was, in fact, downloaded by a third party from Meta via torrent, much less that Plaintiffs‚Äô books were somehow distributed by Meta."While Meta may be confident in its legal strategy despite the new torrenting wrinkle, the social media company has seemingly complicated its case by allowing authors to expand the distribution theory that's key to winning a direct copyright infringement claim beyond just claiming that Meta's AI outputs unlawfully distributed their works.As limited discovery on Meta's seeding now proceeds, Meta is not fighting the seeding aspect of the direct copyright infringement claim at this time, telling the court that it plans to "set... the record straight and debunk... this meritless allegation on summary judgment."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression &quot;RTXNTC&quot; Beta</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-RTXNTC-0.5-Beta</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 11:22:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NVIDIA on Thursday published their first public beta of their RTX Neural Texture Compression "RTX NTC" software development kit...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMDVLK 2025.Q1.1 Brings New Performance Tuning &amp; Fixes</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMDVLK-2025.Q1.1-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 10:54:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AMDVLK 2025.Q1.1 is out this morning as the first update of the year to this official AMD open-source Vulkan driver for Linux systems...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why China‚Äôs Luxury Boom Is Over</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY0UMiSOgI</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/waY0UMiSOgI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 09:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The global luxury market has been booming for more than a decade, pushing up the values of companies such as LVMH and Kering.

Predestination is ultimate destiny, fate. It is the claim by some religions that a Supreme Being, whether a personal God or a cosmic force, has determined for individual lives their ultimate course. When God foreordains, whether for salvation or for damnation, nothing can resist. Is this fair? Does this make sense? Would you like such a God?

The conflict centers on a proposed patch enabling Rust-written device drivers to access the kernel's DMA API, which Hellwig strongly opposed. While the dispute isn't about Rust itself, Hellwig argues that maintaining cross-language codebases severely compromises Linux's integrated nature. From a report: "Don't force me to deal with your shiny language of the day," he [Hellwig] wrote. "Maintaining multi-language projects is a pain I have no interest in dealing with. If you want to use something that's not C, be that assembly or Rust, you write to C interfaces and deal with the impedance mismatch yourself as far as I'm concerned." This resistance follows the September departure of Microsoft engineer Wedson Almeida Filho from the Rust for Linux project, citing "nontechnical nonsense."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: An API that takes a URL and returns a file with browser screenshots</title><link>https://github.com/US-Artificial-Intelligence/scraper</link><author>gkamer8</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:48:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: SQLite disk page explorer</title><link>https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer</link><author>QuadrupleA</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:40:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google finally shipped some fire‚Ä¶</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9xbh9LUYn0</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/k9xbh9LUYn0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:26:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deploy your app without complexity using Sevalla http://bit.ly/4hDju8W

Well we can! Thanks to the extraordinary work of the artist hans Holbein the Younger.

Professor Suzannah Lipscomb goes to Buckingham Palace to enter the gallery of the Royal Collection where a brilliant exhibition of Hans Holbein‚Äôs works takes us to the very heart of life in the Tudor court - meeting the men and women who witnessed and changed history, Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Jane Seymour.  Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. 

Suzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII‚Äôs inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. 

And there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein‚Äôs genius.

But a Bloomberg investigation reveals that several private hospital companies funded by the IFC have kept patients in their care until they can cover their bills or otherwise satisfy the hospital they will be able to pay. This policy can, at times, keep people from going home many days after they are medically ready for discharge. One healthcare company in the Philippines says it‚Äôs just following the law.

Using modern genetic techniques, they‚Äôre extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world? Or is science playing God?

Findings in the thawed permafrost of Siberia have made it possible to reconstruct the DNA of mammoths. Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. 

In Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator‚Äôs genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. 

And biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. 

However, these practices are also attracting criticism. Biology researchers question the usefulness of revived species for natural habitats. They fear that the excitement surrounding the idea of bringing back extinct species could distract people from the many problems that cause animals to disappear, in the first place. Are some scientists playing God - with unforeseeable consequences for the environment?

In a  leaderboard, updates happen almost instantly:A player‚Äôs score changes (e.g., after scoring a point or defeating an opponent).The system updates that player‚Äôs rank immediately.Other players can see the updated position without waiting or refreshing.This real-time aspect makes the user experience more dynamic and engaging. However, it also introduces significant , such as:Efficiently retrieving Top-N players (e.g., Top 10 or Top 100).Allowing players to quickly find their own rank without scanning the entire leaderboard.In this article, we will explore how to design a , , and  that can support above queries and enhance the user experience.Before diving into the design, lets clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of our real-time gaming leaderboard..: Display top N players (e.g., top 10, top 100) on the leaderboard and update it in real-time.: Allow a player to query their current rank without scanning the entire leaderboard. Provide the ability to retrieve a ‚Äúslice‚Äù of the leaderboard around a specific player (e.g., ranks 45 to 55 if the player is rank 50). Players can view past game scores and historical leaderboards for previous matches.Non-Functional Requirements Score changes should reflect immediately in the leaderboard.: Leaderboard queries should return the results in milliseconds.: System should support thousands of concurrent players submitting scores and fetching rankings.Approach to Designing the SystemThe most challenging aspects of building a real-time leaderboard is . Choosing the right storage system is critical to ensuring that queries can be executed efficiently without performance bottlenecks.To simplify the design process, we will follow below approach:Clearly define the input/output structure of leaderboard queries and updates.Define the High-Level Architecture: Identify core system components and their interactions.Choose the appropriate storage model optimized for fast leaderboard lookups and real-time updates.To support real-time leaderboard operations, we define a set of  that allow players to update scores, retrieve rankings, and query nearby ranks efficiently.Updates a player's score incrementally: POST /leaderboard/score/update{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "scoreDelta": 50
}We will use relative score updates () rather than absolute updates.{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "updatedScore": 1000,
  "currentRank": 10

  ]
}Allows a player to retrieve their current rank without scanning the entire leaderboard.: GET /leaderboard/rank/{playerId}{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "score": 1000,
  "rank": 10
}Retrieves players ranked around a given player, allowing for comparison with competitors of similar skill levels.: GET /leaderboard/nearby/{playerId}?range=5:  indicates how many ranks above and below to fetch (e.g., 5 above, 5 below).{
  "playerId": "player123",

WSJ‚Äôs Jonathan Cheng traveled to the world‚Äôs largest wholesale market called the Yiwu International Trade Market to see how these products are making their way into U.S. markets. If you‚Äôve ever bought anything on Temu or Shein, there‚Äôs a good chance it came from this bazaar near China‚Äôs east coast, which is close to huge ports in Shanghai and Ningbo. 

WSJ explores why this market in China, the center point of global wholesale trade, has found itself in the U.S. government‚Äôs crosshairs.

The reason, we suspect, is because folks often forget the order of arrays that come out. We know that `X_train` comes first, but then what? Is it `y_train` or `X_test`? This video explains the reasoning and also does a deep dive on the implementation.

(I‚Äôd be happy if you could give it a star!)And now it runs in the browser using WebAssembly!While explaining the implementation process of Ruby Boy, I‚Äôll introduce the points where I got stuck and the techniques I devised.
I‚Äôll also introduce what I did to optimize Ruby Boy.Finally, I‚Äôll show how Ruby Boy works in the browser using WebAssembly.Why I Created a Game Boy Emulator#I wanted to do some personal development, but since web services incur maintenance costs, I wanted to create something that could be maintained for freeAs I use Ruby for work, I had been wanting to create a Ruby gem for a whileDeveloping a game emulator has ‚Äúclear goals & is fun when it works‚Äù, so it seemed like it would be easier to maintain motivationIn particular, I have a special attachment to the Game Boy‚Üí Let‚Äôs create a Game Boy emulator in Ruby and release it as a gem!The following image is the architecture of the Game Boy:The goal is to implement a program that emulates this hardware.
The class diagram of Ruby Boy and the roles of each class are as follows:Lcd: Handles screen renderingBus: Controller for implementing memory-mapped I/O. Mediates the reading and writing of configuration values from the CPU to various hardwareCpu: Reads instructions from ROM, interprets and executes themRegisters: Performs reading and writing of registersCartridge: Performs reading and writing of ROM and RAM in the cartridge. Implementation differs for each type of MBC chip (explained later)Apu: Generates audio dataRom: Loads the game program from the cartridgeRam: Performs reading and writing of RAM data in the cartridge and Game BoyInterrupt: Manages interrupts. Interrupts are performed from the following three classesTimer: Counts the number of cyclesPpu: Generates pixel information to be rendered on the displayJoypad: Receives button inputs from the Game BoyIn Ruby Boy, synchronization between components is achieved by having the CPU execute instructions and advancing the cycle count of Ppu, Timer, and Apu by the number of cycles taken for execution.
Therefore, the contents of the main loop are as follows:I have compiled my implementation notes in a scrap. I will explain by extracting from this.The UI part that handles screen rendering, audio playback, and keyboard input was implemented using SDL2 via the Ruby-FFI gem.
I created a wrapper class that aggregates the necessary SDL2 methods, and the design is to call SDL2 methods from there.First, I made it possible to load and use the game data.
For example, the title is stored at 0x0134~0x0143, so it can be retrieved as follows:Implementation of MBC (Memory Bank Controller)#Many Game Boy games use MBC (Memory Bank Controller), which achieves address space expansion through bank switching.
There are different types of MBC chips such as MBC1, MBC3, MBC5, etc., each with different sizes of usable ROM and RAM, so implementation specific to the type of MBC chip is necessary.
Ruby Boy supports NoMBC (without MBC) and MBC1 games, and I used the Factory pattern to return the appropriate MBC implementation. By adding chip implementations and case handling, it‚Äôs possible to support other types of MBC chips as well.I implemented a program that repeats the following CPU execution cycle:Fetch instruction from ROMTo maintain motivation, instead of implementing all CPU and PPU processes at once, I first aimed to run the following minimal test ROM:For debugging, I used a Game Boy emulator called BGB. It‚Äôs useful because you can execute step by step while displaying register and memory information, allowing you to compare the behavior with your own CPU.I checked the required CPU instructions using BGB and implemented them. Then, implementing the PPU‚Äôs bg rendering process will make the test pass.Next, I implemented all instructions and interrupt handling, aiming to pass two CPU test ROMs: cpu_instrs and instr_timing.Points Where I Got Stuck#When setting the value of f in , I hadn‚Äôt set the lower 4 bits to 0000The lower 4 bits of the f register are always 0000The c flag calculation was incorrect for two CPU instructions (opcode=0xe8, 0xf8):  and .It passed with cflag = (@sp & 0xff) + (byte & 0xff) > 0xffBy fixing these, it successfully passed.‚Ä¶The rendering looks a bit off, but the CPU processing is OK.I aimed to implement the remaining rendering processes and pass dmg-acid2, which is a test ROM for PPU.The test will pass by implementing window and sprite rendering, interrupt handling, and DMA transfer.
Care must be taken with the priority of sprite display.Now that rendering is possible, implementing the Joypad will make games playable.
The following is a video of running a game called Tobu Tobu Girl:At this point, the game became operational! However, it‚Äôs extremely slow.
From here on, I worked on optimization.I‚Äôll introduce what I did to optimize Ruby Boy.
These techniques are not limited to emulator implementation and are likely applicable for improving the performance of Ruby programs in general.PC: MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018)Processor: 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5Memory: 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3I measured the time it took to execute the first 1500 frames of Tobu Tobu Girl without audio and rendering, repeating the measurement three times.
Since benchmarking will be done repeatedly, I recommend preparing a dedicated program and setting up a system where you can start benchmarking immediately with a command execution.I used the Stackprof gem.It can be used simply by enclosing the area you want to measure in a block, and it‚Äôs recommended because it has low overhead.By enabling YJIT, Ruby‚Äôs JIT compiler, the FPS improved.
YJIT has become practical from Ruby 3.2, and can be enabled by adding the  option at runtime.Ruby: 3.2.2

Line 226‚Äôs block occupies a high percentage of execution time. Upon closer inspection, it creates a Hash called sprite, and then adds sprite to an array called sprites if it meets certain conditions.
By modifying this to create sprite only when the conditions are met, the speed improved.FPS: 46.73385499531633 ‚Üí 49.2233733053377In this way, I steadily continued to identify and fix bottlenecks.Calculate tile_map_addr outside the loop#FPS: 49.2233733053377 ‚Üí 56.6580741129914Calculate tile_index outside the loop#FPS: 56.6580741129914 ‚Üí 60.44140113483162These are based on the basic principle ‚Äúdo outside the loop what can be done outside the loop‚Äù, but it‚Äôs critically important for emulators. Resolving these issues dramatically improved performance.At this point, Ruby Boy achieved about 60 FPS without rendering, but hit a wall.
There‚Äôs a trade-off between optimization and code readability. For example, abandoning the use of constants and directly writing mysterious integers would make it faster, but that‚Äôs not desirable.It got incredibly fast!!!!
Ruby 3.3 was faster than I imagined. Thank you so much üôè

Also, in Pokemon Red, the performance from the title screen to the professor‚Äôs dialogue scene was still heavy, so resolving these issues became the next goal.I used HeapProfiler to detect GC occurrence locations.This can also be easily used by enclosing the area you want to detect in a block, but be careful as it may stop returning detection results when running for a long time.Execution results (partial)rubyboy % heap-profiler tmp/report

While GC has been reduced, performance is still below 60 FPS, and  (number comparison) appears to be the bottleneck.
Number comparisons occur frequently in address-based branching like the following:To eliminate these comparisons, I created an array called  in preprocessing, which contains the correspondence between addresses and processes. This allows for calling with just array reference during execution.This technique was inspired by Optcarrot, a NES emulator written in Ruby.Let‚Äôs run the benchmark and Stackprof again.rubyboy % RUBYOPT=--yjit bundle exec rubyboy bench

The FPS improved from 55.97272441676141 to 68.95255099156066, and the proportion of  was reduced from 21.8% to 0.5%.
There‚Äôs still room for further optimization, but having achieved the goal, I‚Äôm considering this complete for now.I had considered the optimization complete, but when I tried it in the browser with ruby.wasm, it turned out to be slow, so I decided to optimize further.For benchmarking, I used the same method as in Part 1: measuring the time to execute the first 1500 frames of Tobu Tobu Girl three times, without audio and rendering. Here are the current benchmark results:rubyboy % RUBYOPT=--yjit bundle exec rubyboy-bench

2: 11.610802 sec

In the current implementation, frame data is generated pixel by pixel during rendering. This causes significant overhead.
To address this, I modified the implementation to generate frame data when VRAM is updated and cache it. During rendering, it just needs to reference the cached data.I also focused on other performance bottlenecks: optimizing the render_bg method and changing the pixel format of the frame data.These optimizations achieved more than a 2x speedup!

Tips: Building only required gems#When running , all dependent gems in  are built.
To exclude unnecessary gems like rspec or rubocop from the build, specify them in RubyWasm::Packager::EXCLUDED_GEMS and execute the command directly.For Ruby Boy, only the js gem is needed, so adding all other gems to  as follows:Pack the Ruby Boy code into the previously created ruby-js.wasm.# Pack Ruby Boy code located in ./lib

Next, I‚Äôll explain the processing details of worker.js and rubyboy.wasm in the lower part.Inside the Worker, creating a VM by passing rubyboy.wasm to the DefaultRubyVM method. Ruby Boy code runs on this VM. is a Map that represents the root directory preopened by DefaultRubyVM.
Sending ROM data to the VM and receiving frame data from the VM through this Map.The Worker executes Ruby Boy‚Äôs  on the VM, reads the frame data written to /video.data, and posts it to index.js. index.js updates the canvas with the received frame data.
Repeating this process draws the game screen.The implementation of Ruby Boy‚Äôs  is below:The exec method receives current button inputs (direction keys, A, B, Start, Select), emulates the Game Boy, and writes frame data to /video.data.In Ruby Boy, frame data is managed as a Uint32 array in ABGR format like , converting this using  to a Uint8 array in RGBA format like  for canvas use.Emulator Development is Fun#As initially planned, I was able to implement while having fun. While it‚Äôs enjoyable when an emulator runs, I think a major factor is the abundance of documentation and test ROMs. Especially, since the test ROMs provide feedback on incorrect parts, I was able to progress without getting stuck and could refactor easily.
Also, I‚Äôm happy that I could run the cartridges that were lying dormant at my parents‚Äô home.Install it now with !Learned About Low-Level Technology#Through implementing programs that mimic CPU, memory, registers, RAM, etc., I was able to deepen my knowledge about their roles and operations.

The move has been criticized as an attempt to either stall or water down legal action against the database goliath over the programming language's name. Deno Land, the outfit behind the Deno JavaScript runtime, filed a petition with the USPTO back in November in an effort to make the trademarked term available to the JavaScript community. This legal effort is led by Node.js creator and Deno Land CEO Ryan Dahl, summarized on the JavaScript.tm website, and supported by more than 16,000 members of the JavaScript community. It aims to remove the fear of an Oracle lawsuit for using the term "JavaScript" in a conference title or business venture.
 
"Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community organizations," the website explains. "These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around -- for example, JSConf. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark challenge against Oracle, there can be no 'JavaScript Conference' nor a 'JavaScript Specification.' The world's most popular programming language cannot even have a conference in its name." [...] In the initial trademark complaint, Deno Land makes three arguments to invalidate Oracle's ownership of "JavaScript." The biz claims that JavaScript has become a generic term; that Oracle committed fraud in 2019 when it applied to renew its trademark; and that Oracle has abandoned its trademark because it does not offer JavaScript products or services.
 
Oracle's motion on Monday focuses on the dismissal of the fraud claim, while arguing that it expects to prevail on the other two claims, citing corporate use of the trademarked term "in connection with a variety of offerings, including its JavaScript Extension Toolkit as well as developer's guides and educational resources, and also that relevant consumers do not perceive JavaScript as a generic term." The fraud claim follows from Deno Land's assertion that the material Oracle submitted in support of its trademark renewal application has nothing to do with any Oracle product. "Oracle, through its attorney, submitted specimens showing screen captures of the Node.js website, a project created by Ryan Dahl, Petitioner's Chief Executive Officer," the trademark cancellation petition says. "Node.js is not affiliated with Oracle, and the use of screen captures of the 'nodejs.org' website as a specimen did not show any use of the mark by Oracle or on behalf of Oracle."
 
Oracle contends that in fact it submitted two specimens to the USPTO -- a screenshot from the Node.js website and another from its own Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit. And this, among other reasons, invalidates the fraud claim, Big Red's attorneys contend. "Where, as here, Registrant 'provided the USPTO with [two specimens]' at least one of which shows use of the mark in commerce, Petitioner cannot plausibly allege that the inclusion of a second, purportedly defective specimen, was material," Oracle's motion argues, adding that no evidence of fraudulent intent has been presented. Beyond asking the court to toss the fraud claim, Oracle has requested an additional thirty days to respond to the other two claims.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Sports Teams Can Learn from Tiktok Star Josh Richards | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDkTJUzRod0</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uDkTJUzRod0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 23:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with entrepreneur Josh Richards to discuss his social media empire.

Uncover new archaeological evidence rewriting our understanding of the Dark Ages in 5th- and 6th-century Britain that might also explain the legend of King Arthur. [Originally aired in 2019]

After four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island‚Äôs fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders ‚Äì or at least that‚Äôs what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery ‚Äì until now.

The defense is commonly known as MotW, short for Mark of the Web. It works by placing a ‚ÄúZone.Identifier‚Äù tag on all files downloaded from the Internet or from a networked share. This tag, a type of NTFS Alternate Data Stream and in the form of a ZoneID=3, subjects the file to additional scrutiny from Windows Defender SmartScreen and restrictions on how or when it can be executed.There‚Äôs an archive in my archiveThe 7-Zip vulnerability allowed the Russian cybercrime group to bypass those protections. Exploits worked by embedding an executable file within an archive and then embedding the archive into another archive. While the outer archive carried the MotW tag, the inner one did not. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-0411, was fixed with the release of version 24.09 in late November.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build software that lasts!

For a very long time, it was the sensible default option. Around 2016, I used the Ubuntu GNOME flavor, and after they ditched the Unity desktop environment, GNOME became the default option. 

I was really happy with it, both for work and personal computing needs. Estonian ID card software was also officially supported on Ubuntu, which made Ubuntu a good choice for family members. 

But then something changed. Ounapuu recounts how Ubuntu's bi-annual long-term support releases consistently broke functionality, from minor interface glitches to catastrophic system failures that left computers unresponsive. His breaking point came after multiple problematic upgrades affecting family members' computers, including one that rendered a laptop completely unusable during an upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04. Another incident left a relative's system with broken Firefox shortcuts and duplicate status bar icons after updating Lubuntu 18.04. 

Canonical's aggressive push of Snap packages has drawn particular criticism. The forced migration of system components from traditional Debian packages to Snaps resulted in compatibility issues, broken desktop shortcuts, and government ID card authentication failures. In one instance, he writes, a Snap-related bug in the GNOME desktop environment severely disrupted workplace productivity, requiring multiple system restarts to resolve. The author has since switched to Fedora, praising its implementation of Flatpak as a superior alternative to Snaps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tell HN: Cloudflare is blocking Pale Moon and other non-mainstream browsers</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42953508</link><author>Hold-And-Modify</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 19:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello.Cloudflare's Browser Intergrity Check/Verification/Challenge feature used by many websites, is denying access to users of non-mainstream browsers like Pale Moon.Users reports began on January 31:This situation occurs at least once a year, and there is no easy way to contact Cloudflare.

Following the collapse of Germany‚Äôs governing coalition in the fall, early parliamentary elections are now due to take place at the end of February. DW reporters Oxana Evdokimova and Carolina Machhaus  traveled around Germany, speaking to people who are worried about what the future holds, but who are also tackling and helping to solve problems. According to one survey, the cost of living and the gap between rich and poor are particularly problematic in Germany. Food prices, for example, have risen by around a third since 2020.. Munich food bank founder Hannelore Kiethe says that demand has been rising ever since its founding. Affordable housing is another issue that concerns people in Germany, especially in the big cities. Christa Lippmann has founded a housing project for single women, with success. Dietmar Kibbel is concerned that Germany does not have enough skilled workers to get the economy moving again and is involved in a program for applicants to qualify as train drivers within a year ‚Äî a highly skilled profession and one that is highly in demand across the country. It is an opportunity for Abdullah Alyaqub, who fled his home country of Syria ten years ago and hopes that his new job will give him more financial security.

responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
tool to make it faster to categorize
everything.As with all of my surveys the methodology isn‚Äôt particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.Here are the top categories of frustrations!I think it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for 95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 yearsThese comments aren‚Äôt coming from total beginners.Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I‚Äôm mostly writing this up for myself because
I‚Äôm trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.People talked about struggles remembering:the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etckeyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etcThere are just so many little ‚Äútrivia‚Äù details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I‚Äôll sometimes forget where it‚Äôs 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for  and .switching terminals is hard (91)People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)systems which don‚Äôt have their preferred text editor (‚Äúno vim‚Äù or ‚Äúonly vim‚Äù)different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)a shell they aren‚Äôt used to (‚Äúthe subtle differences between zsh and bash‚Äù)as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.Lots of problems with color, like:programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background colorfinding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etcnot wanting color at all and struggling to turn it offThis comment felt relatable to me:Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I‚Äôm locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:using  in a browser-based terminal and closing the windowthe terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
, no , no , lots of  shortcuts aren‚Äôt
possible like )the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses  for something else)issues using emacs in the terminalbackspace not working (2)other copy and paste issues (75)Aside from ‚Äúthe keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different‚Äù, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different waysdealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
‚Äúmiddle click‚Äù clipboard on Linux, tmux‚Äôs clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing themrandom spaces added when copying from the terminalpasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying waywanting a way to copy text without using the mouseThere were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I‚Äôve been told by random people over the years.steep learning curve (44)A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:After 15 years of using it, I‚Äôm not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don‚Äôt spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.Some issues with shell history:history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)limits that are too short (4)history not being restored when terminal tabs are restoredlosing history because the terminal crashednot knowing how to search historyIt wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
‚Äúhistory‚Äù on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type ‚Äúhistory 0‚Äù to get
any useful length of history.documentation being generally opaquelack of examples in man pagesprograms which don‚Äôt have man pagesHere‚Äôs a representative comment:Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflowA few issues with scrollback:programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback historyresizing the terminal messes up the scrollbackGUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs‚Äô outputsWhen resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There‚Äôs a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It‚Äôs just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don‚Äôt even bother.Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or ‚Äìhelp?(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems(23) performance (e.g. ‚Äúmy shell takes too long to start‚Äù)(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (‚ÄúThe debilitating fear that I‚Äôm going

couple of categories that feel related to me:remembering syntax & history (often the thing you need to remember is something you‚Äôve run before!)discoverability & the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)‚Äúswitching systems is hard‚Äù & ‚Äúit feels outdated‚Äù (tools that haven‚Äôt really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
 no matter what system you‚Äôre on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers‚Äô skills.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eggs US ‚Äì Price ‚Äì Chart</title><link>https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/eggs-us</link><author>throwaway5752</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 16:31:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The South Korean Daewoo K2 rifle with firearms expert Jonathan Ferguson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoUYo2ihDmM</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eoUYo2ihDmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 16:08:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As seen in Squid Game, this week Jonathan delves into the South Korean service rifle - the Daewoo K2.

To me personally, it feels unavoidable: I can‚Äôt look down at my phone or glance up at a TV without seeing  that makes me upset. And that‚Äôs really exhausting. But when outrage is everywhere, what can we do to keep it from getting to us?On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Here to talk to us about fighting so-called outrage fatigue is Tanya Lewis, a senior editor covering health and medicine at .Tanya, thanks for joining us today. Thanks so much for having me. So you recently wrote about this phenomenon called ‚Äúoutrage fatigue.‚Äù Could you tell us what that is? Sure, so outrage fatigue is kind of an informal concept, which basically refers to repeatedly experiencing perceived moral transgressions and feeling fatigued by them. So what that basically means is just, you know, you see something, you‚Äôre outraged by it, and over time you just become kind of numb to it. Sounds relevant to [laughs], to many of our lives. What do researchers know about outrage in general? So outrage fatigue itself hasn‚Äôt been that well-studied, but outrage in general has been studied, and people have found that, actually, outrage can be useful. It actually can help you identify a problem and react to it. But it can also be harmful if you‚Äôre experiencing it all the time and become overwhelmed by it.There‚Äôs actually a recent study by William Brady, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management. He and his colleagues found that outrage actually helps misinformation spread more widely, especially online on social media. So the upshot of this is that when you have too much outrage, people can actually withdraw from public spaces or virtual places like social media. Yeah, and what is it about outrage that helps misinformation spread? So I think part of it is the fact that it‚Äôs more engaging. It, you know, activates your emotions, and so people are more primed to respond to that. As we all know, if you‚Äôve ever spent time on social media and social networks, we always see the most kind of inflammatory content because that‚Äôs what gets retweets or clicks and the algorithms are amplifying that. Right, and more broadly, you know, what is it about the times we‚Äôre living in that makes outrage so hard to avoid? So we‚Äôre living in a particularly polarized time, which I think is not a surprise to anybody. If you have been online lately, on Twitter or Facebook or TikTok or any other social media, you‚Äôve probably seen people yelling about something or other. And this just really has been accelerating, I guess, in the last few years because of our political polarization and other world events.As I was saying earlier some amount of outrage is actually normal and healthy, but studies have shown that the majority of outrage posts on social media are actually driven by a small minority of users who are very‚Äîyou know, they feel very strongly about something, and that can actually turn other people off of participating in the conversation. Yeah, so social media is a big part of this, you know, both amplifying it and giving a platform for people who are feeling this outrage. Other than just making us feel bad, what does outrage fatigue do to a person? So the real danger is that we become apathetic, and if we‚Äôre exposed to something all the time‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through social media or even traditional news sources like cable TV‚Äîif it‚Äôs constantly telling us to be outraged, eventually we‚Äôre gonna be less responsive and we‚Äôre gonna kind of pull back. So instead of, like, channeling that outrage into something useful, many people sort of feel exhausted and burned out, and they just don‚Äôt want to take action at all.And this is actually a problem because politicians can take advantage of that and sort of manipulate people. As we‚Äôve seen over the last few decades some of the big social issues like abortion, gay rights, critical race theory, these have all been used as kind of wedge issues to convince people to vote in ways that might be against their own self-interest because they‚Äôre just so outraged about this one particular issue. Yeah, so definitely worth avoiding. What can we do to accomplish that? Right. That was my question, too. You know, a couple of things: one is that we can just sort of limit how much media we consume. As somebody who is a member of the media, you know, this might sound strange, but I think if you‚Äôre feeling constantly overwhelmed and outraged by something, if you consume less of it, that‚Äôs probably a good thing.But it doesn‚Äôt mean you should totally sort of ignore what‚Äôs happening. When I talked to William Brady, he said that, you know, one of the ways you can kind of have an impact without just being overwhelmed is to get involved in local politics or local issues, you know, in your community because you can actually have a much greater impact on a local level, usually, than a national level anyway. So rather than just, like, retweeting that most outrageous post that you see, you know, it‚Äôs better to get involved with real people and kind of have a dialogue with them. Yeah, find some mutual aid groups ... Find stuff you can actually do when you‚Äôre not doomscrolling and hopefully [laughs] ... Do less of the doomscrolling, too. And did he have any advice for sort of recovering from outrage burnout once it‚Äôs hit you? Gosh, that is a good question. You know, it‚Äôs not something I specifically asked Dr. Brady about, but I think, just from my own experience, like I said, you know, pulling back a little bit from some of the media consumption and, you know, just maybe limiting yourself to checking the news a couple times a day instead of, like, every hour or, you know, getting those alerts on your phone all the time. If someone is posting stuff that makes you furious all the time, maybe don‚Äôt follow them [laughs]. And, yeah, get outside, get in nature‚Äîyou know, the usual things that can kind of reset your brain and make you feel, you know, more calm. Yeah, maybe easier said than done, but really good advice. Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us, Tanya. Thanks so much. It‚Äôs always great being on here. That‚Äôs all for today‚Äôs episode.

Discovery putting old movies on YouTube?</title><link>https://tedium.co/2025/02/05/warner-bros-youtube-full-movie-releases/</link><author>shortformblog</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 14:47:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent years, we‚Äôve complained a lot about Warner Bros. Discovery, in part because their decision-making has seemed almost toxic and damaging to the creative community. A movie studio that literally makes movies and doesn‚Äôt release them? That seems like a bizarre state of affairs, and under David Zaslav, they‚Äôve done it multiple times.But the studio has recently done something that I‚Äôm really just kind of in awe about. Over the last month, across five different YouTube channels, the studio has released more than 30 full movies. On YouTube. For free. Without any sort of gating.Much of the collection is here, but it doesn‚Äôt appear to even be a complete accounting of what the studio has released on the service. They keep adding movies, too. In the three or four days since I first spotted it, they‚Äôve added at least two or three additional films.And to be clear, this is not the YouTube Movies service, which is fully licensed and mainly represents a pretty good add-on perk of YouTube Premium subscriptions. Instead, WBD (without notice or promotion) is dropping full-on films that it spent millions of dollars making on its own channels, in a way that makes it feels like it‚Äôs saying that the films are commercially spent.It is embracing a service where a popular type of video is basically watching someone else‚Äôs video and commenting on top of it. In some cases, it is likely that those reaction videos will get more views than these movies.In terms of the quality, most of the films are kind of in the realm where nostalgia hasn‚Äôt caught up with them. Some of them are quite good‚Äîmost notably , , and . And some have sheer cult appeal‚Äîthe 1986 Talking Heads film  feels like a surprising choice to show up here, given that David Byrne is still firmly in the mainstream nearly 40 years after the film‚Äôs release.But there are a lot of stinkers and obscurities. One such film on the list: , an environmental documentary that was created by Leonardo DiCaprio in 2007 but was ultimately overshadowed by the similar , released a year prior. The 2008 film , starring Ryan Reynolds, shows the film star at the nadir of his commercial power. And then there‚Äôs the infamous 2000 New Line Cinema release , which was basically forgotten by all but the die-hards before it showed up on this list.(It is probably a matter of minutes until , another infamous flop distributed by New Line during the same period, appears in this playlist.)At least one film on the list was a bonafide hit upon its initial release‚Äî1977‚Äôs George Burns comedy , which had a $51 million box office run, equivalent to nearly $265 million in 2024 money. But most of the films on this list are more like The Adventures Of Pluto Nash, an infamous 2002 Eddie Murphy dud that came during a period in which Murphy was largely working on poorly reviewed family fare. (If not for , that entire period would have been a critical bust for Murphy. However, only the adult-oriented  lost money.)But what stands out more than anything else is that Warner Bros. released them this way, rather than in a format that limits access‚Äîsomething that Warner could easily do, thanks to the fact that it owns the streaming service Max, as well as Turner Classic Movies, a television channel that allows cable customers to stream. (The aforementioned  appears on TCM‚Äôs website.)So, what‚Äôs going on here? If I was going to speculate, my guess is that Warner has kind of put itself in this awkward place where it has failed to give a home to some of its less-heralded content on streaming services. And in some cases, it kind of feels like a shame. Example: , a 2006 Michel Gondry film that received good reviews and made a small profit at the box office, but simply didn‚Äôt reach the critical heights of Gondry‚Äôs prior release, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It‚Äôs not that this is a bad film‚Äîit seems to be, more than anything else, that it is kind of a forgotten one, poorly presented by the studio that paid millions of dollars to make and distribute it.And honestly, in a lot of ways, that shows why this decision seems so bewildering. By releasing a handful of hidden gems next to some of the worst films it ever released, WBD is doing a disservice to its creative teams of past and present. It is essentially telling its catalog artists that it may simply drop an old film on a service that most people don‚Äôt even think of as a streamer.Warner Bros. is not lacking for proper channels to release this content in full. So why post on YouTube in an DRM-free, sometimes region-free way? (For sake of confirming the films didn‚Äôt have DRM, I opened up yt-dlp frontend Parabolic and had it download two films currently on YouTube: , which is on YouTube Movies, and , which isn‚Äôt. The former was blocked from working; the latter downloaded and played easily in VLC.) The message seems to be, ‚Äúnobody wants this stuff,‚Äù which is a weird thing for an entertainment conglomerate to say about its own archives. Even if these films make money through ad revenue, it likely won‚Äôt add up to much in residuals compared to a distribution deal.(Some movies may be region-free, by the way, but I‚Äôm hearing in the case of at least one, , that there is some region-locking on it in Ireland, a country where the subject matter is most-relevant.)After all, if you can just watch these films for free here, why would you buy these from Amazon or somewhere else? Well, presumably you could get the films in better quality on Blu-ray. And they might come with commentary tracks, in case you want to hear about the decisions that led to  being made. But there likely aren‚Äôt a lot of die-hard fans of most of these movies; they probably don‚Äôt need more than the videos themselves.(And it turns out that as major studios go, WBD isn‚Äôt alone. As spotted by film podcaster Matthew Buck of Film Brain after we published, Sony is also doing similar things on their clips channels, though the selection is somewhat less loaded with poorly reviewed junk, and instead leans more on obscurity.)For years, the line we heard from movie studios was that these movies needed to be protected with strict digital rights management to prevent them from appearing in the wrong hands. This works against that.But at the same time, it‚Äôs perhaps the way things are going. As I noted in my recent piece on Ernie Kovacs, YouTube is increasingly seen as the best option for releasing content made before the 1980s, as Netflix and other services seem to be favoring more recent works. Perhaps this signifies that it‚Äôs an issue for even the big studios.All that said: I‚Äôm not exactly sure what message WBD is sending here by offloading these seemingly random movies in such a bewildering way. But maybe it‚Äôs a sign that, once the long tail starts thinning out, the streaming revolution isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs cracked up to be.It might have been easy to miss amid all the chaos of the week, but there‚Äôs a NSFW porn app on the iOS App Store in Europe, thanks to the European Union‚Äôs alternative app store rules. Apple‚Äôs very much not happy about it, but they don‚Äôt have a say. For those hoping for a sequel to , we may not be getting it.We lost a great one this week. Don Hui, a YouTuber whose channel Novaspirit Tech highlighted a broad passion for homelabbing and the less-talked-about corners of tech, passed away after a yearlong battle with cancer. Jeff Geerling, a friend of Tedium, announced the news on his channel with a tribute. Loved his stuff, he probably got me passionate about Docker. Above is one of my favorite videos of his‚Äîa clip of him installing Windows 11 on a OnePlus 6.Find this one an interesting read?Share it with a pal!

In recent decades, Gassed was interpreted as a very yellow painting. But it didn‚Äôt always look like that. 

The yellow effect comes from a discoloured varnish from the 1970s, concealing Sargent‚Äôs intentions and skewing our interpretation of his work. Now, thanks to meticulous conservation efforts as part of IWM‚Äôs new Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries, Gassed and its meaning have been reborn.
 
Today we‚Äôre going to examine the history of Gassed, what it means, why it‚Äôs important, and how that has changed over 100 years on display.

it describes, but because it shows how close we are to some very large breakthroughs in AI. The model
is just below state of the art, but it can run on my laptop. More important, it sheds light on how all
this stuff works, and it‚Äôs .OpenAI were the first to claim the inference-time scaling laws. Basically, an LLM can get higher performance
if it can ‚Äúthink‚Äù longer before answering. But, like,  How do you make it think longer?OpenAI and R1 had cool graphs showing performance scaling with average thinking time (this from
the s1 paper):But  do they control the length of an LLM response? Everyone skipped over that part, but s1
shows us details, .Context: When an LLM ‚Äúthinks‚Äù at inference time, it puts it‚Äôs thoughts inside  and 
 XML tags. Once it gets past the end tag the model is taught to change voice into a confident
and authoritative tone for the final answer.In s1, when the LLM tries to stop thinking with , they force it to keep going
by replacing it with . It‚Äôll then begin to second guess and double check it‚Äôs answer. They
do this to trim or extend thinking time (trimming is just abruptly inserting ).So for  versus , that‚Äôs likely how they do it. They probably trained 3
models, and with each with a different average thinking time (as measured during training). Eventually the 
training process begins to encode that behavior into the model weights.The trick is so dumb you can do it at inference time too. I‚Äôm kicking myself for not understanding
this earlier, because it‚Äôs what entropix is all about, and I wrote a lot about entropix.In entropix, they look at the entropy & varentropy of the logits (and attention) to change how the
tokens are selected. In fact, they used tokens like ‚ÄúWait‚Äù to force the LLM to second guess itself.
Although there was more to it, they also tweaked sampler setting to make
it more creative, or to go into aggressive exploration mode, all depending on the internal state
of the model.My hunch is that we‚Äôll  of entropix, or something directly inspired from it. Although, it‚Äôs
unclear if it‚Äôll appear predominately in training or inference time.Someone on LinkedIn showed me a piece about token forcing. They convince R1
to share everything it knows about Tiananmen Square by prefixing the bot message with . 
R1 then takes the suggestion and tells what it knows. They suggest that this could be a good 
introspection technique for understanding the models better.(R1 is a Chinese model and has been fine tuned to avoid talking about events like Tiananmen Square)Why did it cost only $6? Because they used a  and hardly any data.After sifting their dataset of 56K examples down to just the best 1K, they found that the core 1K 
is all that‚Äôs needed to achieve o1-preview performance on a 32B model. Adding data didn‚Äôt raise 
performance .32B is a small model, I can run that on my laptop. They used 16 NVIDIA H100s for 26 minutes per 
training run, that equates to around $6.The low cost means you can do a lot of runs, and they did. As we‚Äôll see, they heavily used a 
technique called ablation, re-running the entire training process with  in 
configuration to prove what works and what doesn‚Äôt.For example, how did they figure out it should be ‚ÄúWait‚Äù and not ‚ÄúHmm‚Äù? They also measured properties of the training dataset, which examples provided the most signal:They did a ton of these ablation experiments. This is how you .We like to think that
OpenAI or DeepSeek are simply packed full of brilliant people and they make a wild guess, spend
$10,000,000.00 on a training run and BAM! an innovation is created. But no, even the smartest
people make hundreds of .Innovations like s1 that dramatically lower costs mean that researchers can learn and understand
these models faster. And that directly translates to a  of AI development.Again, AI is inseparable from politics, sorry.There‚Äôs debate about OpenAI & Anthropic‚Äôs vast funding. It‚Äôs tempting to see cost reducing 
innovations like s1 or DeepSeek V3 and assume that OpenAI & Anthropic‚Äôs vast datacenters are
a waste of money. I‚Äôd argue that no, having 10,000 H100s just means that you can do 625 times
 than s1 did.If you believe that AI development is a prime national security advantage, then you absolutely
should want even more money poured into AI development, to make it go .Note that this s1 dataset is . Every example is a thought trace generated by 
another model, Qwen2.5,
prompted to think before answering. OpenAI has been accusing DeepSeek of creating their
V3 model by distilling from o1, which is against their terms of service. There‚Äôs still no strong public
evidence in either direction, so accusations are mostly empty, but s1 gives a lot of credence.Going forward, it‚Äôll be nearly impossible to prevent distealing (unauthorized distilling). One thousand
examples is definitely within the range of what a single person might do in normal usage, no less 
ten or a hundred people. I doubt that OpenAI has a realistic path to  or even 
distealing outside of simply not releasing models.Note that OpenAI released their o3 model as
deep research, an agent instead of direct access to the model API. This might be a trend now,
‚Äúagents‚Äù serving as a way to avoid releasing direct access to a model.S1 is important because it illustrates the current pace of AI development that‚Äôs happening in
the open. When you consider how much compute is available to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic,
the potential true pace of AI development is .S1 isn‚Äôt a replication of R1 or o1. Those were demonstrations in pure reinforcement learning (RL).
S1 shows that supervised fine tuning (SFT) shows just as much potential. That means researchers have
multiple paths to investigate for pushing forward inference-time scaling.I think it‚Äôs safe to say that we‚Äôre going to see some very big things in ‚Äò25. It‚Äôs barely February‚Ä¶]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Caves of Qud with Brian Bucklew</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/05/caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED9626101996.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 10:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Caves of Qud is a roguelike game set in a richly detailed, post-apocalyptic world blending science fiction and fantasy.

So why the abandon-all-hope designation? Because they‚Äôre places where some people get stuck having to spend the night after the last train, but nobody really wants to.To qualify as a station of despair, a station has to be the last stop on its line, in a remote area, but also on a line that has a major population center and entertainment district somewhere. Basically, if there‚Äôs a neighborhood where people are getting drunk, then trying to take the train line home but falling asleep and missing their stop, only to wake up at the end of the line in the middle of nowhere with no way to get home until the next morning, then that‚Äôs a station of despair.For the Tokyo area, one of the more infamous stations of despair is , in . Otsuki is the last stop of the Chuo Line (Rapid), which starts in the east at Tokyo Station and runs through downtown drinking and dining districts such as Shinjuku, Ochanomizu, and Kichijoji before heading out into the suburbs west of downtown, and then into the rural environs of Yamanashi.‚ñº From Tokyo Station to Otsuki Station takes a little less than two hours.With Christmas parties and New Year‚Äôs celebrations coming up, our Japanese-language reporter  figures there‚Äôs a pretty good chance he might accidentally end up in Otsuki one of these nights, so to prepare for that eventuality he decided to go to Otsuki Station on purpose to see what the area is like late at night, arriving at about 9:40 p.m.‚ñº While he didn‚Äôt get drunk before getting on the train, he did try to catch some Zs along the way, for a more realistic simulation.Arriving at Otsuki, Ahiruneko stepped off the train and onto the platform, and his immediate thought was ‚ÄúOh geeeeezzzz is it cold!‚ÄùOtsuki is closer to Mt. Fuji than it is to downtown Tokyo, and the increased elevation means much lower temperatures in winter, particularly after sundown. So while dressing warm is always a good idea when going out at this time of year, it‚Äôs especially important if you think you might end up at this station of despair.‚ñº As another sign that you‚Äôre far from the big city, Otsuki Station has a woody, log cabin-type aesthetic going on.Immediately wanting to get out of the cold, Ahiruneko has happy to spot a cozy-looking waiting room inside the station.Inside are tables, benches, local tourism information, and a row of gacha capsule toy machines.However, the waiting room is only open until midnight, so holing up there until the trains start running again in the morning isn‚Äôt an option if you‚Äôve missed the last train home for the night. So it was time for Ahiruneko to hit the streets of late-night Otsuki, where he found‚Ä¶‚Ä¶not a whole lot that was open.Sure, Otsuki might be on the same train line as the bars and clubs of Shinjuku, where the party goes all-night long each and every night. In Otsuki, though, there‚Äôs a much stronger early-to-bed, early-to-rise sort of vibe.Yeah, there are  (pubs), but they tend to close earlier than they do in the big cities. The branch of chain  (Â∫ÑÂ±ã) near the station is never open past 11:30 p.m., and on some nights closes as early as 10, and the station area‚Äôs  (È≠öÊ∞ë) closes at midnight, so neither one will work if you‚Äôre looking for a place to nurse a drink until the morning trains.Since izakaya were out, Ahiruneko started looking for a 24-hour convenience store with an eat-in corner where he could kill time. Once again, though, convenience stores are fewer and farther between in Otsuki than the big city. Now freezing from the cold, Ahiruneko felt his spirits pick up when he spotted the familiar red-and-yellow signage of a Daily Yamazaki convenience store‚Ä¶‚Ä¶only to have his heart broken when he found out that the space is actually occupied by a branch of mini gym Chocozap.‚ñº The corner location and large windows really do make it look like this place was originally a convenience store, though.Luckily, Ahiruneko was able to stumble across an actual convenience store when he found a  branch.‚ñº Here‚Äôs a map of the route to Lawson from Otsuki Station, so that you don‚Äôt have to rely on luck when you‚Äôre already unlucky enough to have ended up at a station of despair.As further proof of how quiet Otsuki is at night, the Lawson‚Äôs parking lot was full of cars driven by people who needed to take a break from driving but had no other place to do it.This Lawson does have an eat-in-counter, but with only three seats, you‚Äôre going to need to keep your fingers crossed if you‚Äôre hoping for a spot to camp out at until morning.There is another convenience store close to the station, a, but unfortunately without any sort of eat-in space. It is a pretty big store, though, so you can at least warm yourself up while browsing the aisles for a bit, and stock up on supplies for when you have to head back out into the night.‚ñº Walking route from Otsuki Station to 7-ElevenProbably the best option, without springing for a full-on hotel, that Ahiruneko came across was a branch of .Big Echo is a  parlor chain. Some of its more rural branches, instead of being tucked away inside a mixed-use commercial building, are instead little private karaoke shacks on the side of the road, and the ones in Otsuki are open all night, so you can rent one and just crash on its sofa without singing anything.‚ñº Otsuki Station to Big EchoFinally, if you‚Äôre resigned to just getting a hotel room in Otsuki while you wait for the train, there actually is a very large branch of about a 10-minute walk from Otsuki Station, on the opposite side of the tracks from the places we‚Äôve shown so far in this article.Opened in 2022, the Otsuki Toyoko Inn is , considering that the town itself only has about 20,000 people and isn‚Äôt a top-tier tourism destination. Rumor has it that Toyoko Inn built this branch at least in part to capitalize on potential business generated by the nearby station of despair.We don‚Äôt have access to Toyoko Inn‚Äôs booking records, but if that rumor is true, it would imply that there‚Äôs high demand for its rooms during celebratory seasons like winter holidays, though, so it might be hard to find a vacancy at this time of year, and the prices might be inflated too.In a magnanimous show of mercy, our boss didn‚Äôt actually make Ahiruneko spend the night on the streets of Otsuki, and his simulation/exploration was timed so that he‚Äôd still be able to catch a train home, though it wasn‚Äôt until he was back in his kitchen and scarfing down a bowl of piping hot noodles that he finally got the severe chill of the Otsuki night air out of his system.All of which is to say that the best plan is to check your return train schedule before you hit the bars, drink within your limits, and avoid getting stuck at a station of despair this holiday season. If you do, though, hopefully the options Ahiruneko found will help get you through the night.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fair Pricing</title><link>https://kagi.com/changelog#6155</link><author>CleverLikeAnOx</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 05:50:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We know it's been a few weeks since our last update, and there's a good reason for that.

Moranda Reilly always wanted to work in aviation. She read books on aviation heroes, watched air disasters, she listened to live air traffic control in her car. Around her neck, she wore an airplane necklace, a gift from a friend that she‚Äôd mended repeatedly. In her 20s, she elected to take the plunge and do whatever it took to make it happen. She quit her full-time job, took out student loans, and moved to attend a university that offered a two-year degree as part of the FAA‚Äôs collegiate training initiative (CTI) for air traffic controllers. The FAA had established its CTI program in 1989, working together alongside a select group of universities and community colleges to build a better-prepared, college-educated workforce. By the early 2010s, when Moranda and other aspiring air traffic controllers entered the program, CTI was the primary way by which people would enter the field, with the FAA accepting virtually no off-the-street hires. On its website, the FAA instructed aspiring air traffic controllers that if they got CTI degrees, passed the profession‚Äôs aptitude test (the AT-SAT), and met other eligibility requirements, it would place them into a priority hiring queue, giving them first opportunity every time employment slots opened up. Students understood that the FAA hired virtually everyone who completed the program and passed the assessment.As the CTI program ramped up with increasing success in the mid-2000s, Florida State College of Jacksonville applied to join, and in 2008, Sam Fischer launched their program. By 2013, he had settled into a comfortable rhythm, training wave after wave of successful students.Andrew Brigida, a 2013 graduate from Arizona State‚Äôs CTI program, had just aced the AT-SAT, getting perfect marks while meeting all other job requirements. He was fully qualified, poised to become an air traffic controller.First, every past aptitude test applicants had taken was voided. Andrew Brigida‚Äôs perfect score was meaningless.Second, every applicant would be required to take and pass an unspecified ‚Äúbiographical questionnaire‚Äù to have a shot at entering the profession.Third, existing CTI students were left with no advantage in the hiring process, which would be equally open to all off-the-street applicants‚Äîtheir degrees rendered useless for the one specialized job they had trained for.The rules had changed, and students and program managers alike were left scrambling to figure out what was going on.Days after the announcement, Reilly launched a Facebook group for CTI students and instructors to grapple with what was happening. ‚ÄúThis page doesn‚Äôt support the ‚Äòangry mob‚Äô mentality or anything but positive ‚ÄòWe believe in CTI schools‚Äô vibes,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWe believe that all of the simulator hours spent, materials studied, and education taught in C.T.I. schools has value and is of worth.‚ÄùMore than a hundred people joined in the first day. Brigida and Fischer jumped on quickly, helping Reilly to organize the group and walking the anxious crowd through everything they were learning. Fischer provided status updates, Reilly jumped in with rallying cries and organization (‚ÄúSave CTI! Save CTI! Save CTI!‚Äù), and Brigida gave the group a public face. The next hiring wave would be in February 2014, and the CTI graduates and students waited anxiously, grasping at every bit of information they could find to understand what was going on. As the hiring wave approached, some of Reilly‚Äôs friends in the program encouraged her to join the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees (NBCFAE), telling her it would help improve her chances of being hired. She signed up as the February wave started. Soon, though, she became uneasy with what the organization was doing, particularly after she and the rest of the group got a voice message from FAA employee Shelton Snow:hereReilly, Brigida, and thousands of others found themselves faced with the questionnaire, clicking through a bizarre sequence of questions that would determine whether they could enter the profession they‚Äôd been working towards. Faced with the opportunity to cheat, Reilly did not. It cost her a shot at becoming an air traffic controller. Like 85% of their fellow CTI students, Brigida and Reilly found themselves faced with a red exclamation point and a dismissal notice: ‚ÄúBased upon your responses to the Biographical Assessment, we have determined that you are NOT eligible for this position.‚ÄùTheir plans had been upended. No chance for appeal. No way around it short of waiting another year and trying again. Despite their qualifications and their passion, they would not be air traffic controllers.‚ÄúYou Have Been Intentionally Discriminated Against.‚ÄùSo what happened? Why did the FAA upend a stable hiring process, undercut the CTI schools it had established to train its workforce, and throw the plans of thousands of eager would-be air traffic controllers into disarray? I give a bare-bones accounting of the background in another article, but there are a few more details worth adding in this one.The CTI program was popular and successful before the barrier analysis. After 2013, though, the FAA began to treat its CTI schools as a liability. After the biographical questionnaire, per conversations with CTI administrators, the FAA simply tried to pretend the CTI schools did not exist. The FAA cut off communication, treating them tersely and with disdain. The schools were not bastions of privilege. The programs were often at community colleges and junior colleges, with diverse student bodies and professors who worked long hours helping them. They were successful and effective at what they did, and had provided a steady stream of applicants who saw a clear path into the profession. Suddenly, though, they were left scrambling to justify their existence. Fischer talks about how he used to get lots of calls from students asking how to become an air traffic controller, but after 2013, that mostly stopped. He emphasizes that the FAA was never there to give him a job, and if they wanted to change, that was their prerogative. A lot of the problem, and a lot of the sore feelings between the FAA and the CTI schools, came because of the abruptness of the change, the lack of communication, the sudden cutting off.Fischer, alongside other program directors like Joe Eichelberger, began to organize the CTI schools and take meticulous notes. What were success rates like before the scandal? What about after? What had happened, and why? How could they continue to justify their programs to students who could no longer trust that there would be jobs waiting at the other end? gave a few remarksIt‚Äôs an incredible safety concern‚Ä¶ what we‚Äôre dealing with here is a shortage of air traffic controllers. We had a process by which to provide candidates, who were very well-qualified, who were spending a lot of money on their own‚Ä¶ and the FAA has apparently decided to arbitrarily abandon that process. And now when you add onto it the cheating scandal, which clearly is a huge problem, and an FAA official who is trying to pretend it‚Äôs not part of what they have to worry about‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs ludicrous.a lettermore specificallyAll of this is included in the investigation report.Why do we have access to the questionnaire, the investigation report, and other critical documents necessary to pull together this story? Ask Jorge Rojas. Jorge Rojas always wanted to be an air traffic controller. He went to CTI school right after high school and saw all of the 2014 chaos from a distance. In 2015, when he became eligible to take the questionnaire, he did so. Failed. Took it again in 2016. Failed. It was only after Congress explicitly passed a law rejecting the FAA‚Äôs use of the biographical questionnaire that he had an opportunity to enter the role. He worked for the FAA for five years before returning to become a government contractor. But he was frustrated‚Äîfrustrated on his behalf, frustrated on the behalf of others who had had their lives thrown into turmoil. So he began filing FOIA requests.Rojas filed hundreds of requests over the course of multiple years. The FAA delayed some, rejected others, and per Rojas, took the stance that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not going to sue us for all of them.‚Äù Sometimes, he even went back to FOIA his FOIAs, to see what was taking so long and how they were responding. Five separate times, he took the FAA to court over refusals and delays.After long delays and repeated sanctions, the FAA finally produced some of the key documents. He got the questionnaire, the answer key. He got the investigation into Shelton Snow. As of last year when I spoke with him, the FAA was still gradually, periodically, releasing documents to him, responding to FOIAs from back in 2016. Along the whole way, Michael Pearson, soon aided by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, worked diligently on the case. Mountain States Legal Foundation is a small non-profit firm; the case is an ambitious one. They have spent years gathering evidence, arguing in court, pushing for class certification, and preparing to bring the case to trial. The case is scheduled to go to trial next year. a memorandumCaleb Benner, who graduated in 2012 from Purdue University‚Äôs Aviation Management program, one of the FAA‚Äôs designated CTI programs, spent his entire childhood dreaming of becoming an air traffic controller. When other kids responded ‚Äúfirefighter‚Äù or ‚Äúpolice officer‚Äù when asked ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do when you grow up?‚Äù, he always said ‚Äúair traffic controller.‚Äù He took the AT-SAT after graduation and got a score in the high 90s, only for hiring to be hit by sequestration before he could apply. When they came out of sequestration and he was preparing to apply properly, he learned about the Biographical Assessment after the New Year‚Äôs Eve announcement. He took it. He failed.After failing the assessment, he spent multiple years working a job paying $10 an hour, one he specifically chose so it would be easy to uproot and go to the Academy to train when he got the call. The call never came. Eventually, he gave up, paid to get his aircraft dispatcher‚Äôs license, and moved on. Benner hates that this accident brought the scandal to the forefront after a decade in the courts, and is not fond of how Trump has handled it. But, as he puts it, ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt change how blatantly wrong it was what the FAA did. And I spent what seems like every day of my career dealing with the consequences of those decisions.‚ÄùOthers tell similar stories. Another CTI grad tells me he became a police dispatcher (‚Äúto sate my need to talk into a headset for 8 hours a day‚Äù) and worked on getting a private rotorcraft license afterward‚Äîexplained that he didn‚Äôt feel bitter, exactly, but he felt wronged. Robbed. Reilly has remained a passionate advocate for the issue over the years. She reached out to me almost immediately after I published my original article, providing an extensive look at the years of conversations, advocacy, and work the scandal has taken. She has moved on to work in air traffic management. She remains a passionate advocate for women in aviation and spends time volunteering on youth outreach programs. Last year, she organized an event at the Reagan airport in DC, busing in 150 girls from a Title 1 school. Many, she said, had never seen an airplane up close before. In a moment of dark irony, the sort of diversity-focused work she‚Äôs passionate about‚Äînot lowering the bar, but inspiring more people and providing them with mentorship and opportunity to reach it‚Äîis threatened by Trump‚Äôs memorandum. Has this had a long-term impact on aviation safety and air traffic controller shortages? Likely yes. An active air traffic controller reached out to me at the end of January last year, talking about his frustration that so many qualified individuals were eliminated from entering training, contributing to a dire staffing shortage. His facility was operating at less than 75%, with controllers fatigued from working 6-day weeks. As he explained it, training can take 1.5 to 2.5 years at larger facilities, with washout rates from 30-60%, and when we spoke upper level facilities were only accepting transfers from lower level facilities, adding years to preparation time. Every issue compounds and adds to the problem over time, and the FAA‚Äôs 2013 changes set staffing back years. The FAA, he said, simply is not bringing in enough people to match the number leaving, with some air traffic controllers believing the agency is failing on purpose to find an excuse to privatize them. A controller who worked for 25 years and retired in 2015 spoke with me last January as well. He had been offered a position at Oklahoma City to instruct new students. Per him, the ideal candidate can go from street to fully certified in about 4 years, while some trainees during his last few years had been training for 6-8 years. He alleged a pattern where some students were trained for years longer than others, rarely washed out, and were quietly checked out and promoted away from direct air traffic control positions into management.Another retired controller and supervisor who formerly worked at the Chicago ARTCC echoed his story, claiming the FAA would regularly change the ‚Äúbest qualified list,‚Äù with those responsible for promotions changing requirements depending on who they wanted to promote. He was never told to certify an inadequate trainee, he said, but ‚Äúthe pressure was mounting.‚ÄùApplicant quality matters in several ways. Weaker applicants are more likely to drop out in training, to take longer going through the pipeline and in on-the-job training (where experienced controllers have to work directly with them, taking other bodies off the job), and to wind up working in less busy airfields. This matters particularly because there are fixed numbers each year and the pipeline takes several years to get through, so real problems take a few years to filter through the pipeline and be felt. The 2014 change materially shifted applicant quality on net. While it is technically and tautologically true that everyone who makes it through training is qualified, the ‚Äúqualified‚Äù bar on the AT-SAT eliminated very few candidates, with quality maintained mostly by the ‚Äúwell qualified‚Äù bar. Higher scores were genuinely predictive of better performance, and 2014 shifted applicant population. Not only that, it shattered the pipeline the FAA had built with CTI schools, making the process towards becoming an air traffic controller less certain, undercutting many of the most passionate people working to train prospective controllers, and leading to a tense and unclear relationship between the FAA and feeder organizations. Did anyone truly unqualified make it all the way through the pipeline? There's no reason to think so. Did average candidate quality decrease? There's every reason to think so. Would that lead to staffing issues? Unambiguously yes.New York TimesAs I write this story, we are in a moment of intense partisan divide, with everyone mad and very few terribly inclined to give grace or look for nuance. In part because of that, I don‚Äôt think this story can be treated as complete without making the undercurrent of its interaction with political partisanship clear and speaking directly to those sympathetic to one side or the other.I dislike Trump as much as anyone. Maybe I‚Äôm not supposed to play my hand like that while reporting a news article, but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve wanted him out of politics since he entered the scene a decade ago, I voted against him three elections in a row, and I think he‚Äôs had a uniquely destructive effect within US politics. So I understand‚Äîplease believe, I understand‚Äîjust how disquieting it is to watch him stand up and blame DEI after a major tragedy. a thoroughly reported article on air traffic controller shortagesThe class members have mixed sentiments as things stand. Some are thrilled that what they see as the scourge of destructive DEI initiatives is finally being addressed. Others are liberals who are frustrated and hurt that something they worked so hard to keep nonpartisan, a real scandal that hurt them, can now be little but a partisan wedge, and they‚Äôre not happy with the way Trump is handling it.Trump isn‚Äôt handling the scandal how I would, but when is that not true? I expect collateral damage, I expect intense partisanship and noise, I expect chaos. But at the core, fundamentally, I can‚Äôt be unhappy that after a decade, a President finally brought attention to the scandal. I realize political expediency makes talking about the scandal a losing battle for Democrats now that the Biden admin declined to fix it, but a lot of the class members were badly hoping it could be resolved in a nuanced bipartisan way. It's a partisan cudgel right now because the FAA elected to sweep it under the rug for three administrations in a row rather than frankly and honestly cutting out the rot.Fundamentally, people should not be forced to choose between ‚Äúburn it all down‚Äù and ‚Äúsweep it under the rug.‚Äù People should not be forced to choose between lowering the bar and rejecting all outreach to struggling communities. Given the recent election, Democrats have years to build a vision of diversity that involves providing more opportunities for everyone to reach a high bar, not lowering the bar‚Äîone that involves making institutions work, not obfuscating institutional failure until it can no longer be hidden. The time is right for this, and not only can it happen, it should happen. The right way to draw a contrast with Trump is not denying that there was ever an issue, but showing that people who fundamentally believe in the value of institutions and in extending opportunity to a diverse citizenship understand the issues and are prepared to solve them better than bomb-throwers ever could. Finally, to conservatives: Drink my lib tearsSteve SailerAll of that is true. But please, as you‚Äôre handling this‚Äîas you‚Äôre digging up the corruption, understanding the failure, rooting through the mess‚Äîremember that without principled, brave, honest people like Moranda Reilly, all of this might have stayed hidden forever. It all could have died in obscurity. Remember that at root, this really is a bipartisan issue, and many of the class members really do believe in the value of diversity programs that provide a wider range of people opportunity to meet a high bar. I know Democrats had a chance to clean it up, and they didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre going to do things your way. I get that. But please remember the people at the root, and remember that it took a whole lot more than just conservatives to fight this. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[UPDATE] A Dangerous Assignment: Uncovering Corruption in Maduro‚Äôs Venezuela (full documentary)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWnZF6zpbPY</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MWnZF6zpbPY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 03:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch an updated version of FRONTLINE and Armando.info‚Äôs 2024 documentary on a corruption scandal spanning from Venezuela to the U.S., and what has happened to the journalists who helped uncover the story.

a motion to dismiss
in response to Deno‚Äôs petition to cancel its ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù trademark. But instead
of addressing the real issue‚Äîthat JavaScript is an open standard with multiple
independent implementations‚ÄîOracle is trying to stall the process and sidestep
accountability.Two years ago, I published a blog post
asking Oracle to release the JavaScript trademark as a goodwill gesture. That
got no response.Last September, I published an open letter co-signed
by Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript), current TC39 editors, and over 16,000
JavaScript developers. Many were shocked to learn that Oracle even claimed
ownership of JavaScript. Oracle still said nothing.So last November, I filed
a formal petition with the USPTO through
my company, Deno, to cancel Oracle‚Äôs ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù trademark. Among other things,
we pointed out that in 2019, Oracle renewed its trademark by submitting a
screenshot of the Node.js website‚Äîa project I created‚Äîas proof of use, despite
having no affiliation with it.Our petition challenges Oracle‚Äôs trademark on three grounds:Genericness ‚Äì JavaScript is a widely used programming language, not an Oracle
product.Abandonment ‚Äì Oracle does not control, maintain, or enforce the trademark.Fraud on the USPTO ‚Äì Oracle submitted misleading evidence in its renewal
filing.You can read the full peititon for cancellation
here.Oracle‚Äôs defense: ‚ÄúThat specimen? Just ignore it‚ÄùOracle has finally responded‚Äîbut
only to the fraud claim. Their argument: Yes, we used a screenshot from
Node.js, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because we also submitted another specimen.Here‚Äôs how they frame our petition in their filing:‚ÄúThe Petition ignores completely that Oracle submitted two specimens.
Moreover, on its face, the Petition fails to allege a claim of fraud as to the
renewal in Class 42 because the specimen it touts as ‚Äòfraudulent‚Äô was
submitted to support only the renewal in Class 9 and not Class 42.‚ÄùOracle‚Äôs JavaScript trademark covers both software products (Class 9) and
technology services (Class 42). Their argument is that the Node.js screenshot
was only for Class 9 and that their primary specimen‚Äîan Oracle JET page‚Äîwas
sufficient for both.‚ÄúPetitioner has not challenged and could not plausibly challenge the
JAVASCRIPT Extension Toolkit page from Oracle‚Äôs own website that Oracle
submitted as its primary specimen in Class 9 and as its only specimen in Class
42.‚ÄùThis raises serious questions:If Oracle‚Äôs primary specimen (a screenshot of Oracle JET) was truly
sufficient, why submit a screenshot of Node.js at all?Oracle JET isn‚Äôt even a standalone JavaScript runtime‚Äîit‚Äôs a UI toolkit.Has anyone even used Oracle JET, or is it just there to keep the trademark
alive?Oracle never explained why it used a screenshot from a project it had no
connection to.They even go as far as saying:‚ÄúOracle does not concede that submission of the Node.js Specimen was improper.
However, the Board need not address that question in connection with this
Motion.‚ÄùOracle isn‚Äôt denying that it used my project‚Äîit‚Äôs just arguing that it doesn‚Äôt
matter. If a company misrepresents something in a legal filing, you‚Äôd expect
them to acknowledge it. But Oracle hasn‚Äôt even addressed it. No apology. No
explanation. Just an attempt to move past it as if nothing happened.I created Node.js and released it under the MIT license to benefit developers,
not so it could be used as a legal pawn by a Fortune 500 company. Now, instead
of correcting their misrepresentation, they‚Äôre using it to stall the case.Oracle waited until the deadline to file this motion, delaying their response to
the real issue: whether ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù is a generic term.‚ÄúThis motion tolls the deadline to otherwise answer the Petition, and Oracle
requests that the Board reset the answer deadline to at least 30 days after
the date of its decision on this motion.‚ÄùOracle won‚Äôt even discuss whether ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù should remain a trademark until
they‚Äôve finished dragging out this fraud claim.This legal maneuvering puts us in a difficult position:Agree to drop the fraud claim, letting them get away with misrepresenting
their trademark renewal.Spend months fighting this procedural issue before even getting to the real
debate.The situation is self-evident to anyone working in tech: Oracle did not create
JavaScript. Oracle does not control JavaScript. Oracle should not own the
trademark for JavaScript.JavaScript is defined by an open specification (ECMA-262), maintained by TC39,
an industry group with representatives from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla,
and others. The major implementations of JavaScript are in the browsers built by
Mozilla, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Oracle has no role in JavaScript‚Äôs
governance, implementation, or evolution‚Äîyet it continues to wield this
trademark as a legal cudgel.This isn‚Äôt just about JavaScript. If Oracle can hold onto this trademark, what
does that say about the trademark system as a whole? Should corporations be able
to warehouse trademarks indefinitely, even when they play no meaningful role in
the things they claim to own? Even when they commit fraud to maintain them?A company with no role in JavaScript‚Äôs past or future has no right to control
its name.Share this post and spread awareness about Oracle‚Äôs trademark claim.If you‚Äôre a journalist, reach out‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to talk.Let one thing be clear: we are not intimidated by Oracle‚Äôs legal maneuvering,
and we will continue to fight this case on its very strong merits. You can

Schaller discusses how the Red Hat team plans to integrate AI with IBM's open-source Granite engine to enhance developer tools, such as IDEs, and create an AI-powered Code Assistant. He says the team is also working on streamlining AI acceleration in Toolbx and ensuring Fedora users have access to tools like RamaLama. From the post: One big item on our list for the year is looking at ways Fedora Workstation can make use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to IBMs Granite effort we know have an AI engine that is available under proper open source licensing terms and which can be extended for many different usecases. Also the IBM Granite team has an aggressive plan for releasing updated versions of Granite, incorporating new features of special interest to developers, like making Granite a great engine to power IDEs and similar tools. We been brainstorming various ideas in the team for how we can make use of AI to provide improved or new features to users of GNOME and Fedora Workstation. This includes making sure Fedora Workstation users have access to great tools like RamaLama, that we make sure setting up accelerated AI inside Toolbx is simple, that we offer a good Code Assistant based on Granite and that we come up with other cool integration points. "I'm still not sure how I feel about this approach," writes designer/developer and blogger, Bradley Taunt. "While IBM Granite is an open source model, I still don't enjoy so much artificial 'intelligence' creeping into core OS development. This also isn't something optional on the end-users side, like a desktop feature or package. This sounds like it's going to be built directly into the core system."
 
"Red Hat has been pushing hard towards AI and my main concern is having this influence other operating system dev teams. Luckily things seems AI-free in BSD land. For now, at least."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Expert Engineers Meta‚Äôs Video Recommendations</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-expert-meta-video-recommendations</link><author>Willie D.

I spent my weekly allowance to play VF and VF2 in arcades, cavorted cross-country in search of rare Virtua Fighter 3 cabinets, and eventually connected with overseas friends by playing VF4 Evolution and Final Tuned in Japan. So when I see a new--or new-ish, in this case--Virtua Fighter game get released, I want it to be the best it can possibly be. Not just for myself, but so others can pick it up and understand why we longtime Virtua Fighter players adore these games so much.Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown--released a few years back on PS4--was a solid attempt at this, bringing the much-loved VF5 Final Showdown to PS4 with a fresh coat of paint. However, it fumbled in some key areas--particularly the netcode, which was a bizarre delay-based system in an era when fighting game developers were quickly and vocally embracing superior rollback systems. Now, with a new Virtua Fighter in active development and people talking about the series again, Sega has given us Virtua Fighter 5 REVO: another revision exclusively for PCs with the much-longed-for and player-demanded rollback netcode.The rollback netcode is clearly the major selling point here, as much of the game is still built upon the foundation of VF5 Ultimate Showdown: The menu graphics, interface, and character models are largely the same, with a bit of extra polish and visual flair if you've got solid graphics hardware. But that's fine--those areas didn't need much improvement, so why fix what isn't broken?Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Play with real quantum physics in your browser</title><link>https://quantum.orgsoft.org/</link><author>mattvr</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:24:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Accidental Socialists</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZnxHjhtODw</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aZnxHjhtODw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:07:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Discussing the Frontier of Particle Physics with Brian Cox</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urFIHf5coxE</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/urFIHf5coxE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://ground.news/startalk to stay fully informed on the latest Space and Science news.

How much more physics is out there to be discovered? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with physicist, professor, and rockstar Brian Cox, to discuss everything from the Higgs boson, life beyond our planet, and the fundamental forces that guide our universe.

We dive into the cutting-edge world of particle physics. Brian explains the incredible discoveries made at CERN, including the Higgs boson, and why smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light unlocks the building blocks of the universe. What mysteries remain in the standard model of physics? Brian unpacks the search for supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and dark matter while highlighting the challenges of exploring particles that only exist fleetingly after high-energy collisions.

The conversation then shifts to the grand cosmic scale. Brian and Neil explore the relationship between particle physics and astrophysics. Could gravity be a particle? What do these nearly massless particles tell us about the universe‚Äôs deeper truths? And how might the future of experiments like the Large Hadron Collider reshape our understanding of reality?

To wrap up, Brian shares his passion for public science communication and the philosophical questions that drive his work. Learn about his global live tour, Horizons, which combines stunning visuals, classical music, and a celebration of the universe‚Äôs vastness. Discover the excitement behind upcoming missions like the Europa Clipper and how moons like Europa and Io may hold the keys to extraterrestrial life.

With a mix of rock and roll energy, groundbreaking physics, and profound philosophical questions, this episode takes you on a journey through the smallest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos‚Äîand everything in between.

AI & Aliens: New Eyes on Ancient Questions // MLOps Podcast #288 with Richard Cloete, 
Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard University.

// Abstract
Demetrios speaks with Dr. Richard Cloete, a Harvard computer scientist and founder of SEAQR Robotics, about his AI-driven work in tracking Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) through the Galileo Project. Dr. Cloete explains their advanced sensor setup and the challenges of training AI in this niche field, leading to the creation of AeroSynth, a synthetic data tool.

He also discusses his collaboration with the Minor Planet Center on using AI to classify interstellar objects and upcoming telescope data. Additionally, he introduces Seeker Robotics, applying similar AI techniques to oceanic research with unmanned vehicles for marine monitoring. The conversation explores AI‚Äôs role in advancing our understanding of space and the ocean.

After living in the United States for six decades, he returned to Germany in 2012. Ever since then, he‚Äôs been working to educate people.

Unlike many adults, younger people aren‚Äôt as reserved when meeting the Holocaust survivor. They ask him all sorts of questions and take selfies with him - including the concentration camp tattoo on his arm.

Weinberg was born in the East Frisia region of northern Germany in 1925. Adolf Hitler taking power in 1933 changed the trajectory of his family life forever. Like other Jewish families, the Weinberg‚Äôs were victims of persecution, exploitation, and murder. Albrecht's parents, Alfred and Flora, were killed in Auschwitz. Albrecht himself survived and emigrated to the United States.

He finally returned to Germany 13 years ago. Since then he‚Äôs been trying to reconcile himself with the country of his birth. At his side is his former nurse, Gerda D√§nekas - the two are now roommates and best friends. For years, Albrecht and Gerda have been working to raise awareness about the Holocaust and ensure its remembrance. They visit schools and memorial sites, give speeches, and talk to the media. Recent developments, such as antisemitic incidents in Germany and the rise of right-wing extremists, have motivated the pair to maintain their fight against hatred and antisemitism for as long as possible.

This film shows the two friends going about their work, as well as their everyday life together. Even though 99-year-old Albrecht Weinberg no longer has the energy he used to, Gerda is committed to sharing his story, as well as that of other Holocaust victims.

That‚Äôs good‚Äîcomputers need precision. But it also forces humans to think like machines.For decades we tried to fix this by making programming more human-friendly. Higher-level languages. Visual interfaces. Each step helped, but we were still translating human thoughts into computer instructions.AI was supposed to change everything. Finally, plain English could be a programming language‚Äîone everyone already knows. No syntax. No rules. Just say what you want.The first wave of AI coding tools squandered this opportunity. They make flashy demos but produce garbage software. People call them ‚Äúgreat for prototyping,‚Äù which means ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use this for anything real.‚ÄùMany blame the AI models, saying we just need them to get smarter. This is wrong. Yes, better AI will make better guesses about what you mean. But when you‚Äôre building serious software, you don‚Äôt want guesses‚Äîeven smart ones. You want to know exactly what you‚Äôre building.Current AI tools pretend writing software is like having a conversation. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs like writing laws. You‚Äôre using English, but you‚Äôre defining terms, establishing rules, and managing complex interactions between everything you‚Äôve said.Try writing a tax code in chat messages. You can‚Äôt. Even simple tax codes are too complex to keep in your head. That‚Äôs why we use documents‚Äîthey let us organize complexity, reference specific points, and track changes systematically. Chat reduces you to memory and hope.This is the core problem. You can‚Äôt build real software without being precise about what you want. Every successful programming tool in history reflects this truth. AI briefly fooled us into thinking we could just chat our way to working software.We can‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt program by chatting. You program by writing documents.When your intent is in a document instead of scattered across a chat log, English becomes a real programming language:You can see your whole system at onceYou can clarify and improve your intentYou can track changes properlyTeams can work on the system togetherRequirements become their own quality checksChanges start from clear specificationsThe first company to get this will own the next phase of AI development tools. They‚Äôll build tools for real software instead of toys. They‚Äôll make everything available today look like primitive experiments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why you feel stuck ‚Äî and how to get motivated - Shannon Odell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD3-DKkiVeA</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kD3-DKkiVeA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 16:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into the psychology of how to overcome your motivational obstacles and regain focus when you feel stuck in achieving your goals.

--

Many of us have experienced feeling stuck. People often report feeling highly motivated at the start and end of a project, but the middle can feel untethered. It can happen when tackling something as simple as a term paper or as monumental as social inequality or the climate crisis. So, are there ways to get unstuck? Shannon Odell digs into the psychology of overcoming your motivational obstacles.

From managing dynamic permissions to implementing fine-grained access controls, the challenges grow as your requirements and users scale.This eBook will guide you through the 6 key requirements all authorization layers should include to avoid technical debt:Architectural and design considerations for building a scalable and secure authorization layer.20+ technologies, approaches, and standards to consider for your permission management systems.Practical insights, based on 500+ interviews with engineers, architects, and IAM professionals.Learn how to create an authorization solution that evolves with your business needs, while avoiding technical debt.How to Scale MicroservicesThey wanted to reduce the maintenance effort and scale microservices quickly.So they relied on automation.A microservice must be scaled to handle changing traffic.Yet scaling manually is slow and causes errors.So they use infrastructure as code to keep things simple; it‚Äôs used to deploy new instances based on demand.  means managing and provisioning infrastructure using code.Ready for the next technique?It‚Äôs difficult to understand and maintain APIs without a proper naming convention.Yet maintaining consistent naming for APIs across microservices is hard. So they generate APIs using code and store API definitions as JSON in a separate Git repository.Here are the benefits of code-generated APIs:API paths can be validated using linters.API naming conventions and request-response structures are standardized.API version changes can be tracked through tagging.It ensures API operations are defined.User-friendly API paths can be set up as default.Also it standardizes APIs built using different programming languages. Put simply, code generation makes it look like a single person wrote APIs across the system.Besides code generation ensures health checks are included in each microservice.A health check URL is included in the API specification of the microservice.An unhealthy service is removed from production to avoid service interruptions.A change to database schema shouldn‚Äôt break microservices depending on it. Yet sharing a single database across microservices introduces tight coupling and failure risk.So they set up separate databases for each microservice.But maintaining many databases is a huge effort; so, they create databases and tables using code.Here are its main benefits:Consistent database names.Ensure proper database indexes exist from the start.Easy to maintain and operate the database.Besides a microservice shouldn't talk to a database owned by another microservice. Instead, communication happens only via the microservice‚Äôs API owning the database. Otherwise, the data changes aren't safe as they bypass business logic.: use code generation and automation to scale microservices quickly. It reduces maintenance efforts and helps with version control.üëã  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.I launched the newsletter deep dives last month.Yet future deep dives, starting this month, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price.‚ÄúThis newsletter is an amazing resource for learning system design.‚Äù AlexSubscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? üì∞Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 123,001+ readers strong, very close to 124k.

1. This megacity was built on top of a former lake. The soil has become more and more compacted over time.  

2. The city‚Äôs main water supply is underground ‚Äì and it‚Äôs being overused. 

3. Mexico City‚Äôs located in one of the world‚Äôs most active earthquakes zones. As the water supply dries up, the ground becomes less stable. 

More than 22 million people live in Mexico City, and the aging water infrastructure just can‚Äôt keep up. To compensate, water is brought in from other states. That may offer some relief to the city, but it ultimately ends up leaving those other areas dry.

ABSTRACT
Why is it so easy to screw up platform engineering, and how do you undo the damage?

Platform engineering‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the trendy new buzzword. For a thing we‚Äôve been doing for years, ever since someone said ‚Äúwhat if we re-did Solaris zones, but called it Docker instead?‚Äù It means building an internal engineering platform for your digital services or data pipelines. It allows you to scale teams up and down, and supercharge their abilities to deliver outcomes.

But here‚Äôs a thing that nobody likes to talk about. It‚Äôs easy to totally screw up platform engineering. When that happens, there‚Äôs a huge negative impact on your engineering culture, and your teams aren‚Äôt able to achieve their goals. So how do you avoid screwing up platform engineering, and if it does happen to you, can you actually fix it?

I‚Äôve spent years in platform leadership roles, building internal engineering platforms at different scaleups and enterprise organizations. I‚Äôve had successes, and I‚Äôve had failures. I‚Äôll cover the following irreversible ways to screw up, and how to start reversing out of them:

‚Ä¢ Power tools - teams spend all their time configuring Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio etc., because the platform is based on overpowered tech
‚Ä¢ Technology anarchy - N teams do the same task in N different ways, because the platform has no opinions on tech choices, ways of working, or path to prod
‚Ä¢ Teams as tickets - making teams interact with the platform via tickets

And I‚Äôll explain why all of these can be traced back to a scaling problem, the granddaddy screw up of platform engineering - your mindset is platform as a project, not as a product.

Takeaways
‚Ä¢ Platform engineering is about creating an enabler of business value, so your teams can move faster and safer than ever before
‚Ä¢ Avoid using platform engineering power tools e.g. Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio. If you‚Äôre using them, start measuring unplanned work and plan to migrate away
‚Ä¢ Avoid being unopinionated on tech stack, ways of working, and path to prod. If you‚Äôre doing that, capture your leadership team‚Äôs expectations and track team commitments
‚Ä¢ Avoid only interacting with teams through a ticketing system. If you‚Äôre stuck there, start collaborating with teams on self-service paved roads
‚Ä¢ The key to platform engineering success is a platform as a product mindset [...]

Both services have largely depended on free server resources provided by Equinix (formerly Packet.net) and its Metal division for the past few years. Equinix announced recently that it was sunsetting its bare-metal sales and services, or renting out physically distinct single computers rather than virtualized and shared hardware. As reported by the Phoronix blog, both free software organizations have until the end of April to find and fund new hosting, with some fairly demanding bandwidth and development needs.
 
An issue ticket on Freedesktop.org's GitLab repository provides the story and the nitty-gritty needs of that project. Both the X.org foundation (home of the 40-year-old window system) and Freedesktop.org (a shared base of specifications and technology for free software desktops, including Wayland and many more) used Equinix's donated space. [...] Alpine Linux, a small, security-minded distribution used in many containers and embedded devices, also needs a new home quickly. As detailed in its blog, Alpine Linux uses about 800TB of bandwidth each month and also needs continuous integration runners (or separate job agents), as well as a development box. Alpine states it is seeking co-location space and bare-metal servers near the Netherlands, though it will consider virtual machines if bare metal is not feasible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DOE Places Compressed-Air Energy Storage Loan Under Review</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/hydrostor-stymied</link><author>Mark Harris</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjE0NTY0Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NTgwMjg1NH0.5xLHfFUyBmMaIT3wxGhB4ubK-M5hOkvFpfSnDt5LFwY/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trump admin's funding freeze includes a $1.8B loan for Hydrostor's California project]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The PS2‚Äôs backwards compatibility from the engineer who built it (2020)</title><link>https://freelansations.medium.com/the-story-of-the-ps2s-backwards-compatibility-from-the-engineer-who-built-it-ec39cf5a0353</link><author>msephton</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 11:56:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It was 1996 when I first joined Sony Computer Entertainment as part of the second wave of newly graduated hires at the time. Back then, I think SCE‚Äôs research and development team was made up of all of around maybe 50 people, with Ken Kutaragi standing at the helm while guys like me were at the very bottom of the ladder. If I remember correctly, I was hired just after it had been announced that Square entered the ranks of Sony‚Äôs third party developers. Around the time that Final Fantasy VII was coming out, I had a chance to watch the cutscenes for it and, like a lot of people, vividly recall the shock at seeing Aerith meet her untimely demise so dramatically‚Ä¶I believe my first job after joining SCE was to program a video converter of sorts that would take a movie file and apply filters to it. That also happened to be the first program I ever wrote professionally. The thing is, when I entered the team, I was probably the least useful member out of everyone there. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that, either. I had no real electrical engineering skills to speak of whatsoever and I didn‚Äôt even know how to boot up Windows 3.1, let alone how to write any programs. Even now, I can‚Äôt help but wonder what people at Sony saw in me when they decided to hire me.Luckily, I got the chance to learn how to program computers thanks to a training program that the company ran. The material was easy for me to grasp and I came away from that training feeling like I could program just about anything. After I was done with that training, I did a lot of odds and ends. I was put in charge of everything from inspecting CD emulators to model data converters, libc, and more. It was in the midst of that work, around 1998 ‚Äî at least, I think it was around then ‚Äî that all of us in that division were briefed on the next generation PlayStation hardware.After that point, the research and development group was split into two teams. One team obviously continued to focus on the then-current PlayStation hardware, while the other one set their sights on the next generation. I knew that I, for one, as someone who always likes experiencing new things, wanted to work in the latter team. I think I interviewed to join them because I recall later being specifically assigned to it, something that really excited me.Once I was brought onto the PlayStation 2 team, I was given the task of making PS1 games play on the new system. Back then, it was normal for your old games to not be able to run on newer consoles, but SCE wanted to buck that trend, which I thought was forward-thinking of them. Given how I had only been with the company for a few years at that point, too, I was really pleased that I was allowed to work on something so important.When this decision to make the PS2 backwards compatible with PS1 games had been made, the plan was already for the PS2 to reuse the main processor on the PS1 as an input/output processor for the new hardware. The catch, however, was that none of the other hardware from the PS1 was, at that point, going to be included, meaning that the rest of it would have to be emulated with software. Having been involved with the software engineering side of things up until that point, it was up to me to write the emulator for the PS1‚Äôs SPU, or its sound hardware.The PS2‚Äôs sound chip is structured into two parts: the core and the digital signal processor. A senior member of the team who worked specifically in sound engineering tackled the emulation work on the DSP side, while I focused my attention on the core. To that end, we took up shop in a room set up for us at a subcontractor and secluded ourselves as we got to work writing the necessary programming. There were no windows inside that room and I remember regularly arguing with the other engineer while we worked. It wasn‚Äôt all bad, though, as we became really close friends as a result of that time together.I don‚Äôt remember quite how long we‚Äôd been working, but one day, everything was upended unceremoniously. As it turned out, the PS1‚Äôs sound chip  going to be included as part of the PS2‚Äôs internals after all, meaning that all of our work was thrown out of the window.The SPU emulator that we had been writing was rendered useless, leaving our roles up in the air since the adoption of the PS1‚Äôs sound chip didn‚Äôt come at the expense of the PS2‚Äôs own new sound processor. We speculated about what would come next, like, say, potentially writing test vectors for that new sound processor. My next assignment, however, came as a huge surprise.Specifically, I was put in charge of emulating the PS1‚Äôs graphics processor, a request that utterly baffled me. Someone else was already supposed to be taking care of that and when I asked what was going on, I was told that they were quitting the company and that it was on me to pick up where they left off, no ifs, ands, or buts. Suffice it to say, after doing sound work up until that point, switching gears to the graphics side of things was quite the shift. But that didn‚Äôt ultimately matter, as I wasn‚Äôt given much of a say one way or the other. Like it or not, I had to accept the order, even if the whole ordeal was nothing short of confusing.That‚Äôs not to say that I thought it was going to be an impossible hill to climb, however. In my mind, I view emulators as a sort of converter in and of themselves, ones that primarily take orders designed for old processors and translate them into ones that the new target processor can understand and execute. In that sense, even if sound and graphics hardware have their fair share of differences, in the end, they‚Äôre both still fundamentally sending commands. All an emulator is doing is changing the shape and flow of those commands. So long as an emulator is fully tested, it should all work out in the end, even if that‚Äôs obviously the really tough part in practice.By the time that I inherited the GPU emulation work, the previous person in charge had thankfully already laid down a basic framework, so I didn‚Äôt have to start completely from scratch. My first order of business was to therefore get up to speed on the GPU specifications for both the PS1 and PS2. After that, I set about implementing missing functions as I initially tried to focus on reprogramming the PS1‚Äôs GPU commands.The first PS1 game that booted up in the PS2‚Äôs emulator was Ridge Racer. As a launch title for the PS1, it felt pretty profound that out of all the games in the system‚Äôs library to be chosen as the very first target to get up and running, it was Ridge Racer that was chosen for that honor. I pondered the significance of it being a first of sorts once again for the PS2 as I turned the device on.That being said, the initial results were hardly perfect, to put it very, very kindly. The race queen who appears at the start of every race, for instance, was rendered as a mosaic rather than a proper sprite. Plus, when you‚Äôd complete a lap, the screen turned pink. Still, I was just pleased to see the game running at all. Even if the only thing that was actually being emulated was the GPU, that‚Äôs when I knew it was going to be possible to achieve PS1 backwards compatibility on the PS2 with that level of software emulation.Early in the morning on March 2, 1999, I was standing behind the stage curtains at the Tokyo International Forum, where the PlayStation 2 was going to be officially unveiled to the world later that day at the PlayStation Meeting 1999. My role was to perform a live demonstration of the console‚Äôs backwards compatibility with the PS1 once the functionality was announced during the presentation.I had been on standby since the night before to prepare for the event. Several months had passed since Ridge Racer first booted up and progress on the GPU emulator had come a long way. A number of PS1 games were now able to run on it, with Crash Bandicoot: Warped being the best of the bunch. For that reason, it was chosen as the game to show off the PS2‚Äôs backwards compatibility. There was only one problem: sometimes it froze in emulation.It goes without saying that there‚Äôd be big trouble if the game locked in the middle of the demo in front of such a large audience. Unfortunately, I hadn‚Äôt nailed down what was causing these freezes to happen. All I could figure out was that as long as Crash kept moving, the game remained stable for whatever reason. Knowing that, I stayed awake all night, endlessly playing the game on development PS2 hardware. Luckily, I wasn‚Äôt alone in this endeavor, as I had one other person on hand to help play through the game with me. The gameplay feed in our monitor was also set up such that it could be shown off on the big screen on stage during the conference with the flick of a switch. As you might expect, I screwed around with that switch and had a fun time with it. As for why we simply couldn‚Äôt start playing the morning of the announcement, that was because there was a chance the emulator itself wouldn‚Äôt load and there wouldn‚Äôt be enough time to fix it right then and there. As a result, as surprising as it might sound, it was therefore logistically safer to simply keep the system running all night once it had booted up.Thankfully, we made it through that night without incident. The system stayed operational as the big show was approaching that day. It can‚Äôt be understated how important of an event it was, either. Sony CEO Nobuyuki Idei himself was in attendance to offer his support. Tech demos were rolled out that showed off the power of the PS2‚Äôs Emotion Engine and Graphics Synthesizer. From behind the curtains, I didn‚Äôt have a great view of what was happening, but I could tell that people were definitely responding to it and cheering. Everything was going according to plan. Then, soon enough, it was time for the backwards compatibility reveal.Believe it not, I honestly don‚Äôt remember much of what happened in that moment. The plan during the Crash Bandicoot demo was for me to play the game as normal, leaping over obstacles and proceeding deeper and deeper into the stage. But when it came time to play the game in earnest, I really struggled with it and kept running into one particular obstacle in the stage I just couldn‚Äôt get past. From there, my memory is a complete blank. I can‚Äôt tell you whether I managed to get my act together or not.Evidently, though, things seemed to pan out all right in the end because the announcement was greeted with applause despite my bad showing of it. All told, the event was a great success.The PlayStation 2 was eventually released in Japan on March 4, 2000. Work on the PS1 emulator was mostly completed around New Year‚Äôs, if I‚Äôm not mistaken. In the end, there were a handful of games that just wouldn‚Äôt run properly, resulting in us compiling a public blacklist of PS1 games that players wouldn‚Äôt be able to play on the system.After the Japanese hardware launch came the ones in North America and Europe, whose respective PS1 games the emulator naturally also supported. Right before their releases, I went to Sony‚Äôs American and European offices to assist with debugging work, which was the first time I ever went abroad. The PS2 ultimately wasn‚Äôt 100 percent backwards compatible with the PS1 back catalog, but it nevertheless supported nearly all of it. When I look back on it now, that assignment is probably the most important one I‚Äôve ever had in my career.Ken Kutaragi set a high bar for us at his team, telling us to always measure the quality of our work based on whether it was truly the absolute best in class globally. When I think about what I‚Äôve done in my own lifetime that meets that goal, the first thing that comes to mind is the work I did on the PS1 backwards compatibility. That‚Äôs how proud I am of it.To be absolutely clear, I couldn‚Äôt have possibly done it alone and had a lot of people help me along the way. In the end, if it hadn‚Äôt been me who pulled it off, somebody else would have. Regardless, the fact I was able to see such a huge project through to the very end is something I take great pride in. I can only hope I have another opportunity to do something similar again in my lifetime.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Maximizing Cloud Efficiency with Jerzy Grzywinski and Brent Segner</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/04/maximizing-cloud-efficiency-with-jerzy-grzywinski-and-brent-segner/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=maximizing-cloud-efficiency-with-jerzy-grzywinski-and-brent-segner</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED1045788818.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 10:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Compute optimization in a cloud environment is a common challenge because of the need to balance performance, cost, and resource availability.

A customer places an order, and your system needs to deduct the item from inventory, charge the customer‚Äôs credit card, and record the sale in your accounting system‚Äîall at once. What happens if the payment fails but your inventory count has already been reduced? Or if your application crashes halfway through the process?This is where  come into play. They ensure that all the steps in such critical operations happen reliably and consistently.ACID is an acronym that refers to the set of 4 key properties that define a transaction: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and In this article, we‚Äôll dive into what each of the ACID properties mean, why they are important, and how they are implemented in databases.A  in the context of databases is a sequence of one or more operations (such as inserting, updating, or deleting records) that the database treats as . It either fully succeeds or fully fails, with no in-between states.When you send money to a friend, two things happen:Money is deducted from your account.Money is added to their account.These two steps form . If either step fails, both are canceled.Without transactions, databases could end up in inconsistent states. : Your money is deducted, but your friend never receives it.: Two people booking the last movie ticket at the same time.Transactions solve these problems by enforcing rules like  (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).Now, lets looks at each of the ACID properties.Atomicity ensures that a transaction‚Äîcomprising multiple operations‚Äîexecutes as a unit of work: it either  succeeds (commits) or  fails (rolls back). If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to a state exactly as it was before the transaction began.In a money transfer transaction, if the credit step fails, the debit step cannot be allowed to stand on its own. This prevents inconsistent states like ‚Äúmoney disappearing‚Äù from one account without showing up in another.Atomicity abstracts away the complexity of manually undoing changes if something goes wrong.How Databases Implement AtomicityDatabases use two key mechanisms to guarantee atomicity.1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logs)Every operation is recorded in a  before it‚Äôs applied to the actual database table.If a failure occurs, the database uses this log to  incomplete changes.Once the WAL entry is safely on disk, the database proceeds with modifying the in-memory pages that contain rows for  and .When the operations succeed:The database marks  as  in the transaction log.The newly updated balances for A and B will eventually get flushed from memory to their respective data files on disk.If the database crashes  the log entry is written but  the data files are fully updated, the WAL provides a way to recover:On restart, the database checks the WAL.It sees  was committed.It reapplies the  operations to ensure the final balances are correct in the data files.If the transaction had not committed (or was marked as ‚Äúin progress‚Äù) at the time of the crash, the database would  those changes using information in the log, leaving the table as if the transaction never happened.2. Commit/Rollback ProtocolsDatabases provide commands like , , and Any changes made between  and  are considered ‚Äúin-progress‚Äù and won‚Äôt be permanently applied unless the transaction commits successfully.If any step fails, or if you explicitly issue a , all changes since the start of the transaction are undone. in the context of ACID transactions ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another valid state‚Äînever leaving it in a broken or ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù state.It means that all the data integrity constraints, such as  (no duplicate IDs),  (related records must exist in parent tables), and (age can‚Äôt be negative), are satisfied before and after the transaction.If a transaction tries to violate these rules, it will not be committed, and the database will revert to its previous state.You have two tables in an e-commerce database: (with columns: , , etc.) (with columns: , , , etc.): You can‚Äôt place an order for a product if  is greater than the  in the  table.If the product‚Äôs  was 8 (less than what we‚Äôre trying to order), the database sees that the new value would be  which breaks the consistency rule (it should not go negative).The transaction fails or triggers a rollback, preventing the database from ending in an invalid state.How to Implement ConsistencyDatabase Schema Constraints, , , ,  constraints, and other schema definitions ensure no invalid entries are allowed.Triggers and Stored ProceduresTriggers can automatically check additional rules whenever rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.Stored procedures can contain logic to validate data before committing.Application-Level SafeguardsWhile the database enforces constraints at a lower level, applications often add extra checks‚Äîlike ensuring business rules are followed or data is validated before it even reaches the database layer. ensures that concurrently running transactions do not interfere with each other‚Äôs intermediate states.Essentially, while a transaction is in progress, its updates (or intermediate data) remain invisible to other ongoing transactions‚Äîgiving the illusion that each transaction is running sequentially, one at a time.Without isolation, two or more transactions could read and write partial or uncommitted data from each other, causing incorrect or inconsistent results.With isolation, developers can reason more reliably about how data changes will appear to other transactions.To understand how isolation works, it helps to see what can go wrong without proper isolation.  Common concurrency anomalies include:Transaction A reads data that Transaction B has modified but not yet committed.If Transaction B then rolls back, Transaction A ends up holding an invalid or ‚Äúdirty‚Äù value that never truly existed in the committed state.Transaction A reads the same row(s) multiple times during its execution but sees different data because another transaction updated or deleted those rows in between A‚Äôs reads.Transaction A performs a query that returns a set of rows. Another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that match A‚Äôs query conditions.If A re-runs the same query, it sees a different set of rows (‚Äúphantoms‚Äù).Databases typically allow you to choose an , which balances data correctness with performance.Higher isolation levels provide stronger data consistency but can reduce system performance by increasing the wait times for transactions. Let's explore the four common isolation levels:Allows dirty reads; transactions can see uncommitted changes.Rarely used, as it can lead to severe anomalies.A transaction sees only data that has been committed at the moment of reading.Prevents dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can still occur.Ensures if you read the same rows multiple times within a transaction, you‚Äôll get the same values (unless you explicitly modify them).Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, but phantom reads may still happen (depending on the database engine).The highest level of isolation, acting as if all transactions happen sequentially one at a time.Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.Most expensive in terms of performance and concurrency because it can require more locking or more conflict checks.How Databases Enforce IsolationPessimistic Concurrency ControlRows or tables are locked so that no other transaction can read or write them until the lock is released.Can lead to blocking or deadlocks if multiple transactions compete for the same locks.2. MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)Optimistic Concurrency ControlInstead of blocking reads, the database keeps multiple versions of a row.Readers see a consistent snapshot of data (like a point-in-time view), while writers create a new version of the row when updating.This approach reduces lock contention but requires carefully managing row versions and cleanup (vacuuming in PostgreSQL, for example).A form of MVCC where each transaction sees data as it was at the start (or a consistent point) of the transaction.Prevents non-repeatable reads and dirty reads. Phantom reads may still occur unless the isolation level is fully serializable. ensures that once a transaction has been committed, the changes it made will survive, even in the face of power failures, crashes, or other catastrophic events. In other words, once a transaction says ‚Äúdone,‚Äù the data is permanently recorded and cannot simply disappear.How Databases Ensure Durability1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logging)Most relational databases rely on a  to preserve changes before they‚Äôre written to the main data files:: The intended operations (updates, inserts, deletes) are recorded in the WAL on durable storage (disk).: Once the WAL entry is safely persisted, the database can mark the transaction as committed.Apply Changes to Main Data Files: The updated data eventually gets written to the main files‚Äîpossibly first in memory, then flushed to disk.If the database crashes, it uses the WAL during :: Any committed transactions not yet reflected in the main files are reapplied.: Any incomplete (uncommitted) transactions are rolled back to keep the database consistent.2. Replication / RedundancyIn addition to WAL, many systems use replication to ensure data remains durable even if hardware or an entire data center fails.: Writes are immediately copied to multiple nodes or data centers. A transaction is marked committed only if the primary and at least one replica confirm it‚Äôs safely stored.: Changes eventually sync to other nodes, but there is a (small) window where data loss can occur if the primary fails before the replica is updated.Regular  provide a safety net beyond logs and replication. In case of severe corruption, human error, or catastrophic failure:: Capture the entire database at a point in time.Incremental/Differential Backups: Store changes since the last backup for faster, more frequent backups.: Ensures backups remain safe from localized disasters, allowing you to restore data even if hardware is damaged.If you found it valuable, hit a like ‚ù§Ô∏è and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The Verge's Lauren Feiner reports: NetChoice has become one of the fiercest -- and most successful -- opponents of age verification, moderation, and design code laws, all of which would put new obligations on tech platforms and change how users experience the internet. [...] NetChoice's latest suit opposes the Maryland Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a rule that echoes a California law of a similar name. In the California litigation, NetChoice notched a partial win in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the district court's decision to block a part of the law requiring platforms to file reports about their services' impact on kids. (It sent another part of the law back to the lower court for further review.)
 
A similar provision in Maryland's law is at the center of NetChoice's complaint. The group says that Maryland's reporting requirement lets regulators subjectively determine the "best interests of children," inviting "discriminatory enforcement." The reporting requirement on tech companies essentially mandates them "to disparage their services and opine on far-ranging and ill-defined harms that could purportedly arise from their services' 'design' and use of information," NetChoice alleges. NetChoice points out that both California and Maryland have passed separate online privacy laws, which NetChoice Litigation Center director Chris Marchese says shows that "lawmakers know how to write laws to protect online privacy when what they want to do is protect online privacy."
 
Supporters of the Maryland law say legislators learned from California's challenges and "optimized" their law to avoid questions about speech, according to Tech Policy Press. In a blog analyzing Maryland's approach, Future of Privacy Forum points out that the state made some significant changes from California's version -- such as avoiding an "express obligation√¢ to determine users' ages and defining the "best interests of children." The NetChoice challenge will test how well those changes can hold up to First Amendment scrutiny. NetChoice has consistently maintained that even well-intentioned attempts to protect kids online are likely to backfire. Though the Maryland law does not explicitly require the use of specific age verification tools, Marchese says it essentially leaves tech platforms with a no-win decision: collect more data on users to determine their ages and create varied user experiences or cater to the lowest common denominator and self-censor lawful content that might be considered inappropriate for its youngest users. And similar to its arguments in other cases, Marchese worries that collecting more data to identify users as minors could create a "honey pot" of kids' information, creating a different problem in attempting to solve another.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everyone knows your location (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/130</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/130/changelog-news-130.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tim Sh tracked himself down through in-app ads, Sniffnet comfortably monitors your Internet traffic, Cate Huston opines on what makes a good team, Victor Shepelev draws on 25 years of coding to share seven things he now knows & Grant Slatton tells you how to write a good design document.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

In 2013, incarcerated individuals in California‚Äôs Pelican Bay Prison assembled a historic hunger strike to protest decades-long sentences of solitary confinement. The defiance united over 30,000 inmates from diverse backgrounds in a powerful display of solidarity. This act garnered national attention and shed light on the inhumane conditions of The SHU (Security Housing Units). ‚ÄúThe Strike‚Äù highlights the strength of prisoner-led resistance and the transformative power of collective organizing.

I've been there twice, and both times been involved in messy brawls despite not tasting a lick of alcohol. The second of these fisticuffs was against a small group of Cuman deserters. They seemed nice enough, but I was still wary considering the Cumans are who killed my parents a few months back. I wasn't the only one, and after failing to ease the growing tension, I decided to side with the local townspeople when push came to shove.Needless to say, we didn't put up much of a fight. Once the Cumans left, one of the locals implored me to track them down and deal with them once and for all. After eventually tracking them down, the sole Czech-speaking Cuman was so welcoming that I ended up getting drunk with them. I got so inebriated, in fact, that my night revolved around almost drowning, playing matchmaker for one of the soldiers, and then having a conversation with a talking dog that definitely wasn't real. This night of revelry would've been fine on any other evening, but I promised two new acquaintances that I'd be up bright and early to join them on a critical mission. Even after sleeping for seven hours, I was still completely plastered when I arose from my stupor. And let me tell you, fighting bandits with blurred vision, a swaying body, and a soundtrack of frequent farting isn't ideal.To some, this last part might sound utterly infuriating. To me, and others like me, this is part of what makes Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 utterly enticing. This is a game that sings when you're swept up in an entertaining series of events ignited by the consequences of your actions; where the game's quest design and emphasis on player choice wonderfully intertwine with its systems-driven sandbox to create a wholly immersive experience. While its 2018 predecessor was often disrupted by technical issues--which were further exacerbated by a frustrating save system--and clunky combat, Kingdom Come 2 refines and improves upon it in every respect. The obtuse nature of some of its RPG systems still won't click for everybody, but this is a confident sequel that builds on the foundations established by the original game, presenting a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I convert videos to printed flipbooks for living</title><link>https://www.videotoflip.com/</link><author>momciloo</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 15:09:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Contact us to discuss your bulk order needs and receive a customized quote.

Taken on its own, each campaign remains a superbly engaging escapade across eras that will keep you playing for "one more turn" until you realize you're late for your sister's birthday party. Civilization VII is not just a game that you play to pass the time during weekends--the experience is compelling enough that it  the weekend, and maybe several weekdays of your life, too.For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through each historical period. Several of these new features are welcome, given that they address concerns from previous titles while also making campaigns more dynamic. However, a few design decisions are bound to be contentious, especially for longtime fans, since these mechanics tend to impact the player's control over certain outcomes.One of the biggest changes in Civilization VII is how you choose leaders and nations separately. Gone are the days when picking Augustus Caesar or Napoleon meant automatically playing as Rome or France, respectively. Instead, leaders have a unique trait that defines their playstyle, and you can select a country independently to complement that playstyle.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>These Graphene Tattoos Are Actually Biosensors</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/graphene-biosensor</link><author>Dmitry Kireev</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjExODgwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MjQwMjY5OH0.vgPw2A84lmrK8A6WYJlp0gOXgP4vD-uMUbKsNGgIQFE/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Flexible stick-on patches could monitor blood pressure, stress, and more ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Klarity ‚Äì Open-source tool to analyze uncertainty/entropy in LLM output</title><link>https://github.com/klara-research/klarity</link><author>mrciffa</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 13:53:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've open-sourced Klarity - a tool for analyzing uncertainty and decision-making in LLM token generation.

It effortlessly enables us to write simple text and have it transform to rich media.
It feels that it has all the right features without in-your-way bells and whistles.This is the editor I wanted to have since forever üôåToday, we are proud to present to you Marksmith. The GitHub-style markdown editor for Ruby on Rails. It supports ActiveStorage and has a few powerhouse features like preview-panel and helper, toolbar, and list-continuation.Seamless markdown editingI feel that the best way to write markdown is in plain-text. I've used those "markdown wysiwyg" editors like EasyMDE but they just don't feel natural. I think in text, so I want to write text. Let me just write it like that.That's why Marksmith's interface is a plain  where you write plain text. No distractions or any fancy post processing. Once I finish writing the markdown I usually click the preview button to see what it would look like and if the body is valid. Marksmith has a built-in preview pane which will render the markdown as HTML.Marksmith comes with a  helper which will render that content on your show page or other places with the same HTML that you see in your Preview pane.This renderer is easily customizable and extendable in your own app.ActiveStorage integrationOne of the things I do in editors is to embed media and more often images. Marksmith comes integrated with Rails' amazing ActiveStorage framework for storing files.Drag-and-drop files or click the dedicated button to attach files. Images will automatically be formatted as a markdown image and other files will be attached as a link.One nice thing I love about GitHub's editor is the list continuation feature. When writing lists, after I click return, I expect that the editor will go on the next line and add a new list item. üôå Marksmith does that!One request we get very often is the ability to inject images that have previously been uploaded by users, thus not duplicating that content.
Marksmith seamlessly integrates with Avo and will feature an "Add from gallery" button to enable that.I'd like to thank Jeremy Smith for pointing me toward GitHub's toolbar element and other packages and for providing the code for the ActiveStorage integration ‚ù§Ô∏èMarksmith is available on GitHub as an MIT gem. It's an engine that hooks up in any Rails app quickly and integrates beautifully with Avo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Allies had a HUGE problem in the Atlantic</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJWNLg9E_E</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XTJWNLg9E_E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 12:00:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#ww2 #history #battleoftheatlantic #iwm #uboat]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Story: One Million Checkboxes - The Viral Game That Defied Convention</title><link>https://corecursive.com/one-million-checkboxes-with-nolen-royalty/</link><author>Adam@corecursive.com (Adam@corecursive.com)</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/corecursive/omcb.mp3?dest-id=628353" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://corecursive.com/">Podcast - CoRecursive</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if internet trolls could become your greatest collaborators?

In this first episode, we learn how subtle religious and political differences upset the balance of power in England, and plunged the kingdom into chaos.Produced by James Hickmann and edited by Max Carrey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DeepSeek, China, OpenAI, NVIDIA, xAI, TSMC, Stargate, and AI Megaclusters | Lex Fridman Podcast #459</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1f-o0nqpEI</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_1f-o0nqpEI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 00:12:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dylan Patel is the founder of SemiAnalysis, a research & analysis company specializing in semiconductors, GPUs, CPUs, and AI hardware.

But long-time Slashdot reader theodp complains it's a "gushing how-to-make-Agile-even-better opinion piece."

Like other pieces by Agile advocates, it's long on accolades for Agile, but short on hard evidence justifying why exactly Agile project management "has emerged as a critical component for firms looking to improve project delivery speed and flexibility" and the use of Agile approaches is being expanded across other departments beyond software development. Indeed, among the three examples of success offered in the piece to "highlight the effectiveness of agile methods in navigating complex stakeholder dynamics and achieving project success" is Atlassian's use of agile practices to market and develop its products, many of which are coincidentally designed to support Agile practices and teams (including Jira). How meta. 

Citing "recent studies," the piece concludes its call for stakeholder engagement by noting that "59% of organizations measure Agile success by customer or user satisfaction." But that is one of those metrics that can create perverse incentives. Empirical studies of user satisfaction and engagement have been published since the 1970's, and sadly one of the cruel lessons learned from them is that the easiest path to having satisfied users is to avoid working on difficult problems. Keep that in mind when you ponder why difficult user stories seem to languish forever in the Kanban and Scrum Board "Ice Box" column, while the "Complete" column is filled with low-hanging fruit. Sometimes success does come easy! So, are you in the Agile-is-Heaven or Agile-is-Hell camp?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Primary Hustle For Homeless in Vegas</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwJF7Smr2M</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VOwJF7Smr2M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:59:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew and Glen go scavenging for copper wire, which is one of the primary hustles for the homeless in Vegas]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Admits Linux-Post Crackdown Was &apos;In Error&apos;, Fixes Moderation Error</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/1837253/facebook-admits-linux-post-crackdown-was-in-error-fixes-moderation-error?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tom's Hardware reports:

Facebook's heavy-handed censorship of Linux groups and topics was "in error," the social media juggernaut has admitted. Responding to reports earlier this week, sparked by the curious censorship of the eminently wholesome DistroWatch, Facebook contacted PCMag to say that it had made a mistake and that the underlying issue had been rectified. 

"This enforcement was in error and has since been addressed. Discussions of Linux are allowed on our services," said a Meta rep to PCMag. That is the full extent of the statement reproduced by the source... Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has appealed against the Community Standards-triggered ban shortly after it noticed it was in effect (January 19). PCMag received the Facebook admission of error on January 28. The latest statement from DistroWatch, which now prefers posting on Mastodon, indicates that Facebook has lifted the DistroWatch links ban. 


More details from PCMag:

Meta didn't say what caused the crackdown in the first place. But the company has been revamping some of its content moderation and plans to replace its fact-checking methodology with a user-driven Community Notes, similar to X. "We're also going to change how we enforce our policies to reduce the kind of mistakes that account for the vast majority of the censorship on our platforms," the company said earlier this month, in another irony. 
"Up until now, we have been using automated systems to scan for all policy violations, but this has resulted in too many mistakes and too much content being censored that shouldn't have been," Meta added in the same post.

According to a copy of his r√©sum√© obtained by WIRED, he spent three months at Neuralink, Musk‚Äôs brain-computer interface company, last summer.Both Bobba and Coristine are listed in internal OPM records reviewed by WIRED as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù at OPM, reporting directly to Amanda Scales, its new chief of staff. Scales previously worked on talent for xAI, Musk‚Äôs artificial intelligence company, and as part of Uber‚Äôs talent acquisition team, per LinkedIn. Employees at GSA tell WIRED that Coristine has appeared on calls where workers were made to go over code they had written and justify their jobs. WIRED previously reported that Coristine was added to a call with GSA staff members using a nongovernment Gmail address. Employees were not given an explanation as to who he was or why he was on the calls.Kliger, whose LinkedIn lists him as a special adviser to the director of OPM and who is listed in internal records reviewed by WIRED as a special adviser to the director for information technology, attended UC Berkeley until 2020; most recently, according to his LinkedIn, he worked for the AI company Databricks. His Substack includes a post titled ‚ÄúThe Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys Its Enemies,‚Äù as well as another titled ‚ÄúPete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense: The Warrior Washington Fears.‚ÄùKillian, also known as Cole Killian, has a working email associated with DOGE, where he is currently listed as a volunteer, according to internal records reviewed by WIRED. According to a copy of his now-deleted r√©sum√© obtained by WIRED, he attended McGill University through at least 2021 and graduated high school in 2019. An archived copy of his now-deleted personal website indicates that he worked as an engineer at Jump Trading, which specializes in algorithmic and high-frequency financial trades.Shaotran told Business Insider in September that he was a senior at Harvard studying computer science and also the founder of an OpenAI-backed startup, Energize AI. Shaotran was the runner-up in a hackathon held by xAI, Musk‚Äôs AI company. In the Business Insider article, Shaotran says he received a $100,000 grant from OpenAI to build his scheduling assistant, Spark.Are you a current or former employee with the Office of Personnel Management or another government agency impacted by Elon Musk? We‚Äôd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Vittoria Elliott at vittoria_elliott@wired.com or securely at velliott88.18 on Signal.‚ÄúTo the extent these individuals are exercising what would otherwise be relatively significant managerial control over two very large agencies that deal with very complex topics,‚Äù says Nick Bednar, a professor at University of Minnesota‚Äôs school of law, ‚Äúit is very unlikely they have the expertise to understand either the law or the administrative needs that surround these agencies.‚ÄùSources tell WIRED that Bobba, Coristine, Farritor, and Shaotran all currently have working GSA emails and A-suite level clearance at the GSA, which means that they work out of the agency‚Äôs top floor and have access to all physical spaces and IT systems, according a source with knowledge of the GSA‚Äôs clearance protocols. The source, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation, says they worry that the new teams could bypass the regular security clearance protocols to access the agency‚Äôs sensitive compartmented information facility, as the Trump administration has already granted temporary security clearances to unvetted people.This is in addition to Coristine and Bobba being listed as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù working at OPM. Bednar says that while staff can be loaned out between agencies for special projects or to work on issues that might cross agency lines, it‚Äôs not exactly common practice.‚ÄúThis is consistent with the pattern of a lot of tech executives who have taken certain roles of the administration,‚Äù says Bednar. ‚ÄúThis raises concerns about regulatory capture and whether these individuals may have preferences that don‚Äôt serve the American public or the federal government.‚ÄùAdditional reporting by Zo√´ Schiffer and Tim Marchman.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everyone knows your location: tracking myself down through in-app ads</title><link>https://timsh.org/tracking-myself-down-through-in-app-ads/</link><author>apokryptein</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 17:07:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I read about a massive geolocation data leak from Gravy Analytics, which exposed more than 2000 apps, both in AppStore and Google Play, that secretly collect geolocation data without user consent. Oftentimes, even without developers` knowledge. I looked into the list (link here) and found at least 3 apps I have installed on my iPhone. Take a look for yourself! This made me come up with an idea to track myself down externally, e.g. to buy my geolocation data leaked by some application. After more than couple dozen hours of trying, here are the main takeaways: I found a couple requests sent by my phone with + 5 requests that leak , which can be turned into geolocation using reverse DNS. Learned a lot about the RTB (real-time bidding) auctions and OpenRTB protocol and was shocked by the amount and types of data sent with the bids to ad exchanges. Gave up on the idea to buy my location data from a data broker or a tracking service, because I don't have a big enough company to take a trial or $10-50k to buy a huge database with the data of millions of people + me. Well maybe I do, but such expense seems a bit irrational. Turns out that EU-based peoples` data is almost the most expensive. But still, I know my location data was collected and I know where to buy it! My setup for this research included:My old iPhone 11 restored to factory defaults + new apple id. Felt too uncomfortable to do all this on my current phone. Charles Proxy to record all traffic coming in and out. I set up the SSL certificate on the iPhone to decrypt all https traffic.A simple game called Stack by KetchApp - I remember playing it at school 10-12 years ago. Choosing it as a lab rat felt nostalgic. To my surprise, there were a lot of KetchApp games on the list. Ok, here we go: only 1 app installed without the default Apple ones, Charles on, launching Stack in 3, 2, 1.... These are the requests that the app sends in the first minute after launch. Take a look at the timing of the requests - almost every split second. Let's take a look at the contents of the requests. I actually checked every single one of them - but I'll leave out only the interesting ones here. Let's start with the juiciest request sent to https://o.isx.unity3d.com - the first one that included my geo, while I disabled Location Services on iPhone for all apps! If you are as naive as I was before this, you might be surprised - what does Unity, the 3D engine, have to do with the in-app advertisement or location tracking? Perhaps that's just some monitoring data to help improve the engine? Turns out that Unity's main revenue stream (they made $2 bln+ in 2023) is Unity Ads - "Mobile Game Ad Network". Sounds quite interesting.Below is the request body in json format sent to Unity Ads. I will only leave the  fields worth mentioning - the actual size is 200+ keys. {

  "c": "ES", // Country code,
  "d": "sports.bwin.es", // Domain; the app or website where the ad will be displayed.
  "bn": "molocoads-eu-banner", // WTF is moloco ads? We'll see!
  "cip": "181.41.[redacted]", // my IP !!
  "dm": "iPhone12,1", 
  "ct": "2", // Connection type; e.g., Wi-Fi
  "car": "Yoigo", // mobile network operator
  "ifv": "6B00D8E5-E37B-4EA0-BB58-[redacted]", // ID for Vendor. We'll get back to it!
  "lon": "2.[redacted]", // Longitude ... 
  "lat": "41.[redacted]", // Latitude ... 
  "sip": "34.227.224.225", // Server IP (Amazon AWS in US) 
  "uc": "1", // User consent for tracking = True; OK what ?!
}Ok, so my IP + location + timestamp + some  id are shared with Unity ‚Üí Moloco Ads ‚Üí Bwin, and then I see the actual Bwin ad in the game. Wonderful! As a quick note - location shared was not very precise (but still in the same postal index), I guess due to the fact that iPhone was connected to WiFi and had no SIM installed. If it was LTE, I bet the lat/lon would be much more precise. Hello Facebook... What are you doing here?Next interesting request that leaks my IP + timestamp (= geo-datapoint) is Facebook.What?!I don't have any Meta [Facebook] app installed on this iPhoneI didn't link the app nor my Apple ID to any Facebook accountI didn't consent to Facebook getting my IP address!{

		},
        {
          "a lot of data: yes a loooooooot"
         }We'll talk more about this one in the next section. Why do you need my screen brightness level? {
  "osVersion":"16.7.1",
  "connectionType":"wifi",

  "advertisingTrackingId":"00000000-0000....", // interesting ...
  }There's no "personal information" here, but honestly this amount of data shared with an arbitrary list of 3rd parties is scary. Why do they need to know my screen brightness, memory amount, current volume and if I'm wearing headphones? I know the "right" answer - to help companies target their audience better! For example, if you're promoting a mobile app that is 1 GB of size, and the user only has 500 MB of space left - don't show him the ad, right?But I also heard lots of controversies on this topic. Like Uber dynamically adjusting taxi price based on your battery level - because you're not waiting for a cheaper option with 4% left while standing in the street. I can't know if that or another one is true. But the fact that this data is available and accessible by advertisers suggests that they should at least think of using it. Ok, enough with the requests. We can already see the examples of different ip and geolocation leaks.  + timestamp was adjust.com - but the request body was too boring to include. You might've already noticed  and  ==  in the requests above - what are those? IFV, or IDFV, is "ID for Vendor". This is my id unique for each vendor, a.k.a developer - in this case, KetchApp. This checks out: I installed another KetchApp game to quickly record the requests, and the  value was the same for it. Advertising Tracking ID, on the other hand, is the cross-vendor value, the one that is shared with an app if you choose "Allow app to track your activity across ...". As you can see above, it was actually set to  because I "Asked app not to track". I checked this by manually disabling and enabling tracking option for the Stack app and comparing requests in both cases. And that's the only difference between allowing and disallowing trackingI understand there might be nothing shocking to you in it - this is not really kept secret, you can go and check the docs for Apple developers, for example. But I believe this is  communicated correctly to the end users, you and me, in any adequate way, shape or form: the free apps you install and use collect your precise location with timestamp and send it to some 3rd-party companies. The only thing that stops anyone with access to bid data (yet another ad buying agent, or ad exchange, or a dataset bought or rented from data broker, as you'll see later) from tracking you down with all trips you make daily is this  that is not shared when you disallow apps to "track you across apps" to "enhance and personalise your ads experience". By the way: if you're using 10 apps from the same vendor (Playrix, KetchApp or another 1000-app company) and allow  to track you ‚Äì it would mean that the data collected in all 10 apps will be enriched with your IDFA which can later be exchanged to your personal data. At the same time, there is so much data in the requests that I'd expect ad exchanges to find some loophole ID that would allow cross-app tracking without the need for IDFA. I found at least 20 ids like  and ,  and  (these 2 are shared with Facebook), and so on. By the way, the fact that Facebook collected my IP + timestamp without any adequate consent / app connection from my end is crazy. I think Facebook is more than capable of connecting the dots and my Meta Account to this hit as soon as I login to Instagram or Facebook app on the same IP address. Let's get back to the request that leaked my location for a second and look at its trace. We'll focus on the parties in the middle:stack ‚Üí  o.isx.unity3d.com ‚Üí molocoads ‚Üí bwin (advertiser)Unity [ads] is an SSP (supply-side platform) that acts as a collector of data from the app via SDK. As an app developer, you don't need to worry about gathering the right data, registering as a publisher on an ad exchange or whatever - just install the SDK and receive the money. Moloco ads is a DSP network that resells data from multiple SSPs (like Unity, Applovin, Chartboost). Basically, from almost every one of the requested hosts I've seen pop up in Charles Proxy.It then applies some "smart optimisation" and connects a vacant banner space on your phone screen with the advertiser.Sounds like moloco aggregates a lot of data and basically anyone (- any company that becomes an ad partner) can access the data by bidding lower than others. Or imagine a real ad exchange that bids normally and collects all of the data along the way "as a side gig". Basically, this is how intelligence companies and data brokers get their data. At this point I was looking for any mentions of Moloco on Telegram and Reddit, and I ran into this post that answered a lot of my questions:They access it if they integrate with the provider of bidstream, which would be the SSP. It's on the SSP to verify the vendor to whom they give access to bids. Usually, the requirement would be that you actually... bid. SSPs want you to spend money, that's how their business makes revenue. They might open up only part of the traffic to specific vendors (i.e.. if you don't bid worldwide, you won't get the bidstream worldwide, only in the regions in which you operate).Let's move further. When I found out how the data gets out, I started looking for any place where it's being sold. It was a quick search.I found a data marketplace called Datarade which is a panel with all sorts of data. When I searched for MAID-specific data, hundreds of options showed up, like these two: The price of the Redmob dataset surprised me, - $120k a year... for what?Let's now take a look at their promo:Check out the list of features on the right - do any of them look familiar? : "low latency" means they know your location from the last time any of the apps shared it. It can be as little as 5 seconds ago. What's even better is that Redmob provides a  of the data. I tried to request it from their website, but the sample never landed in my mailbox (surprise-surprise, timsh.org doesn't seem like a customer with high potential). Thankfully, this sample is public on Databricks Marketplace with this annotation:Enhance your products and services using our global location data covering over 1.5 billion devices. Using our extensive location dataset, you can unearth concealed patterns, conduct rapid analyses, and obtain profound knowledge.We can also provide region-specific data (MENA, Africa, APAC, etc.) based on your specific requirements. Our pricing model includes an annual licensing option, and we provide free sample data so that you can evaluate the quality of our dataset for yourself. To me, the most absurd part is the  column - the source of the data can't be more obvious. I'm also quite interested in the  column - if it's the birthyear, where did they get it from? Never mind, who cares about your birthyear.All right, imagine I bought the access to a huge stream of Redmob data. But my goal is to track and stalk people like myself or anyone else, so I need some way to exchange MAIDs () for the actual personal info: name, address, phone number... No problem! This kind of dataset is surprisingly also present on Datarade. Take a look at a sample table with  type that is provided by "AGR Marketing Solutions":Inside - all personal info (full name, email, phone number, physical address, property ownership... and IDFAs. Congrats, you have just reached the bottom of this rabbit hole. Let's wrap it up and make a couple of bold statements.How to track yourself down?Easy! Just follow this simple step-by-step guide:Use some free apps for a bit. Move around and commute - this makes the geo data more valuable. "Allow" or "ask not to track" - a combo of IP + location + User-agent + geolocation will still be leaked to hundreds of "3rd parties" regardless of your choice.Wait for a few seconds until fake DSPs and data brokers receive your data.Exchange your full name or phone number for an IDFA (if present), IP address and user-agent through the  data purchased somewhere.Now, access the "Mobility data" consisting of geolocation history, and filter it using the values from the previous step. Congratulations! You found yourself. I created a flowchart that includes almost all actors and data mentioned above - now you can see how it's all connected. This is the worst thing about these data trades that happen constantly around the world - each small part of it is (or seems) legit. It's the bigger picture that makes them look ugly. Thanks for reading this story until the end!My research was heavily influenced by these posts and investigations: ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Technology Can Save The World | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODqJuV8v4y8</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ODqJuV8v4y8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 16:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video is a compilation of clips filmed from 2022.

Animal welfare focuses on animals‚Äô well-being, particularly of those under human care or ownership. Protection laws aim to ensure that animals‚Äô physical, mental, and environmental needs are met, while allowing their owners to make use of them (for food or labor, for example) without inflicting any ‚Äúunnecessary suffering.‚Äù   

Advocates of animal rights, on the other hand, believe animals should be legally protected from all forms of exploitation. Many proponents say people should not be allowed to farm animals, use them in laboratories, injure or kill them. 

Both views are based on the idea that most animals are sentient beings, which can think and feel and therefore have personal interests which should be respected.

It's a library that provides methods for working with musical harmony ‚Äí intervals, notes, chords. For example, it can parse almost any chord symbol (Fmaj7, CminMaj9, etc) and turn it into notes, or it can identify a chord from a given set of notes.I started this project with the idea of using formal grammar to parse chord symbols. I wanted to use it instead of a hand-written parser, which is the common approach among similar libraries. Lua caught my attention because of Lpeg, a Parsing Expression Grammar library that is both fast and easy to use. An additional motivation for using Lua was the lack of comparable libraries for it, even though the language is commonly used in audio programming.However, despite being a Lua library, the project itself is written in Fennel ‚Äî a "lispy" language that transpiles to Lua. Fennel has features that make writing code for the Lua platform much more pleasant: a concise syntax, macros, and destructuring ‚Äî a feature Lua sorely lacks!In the process, I definitely learned a lot about music theory, although my new knowledge is quite one-sided. By working on this library, I know a thing or two about types and structure of chords, but I learned almost nothing about their composition and transformation. Perhaps these will be the directions I explore next in the project.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keychron Q0 Max macropad review (Gateron Jupiter Banana)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj9cv_fpwDE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zj9cv_fpwDE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 10:19:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 3:39 for a typing demonstration.

"The teachers faded away pretty quickly," Gates adds, "But about six of us stayed hardcore. One was Paul Allen..." ‚Äî the future co-founder of Microsoft. And the experience clearly meant a lot to Gates. "Microsoft just never would've happened without Paul ‚Äî and this teletype room." 

In a longer post thanking his "brilliant" teachers, Gates calls his teletype experience "an encounter that would shape my entire future" and "opened up a whole new world for me." Gates also thanks World War II Navy pilot and Boeing engineer Bill Dougall, who "was instrumental in bringing computer access to our school, something he and other faculty members pushed for after taking a summer computer class... The fascinating thing about Mr. Dougall was that he didn't actually know much about programming; he exhausted his knowledge within a week. But he had the vision to know it was important and the trust to let us students figure it out." 

Gates shared a similar memory about the computer-room's 20-something overseer Fred Wright, who "intuitively understood that the best way to get students to learn was to let us explore on our own terms. There was no sign-up sheet, no locked door, no formal instruction."

Instead, Mr. Wright let us figure things out ourselves and trusted that, without his guidance, we'd have to get creative... Some of the other teachers argued for tighter regulations, worried about what we might be doing in there unsupervised. But even though Mr. Wright occasionally popped in to break up a squabble or listen as someone explained their latest program, for the most part he defended our autonomy... 
Mr. Wright gave us something invaluable: the space to discover our own potential.

On Monday, over a trillion dollars was wiped off the US stock market due to the appearance of a Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.

The release of a new reasoning model, known as R1, led investors to question US dominance in tech, their expectations around future AI capex while also raising the prospect that China might beat Silicon Valley at its own game.

The new DeepSeek model can ‚Äúreason‚Äù to solve complex problems and performs as well as the AI software from US tech giants like Google and OpenAI, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.

DeepSeek quickly overtook OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.

Two images of child rape are shared online every second. Social networks make it especially easy for sex offenders to prey on victims.

Back in 2009, the United Nations estimated that 750,000 pedophiles were online at any one time. Fifteen years later, experts believe that figure has tripled. Believing themselves to be shielded by the apparent anonymity of chatrooms, these men - most of the perpetrators are men - exchange ideas on how best to approach and manipulate a child into supplying explicit material.
They also give each other tips on how to rape a child known to them and share images with others without being caught. Some enquire about commissioning the rape of a child to their exact specifications on the other side of the world - and to witness this live via Skype or WhatsApp for less than a hundred dollars. 
A nightmare that is part of everyday life for child protection organizations and law enforcement agencies, who are faced with the challenge of identifying victims of abuse, tracking down the perpetrators and preventing the proliferation of pedocriminal content.
For four years, director Laetitia Ohnona observed the day-to-day work of relevant agencies in Germany, France, Britain, North America and the Philippines: accompanying French police from the new central office for the protection of minors, undercover American special agents from the Homeland Security Investigations agency,  the Public Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office in Frankfurt and German police officers responsible for taking down darknet pages, as well as employees of reporting platforms tracking down pedocriminal content. On a visit to the European Commission, she learned that it plans to impose stricter rules on IT companies.

As Swift expands, there‚Äôs value in investing in matching cross-platform build tools that provide a powerful, consistent, and flexible experience across the ecosystem.As a foundational step in this new chapter of Swift build technologies, today Apple is open sourcing Swift Build, a powerful and extensible build engine that provides a set of build rules for building Swift projects. Swift Build is the engine used by Xcode, which supports millions of apps in the App Store as well as the internal build process for Apple‚Äôs own operating systems. The open source repository also includes support for targeting Linux and Windows.The primary responsibility of the build system is to transform user-authored inputs (such as a project description and source code) into output artifacts like command line tools, libraries, and applications. Build systems play an important role in providing a great developer experience, enabling higher level features which determine how users architect and work with their projects. Furthermore, the performance and reliability of a build system has a direct impact on developer productivity.Swift Build is an infrastructural component designed to plan and execute builds requested by a higher-level client like Swift Package Manager or Xcode. It builds on top of the existing llbuild project to add capabilities including:Robust integration with the Swift compiler to reliably and efficiently coordinate the build of Swift projectsSupport for a wide variety of product types including libraries, command line tools, and GUI applications with advanced build configuration optionsBuild graph optimizations that maximize parallelism when building Swift and C codeCompared to the build engine in Xcode, the build engine in Swift Package Manager is fairly simple. On Apple platforms, having two different ways to build packages has also led to user confusion when the two implementations‚Äô behavior didn‚Äôt match. Contributing Xcode‚Äôs build engine to the Swift project and developing it in open source alongside the Swift compiler provides the tools necessary to address these problems and deliver a great builds experience to all Swift users. With this release, SwiftPM now has the opportunity to offer a unified build execution engine across all platforms. This change should be transparent to users and maintain full compatibility with all existing packages while delivering a consistent cross-platform experience. At the same time, it lays the foundation to enable new features and improvements across all platforms and tools, and unlocks new performance optimizations and developer-facing features. As a small first step towards this vision, today the team is submitting a pull request to begin the process of integrating support for Swift Build in SwiftPM as an alternate build engine. In the coming months, we‚Äôd like to collaborate with the community to complete the work of unifying build system integrations so users can benefit from future tooling improvements across all platforms and project models.We believe this is an important step in continuing to enable a healthy package ecosystem where developers can rely on a consistent, polished development experience ‚Äî no matter what IDE they‚Äôre using or platform they‚Äôre targeting. We‚Äôll be sharing more details about this work on the Swift forums, and we‚Äôre looking forward to hearing others‚Äô feedback!We look forward to working with the community to continue evolving how we build Swift code. You can find the  repository in the Swift organization on GitHub, including a README and documentation describing how to build and contribute. Contributions via pull requests and issues are welcome, and we‚Äôd also love to solicit feedback and ideas for improvements on the Swift forum.This is an exciting new chapter for Swift‚Äôs build system, and we‚Äôre looking forward to all the potential it opens for Swift!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Important Is Temperature? | BBC Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqveSVRu7M</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nlqveSVRu7M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 16:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How is a magnetic field generated?

What is the extent of God‚Äôs creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

ABSTRACT
The software industry is changing faster than ever. Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an approach to systems architecture, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is getting faster and faster.

In this talk, James explores what this means for developers writing code now. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?

In short, what does it mean if we are #neverdone?

They were all telling one another the same thing: Data on the website were about to disappear, or be altered, to comply with the Trump administration‚Äôs ongoing attempt to scrub federal agencies of any mention of gender, DEI, and accessibility. ‚ÄúI was up until 2 a.m.,‚Äù Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan who relies on the CDC‚Äôs data to track viral outbreaks, told me. She archived whatever she could.The full scope of the purge isn‚Äôt yet clear. One document obtained by  indicated that the government was, as of yesterday evening, intending to target and replace, at a minimum, several ‚Äúsuggested keywords‚Äù‚Äîincluding ‚Äúpregnant people, transgender, binary, non-binary, gender, assigned at birth, binary [], non-binary [], cisgender, queer, gender identity, gender minority, anything with pronouns‚Äù‚Äîin CDC content. While these terms are often politicized, some represent demographic variables that researchers collect when tracking the ebb and flow of diseases and health conditions across populations. Should they be reworded, or even removed entirely, from data sets to comply with the executive order, researchers and health-care providers might have a much harder time figuring out how diseases affect specific communities‚Äîmaking it more challenging to serve Americans on the whole.CDC data‚Äôs ‚Äúexplicit purpose‚Äù is to guide researchers toward the places and people who most need attention, Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a former CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, told me. As the changes unfold before him, he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to understand how this benefits health.‚ÄùWhen I contacted the CDC, a spokesperson redirected my requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. After this story was published, an HHS spokesperson said that ‚Äúall changes to the HHS website and HHS division websites are in accordance with President Trump‚Äôs January 20 Executive Orders‚Äù on gender and DEI.The government appears to understand that these changes could have scientific implications: The document directing a review of CDC content suggests that some work could be altered without ‚Äúchanging the meaning or scientific integrity of the content,‚Äù and that any such changes should be considered ‚Äúroutine.‚Äù Changing other content, according to the document, would require review by an expert precisely because any alterations would risk scientific integrity. But the document does not specify how data would be sorted into those categories, or at whose discretion.‚ÄúMy fear is that in the short term, entire data sets would be taken down,‚Äù then reappear with demographic variables removed or altered to conform with DEI restrictions, Katie Biello, an epidemiologist at Brown, told me. Excising mention of gender and sexual orientation, for instance, from public-health data sets could require stripping entire columns of data out. If the government chooses to define sex as binary, transgender people and nonbinary people, among others, could be effectively erased. In response to the ongoing changes, some groups of researchers are now rushing to archive the CDC website in full.Acknowledging and addressing health differences among demographic groups is a basic epidemiological tenet, Biello told me, ‚Äúso we know where to target our health interventions.‚Äù She pointed to examples in her own field: Gay men have higher rates of STIs, but lower rates of obesity; transgender women have higher rates of HIV, but lower rates of prostate cancer. More broadly, demographic changes to data sets could limit the country‚Äôs ability to identify which Americans are most at risk from an expansive list of conditions including adolescent depression, STIs, even sex-specific cancers. Changing data sets in this way would be tantamount to ‚Äúerasing our ability to use data and evidence‚Äù to care for people, Rachel Hardeman, a health-equity expert at the University of Minnesota, told me.Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown, pointed to mpox as a recent example of how replacing ‚Äúgender‚Äù with ‚Äúsex,‚Äù or ignoring sexual orientation, could limit effective public-health responses. At the beginning of the United States‚Äô 2022 outbreak, neither researchers nor the public had much clarity on who was most affected, leading to widespread panic. ‚ÄúOfficials were talking about the situation as if it was a risk we equally faced,‚Äù Nuzzo said. By collecting detailed demographic information, researchers were able to show that the disease was primarily affecting men who have sex with men, allowing officials to more efficiently allocate resources, including vaccines, and bring the epidemic under control before it affected Americans more widely.A scrub such as this could also change how the government allocates funds for long-standing threats to public health, which could widen health-equity gaps, or reverse progress in combatting them. Rates of STIs more generally have recently begun to plateau in the U.S., after decades of steady increase‚Äîbut altering data that focus interventions on, say, transgender populations, or men who have sex with men, could undo those gains. If no data exist to prove that a health issue concentrates within a particular community, that ‚Äúprovides a justification to cut funding,‚Äù one researcher told me. (Several scientists who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity, for fear of retaliation for speaking out about the loss of federal data.) Sullivan, whose work focuses on HIV surveillance, compared the government‚Äôs actions to, effectively, destroying the road map to determining who in America most needs screening, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment.Much of the data on the CDC website have been aggregated from states, so it would be possible for researchers to reassemble those data sets, Nuzzo pointed out. But that‚Äôs an onerous task, and several scientists told me they never thought they‚Äôd be in a position where they‚Äôd have to scramble to squirrel away publicly available federal data. Nuzzo also worried that states might be reluctant in the future to share data with the federal government, or might decide not to bother collecting certain data at all. On the most basic scientific level, changing federal-government data means those data become unreliable. Public-health data are collected with the intention of sussing out which populations most need health interventions; altering those data leaves behind a skewed portrait of reality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: TalkNotes ‚Äì A site that turns your ideas into tasks</title><link>https://www.talknotes.tech/</link><author>ajlkshdaksjd</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 11:43:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Turn any audio into smart notesTurn hours of note taking into seconds.

We are happy to share Perforator ‚Äì our internal cluster-wide profiler with great support for native languages and a built-in AutoFDO pipeline to simplify sPGO builds. Perforator allows you to profile most binaries without having to recompile or adjust the build process. We use it at Yandex to profile each pod inside a large cluster at modest speed (99Hz), collecting petabytes of profiles every day.Inspired by Google-Wide Profiling, we started continuous profiling years ago with simple tools like poormansprofiler.org. With the rise of eBPF, we came up with a simple and elegant solution providing detailed profiles without noticeable overhead. Pretty wild when you can see the guts of your production binaries in a flamegraph without them even noticing.- Our main contribution is infrastructure for continuous PGO using AutoFDO. Google and Meta have done tremendous work on building PGO infrastructure, and we made the last missing piece of the puzzle to make this work well and scalable.- Native binaries are profiled through eh_frame analysis, interpreted/JIT-compiled languages are profiled through perf-pid.map or hardcoded structure offsets.- We render profiles in multiple ways, the most common one is a fast implementation of FlameGraphs, rendering 1M frames in 100ms.- We provide Helm charts to easily deploy Perforator on your k8s cluster.- You can use Perforator in standalone mode as a replacement for perf record.I'd love to answer your questions about the tool!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Android 16&apos;s Linux Terminal Runs Doom</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/31/2317212/android-16s-linux-terminal-runs-doom?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 01:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google is enhancing Android 16's Linux Terminal app to support graphical Linux applications, so Android Authority decided to put it to the test by running Doom. From the report: The Terminal app first appeared in the Android 15 QPR2 beta as a developer option, and it still remains locked behind developer settings. Since its initial public release, Google pushed a few changes that fixed issues with the installation process and added a settings menu to resize the disk, forward ports, and backup the installation. However, the biggest changes the company has been working on, which include adding hardware acceleration support and a full graphical environment, have not been pushed to any public releases.
 
Thankfully, since Google is working on this feature in the open, it's possible to simply compile a build of AOSP with these changes added in. This gives us the opportunity to trial upcoming features of the Android Linux Terminal app before a public release. To demonstrate, we fired up the Linux Terminal on a Pixel 9 Pro, tapped a new button on the top right to enter the Display activity, and then ran the 'weston' command to open up a graphical environment. (Weston is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, a modern display server protocol.)
 
We also went ahead and enabled hardware acceleration beforehand as well as installed Chocolate Doom, a source port of Doom, to see if it would run. Doom did run, as you can see below. It ran well, which is no surprise considering Doom can run on literal potatoes. There wasn't any audio because an audio server isn't available yet, but audio support is something that Google is still working on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why This D.C.

It turns out that if you include any expletives in your search query, Google will not return an AI Overview, as they are called, at the top of the results page.For instance, if you search ‚ÄúHow large is the student body of Yale University?‚Äù the search results page will return a large AI-generated blurb above the blue links. If you instead search, ‚ÄúHow large is the fucking student body at Yale University?‚Äù you will instead get a standard list of blue link results, sans-AI summary.This is not the first time internet sleuths have discovered a way to disable Google‚Äôs AI-powered results. Other methods are more complicated, however, like adding a specific string of characters to the search results page URL. This method of swearing and pleading at Google to ‚Äújust give me the fucking links‚Äù is much more cathartic.We are going to go out on a limb here and say that if people are regularly finding techniques to disable AI summaries in Google searches, perhaps that means they do not want them in the first place? Google search results have never been perfect, of course‚Äîthere is still a lot of poor information across the web. But AI summaries present users with a prominent blurb at the top of their search that looks authoritative when it just risks compounding the misinformation problem with more erroneous slop.It is the same way Siri has been made worse by its integration with ChatGPT. At least in the past, when the voice assistant did not know how to answer a question it would just throw users to the web. Now Siri offers up ChatGPT-generated responses instead, sometimes spitting out incorrect nonsense instead of admitting it is not sure. But this is all being forced on users whether they like it or not. From Google Docs to X and Instagram, there are AI buttons and search boxes and dropdowns everywhere now, because every tech company needs to have an AI strategy. Is a basic keyword search too much to ask?When Google first introduced AI Overviews into search, it went viral for returning nonsensical responses, such as suggesting that one can prevent cheese from sliding off their pizzas by using glue or improve gut health by eating pebbles. It is believed Google‚Äôs model sourced the information from Reddit comments. AI does not know how to identify sarcasm or satire. earlier reported on the new loophole, which, if we are speculating, is caused by Google‚Äôs overly cautious steering of its AI model. Whereas a bot like xAI‚Äôs Grok is more than happy to swear and discuss sensitive topics, Google‚Äôs Gemini keeps it PG. Google has likely trained Gemini to avoid repeating expletives, so it simply is disabled in search when a curse word is present in order to avoid that.Google has argued that AI Overviews, as they are called, do not reduce traffic sent to websites because users will view summaries and be interested in delving deeper into the source material after finding something of interest. That logic has not comforted media companies, which have been litigating the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity for ingesting their content into large language models.We imagine Google will close the expletive loophole eventually, but in the meantime, if you are sick of AI, you now know an easy way to avoid it. Just tell Google to give you the fucking links.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over the top auth strategies (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/78</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/78/changelog--friends-78.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dan Moore from FusionAuth joins us for a wide-ranging discussion about modern auth strategies.

For some people, it gets in the way of taking risks and living the life they dream of. For others, it keeps them trapped in negative feelings. The stronger the shame, the more we try to hide it from others.

This is precisely what gives shame so much destructive power over us. In this documentary, three people tell their stories. They share their personal experiences, and the consequences of their shame: Addiction, self-harm, depression. Experts explain why we feel ashamed in the first place, how shame influences our self-image and how we can find a way out of this painful feeling. 

Because shame hurts. At the same time, shame is crucial to helping us to live together. Shame turns us into social beings, who have internalized the norms and rules of the community. To what extent shame benefits coexistence is also a topic of research. In view of social media, do we need more shame, as a moral cement, so that we behave more respectfully towards each other? Or would less shame be better?

Synchronicity makes an extraordinary claim about reality‚Äîevents may be linked in diverse and strange ways that defy all physical law, causality and common sense. What would it mean if events may relate to each other only by some kind of meaning, however obscure, not by some kind of physical interaction? This type of extraordinary claim demands extraordinary evidence.

ABSTRACT
Playwright is the hottest browser automation tool on the market. You can use it for testing and web scraping, but also for production monitoring!

In this talk I‚Äôll explain the basics of Playwright, show real life (code) examples and explain how to use browser automation for effective, high signal to noise production monitoring: I like to call this the ‚Äúmonitoring as code‚Äù workflow. After this talk, you will have the basic knowledge on using Playwright in your own dev pipeline and catch errors on production. [...]

Our ability to learn about phenomena and worlds that seem almost
impossibly out of reach, now give us an incredible insight into the universe we occupy, and how we got here.

Brian and Robin find out about some of the big new missions providing information into our own solar system and beyond, and find out what big questions in cosmology still remain a tantalising challenge?

H√∂ss was brought in by top Nazis to pioneer the industrialisation of the mass murder of Europe's Jews and others. He lived in a house that shared a wall with Auschwitz, metres from the crematorium, where he and his family enjoyed a happy domestic life - his wife once described their life at the house as 'paradise'.The house was home to a Polish family until last year when it was taken over by the Counter Extremism Project who invited History Hit to explore the house, which is largely as it was when the Hoss family lived there. Dan travels to Poland with historian and best-selling author Thomas Harding to discover more about H√∂ss' role in the Holocaust and what the house teaches us about 'the banality of evil'. They learn about what went on there, what Holocaust artefacts were recently found in the attic and the future of the house as a centre to combat hate.Warning: this episode contains descriptions of human suffering and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.With special thanks to the Counter Extremism Project, Dr Hans-Jakob Schindler, Keith Burnet and Thomas Harding.You can see the History Hit film about the house here:You can find out more in Thomas' book 'Hanns and Rudolf: The German Jew and the Hunt for the Kommandant of Auschwitz'. He also has a new book out for children.

According to quantum physics, the universe should have collapsed on itself in the instant after the Big Bang due to all particles being 100 million billion times heavier. Recent observations of the universe existing suggest that this may not have happened. Even more recent experiments at the Large Hardron Collider have failed to find out why. In particular, why the Higgs boson is light enough to allow the universe to exist. This is part of something known as the hierarchy problem, and some consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in physics.

It's a world I wanted to dive into from the jump, if only to uncover more of how it came to be and what the cultures of the different locations are like. And as much as the worldbuilding retains that wonder with incredible-looking environments that make for engaging play spaces for the physics-based magic system, the beat-for-beat details of Eternal Strands' story aren't nearly as rewarding to unravel.Eternal Strands' story too often hits on familiar fantasy tropes, such as an inexplicable magical disaster that changed everything and a corrupting force that seemingly has no weakness and must be avoided at all costs. But the history that story is built on adds a semblance of life to the world, building memorable NPCs that you want to come back to again and again to talk about what in their life led them to where they are now, and painting a somber undertone to the world that begs to be uncovered through its detailed lore notes and optional collectibles.I especially love how Eternal Strands packages aspects of its history so they're viewed through the art of weaving--not a typical choice for action-adventure games. Concepts like spells are recontextualized, transforming from arcane runes into fashion choices. You can largely avoid the historical exposition if you'd rather spend your time swinging a sword and spewing fire, but there's some great writing to uncover here for lore hounds.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Were Neandertals morning people?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSchvm7lLOw</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vSchvm7lLOw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

This film‚Äôs protagonists are united by the challenges, suffering and constant change they face - as well as by their confidence that things will turn out well in the end.

When Lend Mustafa loses his mother, he plunges into a deep crisis. She was his most important support as he embarked on a difficult journey: Lend had decided to live not as a woman, but as a trans man. Not an easy decision in the patriarchal Kosovar society in which Lend lives. But Lend stays true to his decision and goes on to open a club in Kosovo for the queer community. 
Ekaterina Straijewa is also familiar with the challenges of living in a patriarchal society. In Bulgaria, she was a successful racing driver. Despite her success, she faced ridicule for being a woman on the racetrack. Then an assault forced her to give up her profession. Her whole life was thrown into question. But she manages to fight her way back and climbs into the cockpit once again. 
Bashkim Lilo grew up in the Albanian mountains and worked as a shepherd. When he was offered the opportunity to train as a nursing assistant, he jumped at the chance. Because it was clear to him that this was the only way he and his family would have a future in Albania.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn sits down with esteemed philosophy Richard Swinburne to discuss how the problem of evil may provide a strong argument against theism, the theory of the Trinity, animals in evolution, and more.

Richard Granville Swinburne FBA is an English philosopher. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. Over the last 50 years, Swinburne has been a proponent of philosophical arguments for the existence of God. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of "The Coherence of Theism", "The Existence of God", and "Faith and Reason". He has been influential in reviving substance dualism as an option in philosophy of mind.

We provide an examination of SDcpp, its components, and the technical concepts that enable efficient inference of Stable Diffusion models on lower-end hardware such as CPUs and lightweight GPUs, such as Apple M-series chips. In particular, we‚Äôre looking at Flux.1, a text-to-image model developed by Black Forest¬†Labs.Introduction to Diffusion Models and Stable DiffusionDiffusion models, specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have emerged as powerful generative frameworks capable of producing high-fidelity images from random noise through iterative denoising processes. Stable Diffusion extends the DDPM framework by incorporating text conditioning, allowing for the generation of images based on descriptive prompts. However, the computational demands of such models typically necessitate high-memory, high-bandwidth GPU resources, limiting their accessibility and scalability.SDcpp addresses these limitations by providing an optimized inference framework that leverages techniques such as quantization, memory-efficient sampling, and optimized latent space representations to facilitate the deployment of Stable Diffusion models on devices with constrained computational resources. This paper delves into the architectural and algorithmic components of SDcpp, highlighting the methodologies that underpin its efficiency and performance.The architecture is composed of several interdependent modules, each contributing to the inference process. First, it is loading the required models (1), including text encoders, the diffusion model, and the VAE decoder. It then performs  (2), tokenizing the input prompt and generating text embeddings using a CLIP-based model and an additional T5XXL text conditioning model. Next, it computes the conditioning graph (3), transforming embeddings to create a guidance vector for the diffusion process. The system then  (4) by iteratively refining a randomly initialized latent tensor using a noise schedule and a chosen sampling method, progressively steering it towards a structured latent representation in a number of . This step is the most compute-intensive, consuming roughly 90% of the total processing time. Once sampling completes, the pipeline decodes the latent representation (5) using a VAE model to reconstruct pixel-space information. Finally, it  (6) as an image file, completing the text-to-image generation process.Diffusion Model Core ComponentsThe diffusion model within SDcpp is the principal generative engine, responsible for transforming Gaussian noise into coherent images through a series of denoising . More steps allow finer details and smoother outputs but increase inference time, as each step requires additional computation. This process is governed by the DDPM framework, wherein the model iteratively refines the image by removing noise in a controlled manner. The diffusion model encompasses three primary components:UNet (Denoising Network): the UNet architecture employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and reconstruction. The network predicts and removes noise at each denoising step, progressively enhancing image¬†quality.Text Encoder (Conditioning Module): The text encoder converts textual prompts into latent embeddings that guide the denoising process. SDcpp supports multiple text encoders, including CLIP-L, CLIP-G, and T5XXL, each tailored for different model versions and memory considerations.Scheduler (Noise Controller): The scheduler orchestrates the noise removal strategy, dictating the temporal progression of denoising steps. It determines the rate and manner in which noise is reduced, balancing computational efficiency and image fidelity.A recent model, ¬†, is optimized for low-resource environments, featuring a compact UNet architecture that accelerates inference by reducing the number of denoising steps. Flux.1 is designed for memory-efficient quantization and compatibility with the GGUF format, making it suitable for deployment on lightweight hardware. It reduces inference steps to only 4 steps and can achieve fast inference.Variational Autoencoder (VAE)VAEs facilitating the encoding of images into a lower-dimensional latent space. This reduction significantly diminishes computational and memory overhead while retaining high-resolution image details. Latent space is a compact mathematical representation of an image. Think of it as a highly efficient shorthand where only the most essential details are stored. Instead of storing every pixel, the image is encoded as numbers that describe its features. This makes it possible to work with images at a much lower computational cost. Stable Diffusion doesn‚Äôt generate images pixel by pixel. Instead, it creates images in latent space, where information is stored in a more compact and manageable way. Once the model finishes generating an image in this space, the VAE  it back into a high-resolution format that we can¬†see.Different VAEs can influence how well the final image looks. A generic VAE works for most images, but a model trained for a specific style, like anime or realistic photography, may use a custom VAE to better match its training data. A poorly matched VAE can cause color shifts, blurriness, or unwanted artifacts.Technically, any model can use any VAE, but results vary. A VAE trained on cartoon-style images won‚Äôt reconstruct a photorealistic image correctly. This is why some models provide their own VAEs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey have been optimized to maintain details that matter most for a specific¬†style.LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)LoRA facilitates model customization without the need to adjust the entire diffusion model. By modifying only a small subset of parameters (~10 million), LoRA significantly reduces memory usage compared to full model fine-tuning. Multiple LoRAs can be combined with weighted influences on the final image, enabling diverse stylistic and feature modifications. For instance, combining two LoRAs with different weights can be executed using the syntax <lora:styleA:0.6> <lora:styleB:0.8>. To optimize performance, it is advisable to minimize the number and strength of LoRAs, especially in memory-limited environments.Training and Inference File¬†FormatsThe  is the standard PyTorch checkpoint format, that stores full precision weights and optimizer states. Supports training and fine-tuning but can execute arbitrary Python code, posing security risks. SafeTensors (.safetensors) is a safer alternative to CKPT, with structured, immutable storage and no executable code. Loads faster but still used mainly for training.GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a binary model format introduced by llama.cpp, succeeding GGML. Initially designed for language models (like LLaMA models), GGUF has been adopted in diffusion models to enable efficient, quantized inference without reformatting model files into proprietary formats (e.g.,¬†.ggml or¬†.gguf conversions required previously). Traditional formats (.safetensors,¬†.ckpt,¬†.bin) store full-precision FP16/FP32 model weights, consuming significant VRAM. GGUF introduces quantization at multiple levels, storing models in 2-bit to 16-bit precision while maintaining compatibility with¬†SDcpp.Use GGUF for efficient inference on low-resource devices, prefer¬†.safetensors for training.In our experiments,  demonstrates an extremely fast denoising process, with images at 1 and 2 steps appearing nearly identical, suggesting that most structural information is determined in the very first iterations. By 4 steps, images diverge significantly, and by 6 steps, they change even more, indicating that additional steps introduce large variations rather than just refining details. Interestingly, Euler and Euler_a produce the best results, likely because they follow a balanced noise reduction trajectory, allowing structure to form naturally without over-smoothing or excessive deviations. Euler introduces noticeable changes between 3, 4, and 6 steps, including shifts in pose, face, and hair color, implying that it follows a latent space trajectory where small step changes can drastically impact the final result. Euler_a, being an ancestral sampler, adds controlled randomness at each step, further amplifying these changes. In contrast, LCM performs poorly with Flux 1, excessively blurring images, likely due to its tuning for models that require more iterative refinement, making it unsuitable for Flux 1‚Äôs fast-converging architecture. We observed that 4 steps often produce better images than 5 or 6 steps, as extra iterations introduce unnecessary alterations instead of improving details, reinforcing that Flux 1 is optimized for extremely low-step inference. This is a stark contrast to Stable Diffusion models like SD 1.5 or SDXL, which typically require 20‚Äì50 steps for high-quality outputs. These findings highlight that Flux 1‚Äôs unique training favors fewer steps with the right sampler, making Euler and Euler_a better choices at around 4 steps, while models like LCM fail due to excessive denoising.Denoising Schedules and Sampling IntegrationDenoising schedules define a series of noise levels that guide reverse diffusion. These schedules set discrete or continuous noise decay steps, essentially parameterizing the stochastic differential equation used to reverse the diffusion process. Discrete schedules apply abrupt noise transitions, forcing the model to rapidly shift between latent states. In contrast, smooth schedules such as karras or exponential distribute noise reduction evenly, supporting more accurate latent¬†updates.Sampling methods numerically integrate these latent trajectories. Euler-type samplers update the latent state with fixed time step approximations, benefiting from stable transitions when paired with smooth noise decay. Latent Consistency Models (LCM) depend on gradual noise reduction; abrupt schedules can induce over-smoothing and detail loss. Our observations indicate that matching a sampling method‚Äôs sensitivity to noise decay with an appropriate denoising schedule is key to preserving image structure while ensuring efficient inference.Flux.1‚Äôs behavior indicates that its training regime emphasizes rapid structure formation in early steps. Euler‚Äôs robustness across discrete, exponential, and karras schedules suggests that its integration of abrupt noise transitions still aligns well with Flux.1‚Äôs latent dynamics. LCM, being more sensitive to the noise decay, only works well with smoother schedules (exponential and karras) that provide gradual latent¬†updates.The failures with AYS and GITS imply that these schedules impose noise trajectories incompatible with Flux.1‚Äôs fast-convergence design. Their latent paths likely diverge from the model‚Äôs learned reverse diffusion trajectory, causing the state to collapse into uniform or noisy outputs rather than structured images. This sensitivity reinforces that Flux.1 is optimized for few-step denoising with specific noise decay characteristics, and departures from that‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially with schedules that enforce alternative trajectory regularity‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcan disrupt the image generation process.Flux.1 departs from prior diffusion models by leveraging a T5-style text encoder instead of CLIP, allowing it to process full sentences fluently rather than relying on discrete token hierarchies. Unlike Stable Diffusion, where Booru-style tags and keyword emphasis are required for precision, Flux.1 understands natural language natively, reducing reliance on rigid token structures. Long, descriptive prompts yield better scene coherence, material accuracy, and relational awareness than fragmented keyword¬†lists.Trigger words are optional rather than mandatory, as the model activates concepts contextually rather than requiring explicit token matching. However, structured elements‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshort modifiers or category cues‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcan refine specificity without overpowering Flux.1‚Äôs broader language comprehension. The model is particularly strong at multi-concept blending, which traditionally caused token interference in CLIP-based architectures. Negative prompting is also more effective, reducing the unintended blending of attributes.Flux.1 performs best with contextual and relational descriptions, leveraging semantic depth over isolated tokens. While Booru tags still function, hybrid prompting‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämixing structured elements with full sentences‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoffers the best balance between control and generative adaptability.LoRA functions differently in Flux.1 compared to Stable Diffusion. Since Flux.1 uses a T5-based encoder, LoRA activation does not require fixed trigger words but instead responds dynamically to natural descriptions. This allows LoRAs to integrate seamlessly into prompts without rigid dependencies.Key parameters such as network dimension, alpha scaling, and captioning density influence performance. Higher network dimension strengthens adaptation but risks overfitting, while alpha scaling balances LoRA integration with the base model. Flux.1‚Äôs LoRAs benefit from mixed captioning strategies‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävarying between short tags and natural descriptions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääensuring activation without over-constraining the generative process. Unlike SDXL, which often requires explicit weight scaling (1.2‚Äì1.5x) to activate LoRAs, Flux.1 adapts LoRA strength more organically within context, reducing the need for manual weight adjustments.To maximize LoRA performance in Flux.1, descriptive phrasing should replace rigid token triggers, using context-driven prompts to activate learned modifications naturally. Captions should balance specificity with generalization, ensuring LoRAs enhance rather than dominate the generative output.Optimization Strategies for Low-Resource InferenceQuantization is a pivotal technique in reducing model size and memory usage by lowering the precision of model weights. SDcpp supports various quantization levels, each offering a different balance between memory efficiency and image¬†quality: Reduces memory usage by approximately 75% compared to full precision (FP16) while maintaining good image quality. It introduces a slight computational overhead due to dequantization but is optimal for low-end hardware. Offers slightly better precision than Q4 at the cost of requiring twice the memory. It is suitable for systems with more VRAM where higher image fidelity is¬†desired.For lower-end hardware, Q4_K provides a good balance of speed and quality, while  is better for systems with more VRAM¬†(>16GB).Quantization Impact of Model¬†PartsWe‚Äôre loading a model, vae, clip, and t5, and can choose quantized parts for each. The model itself must be quantized due to memory constraints, but the VAE, CLIP, and T5 can remain in higher precision. We tested a q4_K model with safetensors in higher precision, and a fully quantized version where all parts were¬†q4_0.We observed a 2.5x slowdown with the fully quantized run, despite reduced memory usage. Likely due to increased dequantization overhead, precision mismatch-induced stalls, and reduced SIMD efficiency on the Apple M2. While background processes may have contributed to higher involuntary context switches (3.3M vs. 1.48M), they do not fully explain the slowdown. The quantization format (q4_K vs. q4_0) influences computational efficiency rather than raw inference speed, with q4_K employing grouped quantization, which improves data locality and reduces dequantization frequency, while q4_0 likely applies simpler per-tensor quantization, increasing compute overhead. The hybrid approach‚Äîquantizing only the diffusion model while keeping VAE, CLIP, and T5 in higher precision‚Äîseems to better utilize hardware by avoiding unnecessary precision conversion costs and leveraging FP computation optimizations. These results suggest that full quantization may degrade performance when not optimized for architectural strengths, particularly on FP-optimized hardware like the¬†M2.The sampling method determines the strategy by which noise is removed during the denoising process. Ancestral samplers introduce random variations at each step, leading to more diverse outputs, while fixed-step samplers follow a deterministic trajectory, yielding consistent results.SDcpp integrates several sampling algorithms optimized for different performance criteria: A simple and fast method effective with a lower number of denoising steps, suitable for rapid inference. Prioritizes image quality, requiring more steps and memory. It is ideal for applications where high detail is essential.Latent Consistency Models (LCM): Optimizes speed by drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps (e.g., 4‚Äì8 instead of 20‚Äì30), making it highly suitable for low-end systems. Users can specify the sampling method using the --sampling-method flag, such as --sampling-method lcm.Memory management is critical in ensuring that diffusion models run efficiently on constrained hardware. SDcpp employs several techniques to optimize memory¬†usage: By processing the VAE decoder in smaller, manageable segments, VAE tiling minimizes peak memory¬†usage. Flash Attention optimizes memory allocation during UNet computations. On CUDA-enabled GPUs, it offers significant memory savings and speed improvements. Flash Attention can be activated via the --diffusion-fa flag.In our experiments on an Apple M2, enabling --vae-tiling reduced memory usage but increased execution time, suggesting a trade-off between efficiency and speed. When --diffusion-fa (Flash Attention) was enabled, execution time did not significantly improve. The combination of both options (vae-tiling and diffusion-fa) resulted in the  but also the , confirming that while these settings help on low-VRAM devices, they introduce performance overhead. The fastest run occurred with both options disabled, though it had the highest memory footprint.Image resolution directly impacts both memory consumption and inference speed. Generating images at a resolution of 1280√ó640 requires approximately 2.5 times the memory of generating images at 512√ó512. To accommodate low-resource environments, users can opt for intermediate resolutions such as 768√ó384 or 1024√ó512, balancing image quality and computational efficiency.LoRA Delay and Conditioning Graph RecalculationWhen LoRA modules are applied, the conditioning graph must be recalculated due to LoRA‚Äôs modification of internal activations, which can reintroduce dependencies on structured tagging if the LoRA was trained on datasets requiring them. The conditioner parses and reweights prompt segments dynamically, adjusting token influence based on LoRA-induced shifts in the embedding space, ensuring compatibility between the altered diffusion model state and the input text. This recalibration process accounts for the delay seen post-LoRA application and before sampling, as the system must harmonize LoRA-induced parameter shifts with Flux.1‚Äôs inherently context-aware text encoding.Classifier-Free Guidance¬†ScaleCFG scale (Classifier-Free Guidance Scale) can be set with the --cfg-scale argument. It defaults to 7.0 and controls how strictly the model follows the text prompt, balancing adherence and creativity. Higher values (e.g., 10-15) force the model to generate images that closely match the prompt but can introduce artifacts, while lower values (e.g., 1-5) allow more randomness and artistic interpretation. It impacts performance slightly because higher CFG values increase the weight difference between conditional (prompted) and unconditional (random) predictions, requiring additional computation to balance them. However, the effect on inference speed is minor compared to factors like resolution, model architecture, and sampling¬†steps.Flux.1 seem to have been trained with  as target setting, meaning its internal weighting and contrast are optimized for that value. Lowering CFG to  reduces guidance too much, allowing excessive noise influence, resulting in darker, underexposed images. Raising it to 2.0 strengthens prompt adherence but overemphasizes highlights and contrast, making images appear overly bright. Unlike standard Stable Diffusion, where 7.0 is the default for balanced outputs, Flux.1‚Äôs tuning makes , with deviations causing unintended brightness shifts.To analyze the impact of CFG scale on image generation, we generated eight images using CFG 1.0 and 2.0 across the Euler, LCM, iPNDM, and Euler_a samplers with 4 steps and a fixed seed of 42, using the prompt ‚Äúa beautiful girl in futuristic Tokyo, neon lights,‚Äù comparing how different guidance levels influence brightness, contrast, and prompt adherence.Memory-Efficient InferenceRunning Flux.1 (schnell) on an Apple M2 (16GB RAM), we achieve inference without a GPU, completing a 256√ó256 image in 216.3s with 9.28GB RAM usage. The UNet required just 96.59MB, and VAE decoding used 416MB, demonstrating the efficiency of quantized GGUF¬†models.Our analysis of Stable-Diffusion.cpp and Flux.1 demonstrates that efficient local diffusion inference is feasible even on low-resource hardware, provided that model selection, quantization, and sampling strategies are optimized. Flux.1‚Äôs extremely low-step denoising makes it uniquely suited for fast inference, especially when paired with Euler and Euler_a samplers, which balance structure formation and controlled randomness. In contrast, models like LCM introduce excessive smoothing, making them unsuitable for Flux.1‚Äôs fast convergence.We also observed that 4 steps yield optimal results with Flux.1, as additional iterations introduce unnecessary alterations rather than improving image fidelity. While our results indicate that full quantization introduces dequantization overhead and computational stalls, external factors such as background system load may have influenced the extent of the observed slowdown. Memory-efficient techniques such as VAE tiling and Flash Attention can reduce hardware requirements but may introduce performance trade-offs. Users should select Q4_K or similar quantization for lower-end hardware, as grouped quantization schemes appear to mitigate some of the performance penalties associated with fully quantized inference.These findings highlight that with the right model architecture, quantization, and sampler choice, high-quality image generation is possible on constrained devices without relying on high-end GPUs. Future improvements may focus on further refining model architectures like Flux.1 and optimizing quantization methods for even faster, memory-efficient inference.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The ups and downs of stratified cross-validation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpK9pWZGjbE</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EpK9pWZGjbE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 11:48:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you use GridSearchCV in scikit-learn will do a cross-validated hyperparameter search.

The concepts covered here are equally applicable to other large-scale video platforms such as  and .Before diving into the design, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements.Users should be able to  video files.Uploaded videos must be  into multiple resolutions (e.g., 240p, 360p, 720p, 1080p) to support different network conditions and devices.Users should be able to  videos in real-time with adaptive bitrate streaming to adjust quality based on network conditions.Users can  for videos by title, tags, or description.Users can  and  on videos.Users should be able to create and subscribe to .Non-Functional Requirements: The system should support millions of concurrent users and thousands of video uploads per minute. Core features like video upload, playback, and search should have minimal downtime. Fast video streaming with minimal buffering and near-instantaneous search results. Video files must be stored reliably, with redundancy mechanisms to prevent data loss due to hardware failures. Optimize storage and bandwidth costs.Daily Active Users (DAU): 10 million ~100,000 videos/dayAverage Videos Watched per User per Day: 5 videos 500 MB. 1 KB.: 100,000 videos / day * 500 MB / video = 50 TB / dayDaily Video Metadata Storage: 100,000 * 1KB = 100MB / dayNetwork Bandwidth Estimation:10 million users √ó 5 videos/user = 50 million views/day Daily Bandwidth Requirements (without compression & caching) : 50 million views * 500 MB / day = 25 PB / dayGiven the high storage and bandwidth requirements, leveraging  is the most practical approach:Content Delivery Network (CDN): To cache frequently accessed videos closer to users and reduce latency.Blob Storage (e.g., AWS S3): To store video files reliably with redundancy.We can break the architecture of YouTube into two primary components:  ‚Äì Handles video playback, and delivery.Video Upload & Processing ‚Äì Manages user uploads, transcoding, and metadata storage.3.1 Video Streaming Architecture]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump‚Äôs Intelligence Pick Tulsi Gabbard Secretly Met Assad: What We Know | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bmk9b7HXBzY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 05:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahead of her U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard is facing renewed scrutiny over an unannounced trip to Syria where she met with the now-deposed dictator Bashar al-Assad twice.

  development processes, developed by Beth Andres-Beck and hir father Kent Beck.
  It posits that two communities of software developers have great difficulty
  communicating to each other because they live in very different contexts, so
  advice that applies to one sounds like nonsense to the other.The desert is the common world of software development, where bugs are
  plentiful, skill isn't cultivated, and communications with users is difficult.
  The forest is the world of a well-run team that uses something like Extreme Programming, where developers swiftly put changes into
  production, protected by their tests, code is invested in to keep it healthy,
  and there is regular contact with The Customer.Clearly Beth and Kent prefer The Forest (as do I). But the metaphor is more
  about how description of The Forest and the advice for how to work there often
  sounds nonsensical to those whose only experience is The Desert. It reminds us
  that any lessons we draw about software development practice, or architectural
  patterns, are governed by the context that we experienced them. It is possible
  to change Desert into Forest, but it's difficult - often requiring people to do
  things that are both hard and counter-intuitive. (It seems sadly easier for
  The Forest to submit to desertification.) In this framing I'm definitely a Forest Dweller, and seek with Thoughtworks
  to cultivate a healthy forest for us and our clients. I work to explain The Forest to Desert
  Dwellers, and help my fellow Forest Dwellers to make their forest even more
  plentiful.Kent Beck supplied the image, which he may have painstakingly drew pixel by
    pixel.

Join historians, survivors and experts as they consider one of the great moral dilemmas of the 20th century. Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?

In April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in ≈Ωilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.

While millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler‚Äôs account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?

German submarine, surface and air attacks were sinking merchant ships by the hundred. If those losses continued, Britain could lose a quarter of its fleet within the year and might just be starved out of the war.  
Yet, just a few years later, everything had changed. By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? 
The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. 

In this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.

Science and theology have a tumultuous history of conflict and strife on the one hand, and attempts to seek consilience and consonance on the other. Can philosophy help discern what may be true from what is clearly false? Which principles or methods of philosophy can adjudicate science vs theology?

Most legal scholars say the meaning of the 14th Amendment is clear‚Äìthat people born in the U.S. are citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. But the Trump administration‚Äôs legal case is built around the idea that children born to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be excluded from birthright citizenship.  

WSJ explains how this fight will play out in courts and its broader implications.

1720 was a year of two bubbles and a plague.  The bubbles were the Mississippi Company in France ‚Äìand the South Sea Bubble in England. In September 1720 - when the bubble burst, England was plunged into an economic and political crisis. This was one of the first examples of a financial boom and bust and was the event that gave rise to the use of the term bubble to describe a spectacular market failure.

This is something Rebellion seemed to figure out around the time of Sniper Elite 3 back in 2014, when the series ditched linear levels set in tight, wartorn streets in favor of a much deeper, wider tour of duty, with each map allowing for player choice in how they navigate the world and complete missions. The series has even gone so far as to create some absurd, Agent 47-like situations in which you can assassinate Nazis. Sniper Elite: Resistance reintroduces that tried-and-true formula for the fourth time in 11 years, and though it's still enjoyable, I can't help but notice how this campaign through the French countryside elicits such a strong sense of deja vu.Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter set during World War II, and like other games in the series, it can be played in first-person when you're aiming. The series has made a name for itself on a deep ballistic physics model that accounts for wind, bullet drop, and positioning, as well as its cherry on top: the X-ray killcam. This feature shows you, in slow-motion, how each bullet shreds Nazis in grotesque detail, inside and out. Like in other Sniper Elite games, a well-placed bullet can shoot their eyes out, explode their hearts, or even obliterate their testicles, among other special displays of sharpshooting.Like its predecessors, the game is a fun and reliable shooter when it comes to sniping mechanics, though I've grown weary of the killcam. These days, I more often skip the killcam, or at least adjust my settings to see fewer headhunting highlight reels. I get it by now; it's neat tech, but they add up over the course of a mission, which already tend to take me about two hours each, because I'm much more interested in stealthily completing my missions than watching the highlight reels of long-range vivisections.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple chips can be hacked to leak secrets from Gmail, iCloud, and more</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/newly-discovered-flaws-in-apple-chips-leak-secrets-in-safari-and-chrome/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-M3-chip-series_screen-1152x648.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 20:56:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT ‚Äì Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple-designed chips powering Macs, iPhones, and iPads contain two newly discovered vulnerabilities that leak credit card information, locations, and other sensitive data from the Chrome and Safari browsers as they visit sites such as iCloud Calendar, Google Maps, and Proton Mail.The vulnerabilities, affecting the CPUs in later generations of Apple A- and M-series chip sets, open them to side channel attacks, a class of exploit that infers secrets by measuring manifestations such as timing, sound, and power consumption.

Why was there more matter than antimatter left over? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice explore the quantum origins of the universe, charge parity violation, dark matter, and the many quarks that make up our world with CERN particle physicist Harry Cliff. 

We take a look at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and his work in studying b quarks (or ‚Äúbeauty quarks‚Äù) and sifting through mountains of data to identify new phenomena. We break down the 17 known fundamental particles‚Äîincluding six quarks, three electron-like particles, and three neutrinos. What particles are yet to be uncovered? Could that be the answer to dark matter?

As we dive into the early universe, we explore how matter and antimatter formed in nearly equal amounts, only for matter to triumph in a cosmic imbalance. What conditions created this asymmetry? We discuss CP violation and the other laws of nature that the universe may have broken to create itself. 

Harry also dives into the lifespan of particles, from the fleeting existence of most, to the surprising stability of protons and electrons. Learn how particle discoveries evolved, from Henri Becquerel‚Äôs observation of radioactivity to Karl Anderson‚Äôs discovery of antimatter in cosmic rays. We also explore how Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity applies to particle accelerators, where particles moving near light speed experience time differently. Could these machines create a micro black hole? Harry explains why media fears of ‚Äúdestroying the universe‚Äù are unfounded and why the cosmos has been conducting such experiments for billions of years.

Finally, we tackle questions about dark matter, its presence in everyday life, and the hypothetical tachyons that could travel faster than light. Through it all, Harry sheds light on the quantum fields underpinning reality, revealing how particles are ripples in these invisible forces. With insights from his books, How to Make an Apple Pie from Scratch and Space Oddities, Harry guides us through the thrilling world of particle physics, showing how much we‚Äôve learned‚Äîand how much more there is to discover.

ANIMATION CORRECTION:
At 4:52, the negative charge should be drawn on the carbon at the end of the chain, not on the second to last carbon. This also holds during the polymerization process (5:15), where the negative charge should move right to the end of the chain.

--

As of 2022, humans have deforested 17% of the Amazon, and scientists warn that we may be approaching a tipping point. It‚Äôs like removing bricks from a house: take a few and the house remains standing; remove too many and the whole thing will collapse. So, what would happen if the entire Amazon disappeared? Anna Rothschild explores the relationship between this ecosystem and the rest of the planet.

But when you look into the details, it turns out their residents may have experienced very different final moments.

But in many real-time systems, the server needs to talk first and more often.This is where  and  come into play‚Äîtwo popular methods for achieving real-time updates.In this article, we‚Äôll explore these two techniques, how they work, their pros and cons, and use cases.HTTP, the backbone of the web, follows a :The client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends a request to the server.The server processes the request and sends back a response.This model is simple and works for many use-cases, but it has limitations: With plain HTTP, the server cannot proactively push data to the client. The client has to request the data periodically. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request stands alone with no persistent connection to the server. This can be problematic if you need continuous exchange of data.To build truly real-time features‚Äîlive chat, financial tickers, or gaming updates‚Äîyou need a mechanism where the server can instantly notify the client when something changes. is a technique that mimics real-time behavior by keeping HTTP requests open until the server has data.Long Polling is an enhancement over traditional polling. In regular polling, the client repeatedly sends requests at fixed intervals (e.g., every second) to check for updates. This can be wasteful if no new data exists. Long Polling tweaks this approach: the client asks the server for data and then ‚Äúwaits‚Äù until the server has something new to return or until a timeout occurs.How Does Long Polling Work? to the server, expecting new data.Server holds the request open until it has an update or a timeout is reached.If there's new data, the server immediately responds.If there‚Äôs no new data and the timeout is reached, the server responds with an empty or minimal message.Once the client receives a response‚Äînew data or a timeout‚Äîit immediately sends a new request to the server to keep the connection loop going.Simple to implement (uses standard HTTP).Supported universally since it uses standard HTTP, and it works reliably through firewalls and proxies.Higher latency after each update (client must re-establish connection).Resource-heavy on servers (many open hanging requests).Simple chat or comment systems where real-time but slightly delayed updates (near real-time) are acceptable.Notification systems for less frequent updates (e.g., Gmail‚Äôs "new email" alert).Legacy systems where WebSockets aren‚Äôt feasible.Code Example (JavaScript) provide a full-duplex, persistent connection between the client and the server.Once established, both parties can send data to each other at any time, without the overhead of repeated HTTP requests. Client sends an HTTP request with .: If supported, the server upgrades the connection to WebSocket (switching from  to ). After the handshake, client and server keep a TCP socket open for communication.Full-Duplex Communication: Once upgraded, data can be exchanged bidirectionally in real time until either side closes the connection.Ultra-low latency (no repeated handshakes).Lower overhead since there‚Äôs only one persistent connection rather than repeated HTTP requests.Scalable for real-time applications that need to support large number of concurrent users.More complex setup (requires the client and server to support WebSocket).Some proxies and firewalls may not allow WebSocket traffic.Complexity in implementation and handling reconnections/errors.Server resource usage might grow if you have a large number of concurrent connections.Live chat and collaboration tools (Slack, Google Docs, etc.).Multiplayer online games with real-time state synchronization.Live sports/financial dashboards that need to push frequent updates.Code Example (JavaScript)Both methods achieve real-time updates, but your choice depends on your project‚Äôs requirements: is easier to implement using standard libraries. Any environment that supports HTTP can handle it, often without extra packages. require a bit more setup and a capable proxy environment (e.g., support in Nginx or HAProxy). However, many frameworks (e.g., Socket.io) simplify the process significantly.Scalability and Performance can become resource-intensive with a large number of simultaneous clients, due to multiple open connections waiting on the server side. offer a more efficient, persistent connection and scale better for heavy, frequent data streams. fits scenarios where data updates aren‚Äôt super frequent. If new data arrives every few seconds or minutes, long polling might be enough. are better for high-frequency updates or two-way communication (e.g., multiple participants editing a document or interacting in a game). typically works even in older networks or those with strict firewalls. might face issues in certain corporate or older mobile environments, though this is less of a problem as the standard becomes more widespread.While both achieve real-time communication, WebSockets are generally more efficient for truly real-time applications, while Long Polling can be simpler to implement for less demanding scenarios.1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)Allows the server to push messages to the client over HTTP.It's simpler than WebSockets for one-way communication, but not full-duplex.Best suited for use cases like news feeds, real-time notifications, and status updates.Commonly used in IoT for lightweight publish-subscribe messaging.Specialized for device-to-device or device-to-server communication with minimal overhead.3. Libraries like Socket.ioProvides an abstraction over WebSockets for easier real-time communication.Automatically falls back to long polling if WebSockets are unsupported.Ensures cross-browser compatibility with robust and reliable performance.If you found it valuable, hit a like ‚ù§Ô∏è and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The project, intended to replace a 20-year-old SAP system with a SaaS-based HR and finance system, has faced multiple setbacks, renegotiated contracts, and a new systems integrator, with completion now pushed to December 2025. The Register reports: West Sussex County Council is taking advantage of the so-called "flexible use of capital receipts scheme" introduced in 2016 by the UK government to allow councils to use money from the sale of assets such as land, offices, and housing to fund projects that result in ongoing revenue savings. An example of the asset disposals that might contribute to the project -- set to see the council move off a 20-year-old SAP system -- comes from the sale of a former fire station in Horley, advertised for $3.1 million.
 
Meanwhile, the delays to the project, which began in November 2019, forced the council to renegotiate its terms with Oracle, at a cost of $3 million. The council had expected the new SaaS-based HR and finance system to go live in 2021, and signed a five-year license agreement until June 2025. The plans to go live were put back to 2023, and in the spring of 2024 delayed again until December 2025. According to council documents published this week [PDF], it has "approved the variation of the contract with Oracle Corporation UK Limited" to cover the period from June 2025 to June 2028 and an option to extend again to the period June 2028 to 2030. "The total value of the proposed variation is $2.96 million if the full term of the extension periods are taken," the council said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Flags Linux Topics As &apos;Cybersecurity Threats&apos;</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/27/2120230/facebook-flags-linux-topics-as-cybersecurity-threats?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook has banned posts mentioning Linux-related topics, with the popular Linux news and discussion site, DistroWatch, at the center of the controversy. Tom's Hardware reports: A post on the site claims, "Facebook's internal policy makers decided that Linux is malware and labeled groups associated with Linux as being 'cybersecurity threats.' We tried to post some blurb about distrowatch.com on Facebook and can confirm that it was barred with a message citing Community Standards. DistroWatch says that the Facebook ban took effect on January 19. Readers have reported difficulty posting links to the site on this social media platform. Moreover, some have told DistroWatch that their Facebook accounts have been locked or limited after sharing posts mentioning Linux topics.
 
If you're wondering if there might be something specific to DistroWatch.com, something on the site that the owners/operators perhaps don't even know about, for example, then it seems pretty safe to rule out such a possibility. Reports show that "multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed." However, we tested a few other Facebook posts with mentions of Linux, and they didn't get blocked immediately. Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has tried to appeal against the Community Standards-triggered ban. However, they say that a Facebook representative said that Linux topics would remain on the cybersecurity filter. The DistroWatch writer subsequently got their Facebook account locked... DistroWatch points out the irony at play here: "Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers." 

UPDATE: Facebook has admited they made a mistake and stopped blocking the posts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Collaborated With The Nazis During WW2?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBZZBN2RIU0</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FBZZBN2RIU0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 22:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World War 2 created many impossible decisions for the people who fell victim to this all-consuming war.

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be ‚Äúundesirables‚Äù. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous.¬†In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration &amp; Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHWnPOKh_S0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marc Andreessen is an entrepreneur, investor, co-creator of Mosaic, co-founder of Netscape, and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had established itself as the dominant force in Asia. Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan‚Äôs national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.

In response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîthat Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. 

In War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy‚Äôs primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.

Under Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy‚Äôs long-range scouting capabilities. As "scout cruisers of the air," airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy‚Äôs first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.

In 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.

"This bill aligns Michigan with a majority of the country," according to the state's announcement, which says the bill "advances technological literacy" and ensures their students "are well-equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary for success in the workforce." 
Slashdot reader theodp writes:



From the Michigan House Fiscal Agency Analysis: "Supporters of the bill say that increasing access to computer science courses for students in schools should be a priority of the state in order to ensure that students can compete for the types of jobs that have good pay and will be needed in the coming decades." 
That analysis goes on to report that testifying in favor of the bill were tech-giant backed nonprofit Code.org (Microsoft is a $30 million Code.org donor), Amazon and AWS (Amazon is a $30+ million Code.org donor), the tech-supported Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and the lobbying organization TechNet, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and OpenAI). 
It's not clear how many high schools in Michigan are already teaching CS courses, but this still raises a popular question for discussion. Should high schools be required to teach at least one CS course?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From India to Germany - Creating a new world with good food | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4z76ynr98</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fG4z76ynr98?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 17:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Running a restaurant as an Indian woman?

She will never forget how poor her family once was, after they lost everything in a fire. She has experienced the world as fleeting and fragile. But Prateek Reen also knows that you can take a recipe with you, on a small piece of paper. A memory. The taste of freedom. And that you can use it to create a new world in a foreign country. In Germany, she did just that, with her own restaurant, called "Madam Chutney‚Äù.

Wikipedia defines ACPI as "an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components" for things like power management and putting unused hardware components to sleep. Phoronix reports:

The ACPI change worth highlighting for Linux 6.14 is switching from msleep() to usleep_range() within the acpi_os_sleep() call in the kernel. This reduces spurious sleep time due to timer inaccuracy. Linux ACPI/PM maintainer Rafael Wysocki of Intel who authored this change noted that it could "spectacularly" reduce the duration of system suspend and resume transitions on some systems... 

Rafael explained in the patch making the sleep change: 

 "The extra delay added by msleep() to the sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between 1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time values." 
One 2022 bug report complained a Dell XPS 13 using Thunderbolt took "a full 8 seconds to suspend and a full 8 seconds to resume even though no physical devices are connected." In November an Intel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list that the fix gave a Dell XPS 13 a 42% improvement in kernel resume time (from 1943ms to 1127ms).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Does Ice Float?

"[P]otential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft."

Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure... "The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok," said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. "ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership...." Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake "in the tens of billions," but the rest of the deal is in flux... 


Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as "qualified divestiture" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S... A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval. "A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control," the Congressional staffer said. "There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access...." 


Chinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions "should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles." The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.
 

"Meanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chopin&apos;s Military Hallucinations with Karina Tseng and Anthony Ratinov</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diDnVUPRaYI</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/diDnVUPRaYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 02:19:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch Karina & Anthony's full Polonaise performances:

It's the code that processes packets of network traffic, and Linux "is the most widely used OS for data center servers," according to the article:

The team tested their solution's effectiveness and submitted it to Linux for consideration, and the code was published this month as part of Linux's newest kernel, release version 6.13. "All these big companies ‚Äî Amazon, Google, Meta ‚Äî use Linux in some capacity, but they're very picky about how they decide to use it," said Martin Karsten [professor of Computer Science in the Waterloo's Math Faculty]. "If they choose to 'switch on' our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt hours of energy worldwide. Almost every single service request that happens on the Internet could be positively affected by this." 

The University of Waterloo is building a green computer server room as part of its new mathematics building, and Karsten believes sustainability research must be a priority for computer scientists. "We all have a part to play in building a greener future," he said. The Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the Linux OS, is a founder member of the Green Software Foundation, an organization set up to look at ways of developing "green software" ‚Äî code that reduces energy consumption. 

Karsten "teamed up with Joe Damato, distinguished engineer at Fastly" to develop the 30 lines of code, according to an announcement from the university. "The Linux kernel code addition developed by Karsten and Damato was based on research published in ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review" (by Karsten and grad student Peter Cai). 

Their paper "reviews the performance characteristics of network stack processing for communication-heavy server applications," devising an "indirect methodology" to "identify and quantify the direct and indirect costs of asynchronous hardware interrupt requests (IRQ) as a major source of overhead... 

"Based on these findings, a small modification of a vanilla Linux system is devised that improves the efficiency and performance of traditional kernel-based networking significantly, resulting in up to 45% increased throughput..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Navigating the Cgroup Transition: Bridging the Gap Between Kubernetes and User Expec...

Navigating the Cgroup Transition: Bridging the Gap Between Kubernetes and User Expectations - Sohan Kunkerkar, Red Hat Inc

As Kubernetes and container technologies evolve, shifting from cgroup v1 to cgroup v2 has become a pivotal development. With cgroup v2 available in Kubernetes since v1.25, we're at a crossroads where many users and organizations must decide when and how to transition fully to this new system. Despite the benefits of cgroup v2, including better resource management and enhanced capabilities, users frequently encounter unexpected challenges signaling a gap in readiness and understanding. This talk will address the practical implications of moving to cgroup v2, discuss the coordinated efforts to deprecate cgroup v1, and propose actionable strategies to bridge the gap between the Kubernetes community, system administrators, and developers. By focusing on real-world experiences and providing clear guidance, this session aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools to navigate this significant change confidently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JRE MMA Show #165 with Jiri Prochazka</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lpfgsPUMCaM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joe sits down with Ji≈ô√≠ Proch√°zka, a professional mixed martial artist currently competing in the Light Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.

Is consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it‚Äôs so hard to pin down what makes you ‚Äúyou.‚Äù From Descartes‚Äô ‚Äúbeast machines‚Äù to Darwin‚Äôs revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. 

Will AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness‚Äîor even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids‚Äîtiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us‚Äîand why it matters.

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail‚Äôs symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We‚Äôll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We‚Äôll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to ‚Äúeat‚Äù SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores in different places, but to build a single, cross-platform store in which, within the era of multi-platform games, if you buy a game or digital items in one place, you have the ability to own them everywhere," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters during a press briefing. The Verge reports: Under the program, Epic will offer new free games in the store each month before eventually switching to a weekly schedule. However, the games aren't actually in the store yet -- Epic said on Thursday that it "ran into a few bugs that we're working through now" and "we'll provide an update once the games are live and ready to play!"
 
To sweeten the deal for developers that participate in the free games program on iOS, Epic will help defray the cost of using third-party marketplaces. For one year, it will pay these developers' Core Technology Fee (CTF): a 50 euro cent fee levied on every install of an iOS app that uses third-party stores after it exceeds 1 million annual downloads. (Apple gives developers with less than 10 million euros in global revenue a three-year on-ramp.) [...] Epic writes in its blog post that covering the fee "is not financially viable for every third party app store or for Epic long term, but we'll do it while the European Commission investigates Apple's non-compliance with the law."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Panama Canal</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-panama-canal</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/679116867e5a4982476a84b0/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=awug-Mo6-Ic-lR51OOIDX5aFz_rgMofpwEwQhaVnSlM" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the history of the Panama Canal and why does Trump think he can 'take it back'? Dan is joined by Professor Julie Greene to delve into the long backstory of this 50-mile waterway that changed the world. Its journey from concept to completion was fraught as many nations sought to build it over several centuries, with the US eventually taking up the costly task in the 1900s. During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it. Total control was handed over to Panama in the 1990s.Better understand the headlines with this deep dive into history.You can learn more in Julie's books 'Archival Secrets, Caribbean Workers, and the Panama Canal' and 'The Canal Builders.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Adds Support For The Microsoft Copilot Key Found On New Laptops</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2333254/linux-614-adds-support-for-the-microsoft-copilot-key-found-on-new-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux 6.14 kernel now maps out support for Microsoft's "Copilot" key "so that user-space software can determine the behavior for handling that key's action on the Linux desktop," writes Phoronix's Michael Larabel.

One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what‚Äôs known in the business as a ‚Äúmagic packet.‚Äù On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network‚Äôs Junos OS has been doing just that.J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that‚Äôs encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumen Technology‚Äôs Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why So Many Ancient Civilizations Collapsed At The Same Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8YQuyjWks</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1l8YQuyjWks?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bronze Age collapse is perhaps one of the greatest disasters in human history and also one of the least understood.

--

Moore‚Äôs Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore‚Äôs Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIsHTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:It‚Äôs essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.2. REST is Resource-OrientedIn RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).‚Üí A collection (or list) of books ‚Üí A specific book with ID 123An  is a combination of:An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)A resource URI (, )Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource. ‚Üí Fetch all books ‚Üí Create a new book ‚Üí Delete the book with ID 123Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API ResponsesEach API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.Common status codes include:: The request was successfully received and processed.: The request succeeded.: A new resource was successfully created.: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).: There was an error in the request sent by the client.: The request was malformed or invalid.: Authentication is required or has failed.: The client does not have permission to access the resource.: The requested resource does not exist.: Rate limit exceeded.: The server encountered an error while processing the request.500 Internal Server Error: A general error occurred on the server.: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.1. Define Clear Resource Naming ConventionsUsing a consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.GET /getAllUsers
POST /createNewOrder
DELETE /removeProduct/123GET /users
POST /orders
DELETE /products/123]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Love letter from 1940&apos;s that Amy Tan&apos;s dad sent to her mom ü•∞ #FindingYourRoots #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ifdDk5LMJs</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-ifdDk5LMJs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Henry Louis Gates, Jr. shares with Amy Tan the love letters from her father to her mother written in the 1940's which researchers found in Shanghai court archives.

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

Here are some of them:The risk of error increases if a single authority decides the moderation policies.There‚Äôs a risk of bias when a single authority makes moderation decisions.Managing moderation at scale needs a lot of effort; it becomes a bottleneck.So they set up Bluesky: a research initiative to build a decentralized social network.A decentralized architecture distributes control across many servers.Here are 3 popular decentralized architectures in distributed systems:Federated architecture: client-server model; but different people run parts of the system and parts communicate with each other.Peer-to-Peer architecture: there‚Äôs no difference between client and server; each device acts as both.Blockchain architecture: distributed ledger for consensus and trustless interactions between servers.Bluesky uses a federated architecturefor its familiar client-server model, reliability, and convenience. So each server could be run by different people and servers communicate with each other over HTTP.Think of the federated network as email; a person with Gmail can communicate with someone using Protonmail.Yet building a decentralized social network at scale is difficult.So smart engineers at Bluesky used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):They created a decentralized open-source framework to build social networking apps, called Authenticated Transfer Protocol (), and built Bluesky on top of it.Put simply, Bluesky doesn‚Äôt run separate servers; instead, ATProto servers distribute messages to each other.A user‚Äôs data is shared across apps built on ATProto; Bluesky is one of the apps. So if a user switches between apps on ATProto, such as a photo-sharing app or blogging app, they don‚Äôt lose their followers (social graph).Imagine ATProto as Disneyland Park and Bluesky as one of its attractions. A single ticket is enough to visit all the attractions in the park. And if you don‚Äôt like one of the attractions, try another one in the park.Here‚Äôs how Bluesky works:A post is a short status update by a user; it includes text and images. The text content and timestamp of the post are stored in a . Think of the repository as a collection of data published by a single user.SQLite is used as its data layer for simplicity; each repository gets a separate SQLite database.The data records are encoded in CBOR, a compact binary format, before storing it in SQLite for low costs.Repositories of different users are stored on a ; they set up many data servers for scale.A data server exposes HTTP to handle client requests. Put simply, the data server acts as a proxy for all client interactions. Also it manages user authentication and authorization. The data server includes tooling to automatically apply updates in the federated architecture.They run 6 million user repositories on a single data server at 150 USD per month.Think of the user repository as a Git repo and the data server as GitHub. It‚Äôs easy to move a Git repo from GitHub to GitLab. Similarly, a user repository is movable from one data server to another.Besides it‚Äôs possible to use alternative clients for Bluesky. Yet it‚Äôs necessary to maintain a standard data schema for interactions. So separate  and API endpoints are defined for each app on ATProto, including Bluesky.A user's repository doesn‚Äôt store information about actions performed by their followers such as comments or likes on their post. Instead, it‚Äôs stored only in the repository of the follower who took the action.A post is shown to the user‚Äôs followers.Yet it‚Äôs expensive to push updates to each follower‚Äôs repository. So information is collected from every data server using the .The crawler doesn‚Äôt index data but forwards it.The crawler subscribes for updates on the data server: new posts, likes, or comments.The data server notifies the crawler about updates in real time over websockets.The crawler collects information from data servers and generates a .Consider the generated stream as a log over websockets; put simply, the crawler combines each user‚Äôs actions into a single TCP connection.A user's post is shown to followers only after counting the likes, comments, and reposts on it.Yet the stream doesn‚Äôt contain this information. So the stream‚Äôs data is aggregated using the ; it transforms raw data into a consumable form by processing it. Imagine the index server as a data presentation layer.The index server is built using the Go language for concurrency. A NoSQL database, ScyllaDB, is used as its data layer for horizontal scalability.A reference to the user's post ID is added to the follower‚Äôs repository when they like or repost a post. So the total number of likes and reposts is calculated by crawling every user repository and adding the numbers.Here‚Äôs the workflow for displaying a post:A user‚Äôs request is routed via their data server to the index server.The data server finds the people a user follows by looking at their repository.The index server creates a list of post IDs in reverse chronological order.The index server expands the list of post IDs to full posts with content.The index server then responds to the client.In short, a user repository stores primary data, while the index server stores derived data from repositories.The index server is the most read-heavy service; so, its results are cached using Redis, an in-memory storage, for performance.JSON Web Token () is used for authentication between Bluesky services.Media files, such as images and videos, are stored on the data server‚Äôs disk for simplicity. A cryptographic ID () is used to reference the media files in the repository. The index server fetches the media files from the data server on user request and caches them on the content delivery network () for efficiency.A user updates only their repository when they follow someone. Their repository adds a reference to the user‚Äôs unique decentralized identifier () to indicate follow.The number of followers for a user is found by indexing every repository. This is similar to how Google finds inbound links to a web page; all documents on the web are crawled.A user account includes a handle based on the domain name (); it keeps things simple.And each user automatically gets a handle from the ‚Äòbsky.social‚Äô subdomain upon account creation. Yet posts are stored using DID, and the user handle is displayed along with the posts. So changes to a user's handle don‚Äôt affect their previous posts.A user‚Äôs DID is immutable, but the handle is mutable; put simply, a user‚Äôs handle is reassignable to a custom domain name.Here‚Äôs how a user handle with a custom domain name is verified on Bluesky:The user enters their custom domain name in the Bluesky account settings.Bluesky generates a unique text value for the user: public key.The user stores this value in the DNS TXT record of the custom domain name.The index server then periodically checks the DNS TXT record and validates the user handle. Imagine  as a text data field for domain name settings.3. User Timeline and FeedA user‚Äôs timeline is created by arranging their posts in reverse chronological order.Yet a user‚Äôs repository doesn‚Äôt contain information about likes and comments received on a post. So the request is sent to the index server; it returns the user‚Äôs timeline with aggregated data.A feed is created from posts by people a user follows.Bluesky supports feeds with custom logic, and there are 50K+ custom feeds available. Consider the  as a filter for a specific list of keywords or users.The crawler generates a stream from data servers.The feed generator filters, sorts, and ranks the content based on custom logic.The feed generator creates a list of post IDs.The index server then populates the feed‚Äôs content on a user request. is used to fetch the feed; it offers better performance. It includes an extra parameter in API requests and responses. The cursor parameter points to a specific item in the dataset; for example, the post‚Äôs timestamp to fetch feed until a specific post.A sequential unique column, such as the post's timestamp, is chosen for pagination.The user requests include the cursor parameter to indicate the result‚Äôs offset.The index server uses the cursor parameter to paginate the result dataset.The index server responds with the cursor parameter for future requests.The client decides the cursor parameter‚Äôs window size based on its viewport. The cursor-based pagination scales well as it prevents a full table scan in the index server.Imagine a  as metadata to categorize content. Besides it‚Äôs possible to apply a label manually. A user chooses to hide or show a warning for posts with a specific label.This preference is stored on their data server.Here‚Äôs how Bluesky moderation works:The moderation service consumes the stream from the crawler.The moderation service analyzes the content and assigns a label to it.The index server stores the content along with its label.The user requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The data server includes label IDs in HTTP request headers before forwarding them.The index server applies the label setting in the response.Also a data server operator does basic moderation. The data server filters out the muted users before responding to the client.Put simply, a user can post about anything, but the content is moderated before being shown to the public.Bluesky allows a user to see how many people they follow also follow a specific user: social proof.For example, when I visit Jay‚Äôs Bluesky profile, it shows how many people I follow also follow her.Let‚Äôs dive into the different approaches they used to build this feature.Find the people I follow by querying the database.Do separate parallel queries for each user to find the people they follow.Check if any of them also follow Jay.But this approach won‚Äôt scale as the number of parallel queries increases with the number of people a user follows.A scalable approach is to convert it into a set intersection problem:Set 1 tracks the people I follow.Set 2 tracks the people who follow Jay.The intersection of these sets gives the expected result.An in-memory graph service prevents expensive database queries and performs intersections quickly. Yet Redis Sets don‚Äôt use different CPU cores at once. So here‚Äôs how they implemented a minimum viable product:Each user has a 32-character DID.The DID values are converted into uint64 to reduce memory usage.Each user‚Äôs DID maintains 2 sets: people they follow and people who follow them.But it still consumes a lot of memory and takes extra time to start.So they optimized the graph service by implementing it using Roaring Bitmaps.Yet let‚Äôs take a step back and learn Bitmaps to better understand Roaring Bitmaps.A  represents binary states using bit arrays.Imagine Bluesky has only 100 users.The index value of the people I follow is set to 1 on the Bitmap; the people I follow are then found by walking the Bitmap and recording the index of non-zero bits. A constant time lookup tells whether I follow a specific user. Although Bitmaps do faster bitwise operations, it‚Äôs inefficient for sparse data. A 100-bit long Bitmap is needed even if I follow only a single user; so, it won‚Äôt scale for Bluesky‚Äôs needs.It turns consecutive 0s and 1s into a number for reduced storage. For example, if I follow the last 10 users, only the last 10 indices are marked by 1. With Run-Length Encoding, it‚Äôs stored as 90 0s and 10 1s, thus low storage costs.But this approach won‚Äôt scale for randomly populated data, and a lookup walks the entire Bitset to find an index.Ready for the best technique? .Think of it as compressed Bitmaps, but 100 times faster. A Roaring Bitmap splits data into containers and each container uses a different storage mechanism.The dense data is stored in a container using Bitmap; it uses a fixed-size bit array.The data with a large contiguous range of integers are stored in a container using run-length encoding; which reduces storage costs.The sparse data is stored in a container as integers in a sorted array; it reduces storage needs.Put simply, Roaring Bitmaps use different containers based on data sparsity.The set intersection is done in parallel and a container is converted into a different format for the set intersection. Also the graph data is stored and transferred over the network in Roaring Bitmap‚Äôs serialization format.Many instances of graph service are run for high availability and rolling updates.Bluesky supports short videos up to 90 seconds long.The video is streamed through HTTP Live Streaming (). Think of HLS as a group of text files; it‚Äôs a standard for adaptive bitrate video streaming.A client dynamically changes video quality based on network conditions.A video is encoded into different quality levels: 480p, 720p, 1080p, and so on.Each encoded video is split into small segments of 5 seconds long.The client checks the network conditions and requests video segments of the right quality.HLS uses Playlist files to manage encoded video segments. Imagine the  as a text file, and there are 2 types of Playlists:Master playlist: list of all video quality levels available.Media playlist: list of all video segments for a specific video quality.First, the client downloads the Master playlist to find available quality levels. Second, it selects a Media playlist based on network conditions. Third, it downloads the video segments in the sequence defined on the Media playlist.The videos and playlists are cached in CDN to reduce costs and handle bandwidth needs. The stream requests are routed to CDN via 302 HTTP redirects.The video views are tracked by counting requests to its Master playlist file.And the response for the Master playlist includes a Session ID; it‚Äôs included in future requests for Media playlists to track the user session.Besides the video seconds watched by a user are found by checking the last fetched video segment.A video subtitle is stored in text format and has a separate Media playlist file.The Master playlist includes a reference to subtitles; here‚Äôs how it works:The client finds the available subtitles by querying the Master playlist.The client downloads a specific subtitle's Media playlist based on the language selected by the user.The client then downloads the subtitle segments defined in the Media Playlist.Subscribe to get simplified system design case studies delivered to your inbox:Bluesky Quality AttributesA user‚Äôs data is cryptographically signed before saving it in the data server; it shows data authorship.The Merkle search tree is used to check the integrity of data, such as posts, transferred over the network.Think of the  as an efficient data structure to check data integrity. It doesn‚Äôt store original data; instead, it has only cryptographic hashes representing data.Besides the crawler keeps a copy of each user‚Äôs repository; it verifies the Merkle search tree signatures on data updates.The crawler generates a stream to update the index server.Yet the stream increases bandwidth and infrastructure costs. So the events are validated on the crawler and services, such as the feed generator, are connected to a trusted crawler. Besides Merkle search tree blocks are converted to JSON objects, which lack verifiability and signatures, to reduce stream size.Put simply, Merkle search tree verification overhead is avoided by consuming the stream from a trustable crawler.The crawler transfers the stream to the index server over websockets; zstd compresses websocket traffic for performance.A user, with a massive following, needs a data server with only tiny computing resources as the index server displays aggregated data.Every change to a user's profile is propagated via the index server; which, means eventual consistency.Yet a user viewing their profile right after an update should see the latest changes. So Bluesky offers read-after-write consistency for profile updates; here‚Äôs how:All client requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The response headers from the index server are compared against the data server. The response is updated to include missing records before returning it to the client.This read-after-write behavior applies only to a user viewing their profile; others see the changes eventually.A popular user's post notifies many users, which results in many requests to view the post at once.The results from the index server are cached to reduce the database load. Yet a popular user's post creates a thundering herd problem.A view request, the first one, from a follower reaches the cache server.The cache server queries the database for post content.Requests from others reach the database while the cache waits for the first response.It groups requests for the same data within a short period. Then forwards only a single request to the database; thus, preventing the thundering herd problem.The data server notifies the crawler about data changes in repositories over websockets.Yet network interruptions occur, so the crawler periodically checks repositories. It then compares the data against its local replica to find data changes.Also requests are rate-limited to keep the system operational.HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) is returned in response headers when the rate limit threshold is exceeded. Interactions between servers are also rate-limited to avoid abuse in the decentralized architecture. A new data server‚Äôs request limit capacity is increased over time, based on trust, to keep the crawler running smoothly.Besides a user is only allowed up to 1,666 requests an hour to reduce bot activity.Bluesky has more than 28 million users; it became an independent company in 2021.Although anybody can host a server on ATProto, most Bluesky services are now run by a single company.ATProto and Bluesky look like an interesting new approach to social networks.üëã  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.This is the first deep dive article in this newsletter; it's a free preview.Yet future deep dives, starting this February, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be way higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price."This newsletter gave me ideas on how to build scalable systems."

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate‚Äã

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump‚Äôs felony conviction in a ‚Äúhush money‚Äù case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden‚Äôs exit from the race just four months before the election, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs Comeback‚Äù tells the story of Trump‚Äôs return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump‚Äôs comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE‚Äôs vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump‚Äôs 2024 election victory.

‚ÄúIn the scope of American history, it‚Äôs almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump‚Äôs life, it‚Äôs kind of routine,‚Äù Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. ‚ÄúThe story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs Comeback‚Äù is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

He will be succeeded by Nikki Santoro, who has served as the chief operating officer since 2021. TechCrunch reports: Santoro's appointment is significant, as she is the first woman to become the CEO and only the second person to hold the position. Needham founded IMDb in 1990 at the age of 23, steering the company into a powerhouse within the entertainment industry. After 35 years, he'll transition to a new role as executive chair.
 
According to Needham, Santoro's ascension is well deserved. [...] Santoro has been with the company since 2016, leading the company in expanding its database and improving its IMDbPro membership. She previously held leadership positions at Amazon, Microsoft, and The Weather Channel. "Nikki's strategic vision, deep understanding of our customers and products, and commitment to innovation have already delivered impressive business results during her tenure as COO," said Needham in a statement. "Her track record of driving growth and enhancing our products and services makes her the ideal person to guide IMDb into a new era."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How WW1 Inspired The Lord of The Rings</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/tolkien-in-the-trenches-how-ww1-shaped-lord-of-the-rings</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6746005578f05cc6cc55e5d4/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=BhhPK2bfU_hyRBJ8-JYzfJGAC_5vwJ7LDRNuGzt_o38" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:30:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After Hitler: The Cleanup That Followed WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTRLhs9tI70</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gTRLhs9tI70?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This documentary tells the story of the clean-up that followed WW2.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.Alongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models‚Äîwhich can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware‚Äîhave lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump‚Äôs Road from Jan. 6 Back to the White House | Trump&apos;s Comeback | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7UMDHz3Qc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JS7UMDHz3Qc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a second Trump presidency seemed out of the question to many.

--

In 1968, the American Heart Association made an announcement that would influence people‚Äôs diets for decades: they recommended that people avoid eating more than three eggs a week. Their reasoning was that the cholesterol packed into egg yolks could increase cardiovascular disease risk. So, what exactly is cholesterol? And is it actually bad for you? Hei Man Chan digs into this complex molecule.

Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request. are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.The backend APIs handle , but they ‚Äîwhich isn't practical for everyday users. That‚Äôs why companies build a frontend (user interface) on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .1. Open APIs (Public APIs)Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.Example: YouTube Data APINormally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with "machine learning tutorial" as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links.This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.2. Internal APIs (Private APIs), also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.Let‚Äôs take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into smaller, manageable services, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.The first two types of APIs we discussed‚ÄîOpen APIs and Internal APIs‚Äîare functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.But there‚Äôs another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).These APIs don‚Äôt connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.Python‚Äôs built-in list APIWhen working with lists, Python provides a set of built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data.numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list  fruits = ["apple", "banana"] fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element  fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last elementInstead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.APIs communicate using different protocols and architectures that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.1. REST (Representational State Transfer)REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is lightweight, stateless, and scalable, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.Example: REST API for a BookstoreRetrieve a list of books (GET Request):GET https://api.bookstore.com/books[   { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },   { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" } ]2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)SOAP is an older API communication method that relies on XML-based messaging. Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.SOAP messages are sent using  and require a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service Fetching account balance<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">    <soapenv:Header/>    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalance>          <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>       </bank:GetAccountBalance>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>          <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>       </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can fetch all necessary data in a single request.Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.{   user(id: 123) {     name     email     posts {       title       likes     }   } }{   "data": {     "user": {       "name": "Alice",       "email": "alice@example.com",       "posts": [         { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },         { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }       ]     }   } }gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance API communication method that uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.Here‚Äôs a guide on how to find, access, and interact with an API step by step:Step 1: Find an API to UseBefore using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.Official API Documentation:Step 2: Read the API DocumentationAPI documentation explains how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats.The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY: City name (e.g., ): API Key (required for access)Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.Common Authentication Methods:A unique key provided by the API serviceSecure login via Google, Github, etc.Token-based authenticationUsername + password (Base64 encoded)Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.Go to the  section and generate a key.Use the API key in requests:GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEYStep 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURLBefore writing code,  to see how it responds.Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)Click , enter the API endpoint URL (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY).Select  as the HTTP method.Click  and view the response in .Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)You can also test APIs directly from the  using .curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Write Code to Call the APINow that you‚Äôve tested the API, it‚Äôs time to integrate it into your application.Example: Calling an API in Pythonimport requests  url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY" response = requests.get(url)  if response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}¬∞C") else:     print("Error:", response.status_code) ‚Äì Sends an API request. ‚Äì Converts response to JSON.if response.status_code == 200 ‚Äì Checks if the request was successful.Step 6: Handle Errors & Rate LimitsAPIs don‚Äôt always return perfect responses. You should handle: (e.g., wrong city name). (e.g., expired API keys). (e.g., exceeding request limits).Example: Handling API Errors in Pythonif response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}") elif response.status_code == 401:     print("Error: Invalid API key") elif response.status_code == 404:     print("Error: City not found") else:     print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")Step 7: Use API Responses in Your ApplicationOnce you fetch data from an API, you can display it dynamically in a web or mobile app. You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.Fetch live weather data from the API.Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.If you found it valuable, hit a like ‚ù§Ô∏è and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture:
Enhancements.In this SIG Architecture spotlight we talked with Kirsten
Garrison, lead of the Enhancements subproject.The Enhancements subprojectFrederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the Enhancements
subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.: I‚Äôm a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and
currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with
the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release
team,
eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I
worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in
process) based on my team‚Äôs experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and
contributing to the Subproject‚Äôs work.FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of
intervention?FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily
involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren‚Äôt aware of it?: Every release, the SIGs let the
Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned
above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors
must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move
through 3
phases:
alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP
template
has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed
discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and
performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review
team and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is
looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and
performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and
merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most
significant improvements of that approach?: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on
the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way
to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP
process is communication and consideration.To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP
template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the
k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a
directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with
Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted
today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process
in place over time.As Kubernetes matures, we‚Äôve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single
feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user
expectations. And as we‚Äôve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The
addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements
(varying at different stages of a KEP‚Äôs lifecycle).: We‚Äôre currently working on two things:Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for
significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to
support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so
will only encourage more discussion and transparency. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we
believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with
a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we
believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were
introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was
this a particular area of focus for the subproject?: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team‚Äôs Enhancement team in the migration away
from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has
always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition
to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads "opt-in" KEPs for release tracking. This
helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken
on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid
introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the
Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection
process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native
labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards.FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the
Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it‚Äôs important to give careful consideration to
decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to
give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the
Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a
great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in
the KEP process!FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the
required skills for participating in the sub-project?: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the
kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take
it from there.FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to
share with our readers?: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires
enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it
successful. I‚Äôm thankful and inspired by everyone‚Äôs continued hard work and dedication to making the
project great. This is truly a wonderful community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make computing personal again (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/128</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/128/changelog-news-128.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Benj Edwards wants to put the ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù back in ‚Äúpersonal computer‚Äù, the answer.ai folks took Devin for a month-long spin, Asaf Zamir explains why senior engineers can remain ICs and still have a fulfilling career, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti rethinks documentation by putting user actions first & Tero Piirainen lays out his case for Nue, the standards first web framework.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Phoronix says the release has "plenty of fine features":
Linux 6.13 comes with the introduction of the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver for benefiting multi-CCD Ryzen X3D processors. The new AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" server processors will now default to AMD P-State rather than ACPI CPUFreq for better power efficiency.... 
Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more.
 
Phoronix notes that Linux 6.13 also brings "the start of Intel Xe3 graphics bring-up, support for many older (pre-M1) Apple devices like numerous iPads and iPhones, NVMe 2.1 specification support, and AutoFDO and Propeller optimization support when compiling the Linux kernel with the LLVM Clang compiler." 

And some lucky Linux kernel developers will also be getting a guitar pedal soldered by Linus Torvalds himself, thanks to a generous offer he announced a week ago:

For _me_ a traditional holiday activity tends to be a LEGO build or two, since that's often part of the presents... But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds ("LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron"). Not because I play guitar, but because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing"... 
[S]ince I don't actually have any _use_ for the resulting pedals (I've already foisted off a few only unsuspecting victims^Hfriends), I decided that I'm going to see if some hapless kernel developer would want one.... as an admittedly pretty weak excuse to keep buying and building kits... 

"It may be worth noting that while I've had good success so far, I'm a software person with a soldering iron. You have been warned... [Y]ou should set your expectations along the lines of 'quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charlemagne</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/charlemagne</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67892eb0c2824244c27b929f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=3pCPGiAXWzux-J-3YCe1OwbmIbvcy6B9C-AaxFO1HJk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jennifer Burns: Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, Economics, Capitalism, Freedom | Lex Fridman Podcast #457</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Rz-4ulRKnz4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:27:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jennifer Burns is a historian of ideas, focusing on the evolution of economic, political, and social ideas in the United States in the 20th century.

But now it can do it even better, explains Marco Ippolito of the Node.js steering committee:

In August 2024 Node.js introduced a new experimental feature, Type Stripping, aimed at addressing a longstanding challenge in the Node.js ecosystem: running TypeScript with no configuration. Enabled by default in Node.js v23.6.0, this feature is on its way to becoming stable. 


TypeScript has reached incredible levels of popularity and has been the most requested feature in all the latest Node.js surveys. Unlike other alternatives such as CoffeeScript or Flow, which never gained similar traction, TypeScript has become a cornerstone of modern development. While it has been supported in Node.js for some time through loaders, they relied heavily on configuration and user libraries. This reliance led to inconsistencies between different loaders, making them difficult to use interchangeably. The developer experience suffered due to these inconsistencies and the extra setup required... The goal is to make development faster and simpler, eliminating the overhead of configuration while maintaining the flexibility that developers expect... 

TypeScript is not just a language, it also relies on a toolchain to implement its features. The primary tool for this purpose is tsc, the TypeScript compiler CLI... Type checking is tightly coupled to the implementation of tsc, as there is no formal specification for how the language's type system should behave. This lack of a specification means that the behavior of tsc is effectively the definition of TypeScript's type system. tsc does not follow semantic versioning, so even minor updates can introduce changes to type checking that may break existing code. Transpilation, on the other hand, is a more stable process. It involves converting TypeScript code into JavaScript by removing types, transforming certain syntax constructs, and optionally "downleveling" the JavaScript to allow modern syntax to execute on older JavaScript engines. Unlike type checking, transpilation is less likely to change in breaking ways across versions of tsc. The likelihood of breaking changes is further reduced when we only consider the minimum transpilation needed to make the TypeScript code executable ‚Äî and exclude downleveling of new JavaScript features not yet available in the JavaScript engine but available in TypeScript... 

Node.js, before enabling it by default, introduced --experimental-strip-types. This mode allows running TypeScript files by simply stripping inline types without performing type checking or any other code transformation. This minimal technique is known as Type Stripping. By excluding type checking and traditional transpilation, the more unstable aspects of TypeScript, Node.js reduces the risk of instability and mostly sidesteps the need to track minor TypeScript updates. Moreover, this solution does not require any configuration in order to execute code... Node.js eliminates the need for source maps by replacing the removed syntax with blank spaces, ensuring that the original locations of the code and structure remain intact. It is transparent ‚Äî the code that runs is the code the author wrote, minus the types... 

"As this experimental feature evolves, the Node.js team will continue collaborating with the TypeScript team and the community to refine its behavior and reduce friction. You can check the roadmap for practical next steps..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Horrifying Things We Used To Use As Medicine</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qwdBt9ZBr8</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6qwdBt9ZBr8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It‚Äôs hard to imagine a world where illnesses were treated with things like rushing currents or leeches, but not so long ago, that was the case.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

The findings appear in a pre-print paper titled "How is Google using AI for internal code migrations?" The Register reports: Their focus is on bespoke AI tools developed for specific product areas, such as Ads, Search, Workspace and YouTube, instead of generic AI tools that provide broadly applicable services like code completion, code review, and question answering. Google's code migrations involved: changing 32-bit IDs in the 500-plus-million-line codebase for Google Ads to 64-bit IDs; converting its old JUnit3 testing library to JUnit4; and replacing the Joda time library with Java's standard java.time package. The int32 to int64 migration, the Googlers explain, was not trivial as the IDs were often generically defined (int32_t in C++ or Integer in Java) and were not easily searchable. They existed in tens of thousands of code locations across thousands of files. Changes had to be tracked across multiple teams and changes to class interfaces had to be considered across multiple files. "The full effort, if done manually, was expected to require hundreds of software engineering years and complex crossteam coordination," the authors explain.
 
For their LLM-based workflow, Google's software engineers implemented the following process. An engineer from Ads would identify an ID in need of migration using a combination of code search, Kythe, and custom scripts. Then an LLM-based migration toolkit, triggered by someone knowledgeable in the art, was run to generate verified changes containing code that passed unit tests. Those changes would be manually checked by the same engineer and potentially corrected. Thereafter, the code changes would be sent to multiple reviewers who are responsible for the portion of the codebase affected by the changes. The result was that 80 percent of the code modifications in the change lists (CLs) were purely the product of AI; the remainder were either human-authored or human-edited AI suggestions.
 
"We discovered that in most cases, the human needed to revert at least some changes the model made that were either incorrect or not necessary," the authors observe. "Given the complexity and sensitive nature of the modified code, effort has to be spent in carefully rolling out each change to users." Based on this, Google undertook further work on LLM-driven verification to reduce the need for detailed review. Even with the need to double-check the LLM's work, the authors estimate that the time required to complete the migration was reduced by 50 percent. With LLM assistance, it took just three months to migrate 5,359 files and modify 149,000 lines of code to complete the JUnit3-JUnit4 transition. Approximately 87 percent of the code generated by AI ended up being committed with no changes. As for the Joda-Java time framework switch, the authors estimate a time saving of 89 percent compared to the projected manual change time, though no specifics were provided to support that assertion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Other people&apos;s robots (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/76</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/76/changelog--friends-76.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod & Adam discuss Nvidia‚Äôs recently announced personal AI supercomputer, Waymo‚Äôs latest infinite loop, what‚Äôs involved in getting a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù terminal setup, and whether or not AI has gone mainstream‚Ä¶ warts & all!Changelog++ members get a bonus 8 minutes at the end of this episode and zero ads.

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today‚Ä¶. and cost nothing to visit.

Dark matter has eluded us for many decades. Even our most advanced particle colliders and sophisticated underground detectors have come up short. But it may be that we can finally solve this mystery with a much simpler experiment, involving a ray of light, a good clock, and the planet Mars.

First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year.This raises the price of a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription from $7 a month or $70 a year to $10 and $100; a family subscription goes from $10 a month or $100 a year to $13 a month or $130 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews.Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch "for a limited time." "Classic" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the "services & subscriptions" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Slashes Google&apos;s Code Migration Time By Half</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/16/1810253/ai-slashes-googles-code-migration-time-by-half?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:51:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has cut code migration time in half by deploying AI tools to assist with large-scale software updates, according to a new research paper from the company's engineers.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth‚Äôs most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans‚Äî though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it‚Äôs allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI‚Äîshort for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface‚Äîthe successor to the BIOS that‚Äôs responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Forensics with Emre Tinaztepe</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/16/digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2585624665.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital forensics is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting electronic data for investigative purposes.

It wasn‚Äôt a subject covered in college, and I had no prior experience building scalable systems.But, over time, I realized that you don‚Äôt need professional experience with distributed systems to pass system design interviews.Even experienced engineers often find these interviews challenging because the format is unique and requires a specific approach.The good news is that once you understand the , the , and , and learn how to connect them effectively, system design interviews become far less intimidating.In this article, I‚Äôll share  that improved my system design interview skills and made it significantly easier‚Äîand hopefully, they‚Äôll do the same for you.In a system design interview, the interviewer evaluates your ability to , , and .Here‚Äôs what they are looking for: Can you ask the right questions to clarify functional and non-functional requirements? Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here‚Äôs a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven‚Äôt included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don‚Äôt want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the ‚Äîthe  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system‚Äôs objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages. Messages should appear in real-time for recipients.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Record of Their Time (RA Winter Lecture)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrTliHUt6k</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qHrTliHUt6k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 02:57:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Speakers: Dr Krysten Blackstone, Lecturer in International and Military History, University of Salford and Jonathan Jeffries

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place ‚Äì soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.

It is a popular tool for sending or receiving files, making backups, or setting up mirrors. It minimizes data copied by transferring only the changed parts of files, making it faster and more bandwidth-efficient than traditional copying methods provided by tools like sftp or ftp-ssl. Rsync versions 3.3.0 and below has been found with SIX serious vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these to leak your data, corrupt your files, or even take over your system. There is a heap-based buffer overflow with a CVSS score of 9.8 that needs to be addressed on both the client and server sides of rsync package. Apart from that info leak via uninitialized stack contents defeats ASLR protection and rsync server can make client write files outside of destination directory using symbolic links.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2257 - Bryan Callen</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSGaYEAJMw</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qOSGaYEAJMw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bryan Callen is an actor, comedian, and podcaster.

This is useful when you frequently connect to the same server using SSH protocol for remote login, server management, using IT automation tools over SSH or even running hourly backups. However, sometimes your SSH command (client) will not respond or get hung up on the session when using multiplexing. Typically, this happens when your public IP changes (IPv4 to IPv6 changes when using DNS names), VPN issues, or firewall cuts connections. Hence, knowing SSH client control commands can save you time and boost your productivity when such gotchas occur. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parallels Can Now Run x86 Windows and Linux On Apple Silicon Mac</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/15/0216248/parallels-can-now-run-x86-windows-and-linux-on-apple-silicon-mac?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop now supports running 64-bit x86 operating systems on Apple Silicon Macs through its proprietary emulation engine, enabling users to run traditional Windows and Linux distributions. However, performance is said to be "really slow." How-To Geek reports: The latest Parallels Desktop 20.2 update adds early support for x86 emulation on Apple Silicon, allowing traditional x86 PC operating systems to work on newer Mac computers. There were already apps like UTM that could do it (most of them are based on QEMU), but this feature uses Parallels' "proprietary emulation engine" paired with Apple's built-in hypervisor. [...] Parallels on Apple Silicon can now "run existing x86_64 Windows 10, Windows 11*, Windows Server 2019/2022, and some Linux distributives with UEFI BIOS via Parallels Emulator." You can also create new Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines if needed.
 
There are some big limitations. You can only run 64-bit x86 operating systems -- sorry, FreeDOS fans -- but those 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit applications. There's also no support for USB devices, nested virtualization (so WSL2 won't work), or the Parallels hypervisor. Performance will also be "really slow," since x86 instructions have to be translated to ARM. The company said, "Windows boot time is about 2-7 minutes, depending on your hardware. Windows operating system responsiveness is also low."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Owns Greenland?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/who-owns-greenland</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/678573f83f68018e6a0c098d/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=aK2ez0HAnyG6saKrZTvRIj4SynUteRmJb9DZo3TAn-U" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NuPhy Air60HE keyboard review (Gateron Low-profile Magnetic Jade Pro)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGI03Vdsj5s</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tGI03Vdsj5s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:31:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 7:40 for a typing demonstration.

It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity.It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Europe Rebuilt After WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqljXZGTfug</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WqljXZGTfug?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the largest, bloodiest conflict in human history, more struggle was already on the horizon.

These screens occupy the dimensions of your terminal by default. While you can have many different screens in a single application, only one screen may be active at a time.When you create your¬† class, Textual will create a screen object implicitly. Yes, Textual requires you to have at least one screen or your application won‚Äôt work. If you do not create a new screen or switch to a different one, the default screen is where your widgets will get mounted or composed to.Screens are a great way to organize your application. Many applications have settings pages, help pages, and more. These are just a few examples of how you can use screens.Now that you know what a screen is, you‚Äôre ready to learn how to create new ones!When you create an application, you create a¬†¬†implicitly. But how do you create your own¬†? Fortunately, Textual has made that easy. All you need to do is import the¬†¬†class from¬†¬†and extend it as needed.You can style screens the same way you do other widgets, except for the dimensions as screens are always the same size as your terminal window.To see how this all works, you will create an application with two screens:You second screen, which will be greenYou will be able to switch between the screens using a button. Each screen has its own button and its own event or message handler.Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file called¬†¬†with the following contents:# two_screens.py

from textual import on
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button

class GreenScreen(Screen):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Button("Main Screen", id="main")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#main")
    def on_main(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss()


class MainAop(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("Switch", id="switch")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#switch")
    def on_switch(self) -> None:
        self.push_screen(GreenScreen())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()You use Textual‚Äôs handy¬†¬†decorator to match against the button‚Äôs¬†. That keeps the message from bubbling around to other event handlers, which is what could happen if you had used¬†, for example.When you run your application, you will see something like this:Try clicking the buttons and switching between the screens.Of course, you don‚Äôt need to use button‚Äôs at all, if you don‚Äôt want to. You could use keyboard shortcuts instead. Why not give that a try?Go back to your Python IDE and create a new file called¬†¬†with this code in it:# two_screens_keys_only.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Label


class GreenScreen(Screen):
    BINDINGS = [("escape", "app.pop_screen", "Dismiss the screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Label("Second Screen")


class MainAop(App):
    SCREENS = {"green": GreenScreen}
    BINDINGS = [("n", "push_screen('green')", "Green Screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Label("Main screen")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()Using keyboard shortcuts makes your code a little less verbose. However, since you aren‚Äôt using a¬†¬†widget, the shortcuts are not shown on-screen to the user. When you are on the main screen, you must press the letter ‚Äún‚Äù on your keyboard to switch to the¬†. Then when you want to switch back, you press ‚ÄúEsc‚Äù or escape.Here‚Äôs what the screen looks like on the¬†:Now try using the keys mentioned to swap between the two screens. Feel free to change the keyboard bindings to keys of your own choosing.Textual can do much more with Screens than what is covered in this brief tutorial. However, you can use this information as a great starting point for learning how to add one more additional screens to your GUI in your terminal.Play around with these examples and then run over to the Textual documentation to learn about some of the other widgets you can add to bring your application to life.If you‚Äôd like to learn more about Textual, check out my book: Creating TUI Applications with Textual and Python, which you can find on the following websites:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One of the most controversial medical procedures in history - Jenell Johnson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3d2DlLX7xw</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/w3d2DlLX7xw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:01:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Uncover the history of the lobotomy, and find out why it's considered one of the most controversial procedures of the 20th century.

--

In 1935, researchers found that after removing the frontal lobes of two chimps, they no longer experienced frustration or anxiety. Neurologist Egas Moniz believed that replicating this in humans could cure mental illness‚Äî leading to one of the most controversial and destructive medical treatments of the 20th century: the lobotomy. Jenell Johnson uncovers the history of the procedure.

Donald Trump has promised to conduct ‚Äúthe largest deportation effort in American history,‚Äù no matter what it costs‚Äîbut the price tag may be bigger than expected.

In today's video we look at a history of US border control and the economic costs of deporting more than six percent of the US workforce while the US workforce ages.

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018.The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Heroku and the Twelve-Factor App with Vish Abrams</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/14/heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED5934449149.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Heroku is a cloud platform-as-a-service that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

You Need to Lay the Right FoundationCoding interviews aren‚Äôt just about algorithms‚Äîthey‚Äôre about confidence.Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you‚Äôre not prepared for the basics.The solution? Master these core areas:üí°  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming‚Äîit works.I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I‚Äôd never get it.But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing PatternsEver feel like you‚Äôve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?It‚Äôs not about solving ‚Äîit‚Äôs about solving smarter.Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.Here are a few patterns worth mastering: Ideal for sorted arrays. For substring or interval problems. For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.To answer range sum queries in constant time.For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.For exploring all possible configurations.üí°  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5‚Äì10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map‚Äîthey get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real DealHere‚Äôs the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.You know the material, but when it‚Äôs time to perform, your brain says, ‚ÄúNope.‚ÄùSweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.Use a whiteboard or plain text editor‚Äîno IDE crutches.Practice explaining your thought process out loud.üí°  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.It‚Äôs awkward at first, but it‚Äôs the fastest way to build confidence.4. If You Don‚Äôt Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact TopicsNot all topics are prioritized equally.Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won‚Äôt help when interviewers hit you with the classics. Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals. DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching. Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.üí°  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.The goal isn‚Äôt to know everything‚Äîit‚Äôs to be a pro at what matters most.5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an EngineerCoding interviews aren‚Äôt just about solving problems‚Äîthey‚Äôre about showing  you solve problems.Clear communication sets you apart. Restate it to show you understand. Share your strategy before you start coding. Explain your logic, handle edge cases, and think aloud.üí°  Record yourself solving a problem.Play it back to catch moments where you over-complicate or skip explanations.Interviewers don‚Äôt expect perfection‚Äîthey expect clarity and problem-solving skills.6. And Finally, You Need to Build ResilienceLet‚Äôs talk about failure.It‚Äôs not if‚Äîit‚Äôs when. But every mistake is a step closer to mastery.During my ICPC journey, I submitted hundreds of wrong answers.Some were silly oversights; others were genuinely tough problems.But every ‚Äúwrong answer‚Äù was a chance to learn something new.üí°  Keep a failure journal.Write down problems you struggled with, what you learned, and how you‚Äôll tackle similar issues in the future.Failure isn‚Äôt the end; it‚Äôs the beginning of better solutions.Here are a few resources I personally used to improve at problem-solving:Section for training as a team.Educational section to learn new topics.Highly engaged community and blogs where people go beyond the basics.Slightly advanced topics.The most beautiful algorithmic problems you will ever see.If you‚Äôve ever doubted your ability to land that dream job, let me be the proof: persistence, focus, and the right system can transform everything.And leveraging your competitive advantage will change your life‚Äîmore on that in this post:Competitive Programming Changed My Life ForeverI‚Äôm writing to you from Gothenburg, Sweden‚Äîa place where I‚Äôve found the perfect balance between meaningful work and a fulfilling life‚Ä¶a month ago ¬∑ 31 likes ¬∑ 7 comments ¬∑ Alberto GonzalezYour dream job isn‚Äôt just about a bigger paycheck.

To qualify, developers must have a 2024 commit in Torvalds' kernel git tree and email him with the subject "I WANT A GUITAR PEDAL". He'll pick a winner at random, use his own money to buy a pedal kit from a company called Aion FX, and then 'build it with my own shaky little fingers, and send it to the victim by US postal services.'" The Register reports: The odd offer appeared in his weekly state-of-the-kernel post, which on Sunday US time informed the Linux world that release candidate (rc) seven for version 6.13 of the Linux kernel "is slightly bigger than normal, but considering the timing, it's pretty much where I would have expected, and nothing really stands out." Torvalds therefore expects version 6.13 to debut next week, meaning it will arrive after his preferred seven release candidates and without delays caused by the usual holiday-period slowdown. Torvalds then added a postscript in which he revealed that he often uses the holiday season to build LEGO, which he frequently receives for Christmas and his late December birthday.
 
He kept up that tradition last year, but "also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds" which he described as "LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron." [...] Torvalds doesn't play guitar, but did the builds "because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing.'" He enjoyed the experience and wants to build more pedals, so has decided to give one away to a random kernel developer -- both as an act of generosity and to "check to see if anybody actually ever reads these weekly rc announcements of mine." Torvalds rated his past pedal-building efforts a "good success so far" but warned entrants "I'm a software person with a soldering iron."
 
"I will test the result to the best of my abilities, and the end result may actually work ... but you should set your expectations along the lines of "quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EP31 Kushite Conversations</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wz1WPfI34</link><author>Dan Carlin</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/N1wz1WPfI34?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 22:26:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RcjbuyF5M1U4R62zjE3hg">Dan Carlin</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dan talks with writer, broadcaster and journalist Zeinab Badawi about the ancient African kingdom of Kush and her book on African history.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The new $30,000 side hustle (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/127</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/127/changelog-news-127.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg reports on a concerning new trend in tech hiring, Sean Goedecke has a lot to say about large established codebases, Jacob Bartlett thinks Apple is ruining Swift‚Äôs original vision, Ahmed Khaleel built a cool tool for turning GitHub repos into interactive diagrams & Bridget Harris goes deep on the potential of crypto stablecoins to disrupt Visa and Mastercard‚Äôs duopoly.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome L√º Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters.

The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.According to the White House, "In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One reason movies are so dark now</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJcnUUJlPA</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HSJcnUUJlPA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital cameras have driven this change, but not in the way you think.

"You've heard it all before. But now there's a Linux-powered PC that many people will want..." 

He's talking about Nvidia's newly-announced Project Digits, describing it as "a desktop with AI supercomputer power that runs DGX OS, a customized Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro."

Powered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. "We're going to make this a mainstream product," Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players ‚Äî including Intel and AMD ‚Äî in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? 

Linux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, "Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work." Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.
 
The article strays into speculation, when it adds "maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks...." 

"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Roald Amundsen</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/roald-amundsen</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6765bf1e575cbdaa9d89bede/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=9jVYK1UV2_PMoWc2X_u4mlskXFK1CvhoaIrf4qRmQGI" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:05:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White Lives Matter Rally (Dear Kelly Scene)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmc5-B5AFpk</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zmc5-B5AFpk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 20:10:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DEAR KELLY will premiere in three days at 5:55 P.M.

Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.My immediate reaction was ‚Äúoh, getting a modern terminal experience isn‚Äôt that
hard, you just need to‚Ä¶.‚Äù, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
‚Äúyou just need to‚Ä¶‚Äù list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.what is a ‚Äúmodern terminal experience‚Äù?Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:multiline support for copy and paste: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediatly run them all! That‚Äôs scary! (, ): if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (): I can‚Äôt live without having my  and  in my prompt (): this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours () between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press  in vim to paste (, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too): for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete () (): I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor‚Äôs theme. (, )automatic terminal fixing: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn‚Äôt get messed up (): I want  to work ( or )being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like : ( and )There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.how I achieve a ‚Äúmodern experience‚Äùuse the  shell. Mostly don‚Äôt configure it, except to:
set the  environment variable to my favourite terminal editoruse any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I‚Äôve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I‚Äôm not picky about this. I don‚Äôt really
configure it other than to choose a font.use , with a configuration that I‚Äôve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)A few things that affect my approach:I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time SSHed into other machinesI‚Äôd rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everythingI work on a lot of small projects, not one big projectsome ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù options for a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù experienceWhat if you want a nice experience, but don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminalmac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn‚Äôt have 256-colour support)cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghosttyshell config:
set the  environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editormaybe alias  to text editor: this is a tough one, maybe micro or helix? I haven‚Äôt used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it‚Äôs amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
( to copy,  to paste,  to select all) in micro and
they do what you‚Äôd expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn‚Äôt
have a GUI or plugin system yet.Personally I  use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I‚Äôve found in the past that they‚Äôre missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app‚Äôs case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.I don‚Äôt want to pretend that getting a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù terminal experience is easier
than it is though ‚Äì I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let‚Äôs talk
about them!issue 1 with getting to a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù experience: the shellbash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:you need to customize your promptthey don‚Äôt come with git completions by default, you have to set them upby default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lotI find bash‚Äôs tab completion very frustrating, if there‚Äôs more than
one match then you can‚Äôt tab through themAnd even though I love fish, the fact
that it isn‚Äôt POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.Of course it‚Äôs totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn‚Äôt even need to be that complicated (in bash I‚Äôd
probably start with something like export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ ', or maybe use starship).
But each of these ‚Äúnot complicated‚Äù things really does add up and it‚Äôs
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.An extremely popular solution to getting a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù shell experience is
oh-my-zsh. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I‚Äôve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past ‚Äì it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what‚Äôs happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it‚Äôs slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.issue 2 with getting to a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù experience: the text editorIn the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were , , and .I think the main options for terminal text editors are:use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the workuse nano and accept that you‚Äôre going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don‚Äôt think you can select text with the mouse and then ‚Äúcut‚Äù
it in nano)use  or  which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editorjust avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode‚Äôs terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use  as their  in the terminal.issue 3: individual applicationsThe last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine,  doesn‚Äôt support
the  keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:realize why this is happening (Mac OS won‚Äôt ship GNU tools, and ‚ÄúCtrl-Left arrow‚Äù support comes from GNU readline)find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)adjust my environment (put Homebrew‚Äôs sqlite3 in my PATH)I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúworth it‚Äù ‚Äì often I‚Äôll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don‚Äôt want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I‚Äôve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.A big part of having a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can‚Äôt be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in , but in   I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù command line tools isn‚Äôt easy (though
I made a list here),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you‚Äôre
SSHed into another machine, they won‚Äôt always be there.everything affects everything elseSomething I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything ‚Äúnice‚Äù
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don‚Äôt use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I‚Äôd need to think about a few things, like:if I wanted tmux‚Äôs copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I‚Äôd need to make sure that my terminal emulator has OSC 52 supportif I wanted to use iTerm‚Äôs tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I‚Äôd need to change how I configure colours ‚Äì right now I set them
with a shell script that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.and probably more things I haven‚Äôt thought of. ‚ÄúUsing tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours‚Äù sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided ‚Äúwell, I don‚Äôt want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I‚Äôm not using that feature!‚Äù.It‚Äôs also hard to remember which features I‚Äôm relying on ‚Äì for example maybe
my current terminal  have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don‚Äôt even realize that that‚Äôs something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.Personally even though I think my setup is not  complicated, it‚Äôs taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I‚Äôve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there‚Äôs a problem, which can be really
disorienting.So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using  to eza a year or two ago and
while I like it (because  prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I‚Äôm still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it‚Äôs worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I‚Äôm
very happy I did.getting a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù terminal is not that easyTrying to explain how ‚Äúeasy‚Äù it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it‚Äôs kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.I‚Äôve found that there‚Äôs never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Keychron Q0 Max macropad!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPk09Ars-JE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xPk09Ars-JE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q0-max-qmk-custom-number-pad

Back in 2013 a couple random dudes decided to make a pseudo-sequel to Footprints in Stone called Forbidden History: Footprints in Stone II, which is essentially just an extended interview with Carl Baugh and his protegee Aaron Judkins. I was really tempted to call this video Footprints in Stone III, but restrained myself and consigned that in-joke to the clickbait title.

RFK, Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. 

The US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. 

Fluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains ‚Äî and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.
