Then import the validator package into your own code.import "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10"
Validation functions return type errorThey return type error to avoid the issue discussed in the following, where err is always != nil:Validator returns only InvalidValidationError for bad validation input, nil or ValidationErrors as type error; so, in your code all you need to do is check if the error returned is not nil, and if it's not check if error is InvalidValidationError ( if necessary, most of the time it isn't ) type cast it to type ValidationErrors like so:err := validate.Struct(mystruct)
validationErrors := err.(validator.ValidationErrors)
If new to using validator it is highly recommended to initialize it using the WithRequiredStructEnabled option which is opt-in to new behaviour that will become the default behaviour in v11+. See documentation for more details.validate := validator.New(validator.WithRequiredStructEnabled())

Can you convince your opponent to support an attack in the present while simultaneously backstabbing them five years ago and seven timelines over?Inspired by and indebted to the board game Diplomacy and the video game 5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel. Both are excellent in their own right, so we recommend picking up a copy of each to understand the rules for 5D Diplomacy. is a trademark of Avalon Hill. 5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel is a trademark of Thunkspace, LLC. 5D Diplomacy With Multiverse Time Travel and its creators are not affiliated with either  or 5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel.If you find a bug, please raise an issue.Note that official development of new features has come to an end. Issues requesting new or modified gameplay features will probably be rejected. Only bug fixes, performance improvements, and quality of life adjustments are likely to be accepted as suggestions.Feel free to fork this repo and modify the code there if you wish to experiment with more radical changes to the rules or UI. Visit the 5D Diplomacy Discord server to discuss new rules and theory with others.There are currently two options for installing 5D Diplomacy. Use quick installation if you just want to play the game. Use manual installation if you want to make code changes.The correct version of Docker for your operating system.Open Docker and leave it running.Open the CLI for your operating system and navigate inside the folder where you've downloaded this repository. If you don't know how to do this, use this tutorial.Via the CLI, run the command docker compose build frontend backend and wait for it to complete.Via the CLI, run the command  and wait for it to complete.Wait an extra few seconds for the server to start up. If you experience errors creating a game in the next step, try waiting longer.If you ever update the code (manually or via a pull from this repository), you will need to run docker compose down --rmi local, then run through the steps above again. Note that this may result in the database being wiped.To read server logs, run docker compose logs -f backend.The game consists of two components, found in the  and  directories. You must set up and run both to play 5D Diplomacy, unless you're connecting to someone else's server or have implemented a custom client.The  directory contains the original proof of concept from 2021. None of its contents are required for running the latest version of 5D Diplomacy.Navigate to the  directory.(Optional) If you want to connect to a custom database, copy  to create a new file in the same directory called appsettings.Development.json. Add your database's connection string as the value for the appropriate provider under , then set the value for  to match the name of the connection string.Run one of the following commands, depending on your configuration: 
  If you aren't using a custom database, i.e. if you didn't follow the optional step above, run dotnet ef database update --context SqliteGameContext.If you're using a custom SQLite database, run dotnet ef database update --context SqliteGameContext.If you're using a custom SQL Server database, run dotnet ef database update --context SqlServerGameContext.Run  to start the server.The server will print its address to the console, likely http://localhost:5000 but it may be different. Note this down for later.Note that if you ever update the code with changes that affect the database schema (e.g. if you pull a change from this repository that includes a new migration), you will have to run the appropriate dotnet ef database update command again.Navigate to the  directory.Copy  to create a new file in the same directory called .Inside , replace  with the address of the server noted earlier.Run  to start the client in the default browser.First see installation instructions above. 5D Diplomacy can be set to run normal games (where seven players join and enter orders individually) or sandbox games (where a single user enters all orders).If you wish to play a normal game or let other people see one of your sandbox games, you'll need to expose the domains of your client and/or server (if everyone has set up the client themselves, only a server needs to be exposed). There are various ways to do this, although this guide does not cover them.If you modify the code and host a game that others interact with, you must provide a link to your modified source code to comply with the terms of the AGPL license. We suggest updating the link to the source code in client/src/components/pages/LandingPage.tsx.To create a normal game, one player must choose the new game option from the main menu. They must choose the adjacency setting (see game rules below). After a game has been created, the initiating player enters the game and sees the game ID in the top left corner, which they must copy and send to other players.Other players can then use the join game option from the main menu to join with the supplied game ID.Note that 5D Diplomacy has no in-built messaging system. Unless you want to play without press, you require a separate program to send and receive press, e.g. a messaging app or voice calls.A possible exploit exists when playing multiplayer games. Since 5D Diplomacy has no user logins or verification, a player can join as someone else and enter their orders before them. The alternative - allowing each nation to join only once - would mean players can't rejoin after a break or connection issues. While Diplomacy is a game about breaking trust, you'll simply have to trust players not to be quite this devious.To create a sandbox game, select new game from the main menu and choose the sandbox option. Also set the adjacency setting (see game rules below).In sandbox mode, turns advance after submission whether all nations have orders or not.The rules of 5D Diplomacy generally extend the rules of regular Diplomacy. This guide covers only deviations from the rules of the base game.The game world consists of a grid of Diplomacy boards. Each row is a timeline, and each timeline progresses with boards following the standard Diplomacy turns (Spring 1901, then Fall 1901, then Winter 1901, then Spring 1902, etc.).At a given time, only units on the active boards (those furthest to the right in each timeline) can have new orders assigned. Other units are locked into their pre-existing orders, which can't be changed, though their resolution can.Units in spring or fall turns can be given hold, move, support or convoy orders. These are validated against standard Diplomacy adjacency rules, with extra possibilities for multiverse travel. The adjacency strictness setting (chosen when a new game is created) determines how units can move through the multiverse.With strict adjacencies, a unit can move/support/convoy to:Any adjacent region on its own board.The same region on a different board exactly one timeline up or down, e.g. moving from Paris in Timeline 2 to Paris in Timeline 1.The same region on a different board exactly one board in the past, e.g. moving from Berlin in Fall 1901 to Berlin in Spring 1901. Note that moving to winter boards is forbidden and these are skipped when determining board adjacencies, so Spring 1902 is adjacent to Fall 1901.Any region it is successfully convoyed to (see below).With loose adjacencies, a unit can move/support/convoy to:Any adjacent region on its own board.The same region on a different board exactly one timeline up or down, or any region adjacent to that region within its board, e.g. moving from Paris in Timeline 2 to Gascony in Timeline 1.The same region on a different board exactly one board in the past, or any region adjacent to that region within its board, e.g. moving from Berlin in Fall 1901 to Kiel in Spring 1901. Winter boards are still ignored.Any region it is successfully convoyed to (see below).In either case, note in particular that movement one board diagonally is not permitted (without a convoy).Convoys extend the quirk of standard Diplomacy that allows armies to move an arbitrary distance in a single turn if a chain of convoying fleets exists. Providing each fleet is adjacent to the next and all are ordered to perform the same convoy, an army could go almost anywhere.Units are however forbidden from moving into boards that don't exist yet, even with convoys. Convoys and supports though can anticipate a future unit moving back in time, so the player can use the ghost board to enter supports/convoys via an arbitrary location in the multiverse.Any units in (spring or fall) boards not assigned orders are given a hold order by default.The rule of thumb for adjudication: each time all orders for a turn are submitted, all orders in the entire world are adjudicated together, as if in a single enormous Diplomacy board.In particular, new orders could affect a prior resolution of existing orders, e.g. a unit that bounced now has support and so moves successfully. This extends to supports/convoys across time, e.g. convoys that were previously invalid may become valid if the future army appears and performs the expected move.If the new resolution matches an existing child board that spawned from this one, then no new timeline splits. So if two units bounced and both receive one new support from their relative future next turn, they still bounce and no new board is created (assuming no other changes elsewhere on this board).If the new resolution does not match an existing child board that spawned from this one, a new timeline appears. New timelines always appear below all existing timelines, and are always created in a canonical order (earliest board first; if boards are of equal age, lowest timeline number first).Note that this is different to 5D Chess where boards can spawn above or below existing timelines, potentially changing the coordinates of existing boards. There's no concept of a turn belonging to a player in Diplomacy (instead, they belong to everyone simultaneously) and 5D Diplomacy extends this thinking, so timelines spawn in only one direction. Board coordinates also never change.Main turns (spring and fall) and winter boards adjudicate simultaneously if all are at the end of their respective timelines. So a player may be creating builds on one board and creating moves on another in the same turn. Though of course these must be kept separate, so building is not permitted on movement boards and vice versa.Build/disband counts are per board. If a player controls fewer centres than they have units in one timeline but more in another, the difference does not cancel out: they must disband in the former and may build only in the latter. If they fail to enter enough disbands on a given board, units are removed from that board at random.If any board requires retreats, adjudication pauses for all boards without retreats. Retreats may only move to an adjacent region on the same board.A player achieves victory under one of the following conditions:They are the only player to control at least 18 unique supply centres across all active boards. Unique here means unique by region name, so controlling Serbia in Timeline 1 and Serbia in Timeline 2 counts as only one supply centre.If more than one player controls more than 18 unique supply centres, they are the only one with a clear majority. It's possible for two players to reach 18 centres in the same turn, e.g. if they have targeted different timelines.As with regular Diplomacy, it's possible for 5D Diplomacy to feature variant maps with completely different region arrangements. Other variants, such as variants with new rules, are not supported.Modifying the server to adjudicate custom variants in 5D is simple. First, edit the list of nations in . Then edit the JSON files in the folder  to match the intended board. Any subsequent run of the server will use those to create and adjudicate worlds.Modify  to change supply centres and starting/home centres.Modify  to change connections between regions.Modify  to change regions.Modify  to change starting units.Modifying the client is tricker as it is much more tied to this particular Diplomacy board. While client/src/data/regions.ts contains the list of regions and associated data, you will also need to replace the SVG files in  and then reference them in client/src/hooks/useRegionSvg.tsx.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>juspay/hyperswitch</title><link>https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch</link><author></author><category>trending</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 18:05:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://mshibanami.github.io/GitHubTrendingRSS">Github Trending</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An open source payments switch written in Rust to make payments fast, reliable and affordable
  Single API to access the payments ecosystem and its features 
 Juspay, founded in 2012, is a global leader in payment orchestration and checkout solutions, trusted by 400+ leading enterprises and brands worldwide. Hyperswitch is Juspay's new generation of composable, commercial open-source payments platform for merchant and brands. It is an enterprise-grade, transparent and modular payments platform designed to provide digital businesses access to the best payments infrastructure. 
Here are the key components of Hyperswitch that deliver the whole solution:Hyperswitch Backend: Hyperswitch backend enables seamless payment processing with comprehensive support for various payment flows - authorization, authentication, void and capture workflows along with robust management of post-payment processes like refunds and chargeback handling. Additionally, Hyperswitch supports non-payment use cases by enabling connections with external FRM or authentication providers as part of the payment flow. The backend optimizes payment routing with customizable workflows, including success rate-based routing, rule-based routing, volume distribution, fallback handling, and intelligent retry mechanisms for failed payments based on specific error codes.SDK (Frontend): The SDK, available for web, Android, and iOS, unifies the payment experience across various methods such as cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, and more, while supporting the diverse payment flows of underlying PSPs. When paired with the locker, it surfaces the user's saved payment methods.Control Center: The Control Center enables users to manage the entire payments stack without any coding. It allows the creation of workflows for routing, payment retries, and defining conditions to invoke 3DS, fraud risk management (FRM), and surcharge modules. The Control Center provides access to transaction, refund, and chargeback operations across all integrated PSPs, transaction-level logs for initial debugging, and detailed analytics and insights into payment performance.You can run Hyperswitch on your system using Docker compose after cloning this repository.git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch

Thousands of artists are urging the auction house Christie's to cancel a sale of art created with artificial intelligence, claiming the technology behind the works is committing "mass theft". The Augmented Intelligence auction has been described by Christie's as the first AI-dedicated sale by a major auctioneer and features 20 lots with prices ranging from $10,000 to $250,000... 
The British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in the campaign by creative professionals for protection of their work and a signatory to the letter, said at least nine of the works appearing in the auction appeared to have used models trained on artists' work. However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models. 
A spokesperson for Christie's said that "in most cases" the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists' "own inputs". 

More than 6,000 people have now signed the letter, which states point-blank that "Many of the artworks you plan to auction were created using AI models that are known to be trained on copyrighted work without a license."

These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them. Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies' mass theft of human artists' work. We ask that, if you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction. 

Last week ARTnews spoke to Nicole Sales Giles, Christie's vice-president and director of digital art sales (before the open letter was published). And Giles insisted one of the major themes of the auction is "that AI is not a replacement for human creativity."
"You can see a lot of human agency in all of these works," Giles said. "In every single work, you're seeing a collaboration between an AI model, a robot, or however the artist has chosen to incorporate AI. It is showing how AI is enhancing creativity and not becoming a substitute for it." 

One of the auction's headline lots is a 12-foot-tall robot made by Matr Labs that is guided by artist Alexander Reben's AI model. It will paint a new section of a canvas live during the sale every time the work receives a bid. Reben told ARTnews that he understands the frustrations of artists regarding the AI debate, but he sees "AI as an incredible tool... AI models which are trained on public data are done so under the idea of 'fair use,' just as search engines once faced scrutiny for organizing book data (which was ultimately found to fall under fair use)," he said.... "AI expands creative potential, offering new ways to explore, remix, and evolve artistic expression rather than replace it. The future of art isn't about AI versus artists — it's about how artists wield AI to push boundaries in ways we've never imagined before...." 

Digital artist Jack Butcher has used the open letter to create a minted digital artwork called Undersigned Artists. On X he wrote that the work "takes a collective act of dissent — an appeal to halt an AI art auction — and turns it into the very thing it resists: a minted piece of digital art. The letter, originally a condemnation of AI-generated works trained on unlicensed human labor, now becomes part of the system it critiques." 

Christie's will accept cryptocurrency payments for the majority of lots in the sale.

While playing games and coffee have become stress-busters in our lives, why can't building games be the best one?\
Even though some people find game development insane, it’s easy for software developers because they have almost every skill needed: math, Programming, UX/UI, and the usual stuff. If a normal person takes 6 months to learn a Game Engine, the Developer will take a maximum of 3 months or less.\
Many people don’t know this, but I started my tech career as a game developer, although I later turned my back on game development and became a Python developer. And no lies, they were a few of the best years in my life.\
This article is dedicated to any developer who wants to try something new or exciting (which is game development, yes). Scroll down!Software developers who are interested in game development have a remarkable head start. Programming skills are the core of game development. Even if you’re more comfortable with Swift or Ruby, which is not commonly used in game development, you can quickly pick up other Object-oriented programming languages that are much more commonly used for game development, like C# or C++, easier than anyone!\
If you're a Python lover, you will love to hear this: There are really good, AAA games made with Python such as Battlefield 2, EVE Online, Civilization IV, and more!Not only Python, but almost every commonly used Programming language has libraries that support making games. For example:Flutter has Flame, a game engine that supports Flutter language.Ruby has Gosu, a library that makes it easy to develop 2D games.Python has PyGame, a library that empowers you to create both 2D and 3D games.Phaser allows you to create games with JavaScript and HTML5.For every beginner, either a software engineer or a novice, I give one common piece of advice— Start as small as possible. It doesn't matter how small pieces of code it has or how messy it is, you've won the challenge!\
If you love simple 2D games, I would recommend that you make a Pong game. Pong features simple graphics (2 rectangles and a circle) you can create on your own, minimal sounds, and a game loop. If you want to learn about making multiplayer games, allow matches to occur between two human players over a network. If you want to learn about AI, allow the player to challenge the computer.\
And if you love 3D games like me, start with Cube Run. I haven't made it without a Game engine because, 3D becomes a bit harder with Python or others but with Unity, it's the best game I recommend to take a start.Major Ingredients of A GameIf you make a cake without Sugar, no one will eat it. Except for diabetic people, of course, like my mom.\
The same goes for video games. It’s full of ingredients, some of which are required for every game and some of which are optional. I’ll introduce them briefly.In many games, the level itself is a challenge, trickier than the smartest AI enemies. Series like Tomb Raider also emphasize complex and challenging level design.\
While the advent of open-world games like GTA may make the level design seem less important than in bygone times, it’s worth noting that even open-world games have ‘levels’, such as a particular building, structure, or map area you must enter to achieve a goal.\
To reduce player feelings of being railroaded, levels will ideally have multiple possible paths through them.In games, you can’t really rely on natural light sources to illuminate your video game.\
(You don’t think there’s a sun inside a game engine, do you?)\
Every light source in a video game must be added by hand and light manipulation is incredibly important. Light can be used for all of the following:Controlling the player’s ability . In horror and survival games, light is a resource that must be carefully managed.Controlling a player’s ability . In games with an element of stealth, dark areas can provide cover while well-lit areas represent a difficult challenge.Setting the mood. The quality of light can be used to set the mood, with sunny and bright lighting associated with happy times and brooding light associated with dark times.Lighting the way. Light can be used to direct the player’s attention. The best-designed levels in video games often make clever use of light to guide the player in the right direction when they might otherwise be lost.Game art is the medium through which the game world is presented to the player. In a sense, all the programming effort that goes into making video games is an attempt to turn game art into something that feels responsive and alive. Game art is an umbrella term that includes textures, 3D models, sprites, particle effects, and lighting.\
And yes, it’s a broad area, best to not cover it in this article.Unlike in the real world, video game sounds cannot be made by accident. Every sound in the game universe must be added by hand, and it is through layering these sounds that the game world starts to feel lifelike. You also need to be mindful of sounds triggered by the player, by other characters, and ambient sounds that create the game world environment.\
As an example, the player accidentally hits a metal object; if it doesn't emit a sound, it doesn't feel natural, or the scientist who claimed that metals have sonorous properties got it wrong.\
Another ever-present fact of video games is music, used to create an emotional response in the player or removed entirely to leave behind an eerie silence. Unlike most compositions, video game music must loop seamlessly. It must also transition smoothly to new compositions based on in-game events, such as being spotted by an enemy.\
Here are some of my favorite places to find sound:You have made graphics, levels, and everything but the whole game feels like a dead body. If you want your game to be alive, you need some lines of code.\
Most of my readers are probably a developer already, so you probably know the importance of programming anywhere. I'm not going to give a lecture on "what is programming", but here’s a bit about programming in game design.\
First of all, you need to decide one thing: Are you making a game by using a Game Engine + Language or building a game from scratch with Python or something? It's your choice but let me help you: If you're going to build games for fun, choose the first option because it's easier. \
As I said in the beginning, programmers always juggle complex problems so you probably shouldn't take more stress with that too.\
(Game Engines are the software used to create video games.)\
There are many of them, but the most popular ones are:Unity (Great for beginners, recommended)Next, choose a language to get started. Mostly, C# and C are used. Don't worry, you already got a headstart in knowing at least one programming language; most people start even before they know what the word “programming“stands for.\
And that’s about it. Well, of course, there are many other optional ingredients that video games consist of but in general, the above are basically the starter pack.Starting game development is easier for software developers than anyone. As someone with programming skills, you have a massive head-start on the average video game hobbyist who wants to learn how to make a game. If I scroll to the top of the article, I can list the below points as key takeaways.It's a lot easier to find a game dev library in your comfortable programming language to get started.Start with a small game, maybe a clone of an existing game.Game Engines make your life a lot easier.If you want to make a big, impressive game but don’t have a lot of time to spare, consider teaming up with others or joining a modding community.And that's all for now, Happy Designing! 🏎\

But they aren't stranded there, and they weren't abandoned, the astronauts reminded CNN this week in a rare space-to-earth interview:

"That's been the rhetoric. That's been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck — and I get it. We both get it," [NASA astronaut Butch] Wilmore said. "But that is, again, not what our human spaceflight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded." Wilmore added a request: "If you'll help us change the rhetoric, help us change the narrative. Let's change it to 'prepared and committed.' 

"That's what we prefer," he said... 
[NASA astronaut Suni] Williams also reiterated a sentiment she has expressed on several occasions, including in interviews conducted before she left Earth. "Butch and I knew this was a test flight," she told CNN's Cooper, acknowledging the pair has been prepared for contingencies and understood that the stay in space might be extended. "We knew that we would probably find some things (wrong with Starliner) and we found some stuff, and so that was not a surprise," she said. 
When Cooper opened the interview by asking the astronauts how they're doing, Williams answers "We're doing pretty darn good, actually," pointing out they had plenty of food and great crew members. And Wilmore added that crews come to the space station on a careful cycle, and "to alter that cycle sends ripple effects all the way down the chain. We would never expect to come back just special for us or anyone unless it was a medical issue or something really out of the circumstances along those lines. So we need to come back and keep the normal cycle going..." 

CNN's article notes a new announcement from NASA Tuesday that the astronauts might return a couple weeks early "after opting to change the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule it will use." That mission's targeted launch date is now March 12. 

In the meantime, Williams says in the interview, "We do have some internet connection up here, so we can get some internet live. We've gotten football. It's been this crew's go-to this past fall. Also YouTube or something like that. It's not continuous — it has chunks of time that we get it. And we use that same system also to make phone calls home, so we can talk to our families, and do videoconferences even on the weekends as well. This place is a pretty nice place to live, for the most part." 

And they're also "working on with folks on the ground" to test the NASA's cube-shaped, free-flying robotic Astrobees.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deepseek R1 Distill 8B Q40 on 4 x Raspberry Pi 5, 6.43 tok/s (eval 11.68 tok/s)</title><link>https://github.com/b4rtaz/distributed-llama/discussions/162</link><author>b4rtazz</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 16:11:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NTSYNC Driver Fix Being Worked On For Proper User Permissions</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-NTSYNC-Permissions-Issue</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 16:05:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the great new features of Linux 6.14 is the NTSYNC driver being completed for better emulating the Microsoft Windows NT synchronization primitives so that software like Wine and Proton (Steam Play) can provide for better performance when running Windows games on Linux.

"Since I'm a journalist, or at least close enough, I decided that I should at least get Stellantis/Jeep's side of things," writes car-culture site The Autopian:


Would Stellantis do something so woefully misguided and annoying? I reached out to our Stellantis/Jeep contact to ask and was initially told that they were "investigating" on their end, which to me felt like a stalling tactic while the proper ass-covering plans were conceived. I eventually got this response from a Stellantis spokesperson: 

 "This was an in-vehicle message designed to inform Jeep customers about Mopar extended vehicle care options. A temporary software glitch affected the ability to instantly opt out in a few isolated cases, though instant opt-out is the standard for all our in-vehicle messages. Our team had already identified and corrected the error, and we are following up directly with the customer to ensure the matter is fully resolved..." 

I suppose a glitch is possible, though I've not seen any examples of this ad popping up with the instant opt-out option available, but I guess it must exist, since not all Jeep owners seem to have had to deal with these ads. I suspect if this was happening to more people than these "few isolated cases" we'd still be cleaning up from the aftermath of the riots and uprisings.

In this article I want to correct a popular misconception that's been making the rounds in computer graphics aficionado circles for a long time now. It has to do with conditionals when selecting between two results in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation, and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up a little:
So, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);
     x>?(s.x,):
           x>?s*():
                      (,s.y);
}
The exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations deciding what's the final value this function should return. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return one of three results, which are simple to compute. I could also have implemented this function with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say in this article stays true.
Now, here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will step up and invariably propose the following "optimization", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are "conditional branches" in the code, by arithmetic operations. They will suggest something like this: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);

     w0 = (,x);
     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);
     w2 = -w0-w1;

     res0 = (s.x,);
     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();
     res2 = (,s.y);

     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;
}
There are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. "select"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. I'll repeat it again - there is no branching, the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no prediction involved, no pipe to flush, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.
For the record, of course GPUs can do real branching, and those are fine and fast and totally worth it when big chunks of code and computation are to be skipped given a condition. As with all things computing, always check the generated machine code to know what is happening exactly and when. But one thing you can safely assume without having to check any generated code - when moving simple values or computations like in my original example, you are guaranteed to not branch. This has been true for decades at this point, with GPUs. And while I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.
The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimized version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. You can measure it in a variety of hardware. I can only assume that's because the  function is probably implemented with some sort of conditional move or subtract + bit propagation + AND. step(  x,  y )
{
     x < y ?  : ;
}
Either way, using the step() "optimization" are either using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to mask in and out the different potential outputs with a series of arithmetic multiplications and additions. Which is wasteful, the values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.
But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the original code I published:
GLSL x>?(s.x,):
       x>?s*():
                  (,s.y);
AMD Compiler     s0,      v3, , v1
     v4, , v0
     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0
 v3, 0, v3, vcc
 v0, v0, v4, vcc
 vcc, (v2), s1
 v1, v1, v3, vcc
 v0, 0, v0, vcc
Microsoft Compiler   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy
   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )
 r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz
 r0.xy, r0.xyxx
  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()
   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()
 r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy
 o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw
Here we can confirm that the GPU is not branching, as I explained. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).
The Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison ( - "lt"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).
There are no jump/branch instructions in these listings.
Something not related to the discussion but interesting, is that some of the  GLSL calls I had in my shader before the ternary operator we are discussing, didn't become GPU instructions but rather instruction modifiers, which is the reason you see them in the listing. This means you can think of abs() calls as being free.
So, if you ever see somebody proposing this a = ( b, c, ( y, x ) );
as an optimization to
then please correct them for me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Altman: OpenAI not for sale, especially to competitor who is not able to beat us</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/openai-altman-musk-offer</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:17:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Event Sourcing?</title><link>https://newsletter.scalablethread.com/p/what-is-event-sourcing</link><author>/u/scalablethread</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:05:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Traditional data storage typically focuses on the current state of an entity. For example, in an e-commerce system, you might store the current state of a customer's order: items, quantities, shipping address, etc. Event sourcing takes a different approach. Instead of storing the current state directly, it stores the events that led to that state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the past. Think of it as a detailed log of transactions on your bank statement. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store. The core idea is that an application's state can be derived by replaying events in the order they occurred, just like you can get your current bank balance by replaying all the transactions from the beginning. This makes Event Sourcing particularly useful for applications that require a high degree of audibility and traceability.Every change to the application state is captured as an event object in an Event Sourcing system. These events are then stored in an event store, a database optimized for handling event data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how Event Sourcing works:Reconstructing the state from events involves reading all the events related to an entity from the event store and applying them in sequence to reconstruct the current state. It's like simulating all the changes that have occurred to construct the current state. For example, consider an e-commerce application where an order goes through various states like "Created," "Paid," and "Shipped." To determine the current state of an order, you would:Retrieve all events related to the order from the event store.Initialize an empty order object.Apply each event to the order object in the order in which they were stored.By the end of this process, the order object will reflect the current state of the order.As the number of events grows, replaying the entire event stream to reconstruct the state can become slow and inefficient. This is where snapshots come in. A snapshot is a saved state of an entity at a specific point in time. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, the application can load the latest snapshot and then replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken.

A study reconstructed wild weather events through the eyes of record-keepers during this fraught period, opening a tantalizing window into climate extremes unleashed by a vengeful God (according to contemporary reports).Then: making love the medaka way (get those anal fins ready). Next, the chillest insect in Antarctica (also: the only one). Finally, these turtles will dance for food, and yes, it’s very cute.The Haunting Weather Reports of 16th Century TransylvaniaRejoice, for this week has delivered one of the best varieties of study: Science via historical documents. Sure, ice cores and geological strata are great for reconstructing past climates, but nobody can bitch about the weather better than a good old-fashioned red-blooded member of team . To that end, researchers searched for mentions of weird weather across a trove of diaries, monastery records, travel notes, and other documents from 16th century Transylvania, during a “pivotal moment in climate history” when a centuries-long cooling event called the Little Ice Age intensified, according to researchers led by Ovidiu Răzvan Gaceu of the University of Oradea. These types of studies are packed with colorful human testimonies that can corroborate natural records. More importantly, though, they are just fun to read, especially during such an evocative time and place, freshly haunted by the vampiric spirit of Vlad the Impaler. Some highlights:In August 1526, heavy rainfall caused freak floods in Braşov that “washed the walls of the fortress, demolished the main gate, and the fish also got caught in the big church,” according to the Annals of Brașov. Fish in the church! The ultimate baptism.  In autumn 1553, people in the city of Cluj reported unusual weather events including “October strawberries.” For real, October is for pumpkins, get out of here with the strawbs. Turned out it was a bad omen—there was a plague the following winter. Keep that in mind if you see any late autumn strawberries: Kill on sight.Naturally, a lot of these accounts are heartbreaking. Locusts “sometimes covered the whole sky and destroyed grain crops” and caused terrible famines. A storm-related fire “killed 14 people and made 60 poor.” On September 29, 1582, “there was such a big storm, as it was said that it had never been seen before in the city of Cluj, which uprooted the trees and raised the roofs of the houses, people believed that it is sent by divinity to punish the crimes committed by them.” I mean, I’m not saying these people weren’t doing crimes. It’s 16th century Transylvania. Do what you gotta do. But that's not why there is extreme weather. You’re just in the Little Ice Age. The study ultimately identified “multiple pieces of evidence associated with extreme weather events, including 40 unusually warm summers and several years of excess precipitation or drought.” Taken together with natural archives, the documents paint a picture of troubled times, exacerbated by an unstable climate and possible emergent vampires. Relatable! Valentine’s Day is over, but the romantic mood is still in the air—or in the water, if you’re a medaka (flawless segue). Scientists have discovered that wild medaka, also known as Japanese rice fish, are fans of late-night booty calls, which is a behavior that has not been observed in captivity.“Although medaka and other model organisms are invaluable in laboratories, their ecology in the wild remains largely unknown,” said researchers led by Yuki Kondo of Osaka Metropolitan University. “This study showed that medaka in the wild initiate spawning during late nocturnal hours and exhibit vigorous courtship behavior at midnight.”Kondo and her colleagues recorded this vigorous courtship by placing GoPros into streams over the course of several summer nights in Gifu, Japan. The tapes revealed that medaka like to spawn in the dark, possibly to avoid predators during copulation. The results “provide the first empirical evidence that medaka mating begins significantly earlier than previously reported in the laboratory.”  For anyone who feels clueless about courtship, may I offer a page from the Medaka Sutra: “The spawning behavior of medaka follows a sequence of events: the male chases the female (following), the male swims rapidly around the female (quick circle), the male wraps his dorsal and anal fins around the female (wrapping), the female releases eggs, the male releases sperm (egg and sperm release), and the male leaves the female (leaving),” according to Kondo’s team.The only true love language is, indeed, spoken with anal fins.Major bonus points also go to Osaka Metropolitan University’s press team for throwing together this version of Edward Hopper’s famous “Nighthawks” painting with medaka getting drinks at a bar that is also named Medaka. It is genuinely one of the most inspired public relations efforts I have ever seen, and I’m going to get a print of it to hang on my wall.The Insect at the Edge of Earth, or the Antarctic midge, is the only insect that lives year-round on its namesake continent. Do you know how weird you have to be to be the  insect somewhere? But this midge doesn’t care. It just lives out its bug life, which lasts two years, in an otherwise bugless wasteland. Humans definitely care about the midge, though—how could we not? What is it doing there? How is it not dead? What can it teach us about cryopreservation? These questions are addressed in a new study that resolved mysteries about the animal’s interesting life cycle.“Freeze tolerance and cryoprotective dehydration are cold tolerance strategies used by various invertebrate species in polar regions and indeed,  utilises both for overwintering,” said researchers led by Mizuki Yoshida of the Ohio State University, who completed the project while at Osaka Metropolitan University (OMU killing it this week). “Larvae that are frozen in ice and cryoprotectively dehydrated readily survived 32 days of simulated overwintering,” the team said. “Unlike many insects restricted to highly specific microhabitats,  larvae inhabit a remarkably diverse range of substrates that differ in vegetation, substrate type, slope, drainage, and thermal and hydric conditions.”I love the phrasing of “readily survived” as if the midges were eager to show off their cryoprotective superpowers. After this 32-day period they emerged with “That all you got?” energy. By studying the bugs in these simulated conditions, the researchers confirmed that they rely on multiple overwintering strategies, including a state of arrested development called “obligate diapause.” “Diapause has long been assumed to be uncommon in Antarctic species, but the present study reveals that  utilises diapause for seasonal adaptation, as in many temperate species,” Yoshida and her colleagues said. In addition to being the only endemic Antarctic insect, this midge has the smallest genome of any known insect while also being the largest fully terrestrial animal on the continent, even though it’s only a few millimeters long. In other words, it is the biggest animal in Antarctica that doesn’t fly or swim. Okay, Antarctic midge. You just keep doing you.Last, turtles do a little victory dance when they find food. Yes, it is cute. Yes, there is a video.The footage (along with ) is part of a study that tested if turtles could distinguish the magnetic signatures of two geographical areas. When the turtles were exposed to signatures associated with an area they associated with food, they danced in anticipation of a meal, demonstrating that they could tell the signals apart—and party accordingly.  “Hallmarks of the behaviour include some or all of the following: tilting the body vertically, holding the head near or above water, opening the mouth, rapid alternating movement of the front flippers, and, occasionally, even spinning in place, hence the name ‘turtle dance,’” said researchers led by Kayla Goforth of Texas A&M University. “Turtles exhibited significantly higher levels of turtle dance behaviour when experiencing the field in which they had been fed.”With that, let’s all tilt vertically, spin in place, and shell-abrate the long weekend. Thanks for reading! See you next week.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Paragraf Is Building a &quot;Blank Canvas&quot; Graphene Foundry</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/paragraf-graphene-foundry</link><author>Liam Critchley</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjQ2NTMyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MzQyMzgzM30.wJGF4-_y2VSVjXLsYFhhL9DuC-xHiTHWB-Ciq4DHQTU/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The company wants to make graphene sensors more accessible to industries]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Diablo hackers uncovered a speedrun scandal</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/</link><author>pitwin</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[But simply splitting a run into segments doesn't explain away all of the problems the TAS team found. Getting Naj's Puzzler on dungeon level 9, for instance, still requires outside modification of a save file, which is specifically prohibited by longstanding Speed Demos Archive rules that "manually editing/adding/removing game files is generally not allowed." Groobo's apparent splicing of multiple game versions and differently seeded save files also seems to go against SDA rules, which say that "there obviously needs to be continuity between segments in terms of inventory, experience points or whatever is applicable for the individual game."After being presented with the TAS team's evidence, SDA wrote that "it has been determined that Groobo's run very likely does not stem from only legitimate techniques, and as such, has itself been banished barring new developments." But Groobo's record is still listed as the "Fastest completion of an RPG videogame" by Guinness World Records, which has not offered a substantive response to the team's findings (Guinness has not responded to a request for comment from Ars Technica).
      A recent  speedrun on a confirmed legitimate dungeon seed.

          This might seem like a pretty petty issue to spend weeks of time and attention debunking. But at a recent presentation attended by Ars, Cecil said he was motivated to pursue it because "it did harm. Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category [of ]. No one tried, no one could."Because of Groobo's previously unknown modifications to make an impossible-to-beat run, "this big running community just stopped trying to run this game in that category," Cecil said. "For more than a decade, this had a chilling impact on that community." With Groobo's run out of the way, though, new runners are setting new records on confirmed legitimate RNG seeds, and with the aid of TAS tools.In the end, Cecil said he hopes the evidence regarding Groobo's run will make people look more carefully at other record submissions. "Groobo had created a number of well-respected ... speedruns," he said. "[People thought] there wasn't any good reason to doubt him. In other words, there was bias in familiarity. This was a familiar character. Why would they cheat?"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>These Google Photos alternatives offer tons of storage options at a reasonable price</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/these-google-photos-alternatives-offer-tons-of-storage-options-at-a-reasonable-price/</link><author>Ivan Mehta</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Photos is a great service for storing images across devices.

ABSTRACT
Whenever a new technology appears, our first instinct as developers is to offer "text" as the primary method of interaction. This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.

At tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising. [...]

From the report: With Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency installing itself at the IRS amid a broader push to replace federal bureaucracy with machine-learning software, the tax agency's computing center in Martinsburg, West Virginia, will soon be home to a state-of-the-art Nvidia SuperPod AI computing cluster. According to the previously unreported February 5 acquisition document, the setup will combine 31 separate Nvidia servers, each containing eight of the company's flagship Blackwell processors designed to train and operate artificial intelligence models that power tools like ChatGPT. The hardware has not yet been purchased and installed, nor is a price listed, but SuperPod systems reportedly start at $7 million. The setup described in the contract materials notes that it will include a substantial memory upgrade from Nvidia.
 
Though small compared to the massive AI-training data centers deployed by companies like OpenAI and Meta, the SuperPod is still a powerful and expensive setup using the most advanced technology offered by Nvidia, whose chips have facilitated the global machine-learning spree. While the hardware can be used in many ways, it's marketed as a turnkey means of creating and querying an AI model. Last year, the MITRE Corporation, a federally funded military R&D lab, acquired a $20 million SuperPod setup to train bespoke AI models for use by government agencies, touting the purchase as a "massive increase in computing power" for the United States.
 
How exactly the IRS will use its SuperPod is unclear. An agency spokesperson said the IRS had no information to share on the supercomputer purchase, including which presidential administration ordered it. A 2024 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified 68 different AI-related projects underway at the IRS; the Nvidia cluster is not named among them, though many were redacted. But some clues can be gleaned from the purchase materials. "The IRS requires a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle complex machine learning (ML) workloads," the document explains. "The Nvidia Super Pod is a critical component of this infrastructure, providing the necessary compute power, storage, and networking capabilities to support the development and deployment of large-scale ML models."
 
The document notes that the SuperPod will be run by the IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division, or RAAS, which leads a variety of data-centric initiatives at the agency. While no specific uses are cited, it states that this division's Compliance Data Warehouse project, which is behind this SuperPod purchase, has previously used machine learning for automated fraud detection, identity theft prevention, and generally gaining a "deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive taxpayer behavior."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chinese Vice Minister says China and the US must work together to control rogue AI: &quot;If not...

Lyude and Danilo are doing a wonderful job and I've put all my trust into them.However, there is one thing I can't stand and it's hurting me the most. I'm convinced, no, my core believe is, that inclusivity and respect, working with others as equals, no power plays involved, is how we should work together within the Free and Open Source community.I can understand maintainers needing to learn, being concerned on technical points. Everybody deserves the time to understand and learn. It is my true belief that most people are capable of change eventually. I truly believe this community can change from within, however this doesn't mean it's going to be a smooth process.The moment I made up my mind about this was reading the following words written by a maintainer within the kernel community:"we are the thin blue line"This isn't okay. This isn't creating an inclusive environment. This isn't okay with the current political situation especially in the US. A maintainer speaking those words can't be kept. No matter how important or critical or relevant they are. They need to be removed until they learn. Learn what those words mean for a lot of marginalized people. Learn about what horrors it evokes in their minds.I can't in good faith remain to be part of a project and its community where those words are tolerated. Those words are not technical, they are a political statement. Even if unintentionally, such words carry power, they carry meanings one needs to be aware of. They do cause an immense amount of harm.I wish the best of luck for everybody to continue to try to work from within. You got my full support and I won't hold it against anybody trying to improve the community, it's a thankless job, it's a lot of work. People will continue to burn out.I got burned out enough by myself caring about the bits I maintained, but eventually I had to realize my limits. The obligation I felt was eating me from inside. It stopped being fun at some point and I reached a point where I simply couldn't continue the work I was so motivated doing as I've did in the early days.Please respect my wishes and put this statement as is into the tree.

- Built with modern Python best practices (async/await, type hints, functional-first)
- Optimized async I/O with anyio for multi-loop compatibility
- Smart worker process pool for CPU-bound tasks (OCR, doc conversion)
- Efficient batch processing with concurrent extractions
- Clean error handling with context-rich exceptionsI built this after struggling with existing solutions that were either synchronous-only, required complex deployments, or had poor async support. The goal was to create something that works well in modern async Python applications, can be easily dockerized or used in serverless contexts, and relies only on permissive OSS.Key advantages over alternatives:
- True async support with optimized I/O
- Minimal dependencies (much smaller than alternatives)
- Perfect for serverless and async web apps
- Local processing without API calls
- Built for modern Python codebases with rigorous typing and testingThe library is MIT licensed and open to contributions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux in any distribution is unobtainable for most people because the first two installation steps are basically impossible.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipyc1o/linux_in_any_distribution_is_unobtainable_for/</link><author>/u/trollfinnes</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:05:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, just before Christmas, I decided to check out Linux again (tried it ~20 years ago) because Windows 11 was about to cause an aneurysm.I was expecting to spend the "weekend" getting everything to work; find hardware drivers, installing various open source software and generally just 'hack together something that works'.To my surprise everything worked flawlessly first time booting up. I had WiFi, sound, usb, webcam, memory card reader, correct screen resolution. I even got battery status and management! It even came with a nice litte 'app center' making installation of a bunch of software as simple as a click!And I remember thinking any Windows user could  install Linux and would get comfortable using it in an afternoon.I'm pretty 'comfortable' in anything PC and have changed boot orders and created bootable things since the early 90's and considered that part of the installation the easiest part.However, most people have never heard about any of them, and that makes the two steps seem 'impossible'.I recently convinced a friend of mine, who also couldn't stand Window11, to install Linux instead as it would easily cover all his PC needs. And while he is definitely in the upper half of people in terms of 'tech savvyness', both those "two easy first steps" made it virtually impossible for him to install it. He easily managed downloading the .iso, but turning that iso into a bootable USB-stick turned out to be too difficult. But after guiding him over the phone he was able to create it.But he wasn't able to get into bios despite all my attempts explaining what button to push and whenNext day he came over with his laptop. And just out of reflex I just started smashing the F2 key (or whatever it was) repeatingly and got right into bios where I enabled USB boot and put it at the top at the sequence.After that he managed to install Linux just fine without my supervision.But it made me realise that the two first steps in installing Linux, that are second nature to me and probably everyone involved with Linux from people just using it to people working on huge distributions, makes them virtually impossible for most people to install it.I don't know enough about programming to know of this is possible:Instead of an .iso file for download some sort of .exe file can be downloaded that is able to create a bootable USB-stick and change the boot order?That would 'open up' Linux to  more people, probably orders of magnitude..]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eating From Plastic Takeout Containers Can Increase Heart Failure Risk, Study Finds</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/0555235/eating-from-plastic-takeout-containers-can-increase-heart-failure-risk-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new study suggests that frequent consumption of food from plastic takeout containers significantly increases the risk of congestive heart failure due to gut biome changes that trigger inflammation and circulatory damage. The Guardian reports: The authors used a two-part approach, first looking into the frequency with which over 3,000 people in China ate from plastic takeout containers, and whether they had heart disease. They then exposed rats to plastic chemicals in water that was boiled and poured in carryout containers to extract chemicals. "The data revealed that high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure," the authors wrote. [...] They put boiling water in the containers for one, five or 15 minutes because plastic chemicals leach at much higher rates when hot contents are placed in containers -- the study cited previous research that found as many as 4.2m microplastic particles per sq cm can leach from plastic containers that are microwaved.
 
The authors then gave rats the water contaminated with leachate to drink for several months, then analyzed the gut biome and metabolites in the feces. It found notable changes. "It indicated that ingestion of these leachates altered the intestinal microenvironment, affected gut microbiota composition, and modified gut microbiota metabolites, particularly those linked to inflammation and oxidative stress," the authors wrote. They then checked the rats' heart muscle tissue and found it had been damaged. The study did not find a statistical difference in the changes and damage among rats that were exposed to water that had been in contact with plastic for one minute versus five or fifteen. The study has been published in the journal Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jane Street&apos;s Figgie card game</title><link>https://www.figgie.com/</link><author>eamag</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 09:59:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jane Street's fast-paced

He’s perhaps best known for the groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks, which inspired countless shows, including The X-Files, The Sopranos, and Lost.Lynch was genuinely a good human being who cared deeply for his actors and crew. He discovered extraordinary talent like Naomi Watts, who had struggled to land a major role in a Hollywood movie after 10 years of auditioning. From the interviews he gave, it quickly becomes apparent that he respected people of all kinds and never put anyone down – even those who truly deserved it.Lynch is famous for refusing to explain his movies. Although not a fan of his previous work, the great film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that Mulholland Drive remained compulsively watchable while refusing to yield to interpretation.While Lynch offered very little in terms of what his movies meant, he was generous in sharing his views on creativity, work, and life in general. As a tribute to Lynch, I’d like to share my perspective on his life lessons from a software developer’s viewpoint.Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.We’ve all got hundreds or even thousands of ideas floating around in our brains. But the really big ones are few and far between. Once you catch a good one –because they’re so rare– write it down immediately, says Lynch. From there, ideas attract other ideas and start to grow from their initial seed state. The final job is to translate those ideas into a medium, whether it’s a film, a painting, or software.The idea is the whole thing. If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really. You just keep working to make it look like that idea looked, feel like it felt, sound like it sounded, and be the way it was.Software development is part art, part engineering. We don’t build the same software over and over again – virtually all software is crafted by hand, sometimes with help from AI. If you ask two developers to create a non-trivial program, it’s very likely that the programs they produce will be different, even if the functionality is the same. Under the hood, the programming language, data structures, and overall architecture may be completely different. And on the surface, the user interfaces may look nothing alike.It’s a good habit to listen to what users have to say, but they often can only describe their problems – they rarely come up with good ideas to solve them. And that’s OK. It’s our job to find the right ideas, implement them well, and solve tricky problems in a way we, and hopefully the users, will love.My friend Bushnell Keeler, who was really responsible for me wanting to be a painter, said you need four hours of uninterrupted time to get one hour of good painting in, and that is really true.Like other creative fields, writing code requires deep concentration. We need to hold complex structures in our minds while working through problems. Switching between coding and other tasks disrupts  – that magical state of mind where we lose track of time and produce code effortlessly. That’s why many developers hate meetings – they are toxic to our productivity.I believe you need technical knowledge. And also, it’s really, really great to learn by doing. So, you should make a film.Software development is one of those rare fields where a college degree isn’t required to succeed. Yes, we should all know the basics, but in my experience, new college graduates often lack the practical knowledge to be effective developers.The real learning happens through hands-on experience: building real projects, debugging tricky problems, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code over time. It’s crucial to never stop learning, experimenting, and iterating on our craft.Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn’t even exist.Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Originally conceived to meet the demand for information sharing between scientists around the world, the web went mainstream within just a few years.Linus Torvalds created Git due to a licensing dispute over BitKeeper, the original version control system used for Linux development. The need for a new tool led to Git becoming the most widely used version control system today.I feel that a set should be like a happy family. Almost like Thanksgiving every day, happily going down the road together.Be kind to your teammates, don’t embarrass them. They may not be perfect, but accept them for who they are. The most important trait of an effective software development team is psychological safety –that is, team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other, as corroborated by Google’s research on the subject.It’s OK to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them. Knowing that your team has your back when things go south is a wonderful feeling.Most of Hollywood is about making money - and I love money, but I don’t make the films thinking about money.Just like Lynch prioritizes creativity over financial gain, some of the most impactful software projects started with an open source model, and they literally changed the world, such as Linux, PostgreSQL, and Node.js, just to name a few.What makes these projects remarkable is that they didn’t emerge from corporate boardrooms – they were built by communities of passionate developers, collaborating across the world.Money is just a means to an end. Unfortunately, many get this confused.David, thank you for making the world a better place!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Container Networking - Kubernetes with Calico</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ipw9bu/container_networking_kubernetes_with_calico/</link><author>/u/tkr_2020</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:25:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: VLAN 10: VLAN 20When traffic flows from VLAN 10 to VLAN 20, the outer IP header shows:The inner IP header reflects:The firewall administrator notices that both the source and destination ports appear as , indicating they are set to .

Today, many organizations use cloud services and micro-services. In such environments, IP addresses assigned to virtual machines or services can often be volatile, meaning they can change or be reassigned to other organizations or users. This presents a risk for services relying on static IPs for security configurations and may introduce impersonation or data leakage issues.This morning, I was setting up a new environment. I got a new IP address assigned by my hosting company and deployed a classic configuration: a reverse-proxy redirecting to many web services and generating Let’s Encrypt certificates.Once the reverse proxy was in place, I started to deploy more services but detected some activity in the log (always keep an eye on your logs!) and saw this:{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T06:22:33Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \"postmaster.xxxxxxxx.hu\""}

A quick DNS request confirmed that these hosts are resolving to my newly assigned IP!Worse, this organization seems to still be using POP3, and a user (or a script) is still trying to fetch emails using this protocol!When you move to another hosting solution, update your DNS recordsCleanup your DNS zones and remove unwanted entriesUse mechanisms to preserve your IP addresses (like “Elastic IPs” provided by AWS)Xavier Mertens (@xme)

The researchers developed a comprehensive test suite covering mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism using both quantitative and qualitative questions.Key technical aspects: - Multi-level assessment hierarchy ranging from fact recall to conceptual transfer - Controlled vocabulary to minimize linguistic pattern matching - Cross-context validation using parallel problems - Integration of numerical computation and conceptual explanation tasks - Standardized scoring rubrics based on educational assessment methodsMain results: - GPT-4 achieved 76% accuracy on basic physics calculations - Performance dropped to 43% on cross-context transfer problems - Significant variance in performance across physics domains - Models showed strong correlation between mathematical ability and physics problem-solving - Systematic errors emerged when combining multiple physics conceptsI think this methodology provides a more rigorous approach to understanding LLM capabilities than previous work. The educational testing framework helps distinguish between surface-level pattern matching and deeper conceptual understanding. This could lead to better benchmarks for measuring AI progress in scientific reasoning.I think the results highlight current limitations in LLMs' ability to transfer physics knowledge across contexts - something that's crucial for real scientific work. The systematic evaluation approach could be extended to other scientific domains.TLDR: New assessment framework based on educational testing principles reveals LLMs have decent physics calculation abilities but struggle with deeper conceptual understanding and knowledge transfer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: Futures of Ethereum II - Censorship Resistance (2/15/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/2-15-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:11:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @rootstock_io [ 3 Min read ]

Amazon accounts for more than 80% of all online book sales, according to market research firm IBISWorld. Not to mention it owns Kindle, a wildly popular format for e-reading.Bookshop.org is ready to change that. Today, the online platform that connects readers to local bookstores launched an e-reading platform of its own. For the first time, local independent bookstores can sell e-books to customers, says CEO and founder Andy Hunter. Bookshop.org launches e-book platform to support local bookstoresHunter is in the business of solving logistical problems for readers. In 2020, he launched Bookshop.org to support local businesses losing sales to Amazon Books. Years later, as an e-reader himself, he realized how hard it was to continue his “socially-conscious consumerism” mindset of buying locally when it came to digital titles.“Right now, no matter how much you love your local bookstore, if you want to read an e-book, you have to go to Amazon or another alternate platform and you can’t support your local bookstore,” Hunter tells USA TODAY. “E-books are an important revenue stream for publishers and authors and they could be for independent bookstores.”The result is an app (available for iOS and Android, and accessible from a web browser) with nearly a million titles from major publishing houses. Readers can annotate, add notes, look up words and sync across all their devices. There's a search function if consumers know the book they want to read, and if they don't, there's an explore page with suggestions by genre.Most importantly for Hunter, booksellers will take home the profits, which he says has prevented local businesses from thriving in e-book sales until now. “There’s no real way to make it profitable, but we don’t care about it being profitable,” Hunter says, citing the socially conscious company’s B corporation status. “Our mission is to help independent bookstores survive and thrive in the digital age.”With discounts, quick shipping and Kindle synching, Amazon Books has long been an appealing option to many readers. But now, Hunter says there’s “no reason on Earth to give a billionaire your $9.99 for your e-book,” as publishers set a fixed price for e-books and there’s no shipping to compete with. Bookshop.org’s new initiative follows a growing movement across social media – not just exclusively in bookish communities – to forgo Amazon and other big-box sellers in favor of shopping locally. “In an age of billionaires and giant e-commerce companies and our loss of control of our lives to Silicon Valley oligarchs, that they know we’re going to fight back against that and we’re going to stay local,” Hunter says. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can invest in, we can support our local community even when we’re reading digital books.”E-reader features to include social sharingBookshop.org's platform also includes a “quote-sharing” feature for social media, Hunter says. He wants books to catch up to the way other media is shared – it’s easy to share your Spotify or Apple Music listening to your Instagram story, and you can even post about your workouts with some apps. But if you want to share a quote from a book, readers have to take a photo of the physical book or a screenshot. “They should be able to share that to social media and somebody else should be able to click in, buy the book using Apple Pay and start reading it right away,” Hunter says. “That’ll fuel all kinds of discussions about books on TikTok and places like that, and all of that will benefit the independent bookstores because it will be them selling the books that people are talking about.”Looking for your next great read?

Ars Technica reports: The researchers started out by using the standard tools they developed to handle protein design, including an AI tool named RFDiffusion, which uses a random seed to generate a variety of protein backgrounds. In this case, the researchers asked RFDiffusion to match the average positions of the amino acids in a family of ester-breaking enzymes. The results were fed to another neural network, which chose the amino acids such that they'd form a pocket that would hold an ester that breaks down into a fluorescent molecule so they could follow the enzyme's activity using its glow.
 
Of the 129 proteins designed by this software, only two of them resulted in any fluorescence. So the team decided they needed yet another AI. Called PLACER, the software was trained by taking all the known structures of proteins latched on to small molecules and randomizing some of their structure, forcing the AI to learn how to shift things back into a functional state (making it a generative AI). The hope was that PLACER would be trained to capture some of the structural details that allow enzymes to adopt more than one specific configuration over the course of the reaction they were catalyzing. And it worked. Repeating the same process with an added PLACER screening step boosted the number of enzymes with catalytic activity by over three-fold.
 
Unfortunately, all of these enzymes stalled after a single reaction. It turns out they were much better at cleaving the ester, but they left one part of it chemically bonded to the enzyme. In other words, the enzymes acted like part of the reaction, not a catalyst. So the researchers started using PLACER to screen for structures that could adopt a key intermediate state of the reaction. This produced a much higher rate of reactive enzymes (18 percent of them cleaved the ester bond), and two -- named "super" and "win" -- could actually cycle through multiple rounds of reactions. The team had finally made an enzyme.
 
By adding additional rounds alternating between structure suggestions using RFDiffusion and screening using PLACER, the team saw the frequency of functional enzymes increase and eventually designed one that had an activity similar to some produced by actual living things. They also showed they could use the same process to design an esterase capable of digesting the bonds in PET, a common plastic. The research has been published in the journal Science.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reading Documentation Shouldn&apos;t Be a Chore</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/reading-documentation-shouldnt-be-a-chore?source=rss</link><author>Rami James</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:48:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a developer, documentation is both your greatest ally and your worst nemesis. It's the key to unlocking the power of libraries, frameworks, APIs, and even entire programming languages. Yet, many developers struggle to effectively navigate and extract the information they need from documentation. It's a skill that can be learned, and it's one that can make a huge difference in your productivity and the quality of your work. New developers often lack this critical skill, and find themselves stopped in their progress towards becoming a better dev because of it.\
I'm currently writing the docs for Vewrite, a project management tool for writing teams. It occurs to me that I've been writing documentation for a long time, and I've gotten pretty good at it. I've also gotten pretty good at reading documentation, and I think that this is a skill that is often overlooked.\
Let's talk about how to equip you with the skills to read documentation better, turning this often daunting task into a smooth and efficient process.Why is reading documentation challenging?\
Good documentation is essential. It provides the definitive guide to how software works, saving you countless hours of pointless, frustrating trial and error. Bad documentation is a nightmare. It's like trying to navigate a maze blindfolded, with no map and no sense of direction, guided by a liar.\
If you have access to the code you are working against, that's great and you should use it. Poke around and see what you're supposed to do by reading the code. But, in many cases (and almost all of the time with proprietary software), you're going to have to rely on the documentation to get you through. However, documentation can vary wildly in quality. Some is meticulously crafted, while others can be uninformative, outdated, or even misleading. This inconsistency is one of the reasons why reading documentation can be challenging.Some docs are just a dumping ground for information, with no clear structure or organization. This can make it difficult to find what you're looking for, and you end up spending more time searching than actually learning. A well-structured set of documentation will have a clear table of contents, with sections and subsections that guide you through the material in a logical order. This makes it easier to navigate and find the information you need.In general, I'll also recommend some Getting Started section which points different types of users to the information which is most critical to them.Information overload is another common hurdle. Docs can cover a vast range of features and functionalities, making it difficult to find the specific information you need. For example, a large framework might have hundreds of classes and methods, and trying to find the one you need can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.Unclear technical jargon can also be a barrier, as documentation is inherently technical, and sometimes the terminology can be confusing, especially for newcomers. This often stems from the assumption that the reader has a certain level of prior knowledge as it is largely written by the team who has developed the software and has an intimate knowledge of its innner workings.Outdated information can be a major problem. Software evolves rapidly, and documentation can sometimes lag behind, leading to frustration and wasted time. A library might have deprecated a certain function, but the documentation might still describe it as the primary way to perform a task. The teams who produce software should be including accurate documentation creation and upkeep in their backlog as part of their process. Unfortunately, in the haste to get features shipped to market, corners are often cut. I've spent the better part of the last decade advocating for better processes that lead to better docs at a number of companies, and the biggest challenge here has been explaining to stakeholders where the value is.How to read documentation effectivelyOver the years, I've developed a structured approach to how I tackle reading new documentation. I've found that this approach helps me quickly get up to speed with new tools and technologies, and I hope it can help you too.\
By and large this method has three parts: understanding the structure of the documentation itself, understanding the way that the system I'm learning works, and lastly engaging with the material in the docs. First I get the lay of the land, and then I try to focus in on the details.Understand the structure of the documentationDocs are written by people, and every sysyem is going to be different. That means that every set of docs is going to be different. Some docs are organized by feature, others by use case, and still others by API endpoint. Understanding the structure of the documentation is key to finding the information you need quickly. Start by scanning the table of contents to get an overview of the topics covered. This will help you get a sense of the scope of the documentation and where to find specific information. You'll want to quickly click through the docs and get a sense of how things work, how they are organized, and where you can find reference materials if there are any.\
I find that this initial run through also trickles some information about the system and its components into my brain. It's not comprehensive at all, but it's a good start.Every piece of software is a system, and understanding how that system works is key to understanding how to use it. This is where the documentation can be a huge help. Good documentation will provide you with a high-level overview of the system, explaining how the different components fit together and how they interact. This can help you understand the context in which a particular feature or function is used, and how it relates to the rest of the system. This is where you start to get a sense of how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems.\
A lot of the problems that you'll encounter when building software will be because you fundamentally don't understand how what you're building with actually works. This is where the documentation can be a huge help. It can provide you with the context you need to understand how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems. Use that to your advantage and you'll be able to build better software, faster.This is often the most tedious and boring part. You have to actually take a few hours and read through the entire docs. For smaller libraries or APIs, this isn't going to be a big deal and you'll be able to fit most of it into your head. For larger systems, this is going to be a multi-day process. You'll want to take notes, ask questions, and engage with the material in a way that helps you understand it. This is where you start to get a sense of how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems. If it doesn't all fit into your head now, that's ok. You'll remember more than you think you will, and when you're actually doing development it will be an order of magnitude faster to find an answer if you've already seen it once.I've actually found that modern AIs are absolutely awesome for this step. You can use them as you would a more experienced developer and ask them questions about the system, the functionality, and the docs themselves. You can't trust everything that they say, but you can't really trust what another developer always tells you. I've found that being able to have a discussion with an AI about a library or API really helps me understand how stuff works at a deeper level.Strategies for effectively reading docsDespite these challenges, mastering the art of reading documentation is doable. Here are some strategies to keep in mind while you are digging around in docs, looking for an answer.If you don't know where you're going, you may never get there. Before you dive into a set of docs, you may want to set a clear objective for yourself. Are you trying to understand a specific function, integrate a new library, or troubleshoot an error? Having a clear objective will help you focus your search.\
For example, if you're trying to fix a bug where a specific function isn't returning the expected value, and your code matches what the docs say that you're supposed to do, your goal is to understand the function's place in the wider system. The problem is going to be a few levels up and the docs are likely going to be the key to understanding how the software works at a higher level.\
Don't immediately jump into the nitty-gritty details. Begin with the introductory sections, tutorials, or quick start guides to get a high-level understanding of the system. Your assumptions will often be wrong, and it is good to base your work on a foundation of truth. Think of it like reading the abstract of a research paper before diving into the full text. These introductory materials often provide a roadmap to the rest of the documentation.Use the structure of the docs to your advantageUse the table of contents and search function (these are your best friends) to quickly locate the sections you need. Don't be afraid to experiment with different search terms. Scan through the entire table of contents. Poke around and get a really good feel for how the documentation is structured. Sometimes you will find that your answers are hidden adjacent to where you thought that they would be.Real-world examples are invaluable, and the best docs are going to include them. They demonstrate how to use the code in practice and can often clarify confusing concepts. Pay close attention to the context in which the examples are used. A code snippet demonstrating how to use a particular function is much more helpful if it's accompanied by an explanation of what the function does and why it's being used in that specific scenario.Pay attention to the detailsWhen looking at function or method definitions, carefully examine the data types of the parameters and return values. This will help you understand how to use them correctly. Sometimes, crucial information is hidden in footnotes, warnings, or less prominent sections. Make sure you scan the entire page, not just the headlines. A seemingly minor note might contain a critical piece of information that can save you a lot of trouble. Documentation often contains links to related topics or other parts of the documentation. Don't hesitate to follow these links to gain a deeper understanding. These links can often lead you to more detailed explanations, examples, or even the source code itself.This is one of the biggest reasons why I believe that open-source can be such a boon for companies who want to build an ecosystem of developers around their software. Sometimes, the best way to understand how something works is to look at the source code itself. Don't be afraid to dive in, especially if the documentation is unclear. Reading the source code can give you a much clearer picture of what's happening under the hood. Try out the code examples and modify them to see how they behave. This is a great way to solidify your understanding and discover edge cases. Experimenting with the code is like conducting your own little science experiment. You can change the inputs, observe the outputs, and gain a deeper understanding of how the code works. If you're still stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to the community for help. Forums, mailing lists, and online communities are valuable resources for getting your questions answered. The developer community is generally very helpful, and there are often people who have encountered the same problems you're facing.Reading documentation shouldn't be a passive activity. Engage with the material by taking notes, jotting down key points, examples, and any questions you have. Annotating the documentation (if possible), highlighting important sections and adding your own comments can also be helpful. Creating your own examples, writing small programs that use the features you're learning about, is a great way to reinforce your understanding. It's like practicing a musical instrument – the more you do it, the better you get.Reading documentation is a skill that improves with practice. By adopting these strategies and actively engaging with the material, you can transform documentation from a source of frustration into a powerful tool for learning and development. So, embrace the documentation, and unlock the full potential of the software you're working with!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Expose (And Fix) Hidden Bottlenecks in Adobe Experience Manager</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-expose-and-fix-hidden-bottlenecks-in-adobe-experience-manager?source=rss</link><author>Giuseppe Baglio</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:45:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn how to read thread dumps and take control of your application’s runtime behaviour.\
When your Adobe Experience Manager (or in general any JAVA application) instance shows signs of sluggishness, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and dive into the world of thread dumps. IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) is here to help you untangle the web of threads and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to use IBM TDA to diagnose performance issues in AEM like a pro.Before you can start analyzing thread dumps, you’ll need to download and install IBM Thread Analyzer. Head over to the official IBM website or your organization’s repository to grab the latest version. Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions for your operating system. It’s quick, easy, and sets the stage for some serious troubleshooting.Thread dumps are snapshots of all the threads running in your AEM instance at a specific moment. To capture them:Use tools like , , or AEM’s built-in functionality to generate thread dumps. There is a well-documented page on Adobe Docs.Save the thread dump files to your local machine.\
Pro Tip: Capture multiple thread dumps at intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds) to get a clearer picture of long-running issues.Launch IBM TDA and open the thread dump files you’ve captured. Simply drag and drop the files into the application or use the “Open” option to load them. Once loaded, you’ll see a list of thread dumps on the left-hand panel.To analyze a specific thread dump:Select the file from the listing.Click the Thread Detail button at the top\
This will display a detailed view of all the threads in that dump. Now, let’s sort the threads by Stack Depth, ensuring the longest stacks appear at the top. Why? Threads with deeper stacks often indicate more complex operations, which are usually where performance issues hide.Focus on threads with a stack depth of 10 lines or longer. These threads are typically the ones consuming the most resources. Take notes on any threads that stand out — whether due to their names, states, or stack traces.Next, sort the threads by their State. Scroll down to the Runnable threads. These are the threads that were actively using CPU time when the dump was taken. Keep an eye out for application-specific threads, such as:Background job threads: Handling tasks like indexing or replication.Request threads: Named like 127.0.0.1 [timestamp] GET /path HTTP/1.1.For each request thread, extract the timestamp from its name (e.g., ). This Unix epoch timestamp tells you when the user’s browser made the request. Convert it to a human-readable date/time using a tool like https://www.epochconverter.com/. Compare this with the thread dump’s timestamp to calculate how long the request has been active.If the difference is unusually large (e.g., several seconds or minutes), it could indicate a bottleneck in your application.\
Pro Tip: Keep an eye out for patterns. Are certain types of requests consistently taking longer? For example, requests involving complex queries or resource-heavy operations might be worth optimizing. Additionally, if you notice that specific URLs or endpoints are frequently associated with long-running threads, consider profiling those areas of your codebase.Thread analysis requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond simple waiting states. While the IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) interface provides valuable insights into thread relationships, understanding the full context of thread behavior helps create a more complete picture of your application’s performance characteristics.Understanding Thread StatesWhen examining threads in TDA, you’ll encounter several important states:: These threads are either currently executing or ready to execute when CPU time becomes available. A Runnable state doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem — it’s the natural state for actively working threads.: These threads have temporarily paused execution while waiting for a condition to be met. The waiting state can occur for many legitimate reasons, including:Resource availability (database connections, file handles)Task completion in other threads\
: These threads are specifically waiting to acquire a monitor or lock. While similar to waiting, blocked states specifically indicate synchronization-related pauses.Analyzing Thread RelationshipsWhen you identify a thread of interest, examine its relationships with other threads using this systematic approach:Direct Lock Relationships:Examine the Waiting Threads panel for immediate dependenciesReview the stack traces of waiting threads to understand why they’re blockedNote the duration of the wait states if available\
2. Resource Usage Patterns:Look for patterns in resource acquisition and releaseIdentify potential resource bottlenecksConsider alternative resource management strategies\
3. Architectural Implications:Evaluate if the observed behaviour aligns with the system’s designConsider if the current threading model is appropriateAssess the impact on scalabilityUnderstanding Lock Types and VisibilityThread dumps may not show all types of contention. Modern Java applications use various synchronization mechanisms:Intrinsic Locks (synchronized keyword):Show clear owner-waiter relationshipsStack traces indicate synchronization points\
2. Explicit Locks (java.util.concurrent):May require additional tooling to visualize\
3. Non-blocking Mechanisms (Don’t appear as traditional locks but can impact performance):When you identify genuine contention issues, consider these approaches:Implement finer-grained lockingConsider non-blocking alternativesImplement backoff strategiesConsider caching solutions\
3. Architectural ChangesEvaluate asynchronous processingConsider parallel execution pathsImplement queue-based approaches\
Remember that thread analysis is an iterative process. Patterns that emerge in one thread dump might not represent consistent behaviour. Always validate your findings across multiple dumps and different time periods before making significant changes to your application.Comparing thread dumps across time reveals important performance patterns in your AEM instance. Start by establishing a baseline during normal operation, including peak usage periods and maintenance windows. This baseline provides context for identifying abnormal thread behaviour.To determine if a thread is persistent across time:Select multiple thread dumps from different points in time.Click the Compare Threads button in IBM TDA.Look for threads that remain in the Runnable state across all dumps, especially those with consistently long stack traces.\
Use IBM TDA’s Compare Threads feature to analyze dumps from different time points. Focus on threads that persist across multiple dumps, examining their states, stack depths, and resource usage. Remember that thread persistence alone doesn’t automatically indicate a problem — background services naturally run continuously, while request threads should complete within expected timeframes.\
When analyzing persistent Runnable threads, correlate their behaviour with system metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times. Consider the thread’s purpose: background services, request processing, or maintenance tasks each have different expected patterns. For request threads, compare their duration against defined service level agreements and business requirements.\
Got a suspicious thread pattern? Don’t jump to conclusions just yet! Try to recreate the issue in your test environment first — it’s like having a dress rehearsal before the main show. Take a good look at your code, double-check those config settings, and consider what else might be stirring up trouble in your environment. Keep track of what you find with real performance numbers and test results — you’ll thank yourself later.\
Once you’re sure you’ve caught a real performance culprit (backed by solid evidence, of course), it’s time to fix it.If analyzing threads doesn’t yield actionable insights, switch to the Monitor Detail view:Go back to the thread listing.Select a thread dump and click the Monitor Detail button.IBM TDA will display a tree view of monitor-owning threads and their waiting threads.\
This view helps you identify threads that are holding monitors and causing contention. Understanding thread monitors is like viewing the nervous system of your application. These synchronization mechanisms control how threads access shared resources, preventing potential conflicts and ensuring smooth operation.\
Monitor interactions can reveal critical performance insights. Some threads will be actively processing requests, while others wait for resource acquisition or participate in coordinated activities. Not all waiting or idle threads indicate a problem — they’re often part of the application’s natural resource management strategy.\
However, not all threads are equally important:Ignore idle thread pool threads: These threads typically have ≤10 stack lines and are part of thread pools like the servlet engine. They’re usually harmless unless they dominate the thread pool.Focus on application-specific monitors: Look for monitors tied to your application’s business logic, such as database connections, caching mechanisms, or custom synchronization blocks.\
Remember that thread and monitor analysis is both an art and a science. Each application has unique characteristics, so approach performance optimization with curiosity and a holistic perspective. The goal is not to eliminate all waiting threads but to understand and optimize their interactions.\
Advanced Tip: If you notice certain monitors are frequently contended, consider refactoring your code to reduce lock granularity. For example:Replace coarse-grained locks with fine-grained ones.Use non-blocking algorithms or concurrent data structures where possible.Optimize database queries to reduce the time threads spend waiting for locks.In some thread dumps, you might notice the  appearing frequently. This service handles tasks like Garbage Collection, memory management, and resource cleanup. While the Collector Service might seem like a mysterious background process, understanding its behaviour is key to maintaining optimal system performance — think of it like a diligent janitor in a large office building.\
When you notice frequent Collector Service activity, don’t immediately assume disaster. It’s normal for the Collector Service to show up occasionally, but excessive activity could indicate underlying issues:Memory leaks: Objects that are not being garbage collected can cause frequent GC cycles.High object churn: Rapid creation and destruction of objects can overwhelm the garbage collector.Improper JVM settings: Misconfigured heap sizes or GC algorithms can lead to inefficiencies.\
Here are some considerations to optimize resource usage:Tuning your JVM settings (e.g., increasing heap size, switching to G1GC).Reviewing your application’s memory allocation patterns to reduce unnecessary object creation.\
Garbage Collection is not a problem to be solved, but a dynamic system to be understood and optimized. Each application has unique characteristics, and there’s no universal solution.Thread dump analysis is a developer’s superpower — transforming you from a code writer to a performance detective. IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) is your key to understanding complex system behaviours, revealing hidden bottlenecks that impact your Java/AEM instance’s performance.\
Like learning an instrument, your skill improves with practice. Each thread dump becomes clearer, revealing intricate patterns of system interactions. The more you analyze, the more intuitive performance optimization becomes.\
Remember, practice makes perfect — the more you analyze thread dumps, the sharper your diagnostic skills will become. 📊💪\

A staggering number and a logical reason behind it – and it’s the main one, according to CB Insights. It’s not about a lack of funding, bad hires, or tough competition. The real question is whether people actually need what you’re about to offer them.\
Plus, having a great product isn’t enough. To win, you need to understand the competitive landscape, your audience, and how to get your brand in front of the right people. Drawing from my experience launching Yango Play in MENA — where we developed an AI-powered Entertainment SuperApp that quickly became one of the region’s leading streaming platforms — I want to share the key steps we took to make it the success it is now.Selecting the right market is a balance between competition and profitability. Some regions offer low competition but limited revenue potential, while others may be more lucrative but very, very saturated. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has a large population and low competition, making it an appealing early-stage entry option. But, lower consumer spending restricts growth. MENA, on the other hand, has a smaller population but significantly higher consumer purchasing power, making it an attractive place for expansion.\
 is just as critical as market selection. Entering too early may mean slow adoption while entering too late risks facing intense competition.If competition is low, it provides an advantage and accelerates market growth. The key is to enter before the market experiences a surge in adoption.\
In the CIS region, the subscription economy remained relatively flat at 1–2 million subscribers for several years before suddenly accelerating to 100% annual growth. The same pattern emerged in MENA, indicating that the region was nearing a similar tipping point, making it the optimal time to enter.\
Market data is here to reinforce this statement. MENA’s total population is around 500 million, with 13.5 million already subscribed to video streaming services. Just for reference, penetration of subscription services in CIS region stands at 15-20%, with slight differences between countries. Even without complex economic modeling, these figures indicated a major opportunity for subscription-based services in MENA. So, an ideal market for expansion. In this case, the potential formed the perfect ground for selecting the market and strategy – the choice was easy.\
Still, the region was already highly competitive, with more than 50 video streaming platforms and many global and local music services. We had strong competitors in each category, so for us entering the market required more than just identifying demand.Product and Content DifferentiationCreating a strong differentiator was key, and competing head-on with zero brand awareness would have been very much an uphill battle.\
Take YANGO’s case study on product differentiation. We simultaneously implemented two strategies — with **differentiation through the product and content. \n An Entertainment SuperApp — a single subscription combining music, movies, and games. At the time, there wasn’t anything similar, so we gladly took the opportunity for this strategic entry point. Users typically juggle multiple subscriptions: one for music, another for video, and yet another for gaming. We built everything into one app under a single subscription. This way, we got on the growing global trend toward bundled entertainment services and also filled a gap in our target market. Win-win.Netflix has long become the go-to platform for global content. We took a different route and built an ecosystem tailored to local tastes. Our SuperApp has regional music, Arabic-language films, and localized gaming options, making it much more relevant to MENA audiences. This became a critical differentiator, making our product not just another streaming service but a culturally attuned entertainment hub.\
Conclusion: To successfully differentiate a product, the best strategy is to identify weaknesses or unmet needs in competing products — and fill those gaps.\
In crowded markets, pricing is as crucial as the product. It’s not the features that make or break the product – it’s about making your product the most logical choice.\
So, we introduced a long trial period and a bundled pricing model, allowing users to get music and movies for the price of one. Instead of discounting, we maximized perceived value, making the subscription an easy, rational decision.\
Expanding into a new market meant building a local team and adapting to language and cultural nuances. With deep market research, perfect timing, and a product tailored to real consumer needs, the SuperApp secured a strong foothold in a high-growth market. How did we tackle these challenges? That’s a story for another article.Audience Differentiation: Defining the Target UserUsers have mental “boxes” where they sort every new product they see. Food delivery? That goes into one box. A streaming service? Another box. But if your product doesn’t fit neatly into a box, it triggers confusion — people don’t know what to do with it. And when something feels unfamiliar, the default reaction is to ignore it.\
That’s why crystal-clear positioning isn’t optional — it’s survival. If users can’t instantly grasp who your product is for and why they need it, you’re fighting an uphill battle. But just fitting into a category isn’t enough. You have to own it. When people think about entertainment subscriptions, they should immediately think of your brand.\
How do you make that happen? Precision. Messaging needs to be sharp, clear, and unmistakable. Instead of vague positioning, spell it out: “This is a service for modern Arabic-speaking users.” That clarity eliminates confusion and makes it easier for potential subscribers to see how the product fits into their everyday world.\
Brand anchoring is everything— the simpler and more memorable the positioning, the stronger the audience connection. If users struggle to define what the product is or who it’s for, they’ll tune it out. That’s a death sentence for any brand. The fix? Build an instant mental link. The moment someone thinks “entertainment subscription,” your SuperApp should be the first thing they recall.For startups that can’t outspend competitors, traditional marketing funnels — awareness → consideration → purchase — might not be the best play. Instead, skip the awareness stage and go straight for user acquisition.\
Here’s the logic: if someone downloads your app, they already know it exists. There’s no need to waste resources on brand awareness before conversion. Yes, this approach raises the cost per acquisition (CPA) since users are coming in cold, but the trade-off is greater control over spending and a more direct path to growth.\
The real power lies in performance-driven marketing, which focuses on conversions rather than broad exposure. Even brands with large media budgets rely on performance marketing as the most efficient way to drive actual user engagement. For lean startups, this strategy isn’t just viable — it’s essential.A product launch is a one-time shot at grabbing audience attention —  over a long, drawn-out campaign. The smartest play? Go loud.\
The launch moment is your biggest marketing asset — a rare window where PR and buzz can be built just around your existence. Instead of slow, passive brand-building, focus on making a splash that gets people talking.\
Once the initial hype kicks in, then comes the next phase — brick by brick, reinforcing brand awareness and earning user trust. We also saw this proven in the case of Kinopoisk (video streaming platform). We focused our marketing around major premieres such as Zack Snyder's Justice League, , and big exclusive original premieres.Shifting from Traditional Advertising to Alternative ChannelsFrom experience, buying direct media ads is often far less effective than leveraging influencers, word of mouth, and strong PR.\
Spending time on finding the right influencer, crafting a viral PR angle, or developing creative content that resonates delivers higher ROI than just pouring money into paid ads. In a budget-constrained environment, the smarter play is a two-step approach:Performance marketing first — drive installs and conversions while simultaneously learning how users interact with the product.Organic & influencer-driven marketing second — building credibility and momentum through earned media, viral content, and strategic partnerships.With influencers, you’re hitting two targets at once. First, their audience gets exposed to your service, boosting brand awareness. But the real power of influencer marketing is in its high conversion rates — it doesn’t just build visibility; it drives action. It works like performance marketing in many ways. Even better? The creative content influencers produce often performs exceptionally well in paid performance campaigns, making it a valuable asset beyond the initial collaboration. So, really, you’re getting even more value out of every campaign.\
This keeps acquisition costs under control and ensures real engagement and long-term user retention.\
One of the most successful cases of leveraging PR instead of direct advertising is Netflix. When expanding into new regions, the company rarely invests in traditional media ads. Instead, it focuses on localized content, influencer collaborations, and large-scale PR campaigns. This approach has allowed Netflix to dominate new markets without massive ad spending, making the brand recognizable through organic user discussions and viral interest.\
There are plenty of examples of viral brands and services — take Dubai Chocolate or Clubhouse, for instance. These apps and platforms managed to gain massive audiences with little to no marketing spend, relying purely on organic growth and word of mouth.The Founder as the Brand’s Leading AmbassadorIn a competitive market, PR isn’t just about press releases and media coverage — it’s about people. A founder holds a unique advantage: their voice becomes the product’s most powerful marketing tool.\
People don’t engage with companies — they engage with other people. Instead of relying on corporate statements or press releases, modern PR is about creating shareable content and building influence through authentic, human-driven narratives.\n Whether you are a startup or an established company, entering a new market requires more than a strong product — it asks for adaptability to evolving industry rules and dynamics. The strategies that worked in the past may no longer be effective in an environment where competition is fierce, consumer behavior is shifting, and digital ecosystems are rapidly changing. Success hinges on thorough market research, precise audience targeting, strategic product differentiation, and a well-structured promotional approach.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Every New Apple Device Expected in 2025</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/every-new-apple-device-expected-in-2025?source=rss</link><author>David Perru</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:21:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Hospitals Use AI to Boost Efficiency in Medical Imaging Technology</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-hospitals-use-ai-to-boost-efficiency-in-medical-imaging-technology?source=rss</link><author>Beth Rush</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:21:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Advancing health care technologies are crucial for doctors and patients. They could make medical services easier to provide while giving people better results, but only if everyone understands the bigger picture. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical tool that may become part of your health care services in the near future. Check out how physicians are using AI in medical imaging and diagnostics to learn why it could revolutionize the industry.What Is Medical Imaging Technology?Medical imaging technology is any tool that  to monitor normal and abnormal cases. The term includes various services that assist health care providers in making diagnoses. While they’ve existed long before automation, artificial intelligence in medical imaging is becoming more widespread through software updates.Different Types of Imaging TechniquesYou’ll better understand why AI could be an essential scientific tool if you know which imaging techniques people undergo. Learn more about each form of technology to understand AI’s advantages and challenges more easily.X-ray machines are penetrative imaging tools that look at targeted areas inside the body before sending the results to imaging technology. The machine sends ionizing radiation into a patient to gather pictures for diagnosis. X-rays are especially useful for bone inquiries because the radiation passes through them and makes them bright white.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)If you need an MRI, a doctor might inject a contrast agent into your bloodstream  before you sit in the machine. Radiowaves, a magnet and a computer processor look inside the selected part of your body to reveal everything from tissues to joints.Ultrasound imaging  to see what’s in your body. The machinery bounces soundwaves off of your organs and tissues instead. This isn’t a penetrative imaging technique, even though tools like transvaginal wands do work inside the vaginal canal.Doctors needing more complex imaging may order CT scans. They combine an X-ray with a computer to  before it bounces back on a plate behind the patient. The machinery scans in a circle, making it more useful for 3D images of internal damage or tumors.How Each Technique Benefits From AIIf health care experts have used imaging techniques since before AI existed, why would they benefit from it? There are a few key ways AI in medical imaging and diagnostics could improve each technique for providers and patients.Algorithms Can Process Images FasterWhen doctors order penetrative imaging, they wait for specialized hospital staff to conduct the process and return the pictures. The physician needs time to sit and analyze the image, which may not happen immediately if they have a busy schedule. Given that the U.S. will have a health care worker shortage , the high work demand on doctors is a long-term challenge.\
You don’t need to worry about not getting medical imaging results back quickly if your local hospital uses machine-learning algorithms to process patient results. AI can review results , providing recommendations for doctors when they have time to check the scans. A health care provider will still review your results, but they could get back to you faster with computerized assistance.AI May Catch Small Details BetterArtificial intelligence in medical imaging can do much more than summarize scans. The algorithms can also delineate structures in the human body. Advanced programs , tumors, and blood vessels and catch abnormalities in imaging results.\
Doctors might accidentally overlook similar developments if they’re too small to see with the human eye. Instead of going back for additional imaging in a few weeks or months, you could get earlier and more precise results with AI-supported medical imaging techniques.\
Remember — your doctor will still have the final say over your diagnosis. AI provides additional insights, but you’ll always need to talk with your health care provider before moving forward with treatments.Predictive Analytics May Provide Personalized Treatment SuggestionsPersonalized treatment plans start with diagnostic tools like medical imaging before combining your results with your health history. AI may assist with that process in more hospitals over time. Advanced algorithms can  while checking your scan results. Afterward, your doctor will review its recommended treatment options and use that data to start conversations with you.\
Together, you’ll decide the next best steps. AI won’t determine how you get medical care. Machine learning programs are an evergrowing tool that could make those conversations more straightforward by supplying potentially more accurate data.Some surgeries require medical imagery techniques for real-time data. Machine learning  in specialties like cardiothoracic, ophthalmology and general surgery. When health care professionals use it in real time, the algorithms can review images guiding surgeons through a procedure and assist in augmented visualization. Decision support may also be helpful for instant recommendations based on the patient’s collective medical history, like the likelihood of complications.Does AI Medical Imaging Guarantee Increased Efficiency?There’s no guarantee that AI medical imaging will increase the efficiency of real-time surgical decisions, diagnoses or treatment plans. Algorithms are only as good as their programming. Your doctor will always need to consider the data provided by any machine learning program before using their comprehensive medical knowledge and understanding of your needs to give an informed opinion.Potential Challenges Hospitals May FaceAs more hospitals start using AI programs to read results like medical scans, it’s important to understand the barriers that may prevent implementation. Keep those factors in mind if you’re hoping to see AI-assisted medical services where you live.Data Storage and ProtectionEverything processed and produced by artificial intelligence in medical imaging consists of sensitive data. Hospitals need robust storage capabilities to utilize AI-assisted medical imaging and keep patient information safe. Experts estimate data breaches  in 2024 and may get worse in years to come.\
Hospital administrative teams may need to partner with information technology experts internally or externally to set up data storage methods with extra protection. The process may delay AI implementation, depending on where each facility’s current cybersecurity measures stand.Accurate InterpretabilityMedical imaging technology with AI programs is relatively new. Hospital staff will likely need some form of training before they can use it with patients. Human error could cause less accurate interpretability as medical providers get used to reading and considering AI results while making recommendations.Integrating AI With Current Workflow SystemsAdding a software system to a new service is much less complicated than integrating it into something people are already doing. Hospitals are serving patients around the clock, so adding AI to their medical imaging processes without compromising patient care or service speed is challenging.\
Researchers also point out that health care systems  due to things like mismatching software programs or outdated technology. Analyzing, collecting and storing imaging data may require other updates before it can happen smoothly. Communicating AI information across departments or between hospitals may create additional struggles for health care providers.Anticipate More AI in Medical Imaging and DiagnosticsHealth care professionals are interested in artificial intelligence in medical imaging because it could help them work faster, provide personalized results and give more accurate treatment plans. It can also require complex integration planning before patients benefit from it. Staying up to date on those factors will keep you in the know with the ever-changing health care industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] What&apos;s the most promising successor to the Transformer?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ipvau4/d_whats_the_most_promising_successor_to_the/</link><author>/u/jsonathan</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:17:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[All I know about is MAMBA, which looks promising from an efficiency perspective (inference is linear instead of quadratic), but AFAIK nobody's trained a big model yet.

• The relic density coming from Planck satellite data [49]\
The total relic abundance of DM in our model is given by the sum of the scalar (𝜒) and fermion (𝑁3) relic abundances:\
Only for solutions falling exactly within the band given in Eq. (3.31) the totality of the DM can be explained by 𝜒 and 𝑁3.\
• Direct detection cross-section of DM scattering of nucleon set by various experiments such as XENON1T [66], LUX [65] and PandaX-II [174]\
We implemented the model in the SARAH package [175] to calculate all the vertices, mass matrices, tadpole equations etc. The thermal cross sections and DM relic abundance are determined using micrOMEGAS-5.0.8 [176]. Even though the model introduces new free parameters, not all of them are important to DM analysis. For example, self-quartic coupling 𝜆𝜒 does not play any role in DM phenomenology. Hence we choose to fix 𝜆𝜒 = 0.1 in our analysis. The remaining free parameters relevant for DM analysis can be chosen as:\
In the next sections, we will study how the DM phenomenology of this model depends on the free parameters and to do that we choose the following benchmark points which are allowed from all the above-mentioned constraints:\
which we can be utilized to compute the relic density of both the components,The direct detection study of our DM candidates 𝜒𝑅 and 𝑁3 are done here. The current experimental constraints on the DM direct detection assume the existence of only one DM candidate. As in our model, two-component DM candidates are predicted, and the contribution of each candidate to the direct detection cross-section should be rescaled by the fraction contributing to the total relic density. Hence it is convenient to define the fraction of the mass density of 𝑖th DM in the case of multi-component DM [156,157,178,179]\
The upper limit on the direct detection now can be recast as\
The above formula in Eq. (3.40) is an extension of the expression corresponding to the singlet scalar DM case [180]. The relative negative sign between the ℎ1 and ℎ2 contributions arises in our considered model as the couplings get modified according to Eq. (3.42). Due to the presence of the two different channels, depending on the parameter space, we can have destructive interference between these two channels, and direct detection can be very small.(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No Personal Liability For DOGE Yet, But With Two More Lawsuits We Get Closer</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/no-personal-liability-for-doge-yet-but-with-two-more-lawsuits-we-get-closer/</link><author>Cathy Gellis</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m going to keep pounding the drum for personal liability against Musk and DOGE, partly to scare them into backing off from their unlawful seizure of our government, and eventually to compensate us for the immense harm they’ve caused. So far it doesn’t seem like anyone has tried to personally sue them for damages, but several lawsuits are taking what might be a predicate step to establish the lawlessness of their claimed power, upon which liability claims would later be based. In addition to the AFGE litigation against OPM we already wrote about, which also names OPM itself for it wrongfully giving DOGE access to its systems, and the states’ lawsuit against the Treasury department for giving DOGE access to theirs, now we have (at this writing at least) two more lawsuits. But while those lawsuits were directed at specific agencies and the wrongfulness of Musk and DOGE’s misuse of power at these agencies, these new lawsuits come gunning for Musk and DOGE and their illegal seizure of power generally.They both base this argument on the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, but we’ll use the states’ complaint to illustrate how. As it sets forth:The Founders of this country fought for independence from the British monarchy due in no small part to the King’s despotic power to create an unlimited number of governmental offices and to fill those offices with the King’s supporters. In fact, this practice so severely undermined the Founders’ freedoms that it is a listed grievance in the Declaration of Independence. Informed by that history, the Framers of the Constitution crafted the Appointments Clause to protect against such tyranny in our system of government. The Appointments Clause was designed to buttress the separation of powers in two ways: first by requiring that Congress create an office before the President can fill it, and second by requiring that the Senate confirm a nominee to an office created by law. These limitations on the President’s power make executive appointments accountable to Congress and make the Senate’s confirmation decisions accountable to the people. See United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 12 (2021). In this way, the Appointments Clause serves a vital role in curbing Executive abuses of power.Yet here we have Musk wielding a shocking amount of power, the complaint continues:Mr. Musk’s seemingly limitless and unchecked power to strip the government of its workforce and eliminate entire departments with the stroke of a pen or click of a mouse would have been shocking to those who won this country’s independence. There is no office of the United States, other than the President, with the full power of the Executive Branch, and the sweeping authority now vested in a single unelected and unconfirmed individual is antithetical to the nation’s entire constitutional structure.We have an Appointments Clause for this very reason, the complaint reminds, “because it prevents one branch from “aggrandizing its power” or “dispensing it too freely . . . to inappropriate members of the Executive Branch.” It explains that there are three types of personnel that can work for the Executive Branch, “Principle Officers,” “Inferior Officers,” and employees. The last category doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but it also isn’t endowed with the sort of executive power that Musk has been claiming. The other categories are, which is why they require nominations by the President and Senate approval, unless Congress has already passed a law foregoing that process. But Congress can only do that for inferior officers, it has not done so here, and in any case Musk is acting more like a Principle Officer anyway.Furthermore, even for Principle Officers the President simply can’t make up a job with such power and appoint someone to it. And even Justice Thomas agrees! The complaint cites what he wrote less than a year ago in :Importantly, the Appointments Clause only grants the President the power to nominate officers to offices that Congress has already “established by Law.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. “If Congress has not reached a consensus that a particular office should exist, the Executive lacks the power to unilaterally create and then fill that office.” Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 650 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring). “By keeping the ability to create offices out of the President’s hands, the Founders ensured that no President could unilaterally create an army of officer positions to then fill with his supporters. Instead, our Constitution leaves it in the hands of the people’s elected representatives to determine whether new executive offices should exist.” Id. at 646 (Thomas, J., concurring).Yet here we are, with Trump having done exactly what Justice Thomas said he could not, for the very reasons Justice Thomas himself said he could not.The complaint then takes 30 pages to document Musk and DOGE’s unlawful rampage through executive branch agencies, in what is surely only scratching the surface of the full depth of how he has abused his unlawful power, and still continues to abuse it.And so the lawsuit asks for this power to be enjoined so that Musk and DOGE are forced to stop their destruction. In fact, it’s also now asked for a temporary restraining order to get Musk and DOGE to stop what they are doing immediately:[T]he States ask the court to issue a temporary restraining order that immediately and temporarily, until such time as the Court may hear a motion for preliminary injunction, orders Mr. Musk to identify all ways in which any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used, including whether it was used to train any algorithmic models or create or obtain derivative data, orders Mr. Musk to destroy any copies or any derivative data from such unauthorized access in his or DOGE’s possession, custody, or control, and bars Mr. Musk and personnel associated with DOGE from:(a) ordering any change in the disbursement of public funds by agencies;(b) extending offers on behalf of the United States that would bind the government to anappropriation that has not been authorized by law;(c) cancelling government contracts;(d) disposing of government property;(e) ordering the rescission or amendment of regulations;(f) making personnel decisions for agency employees;(g) taking steps to dismantle agencies created by law or otherwise asserting control oversuch agencies, including, e.g., placing employees on administrative leave;(h) accessing sensitive and confidential agency data, using agency data for other than itsauthorized purpose;(i) altering agency data systems without authorization by law and without taking allappropriate protections against cybersecurity risks;(j) engaging in any other conduct that violates the Appointments Clause or exceedsstatutory authority.But beyond that the complaint also asks for declaratory relief such that a court finally speaks to the unlawful nature of Musk’s power (as well as that of its DOGE agency, which, as the complaint explains, is also malformed if it is to claim the sort of supervisory power that it has, which is a power that can only be endowed by Congress):DOGE has purported to exercise authority of its own, and not merely to have acted as an adviser to the President. “Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) (per curiam). Congress has not provided any authority to DOGE. The Constitution does not provide any authority to DOGE. The temporary organization statute, 5 U.S.C. § 3161, [that Trump claimed in his Executive Order was empowering DOGE] does not provide DOGE with the authority it has purported to exercise. That statute provides that a “temporary organization” is defined as an organization “established by law or Executive order for a specific period not in excess of three years for the purpose of performing a specific study or other project.” 5 U.S.C. § 3161(a)(1) (emphasis added). There is no plausible definition of “project” that would include DOGE’s attempt to remake the entire Executive Branch, as described above, or to destroy agencies, fire personnel, halt funding, or dispose of government property.In asking for declaratory relief a few things are accomplished. For one thing, it gives those whom Musk and DOGE are bossing around the ability to say no. In fact, if gives them the obligation to say no, because what they are being asked to do would be an unlawful order and thus unlawful for them to do. (Of course, the injunction/TRO would also restrict Musk and DOGE from even making such demands.)But it also inches us forward to the real prize here: holding everyone involved with DOGE personally liable for the harm they have caused. By establishing that what they have done has been unlawful it provides the predicate basis for potentially all sorts of forms of liability, including the CFAA, which the USAID workers suit also provides more evidence of liability for, including in its allegations that . See page 6-7 of the complaint:*J. Doe 2 understands that the DOGE personnel had administrative privileges into all the USAID systems and tools and that DOGE personnel took information out of the agency and sent it elsewhere. DOGE’s actions have caused J. Doe 2 emotional injury, as J. Doe 2 is aware of the extent of confidential information that has been breached and the privacy laws broken.And the declaratory judgment would help overcome another legal issue: whether anyone associated with DOGE would be entitled to any sort of governmental immunity for the harm they’ve caused. This will be an issue to analyze further, because we have, and would normally want to have, some immunity shielding government officials from liability for doing their jobs, if we are going to leave them sufficiently free to do their jobs. But here no one in DOGE actually had a job that would have entitled them to do what they have done. Which is what these 14 states are asking a court to finally and declaratively say.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The 20 year old PSP can now connect to WPA2 WiFi Networks</title><link>https://wololo.net/2025/02/14/the-20-year-old-psp-can-now-connect-to-wpa2-wifi-networks/</link><author>zdw</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:31:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Screenshot source: Zekiu_ on youtubeAcid_Snake and the ARK Development team have released a significant update to the ARK custom Firmware for the Sony PSP. Custom Firmware now allows the Playstation Portable to connect to WPA2 encrypted Wifi networks. This is thanks to the recently released  plugin, created by developer  and published on the PSP Homebrew discord.Playstation Portable gets WPA2 Wifi accessThe PSP has been out of official support from Sony for years, but lots of enthusiasts keep maintaining this great handheld through homebrew and custom Firmware updates. As technology evolves around us, older devices such as the PlayStation Portable can lose some of their features.For example, as WPA2 has become the defacto encryption standard for home wifi networks (WPA3’s adoption rate remains low), older devices such as the PSP, that do not support these new* encryption standards become technically unable to access the internet.Wifi access was a very strong feature of the PSP when it was released, and, although it’s probably less important nowadays, losing that feature because newer networks aren’t compatible is a bummer.WPA2 support has been a request by many enthusiasts for years on PSP discussion channels, and it seems that the wpa2psp plugin by developer Moment now brings this to life. According to Acid_Snake, the developer was kind enough to provide the source code of the plugin, which allowed the ARK team to embed it into the ARK Custom Firmware for PSP.This reddit thread by Nebula_NL covers a lot of details on how to install and use the plugin. But the bottom line is: install the latest release of the ARK CFW on your PSP, and take it from there. (Note that you can also manually install the plugin if you’re using another CFW than ARK)This is of course the first iteration of this plugin, and it comes with limitations, specifically:2.4 GHz Only
WPA2 support works with 2.4 GHz WiFi.If your router uses a single SSID for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, you may need to separate them and connect your PSP to the 2.4 GHz network.WPA2 AES Only
Requires WPA2 with AES (AES-CCMP) encryption.TKIP is not supported and will not work.WEP/WPA Compatibility
While WPA2 is active, WEP and WPA encryption will not work.To use WEP or WPA again, disable WPA2, and they will function normally.WPA2/WPA3 Mixed Mode
If your router is set to WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode, your PSP may struggle to obtain an IP address.Try manually setting the IP address instead of using DHCP in [AUTO] mode.Download and install ARK-4 + enable WPA2 Support for the PSP* WPA2 was certified in 2004… It’s “new” from the PSP’s perspective which launched the same year and didn’t “need” to support it at the time. WPA3 launched in 2018 but its adoption is taking time]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brake Pad Dust Can Be More Toxic Than Exhaust Emissions, Study Says</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/0016236/brake-pad-dust-can-be-more-toxic-than-exhaust-emissions-study-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bruce66423 shares a report from The Guardian: Microscopic particles emitted from brake pads can be more toxic than those emitted in diesel vehicle exhaust, a study has found. This research shows that even with a move to electric vehicles, pollution from cars may not be able to be eradicated. The researchers found that a higher concentration of copper in some commonly used brake pads was associated with increased harmful effects on sensitive cells from people's lungs, as a result of particles being breathed in.
 
Exposure to pollution generated by cars, vans and lorries has been previously been linked to an increased risk of lung and heart disease. While past attention has mainly concentrated on exhaust emissions, particles are also released into the air from tyre, road and brake pad wear. These emissions are largely unregulated by legislation and the study found that these âoenon-exhaustâ pollution sources are now responsible for the majority of vehicle particulate matter emissions in the UK and parts of Europe, with brake dust the main contributor among them.
 
[...] The scientists examined the effects on lung health of particulate matter from four different types of brake pad with differing chemical compositions; low metallic, semi-metallic, non-asbestos organic and hybrid-ceramic. Results showed that of the four types of brake pads, non-asbestos organic pads were the most potent at inducing inflammation and other markers of toxicity, and were found to be more toxic to human lung cells than diesel exhaust particles. Ceramic pads were the second most toxic. Dr. Ian Mudway, senior lecturer at the school of public health at Imperial College London, cautioned that while the research on brake pad emissions appears sound, it is premature to conclude they are worse than diesel exhaust due to "uncontrolled variables" like brake disc types and particle composition.
 
Slashdot reader Bruce66423 also notes it "doesn't discuss the significance of regenerative breaking, which is a feature of at least some electric cars [that reduces brake pad wear by using the electric motor to slow down the vehicle and recover energy]."
 
The research has been published in the journal Particle and Fibre Technology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Theoretical and Experimental Constraints: Discussing Different Constraints on the Model Parameters</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/theoretical-and-experimental-constraints-discussing-different-constraints-on-the-model-parameters?source=rss</link><author>Phenomenology Technology</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:06:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[3.3 Theoretical and experimental constraintsWe discuss different constraints on the model parameters such as𝑈(1)𝑋 gauge coupling and scalar mixing angle.

The results are based on the work: Arindam Das, Shivam Gola, Sanjoy Mondal, Nita Sinha, "Two-Components Scalar and Fermionic Dark Matter candidates in a generic U(1)𝑋 model, Phys.Lett.B 2022.137117”.Underpinning the origin of neutrino mass and elucidating the nature of DM would constitute a major step forward in particle physics. Several simple extensions of the SM that can account for the DM have already been studied [136–143]. In these models, the SM particle content is extended by additional fields, and a discrete symmetry is usually introduced to guarantee the stability of the DM particle in cosmological scale. In recent years, a class of models has been proposed to incorporate the neutrino mass generation and the existence of DM in a unified framework. Motivated by this, people have studied well-motivated BSM framework based on the gauged 𝑈(1)𝑋 model [144–146]. The most intriguing aspect of this model is that including three generations of right-handed neutrinos, as in the type-I seesaw process for creating light neutrino masses, is no longer an option, but emerges as the simplest solution to eliminate the gauge and mixed gauge-gravity anomalies [147]. The scalar DM can be inherently stable in such models due to its 𝑈(1)𝑋 charge, but the fermionic DM cannot be realized in the simplest 𝑈(1)𝑋 model. Additional discrete symmetries can be introduced, which can stabilize one of the right-handed neutrinos to play the role of DM, while the other two neutrinos participate in the type I seesaw process to generate the required light neutrino masses and flavor mixing. Also, there are many models proposed in the literature, where neutrino mass generation is intimately connected with DM [148–153]. In these types of models, DM is a mediator of neutrino mass generation.\
A single-particle DM model may not be sufficient to account for the relic density of DM observed in the universe. Many such models face strong constraints from direct detection experiments and other observations. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider multi-particle DM scenarios, where two or more particles contribute to the DM abundance. [24,62,126]. Multi-component DM refers to a situation in which two or more particles contribute to the measured DM density. This has been already studied in many BSM scenarios [31, 56, 57, 154–166]. The multi-component DM model has also some benefits over the single dark matter scenario. For instance, it can avoid some stringent constraints arising from various experiments that probe the properties and interactions of dark matter and other particles. A multi-component DM model can also accommodate different observational features of dark matter, such as its distribution and abundance in the universe.(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bringing Nest.js to Rust: Meet Toni.rs, the Framework You’ve Been Waiting For! 🚀</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iprsmo/bringing_nestjs_to_rust_meet_tonirs_the_framework/</link><author>/u/Mysterious-Rust</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:42:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a Rust developer coming from TypeScript, I’ve been missing a Nest.js-like framework — its modularity, dependency injection, and CLI superpowers.

I am fortunate enough to work and develop with these technologies every day as a machine learning engineer!In this article, I will walk you through my journey to becoming a machine learning engineer, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!In one of my previous articles, I extensively wrote about my journey from school to securing my first Data Science job. I recommend you check out that article, but I will summarise the key timeline here.Pretty much everyone in my family studied some sort of STEM subject. My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.So, my path was always paved for me.I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it’s fair to say everyone was very proud!At school, I wasn’t dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn’t fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It’s mainly for students who don’t have a university offer.I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master’s degree in physics!There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn’t seem there was much opportunity in the space.During this time, DeepMind released theirdocumentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.You can hear more about my journey from a podcast.I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and generalised linear models (GLMs).I built models to predict: — Did someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.— What’s the premium we should give someone.— How many claims will someone have. — What’s the average claim value someone will have.I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.However, due to the company’s structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the “tech” side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in time series forecasting and optimisation problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.Fair to say I learned a lot. I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by Pau Labarta BajoML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues: -> You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance. -> You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don’t provide tangible value to a business.That’s not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.You want to say that you did “X that produced Y”, which the above two avenues allow you to do.The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that’s where I gravitated towards.To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.And that’s exactly what I did.Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!Fortunately, a role kind of “fell to me,” but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work — you don’t know what may come from it.I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist. — A machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That’s why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas. — If you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It’s not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me! — Most companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it’s best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take. — I am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout here.Data Structures & Algorithms — Understanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It’s not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick. — Again, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts. — Many MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse. This is why securing a machine learning engineer role can be quite challenging, as it requires proficiency across a wide range of skills.Summary & Further ThoughtsI have a free newsletter, , where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist. Plus, when you subscribe, you will get my and short PDF version of my AI roadmap!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI and the Future of Work: Transforming Industries</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ai-and-the-future-of-work-transforming-industries?source=rss</link><author>Ombir Sharma</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:13:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI or artificial intelligence is the capability and ability of a machine to imitate human intelligence. Intelligent systems are capable of learning, reasoning, and self-correcting. AI includes a number of technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. It is able to perform a wide array of functions from simple repetitive work to making complex decisions which changes the very fabric of industries.The Rise of Robotics and AIThe combination of AI and robotics is changing the world at an unprecedented rate; human errors are greatly reduced and proficiency is greatly improved across multiple industries. Robots powered by AI can be programmed to accomplish tasks that previously only humans could perform. From AI-trained chatbots at customer service to assembly lines in factories, this newly developed technology changes the workplace alongside societal norms.Effect of Artificial Intelligence on EmploymentAI is a double-edged sword with its impact on employment. The technology has created several new opportunities and increased overall productivity in numerous ways, however, it has also posed great threats to certain jobs and industries which can lead to displacement of employees.An important shift is on the horizon as the job market is about to undergo a role reversal change. As AI technology evolves, it is taking over the more labor-intensive tasks and as a result, human workers are becoming more strategic and analytic. AI alleviates repetitive tasks and allows employees to focus on creative problem-solving.The new approach AI takes centers around, just like the Industrial Revolution. While focusing on increasing productivity, ChatGPT and AutoGPT have the potential to perform tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and even more complex problem-solving, increasing overall demand for customer service representatives and support agents. In every age, these shifts in productivity have led to increased job opportunities, just like the multiple industries that formed alongside the technology integrations.Facilitation of EmploymentThe introduction of ChatGPT can aid everyday business operations, serving as virtual assistants that communicate primarily with customers. By streamlining business functions for flexible resource allocation, productivity is sure to increase. Efficient use of ChatGPT makes it incredibly simple for businesses to automate their customer inquiries, increasing profit margins.ChatGPT encourages an environmentally friendly approach by seamlessly optimizing supply chains with effective waste reduction strategies. AI, without a doubt, would optimize ChatGPT-provided decision-making to improve overall energy consumption and ensure economic goals are catered towards too.In the absence of people, ChatGPT opens doors to new interactions that drastically improve service and business operations through automation. Communication via virtual assistants and chatbots allows for effortless collaboration and automated customer interactions on a new level.\
In every way possible, AI improves business decision-making by offering adequate utility and data for correct allocation. Business AI helps set prices, predict market movement, and analyze how much risk varies. Keeping track of tools like ChatGPT can aid project-based decisions by providing up-to-date information.Elimination of Junior and Mid-level Staff PositionsAs a result of automation, junior and mid-level roles, particularly in data entry and administrative duties and tasks, are being skinned out. More companies seem to be using AI, which, in turn, is leading to an increased need for highly specialized and senior positions that require a supervisor to think strategically.Across different industries, AI is changing the future of work. From performing simple services to making complex decisions, AI has a broad range of applications, and as time goes by, the list only seems to grow.The Use Of AI In BusinessArtificial intelligence is being adopted in all sectors to boost productivity, accuracy, and satisfaction of customers. It is used in recruitment HR, in through chatbots, and in marketing through brand campaigns. Work processes are now being automated with AI, thereby, minimizing the costs of running the business.Impact Of AI On Business OperationsSoftware developments with regard to Artificial intelligence utilizing machine learning and automation present the future of the workplace, resulting in increased productivity. Businesses will continuously adopt AI to better their decisions, improve work processes, and promote creativity. Because of this, more skills in AI will be needed which will translate to new positions being created.In the field of finance, AI handles fraud detection, automates trading, and enhances risk assessments. Robo-advisors make investment suggestions based on a client’s unique profile, and AI chatbots provide further engagement with customers.AI assists in diagnosing diseases and personalizes treatments for patients in healthcare.

Recommendation systems based on users' behavior increase the total sales and satisfaction level of customers.We see the growth of AI in hospitality in chatbots, smart booking systems, and customer experience applications. AI analytics also help with effective guest price settings and greater guest satisfaction.AI greatly assists in providing relevant lists of jobs that best suit a candidate's skills. AI technology helps to read a CV, understand the candidate's level of skills, and determine his success.Are My Working Opportunities On The Line Due To AI?Filling positions for repetitive work is indeed scalable with AI which is why it poses a threat for employment. In reality, AI also creates new possibilities by taking up low-productivity tasks. It is expected that new jobs that require creative thinking, emotions, and strategy-based decision-making will still exist. To ensure that they remain employed, workers must learn new skills and adjust to the new reality.AI is enabling the future of work by performing tasks that require time and effort, growing productivity, and changing the existing categorization of industries. Some roles may be lost, but there are always new positions that have to be filled. Being able to utilize AI together with other novel technologies is crucial to be successful for business professionals in the new world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How do I configure Minikube to use my local IP address instead of the cluster IP?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ipr3i1/how_do_i_configure_minikube_to_use_my_local_ip/</link><author>/u/Own_Appointment5630</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:02:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi there!!

"The tech companies behind them might frame it as a step forward in efficiency, but the technology raises troubling questions around etiquette and privacy and risks undercutting the very communication it's meant to improve (paywalled; alternative source)," writes Chris Stokel-Walker in a Weekend Essay for Bloomberg. From the article: [...] The push to document every workplace interaction and utterance is not new. Having a paper trail has long been seen as a useful thing, and a record of decisions and action points is arguably what makes a meeting meaningful. The difference now is the inclusion of new technology that lacks the nuance and depth of understanding inherent to human interaction in a meeting room. In some ways, the prior generation of communication tools, such as instant messaging service Slack, created its own set of problems. Messaging that previously passed in private via email became much more transparent, creating a minefield where one wrong word or badly chosen emoji can explode into a dispute between colleagues. There is a similar risk with notetaking tools. Each utterance documented and analyzed by AI includes the potential for missteps and misunderstandings.
 
Anyone thinking of bringing an AI notetaker to a meeting must consider how other attendees will respond, says Andrew Brodsky, assistant professor of management at the McCombs School of Business, part of the University of Texas at Austin. Colleagues might think you want to better focus on what is said without missing out on a definitive record of the discussion. Or they might think, "You can't be bothered to take notes yourself or remember what was being talked about," he says. For the companies that sell these AI interlopers, the upside is clear. They recognize we're easily nudged into different behaviors and can quickly become reliant on tools that we survived without for years. [...] There's another benefit for tech companies getting us hooked on AI notetakers: Training data for AI systems is increasingly hard to come by. Research group Epoch AI forecasts there will be a drought of usable text possibly by next year. And with publishers unleashing lawsuits against AI companies for hoovering up their content, the tech firms are on the hunt for other sources of data. Notes from millions of meetings around the world could be an ideal option.
 
For those of us who are the source of such data, however, the situation is more nuanced. The key question is whether AI notetakers make office meetings more useless than so many already are. There's an argument that meetings are an important excuse for workers to come together and talk as human beings. All that small talk is where good ideas often germinate -- that's ostensibly why so many companies are demanding staff return to the office. But if workers trade in-person engagement for AI readbacks, and colleagues curb their words and ideas for fear of being exposed by bots, what's left? If the humans step back, all that remains is a series of data points and more AI slop polluting our lives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Uber sues DoorDash, alleging anti-competitive tactics</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/uber-sues-doordash-alleging-anti-competitive-tactics/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec, Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:35:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ride-share giant Uber filed a lawsuit Friday against DoorDash, accusing the delivery outfit of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals.

"Millions of people rely on such workers for timely deliveries, yet the low wages and brutal conditions of the job have forced many riders to seek out low-cost electric bicycles to perform the work -- exactly the kind of e-bikes that are least likely to have received safety certifications," reports Electrek. From the report: The NYC DOT has already begun accepting applications for the new E-Bike Trade-In Program, which is open to delivery workers with non-compliant electric bicycles as well as the often-seen electric scooters/mopeds that don't really qualify as e-bikes, despite their ubiquitous use in the industry. Interestingly, the program even accepts gasoline-powered mopeds that are not able to be legally registered with the DMV, including those that lack VINs. In exchange for trading in a non-certified vehicle, the delivery worker will receive a new UL-certified electric bike with a spare UL-certified battery.
 
There are a few requirements for eligibility. The worker has to have earned at least US $1,500 by working in the food delivery industry last year in 2024, live in one of the five New York City boroughs, be at least 18 years old, and own/use one of the eligible devices for trade-in. The program is free to participate in with no additional cost for the delivery workers. However, the supply of free electric bicycles is described as "limited." Those interested need to submit an application before the window closes on March 10, 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go 1.24 Brings Performance Improvements, Better WebAssembly Support</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Go-1.24-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:24:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go 1.24 was released this week by Google engineers as the newest step forward for this popular programming language...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing Impressions at Netflix</title><link>https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-impressions-at-netflix-e2b67c88c9fb?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4</link><author>Netflix Technology Blog</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:13:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://netflixtechblog.com/?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4">Netflix Tech Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Part 1: Creating the Source of Truth for ImpressionsImagine scrolling through Netflix, where each movie poster or promotional banner competes for your attention. Every image you hover over isn’t just a visual placeholder; it’s a critical data point that fuels our sophisticated personalization engine. At Netflix, we call these images ‘impressions,’ and they play a pivotal role in transforming your interaction from simple browsing into an immersive binge-watching experience, all tailored to your unique tastes.Capturing these moments and turning them into a personalized journey is no simple feat. It requires a state-of-the-art system that can track and process these impressions while maintaining a detailed history of each profile’s exposure. This nuanced integration of data and technology empowers us to offer bespoke content recommendations.In this multi-part blog series, we take you behind the scenes of our system that processes billions of impressions daily. We will explore the challenges we encounter and unveil how we are building a resilient solution that transforms these client-side impressions into a personalized content discovery experience for every Netflix viewer.Why do we need impression history?To tailor recommendations more effectively, it’s crucial to track what content a user has already encountered. Having impression history helps us achieve this by allowing us to identify content that has been displayed on the homepage but not engaged with, helping us deliver fresh, engaging recommendations.By maintaining a history of impressions, we can implement frequency capping to prevent over-exposure to the same content. This ensures users aren’t repeatedly shown identical options, keeping the viewing experience vibrant and reducing the risk of frustration or disengagement.Highlighting New ReleasesFor new content, impression history helps us monitor initial user interactions and adjust our merchandising efforts accordingly. We can experiment with different content placements or promotional strategies to boost visibility and engagement.Additionally, impression history offers insightful information for addressing a number of platform-related analytics queries. Analyzing impression history, for example, might help determine how well a specific row on the home page is functioning or assess the effectiveness of a merchandising strategy.The first pivotal step in managing impressions begins with the creation of a Source-of-Truth (SOT) dataset. This foundational dataset is essential, as it supports various downstream workflows and enables a multitude of use cases.Collecting Raw Impression EventsAs Netflix members explore our platform, their interactions with the user interface spark a vast array of raw events. These events are promptly relayed from the client side to our servers, entering a centralized event processing queue. This queue ensures we are consistently capturing raw events from our global user base.After raw events are collected into a centralized queue, a custom event extractor processes this data to identify and extract all impression events. These extracted events are then routed to an Apache Kafka topic for immediate processing needs and simultaneously stored in an Apache Iceberg table for long-term retention and historical analysis. This dual-path approach leverages Kafka’s capability for low-latency streaming and Iceberg’s efficient management of large-scale, immutable datasets, ensuring both real-time responsiveness and comprehensive historical data availability.Filtering & Enriching Raw ImpressionsOnce the raw impression events are queued, a stateless Apache Flink job takes charge, meticulously processing this data. It filters out any invalid entries and enriches the valid ones with additional metadata, such as show or movie title details, and the specific page and row location where each impression was presented to users. This refined output is then structured using an Avro schema, establishing a definitive source of truth for Netflix’s impression data. The enriched data is seamlessly accessible for both real-time applications via Kafka and historical analysis through storage in an Apache Iceberg table. This dual availability ensures immediate processing capabilities alongside comprehensive long-term data retention.Ensuring High Quality ImpressionsMaintaining the highest quality of impressions is a top priority. We accomplish this by gathering detailed column-level metrics that offer insights into the state and quality of each impression. These metrics include everything from validating identifiers to checking that essential columns are properly filled. The data collected feeds into a comprehensive quality dashboard and supports a tiered threshold-based alerting system. These alerts promptly notify us of any potential issues, enabling us to swiftly address regressions. Additionally, while enriching the data, we ensure that all columns are in agreement with each other, offering in-place corrections wherever possible to deliver accurate data.We handle a staggering volume of 1 to 1.5 million impression events globally every second, with each event approximately 1.2KB in size. To efficiently process this massive influx in real-time, we employ Apache Flink for its low-latency stream processing capabilities, which seamlessly integrates both batch and stream processing to facilitate efficient backfilling of historical data and ensure consistency across real-time and historical analyses. Our Flink configuration includes 8 task managers per region, each equipped with 8 CPU cores and 32GB of memory, operating at a parallelism of 48, allowing us to handle the necessary scale and speed for seamless performance delivery. The Flink job’s sink is equipped with a data mesh connector, as detailed in our Data Mesh platform which has two outputs: Kafka and Iceberg. This setup allows for efficient streaming of real-time data through Kafka and the preservation of historical data in Iceberg, providing a comprehensive and flexible data processing and storage solution.We utilize the ‘island model’ for deploying our Flink jobs, where all dependencies for a given application reside within a single region. This approach ensures high availability by isolating regions, so if one becomes degraded, others remain unaffected, allowing traffic to be shifted between regions to maintain service continuity. Thus, all data in one region is processed by the Flink job deployed within that region.Addressing the Challenge of Unschematized EventsAllowing raw events to land on our centralized processing queue unschematized offers significant flexibility, but it also introduces challenges. Without a defined schema, it can be difficult to determine whether missing data was intentional or due to a logging error. We are investigating solutions to introduce schema management that maintains flexibility while providing clarity.Automating Performance Tuning with AutoscalersTuning the performance of our Apache Flink jobs is currently a manual process. The next step is to integrate with autoscalers, which can dynamically adjust resources based on workload demands. This integration will not only optimize performance but also ensure more efficient resource utilization.Improving Data Quality AlertsRight now, there’s a lot of business rules dictating when a data quality alert needs to be fired. This leads to a lot of false positives that require manual judgement. A lot of times it is difficult to track changes leading to regression due to inadequate data lineage information. We are investing in building a comprehensive data quality platform that more intelligently identifies anomalies in our impression stream, keeps track of data lineage and data governance, and also, generates alerts notifying producers of any regressions. This approach will enhance efficiency, reduce manual oversight, and ensure a higher standard of data integrity.Creating a reliable source of truth for impressions is a complex but essential task that enhances personalization and discovery experience. Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where we’ll delve into how we use this SOT dataset to create a microservice that provides impression histories. We invite you to share your thoughts in the comments and continue with us on this journey of discovering impressions.We are genuinely grateful to our amazing colleagues whose contributions were essential to the success of Impressions: Julian Jaffe, Bryan Keller, Yun Wang, Brandon Bremen, Kyle Alford, Ron Brown and Shriya Arora.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Study Finds Relying on AI Kills Your Critical Thinking Skills</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/2320203/microsoft-study-finds-relying-on-ai-kills-your-critical-thinking-skills?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new study (PDF) from researchers at Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University found that increased reliance on AI tools leads to a decline in critical thinking skills. Gizmodo reports: The researchers tapped 319 knowledge workers -- a person whose job involves handling data or information -- and asked them to self-report details of how they use generative AI tools in the workplace. The participants were asked to report tasks that they were asked to do, how they used AI tools to complete them, how confident they were in the AI's ability to do the task, their ability to evaluate that output, and how confident they were in their own ability to complete the same task without any AI assistance.
 
Over the course of the study, a pattern revealed itself: the more confident the worker was in the AI's capability to complete the task, the more often they could feel themselves letting their hands off the wheel. The participants reported a "perceived enaction of critical thinking" when they felt like they could rely on the AI tool, presenting the potential for over-reliance on the technology without examination. This was especially true for lower-stakes tasks, the study found, as people tended to be less critical. While it's very human to have your eyes glaze over for a simple task, the researchers warned that this could portend to concerns about "long-term reliance and diminished independent problem-solving."
 
By contrast, when the workers had less confidence in the ability of AI to complete the assigned task, the more they found themselves engaging in their critical thinking skills. In turn, they typically reported more confidence in their ability to evaluate what the AI produced and improve upon it on their own. Another noteworthy finding of the study: users who had access to generative AI tools tended to produce "a less diverse set of outcomes for the same task" compared to those without.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Did Semgrep Just Get a Lot More Interesting?</title><link>https://fly.io/blog/semgrep-but-for-real-now/</link><author>ghuntley</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:40:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This bit by Geoffrey Huntley is super interesting to me and, despite calling out that LLM-driven development agents like Cursor have something like a 40% success rate at actually building anything that passes acceptance criteria, makes me think that more of the future of our field belongs to people who figure out how to use this weird bags of model weights than any of us are comfortable with. I’ve been dinking around with Cursor for a week now (if you haven’t, I think it’s something close to malpractice not to at least take it — or something like it — for a spin) and am just now from this post learning that Cursor has this rules feature. The important thing for me is not how Cursor rules work, but rather how Huntley uses them. He turns them back on themselves, writing rules to tell Cursor how to organize the rules, and then teach Cursor how to write (under human supervision) its own rules.Cursor kept trying to get Huntley to use Bazel as a build system. So he had cursor write a rule for itself: “no bazel”. And there was no more Bazel. If I’d known I could do this, I probably wouldn’t have bounced from the Elixir project I had Cursor doing, where trying to get it to write simple unit tests got it all tangled up trying to make Mox work. But I’m burying the lead. Security people have been for several years now somewhat in love with a tool called Semgrep. Semgrep is a semantics-aware code search tool; using symbolic variable placeholders and otherwise ordinary code, you can write rules to match pretty much arbitary expressions and control flow. If you’re an appsec person, where you obviously go with this is: you build a library of Semgrep searches for well-known vulnerability patterns (or, if you’re like us at Fly.io, you work out how to get Semgrep to catch the Rust concurrency footgun of RWLocks inside if-lets).The reality for most teams though is “ain’t nobody got time for that”. But I just checked and, unsurprisingly, 4o seems to do reasonably well at generating Semgrep rules? Like: I have no idea if this rule is actually any good. But it looks like a Semgrep rule?What interests me is this: it seems obvious that we’re going to do more and more “closed-loop” LLM agent code generation stuff. By “closed loop”, I mean that the thingy that generates code is going to get to run the code and watch what happens when it’s interacted with. You’re just a small bit of glue code and a lot of system prompting away from building something like that right now: Chris McCord is building a thingy that generates whole Elixir/Phoenix apps and runs them as Fly Machines. When you deploy these kinds of things, the LLM gets to see the errors when the code is run, and it can just go fix them. It also gets to see errors and exceptions in the logs when you hit a page on the app, and it can just go fix them.With a bit more system prompting, you can get an LLM to try to generalize out from exceptions it fixes and generate unit test coverage for them. With a little bit more system prompting, you can probably get an LLM to (1) generate a Semgrep rule for the generalized bug it caught, (2) test the Semgrep rule with a positive/negative control, (3) save the rule, (4) test the whole codebase with Semgrep for that rule, and (5) fix anything it finds that way. That is a lot more interesting to me than tediously (and probably badly) trying to predict everything that will go wrong in my codebase a priori and Semgrepping for them. Which is to say: Semgrep — which I have always liked — is maybe a lot more interesting now? And tools like it?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI’s Hallucinations Are Over</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ais-hallucinations-are-over?source=rss</link><author>Oleksandr Zabashnyi</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:39:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, let me describe the problem. I am a software developer, and I don't use AI to write code just because of hallucinations. For creating pictures or writing texts they are not so critical, but for the task of writing code, they are overkill. I have identified two subproblems. Firstly, it is difficult to identify the errors made by AI. It is quite easy for a designer as he counts the fingers in the pictures and that's it; the picture is accepted as the result. \
However, I have to deal with the code and seek the mistakes in it. I hate to do it. Secondly, it is the irreproducibility of the result. For example, I tried to write unit tests: the first generated unit test is successful, but the second one is not, even for the same method. This makes working with it impossible.\
Now, about the solution. Our hypothesis was as follows: what if we could assign the corresponding result data to a certain set of input information? And do that at least sometimes during the task-solving process. Would that reduce the number of hallucinations? Oh yes! After thorough research, we have come to the conclusion that the presence of a critical mass of such ‘rigidly fixed’ nodes almost completely removed hallucinations from the output. All that remained was to find the criteria for identifying these correspondences between input and output information and to modify the math apparatus to enable the use of this approach. We called this method the "preset landscape."\
Certainly, our approach has several limitations. First of all, the subject area should imply the existence of only one correct answer for a given set of output data. Fortunately, software development is exactly such an area. The second limitation is that at the stage of landscape formation, the participation of an expert in the subject field is required. In other words, it is impossible to apply the math apparatus to the areas where a human cannot articulate the rules. These limitations greatly narrow the scope of application of our approach. However, its usage in such areas as software development, law, healthcare, and engineering tasks is more than enough.\
To demonstrate the capabilities of the math apparatus, we have developed a plugin for IntelliJ Idea (JetBrains). You can install it and make sure that there are no hallucinations. Here, you can find the instructions.\
While we were working on the plugin, AI services came into vogue, which provides API and you can use them in your own solutions. Therefore, we are planning to make such a platform for software development tasks. We will most likely start with Java. If you have an insight into how this approach can be implemented for lawyers or healthcare professionals - feel free to share.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tabiew 0.8.4 Released</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ipp72r/tabiew_084_released/</link><author>/u/shshemi</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:21:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tabiew is a lightweight TUI application that allows users to view and query tabular data files, such as CSV, Parquet, Arrow, Sqlite, and ...📊 Support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, JSONL, Arrow, FWF, and Sqlite🗂️ Multi-table functionalityUI is updated to be more modern and responsiveHorizontally scrollable tablesVisible data frame can be referenced with name "_"Compatibility with older versions of glibcTwo new themes (Tokyo Night and Catppuccin)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PIN AI Launches Mobile App Letting You Make Your Own Personalized, Private AI Model</title><link>https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/2227222/pin-ai-launches-mobile-app-letting-you-make-your-own-personalized-private-ai-model?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from VentureBeat: A new startup PIN AI (not to be confused with the poorly reviewed hardware device the AI Pin by Humane) has emerged from stealth to launch its first mobile app, which lets a user select an underlying open-source AI model that runs directly on their smartphone (iOS/Apple iPhone and Google Android supported) and remains private and totally customized to their preferences. Built with a decentralized infrastructure that prioritizes privacy, PIN AI aims to challenge big tech's dominance over user data by ensuring that personal AI serves individuals -- not corporate interests. Founded by AI and blockchain experts from Columbia, MIT and Stanford, PIN AI is led by Davide Crapis, Ben Wu and Bill Sun, who bring deep experience in AI research, large-scale data infrastructure and blockchain security. [...]
 
PIN AI introduces an alternative to centralized AI models that collect and monetize user data. Unlike cloud-based AI controlled by large tech firms, PIN AI's personal AI runs locally on user devices, allowing for secure, customized AI experiences without third-party surveillance. At the heart of PIN AI is a user-controlled data bank, which enables individuals to store and manage their personal information while allowing developers access to anonymized, multi-category insights -- ranging from shopping habits to investment strategies. This approach ensures that AI-powered services can benefit from high-quality contextual data without compromising user privacy.
[...]
The new mobile app launched in the U.S. and multiple regions also includes key features such as: - The "God model" (guardian of data): Helps users track how well their AI understands them, ensuring it aligns with their preferences. - Ask PIN AI: A personalized AI assistant capable of handling tasks like financial planning, travel coordination and product recommendations. - Open-source integrations: Users can connect apps like Gmail, social media platforms and financial services to their personal AI, training it to better serve them without exposing data to third parties. - "With our app, you have a personal AI that is your model," Crapis added. "You own the weights, and it's completely private, with privacy-preserving fine-tuning." Davide Crapis, co-founder of PIN AI, told VentureBeat that the app currently supports several open-source AI models, including small versions of DeepSeek and Meta's Llama. "With our app, you have a personal AI that is your model," Crapis added. "You own the weights, and it's completely private, with privacy-preserving fine-tuning."

A new engineer manager arrives and asks for the following:On every PR, run integration tests in a Kubernetes cluster similar to the production one.\
In this series of posts, I'll show how you can do it. My plan is the following:This blog post focuses on the app, the basic GitHub workflow setup, and testing both locally and during the workflow run.The second blog post will detail the setup of a Google Kubernetes Engine instance and how to adapt the workflow to use it.Unit Testing vs. Integration TestingIntegration Testing is a strategy to test the collaboration of at least two components.\
I translated it in Object-Oriented Programming as:Integration Testing is a strategy to test the collaboration of at least two classes.Let’s consider the making of a car. Single-class testing is akin to testing each nut and bolt separately. Imagine testing of such components brought no issue to light. Still, it would be very risky to mass manufacture the car without having built a prototype and sent it to a test drive.\
However, technology has evolved since that time.I use the word "technology" very generally, but I have Testcontainers in mind:Unit tests with real dependencies\
  Testcontainers is an open source library for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.\
In effect, Testcontainers replaces  with "real" dependencies-containerized. It's a real game-changer: instead of painfully writing mocking code to stub dependencies just set them up regularly.\
For example, without Testcontainers, you'd need to provide mocks for your  in tests; with it, you only need to start a database container, and off you go.\
At the time, the cost of having a local Docker daemon in your testing environment offset many benefits. It's not the case anymore, as Docker daemons are available (nearly) everywhere.\
My definition of Integration Testing has changed a bit:Integration Testing is testing that requires significant setup.\
The definition is vague on purpose, as significance has a different meaning depending on the organization, the team, and the individual. Note that Google defines two categories of tests: fast and slow. Their definition is equally vague, meant to adapt to different contexts.In any case, the golden rule still applies: the closer you are to the final environment, the more risks you cover, and the more valuable your tests are. \
If our target production environment is Kubernetes, we will reap the most benefits from running the app on Kubernetes and testing it as a black box. It doesn't mean that white box testing in a more distant environment is not beneficial; it means that the more significant the gap between the testing environment and the target environment, the fewer issues we will uncover.\
For the purposes of this blog post, we will use GitHub as the base testing environment for unit testing and a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster for integration testing. There is no absolute truth regarding what is the best practice™, as contexts vary widely across organizations and even across teams within the same organization. It's up to every engineer to decide within their specific context the ROI of setting up such an environment because the closer you are to production, the more complex and, thus, expensive it will be.Use-case: Application With DatabaseLet's jump into how to test an app that uses a database to store its data. I don't want anything fancy, just solid, standard engineering practices. I'll be using a CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) JVM-based app, but most of the following can easily apply to other stacks as well. The following blog posts will involve less language-specific content.Kotlin, because I love the languageSpring Boot: it's the most widespread framework for JVM-based applicationsMaven-there's nothing elseProject Reactor and coroutines, because it makes things more interestingPostgreSQL-at the moment, it's a very popular database, and it's well-supported by Spring\
If you don't know Flyway, it allows you to track database schemas and data in a code repository and manage changes, known as migrations, between versions. Each migration has a unique version, , v1.0, v1.1, v2.1.2, etc. Flyway tries to apply migration in order. If it has already applied a migration, it skips it. Flyway stores its data in a dedicated table to track the applied migrations.\
This approach is a must-have; Liquibase is an alternative that follows the same principles.\
Spring Boot fully integrates Flyway and Liquibase. When the app starts, the framework will kickstart them. If a pod is killed and restarted, Flyway will first check the migrations table to apply only the one that didn't run previously.\
I don't want to bore you with the app details; you can find the code on GitHub.Per my definition above, unit testing should be easy to set up. With Testcontainers, it is.\
The testing code counts the number of items in a table, inserts a new item, and counts the number of items again. It then checks that:There's one additional item compared to the initial countThat the new item is the one we inserted@SpringBootTest                                                              //1
class VClusterPipelineTest @Autowired constructor(private val repository: ProductRepository) { //2

    @Test
    fun `When inserting a new Product, there should be one more Product in the database and the last inserted Product should be the one inserted`() { //3
        runBlocking {                                                        //4
            val initialCount = repository.count()                            //5
            // The rest of the test
        }
    }
}
Initialize the Spring contextPraise Kotlin for allowing for descriptive function namesRun non-blocking code in a blocking function\
We now need a PostgreSQL database; Testcontainers can provide one for us. However, to avoid conflicts, it will choose a random port until it finds an unused one. We need it to connect to the database, run the Flyway migration, and run the testing code.\
For this reason, we must write a bit of additional code:@Profile("local")                                                              //1
class TestContainerConfig {

    companion object {
        val name = "test"
        val userName = "test"
        val pass = "test"
        val postgres = PostgreSQLContainer<Nothing>("postgres:17.2").apply {   //1
            withDatabaseName(name)

            withPassword(pass)
            start()
        }

class TestContainerInitializer : ApplicationContextInitializer<ConfigurableApplicationContext> {
    override fun initialize(applicationContext: ConfigurableApplicationContext) {
        if (applicationContext.environment.activeProfiles.contains("local")) {
            TestPropertyValues.of(                                             //2

Start the container, but only if the Spring Boot profile  is active.Override the configuration values.\
We need to specify neither the  nor the  if we hacked the  to reuse the R2BC parameters of the same name:spring:
  application:
    name: vcluster-pipeline
  r2dbc:
    username: test
    password: test
    url: r2dbc:postgresql://localhost:8082/flyway-test-db
  flyway:
    user: ${SPRING_R2DBC_USERNAME}                                             #1
    password: ${SPRING_R2DBC_PASSWORD}                                         #1
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8082/flyway-test-db
Smart hack to DRY configuration further down.\
We also annotate the previous test class to use the initializer:@SpringBootTest
@ContextConfiguration(initializers = [TestContainerInitializer::class])
class VClusterPipelineTest @Autowired constructor(private val repository: ProductRepository) {

    // No change
}
\
Spring Boot offers a couple of options to activate profiles. For local development, we can use a simple JVM property, , mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=local; in the CI pipeline, we will use environment variables instead.I'll also use Flyway to create the database structure for integration testing. In the scope of this example, the System Under Test will be the entire app; hence, I'll test from the HTTP endpoints. It's end-to-end testing for APIs. The code will test the same behavior, albeit treating the System Under Test as a black box.class VClusterPipelineIT {

    val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this::class.java)

    @Test
    fun `When inserting a new Product, there should be one more Product in the database and the last inserted Product should be the one inserted`() {

        val baseUrl = System.getenv("APP_BASE_URL") ?: "http://localhost:8080" //1

        logger.info("Using base URL: $baseUrl")

        val client = WebTestClient.bindToServer()                              //2
            .baseUrl(baseUrl)
            .build()

        val initialResponse: EntityExchangeResult<List<Product?>?> = client.get() //3
            .uri("/products")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk
            .expectBodyList(Product::class.java)
            .returnResult()

        val initialCount = initialResponse.responseBody?.size?.toLong()        //4

        val now = LocalDateTime.now()
        val product = Product(
            id = UUID.randomUUID(),
            name = "My awesome product",
            description = "Really awesome product",
            price = 100.0,
            createdAt = now
        )

        client.post()                                                          //5
            .uri("/products")
            .bodyValue(product)
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk
            .expectBody(Product::class.java)

        client.get()                                                           //6
            .uri("/products")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk
            .expectBodyList(Product::class.java)
            .hasSize((initialCount!! + 1).toInt())
    }
}
Get the deployed app URL.Create a web client that uses the former.Get the initial item list.Get the size; we definitely should offer a count function if there are too many items.Insert a new item and assert everything works out fine.Get the list of items and assert the item count is higher by one.\
Before going further, let's run the tests in a GitHub workflow.I'll assume you're familiar with GitHub workflows. If you aren't, a GitHub workflow is a declarative description of an automated job. A job consists of several steps. GitHub offers several triggers: Manual, scheduled, or depending on an event.\
We want the workflow to run on each Pull Request to verify that tests run as expected.name: Test on PR                                                               #1

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]                                                     #2
Trigger on a PR to the master branch.\
The first steps are pretty standard:jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install JRE
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 21
          cache: maven                                                         #1
The  action includes a caching option for build tools. Here, it will cache dependencies across runs, speeding up consecutive runs. Unless you have good reasons not to, I recommend using this option.\
For the same reason, we should cache our built artifacts. While researching for this post, I learned that GitHub discards them across runs and steps in the same run. Hence, we can speed up the runs by caching them explicitly:      - name: Cache build artifacts
        uses: actions/cache@v4                                                 <1>
        with:
          path: target
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ github.sha }}                        <2>
          restore-keys:
            ${{ runner.os }}-build                                             <3>
Use the same action that  uses under the hood.Compute the cache key. In our case, the  should be immutable, but this should be how you run matrices across different operating systems.Reuse the cache if it's the same OS.      - name: Run "unit" tests
        run: ./mvnw -B test
        env:
          SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: local                                        <1>
Activate the local profile. The workflow's environment provides a Docker daemon. Hence, Testcontainer successfully downloads and runs the database container.\
At this point, we should run the integration test. Yet, we need the app deployed to run this test. For this, we need available infrastructure.Alternative "Unit testing" on GitHubThe above works perfectly on GitHub, but we can move closer to the deployment setup by leveraging GitHub service containers. Let's migrate PostgreSQL from Testcontainers to a GitHub service container.\
Removing Testcontainers is pretty straightforward: we do not activate the  profile.\
Using GitHub's service container requires an additional section in our workflow:jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GH_PG_USER: testuser                                                     #1
      GH_PG_PASSWORD: testpassword                                             #1
      GH_PG_DB: testdb                                                         #1
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        options: >-                                                            #2
          --health-cmd "pg_isready -U $POSTGRES_USER"
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
        ports:
            - 5432/tcp                                                         #3
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: ${{ env.GH_PG_USER }}                                 #4
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ env.GH_PG_PASSWORD }}                         #4
          POSTGRES_DB: ${{ env.GH_PG_DB }}                                     #4
Define environment variables at the job level to use them across steps. You can use secrets, but in this case, the database instance is not exposed outside the workflow and will be switched off when the latter finishes. Environment variables are good enough to avoid adding unnecessary secrets.Make sure that PostgreSQL works before going further.Assign a random port and map it to the underlying  port.Use the environment variables.\
To run the tests using the above configuration is straightforward.      - name: Run "unit" tests
        run: ./mvnw -B test
        env:
          SPRING_FLYWAY_URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:${{ job.services.postgres.ports['5432'] }}/${{ env.GH_PG_DB }} #1
          SPRING_R2DBC_URL: r2dbc:postgresql://localhost:${{ job.services.postgres.ports['5432'] }}/${{ env.GH_PG_DB }} #1
          SPRING_R2DBC_USERNAME: ${{ env.GH_PG_USER }}
          SPRING_R2DBC_PASSWORD: ${{ env.GH_PG_PASSWORD }}
GitHub runs PostgreSQL on a local Docker, so the host is . We can get the random port with the ${{ job.services.postgres.ports['5432'] }} syntax.In this post, we laid the ground for a simple app's unit- and integration-testing, leveraging Testcontainers in the local environment. We then proceeded to automate unit testing via a GitHub workflow with the help of GitHub service containers. In the next post, we will prepare the Kubernetes environment on a Cloud provider infrastructure, build the image, and deploy it to the latter.\

This was a neighborhood with Razor scooters dumped in trimmed front lawns. Where family walks with leashed dogs happened down the middle of intentionally curved streets named after long demolished natural landmarks like "Timbercrest" and "Forest Trails." Where the HOA (because of course there was an HOA) banned the installation of driveway basketball hoops.Receiving industrial freight deliveries, freshly cleared through international customs, probably wasn't explicitly prohibited in the homeowner's handbook. But then, why would it need to be? Nobody would think to bring that kind of commercial chaos into the burgeoning middle-class peace of Castle Pines North in 1998.If neighbors peeking behind curtains at the idling 18-wheeler thought to call in a complaint, the husband and wife receiving the delivery didn't notice. They were too busy unloading boxes—more than 800 of them. Balancing four at a time on a handcart, it took 200 trips through the open garage door and down the unfinished basement steps. The boxes, holding smaller rectangular packages inscribed with Japanese lettering, were piled to the ceiling. There was enough room left for a skinny aisle leading back up the stairs, and two plastic tables ladened with tape and flat-rate USPS packaging. 5,800 miles away, a man in middle management at the global toy conglomerate Hasbro must have been very pleased. The delivery represented a small yet unexpected boon. Those boxes were dead inventory, wasting space in a nondescript warehouse. They should have been headed for a landfill and a tax write-off. Instead, a Mr. Toshio Takiguchi brokered the export at a ¥1,300 per-unit cost. Not a tidy profit, but no longer a loss on the annual P&L. The remains of a failed business decision disappeared across the ocean. It was a certain Mr. Fox's problem now.That problem cost $43,000, a sum that represented the entire life savings of Mr. Fox and his wife, who at that point had been surviving on public-school salaries. Friends and family never really said it out loud, but they were certainly thinking it: This was insane. What about the three kids and that mortgage? The couple, though, never had a doubt. "He always used to tell me, 'If I had 10,000 of these, I could sell them in a year,'" Mrs. Fox recalled, 27 years later.That's the unabashed confidence you'd expect from any good entrepreneur, especially with the benefit of hindsight. But ask yourself this: Would you, watching this couple unload box after box into their bank-financed home, have bet on this man and his family's future if you knew exactly what he needed to sell?Tucked inside those boxes, in nested columns of 12, were 120,000 plastic cups. They were turned upside down, each with a hole drilled through the middle of the base, rendering them useless in terms of a cup's normal, and really only, task.The couple's future hinged on accomplishing what the world's second largest toy company could not: convincing thousands of kids that stacking these plastic cups in pre-determined patterns was … . More critically, the couple needed to convince the parents of those kids to actually buy these cups, despite not even being able to drink from them. Mr. Takiguchi could breathe a sigh of relief. Mr. and Mrs. Fox had to get to work.The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown ... The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a really, really good clown. Every few months, in different corners of the internet, someone asks a version of the same question: Why did we all stack plastic cups in elementary school PE class?You might have even asked it yourself, perhaps after a few beers when a friend turned some Solo Cups upside down, activating one of your mid-aughts memories of sitting cross-legged on a linoleum gym floor, surrounded by the clatter of your classmates piling cups into pyramids.Sport Stacking, as it's officially known (cup stacking and speed stacking as it is colloquially known), exists in the same cloud of millennial nostalgia where you'll find vague recollections of SlamBall and JoJo. It has appeared on pretty much every morning and late show, been a trend piece in both the  and , and was once labeled by Glenn Beck as "what’s really wrong with America."It has been a minor plot line in , Matt LeBlanc's , and ; it's been the major plot line in a 2022 Thai-language film released on Netflix titled  (100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes). The infamous "Oh my gosh!" scream in Skrillex's "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" was sampled from a viral sport stacking video from 2008.At its peak, between 2002 and 2011, roughly 5,000 American schools included it as part of their annual curriculum, according to Mr. and Mrs. Fox. That means somewhere between five and eight percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 22 and 35 share the same core memory—and in the ensuing years have asked themselves, their friends, or social media the same question: Why did credentialed educational professionals make us do this ludicrous activity in gym class?I am, perhaps, the person best suited on the planet to answer this question. Because the answer … is my dad.The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown. Not in the figurative, funnyman personality sense. In the literal red-nose, black-eyeliner, juggling-tennis-balls-at-children’s-birthday-parties sense.The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a really, really good clown. He'd scoff at the mental image you probably have of him right now: oversized shoes, cartoonish honks, and bumbling choreography. My dad's act was entirely silent, required immense skill, and was predicated on audience participation. He was equally good at riding a unicycle and convincing the most curmudgeonly dad in the room to leave their back corner and join him onstage to try—and always fail—at blowing up a balloon animal. Kids went bananas. Adults always laughed. The San Francisco 49ers hired him to be the walk-around entertainment for their post–Super Bowl ring ceremony in 1995. We used to shut the shades so neighbors didn't think he robbed a bank as he counted the cash he earned during Denver's largest busking festival.This was a man who took the unserious very, very seriously. As a high school theater teacher, he'd spend 60–80 hours a week building out increasingly elaborate sets for the annual musical. He built a life-sized plant puppet that could actually eat cast members for , and cut a full-sized muscle car in half so it would fit on stage during ; another car was hoisted onto the school's roof to promote the show. Before her bevy of Oscar nominations, Amy Adams was one of his choreographers and students.He quit because his wife, Jill, needed him home more to help raise their three children. So he became an elementary school classroom and PE teacher instead, where he would end up teaching hundreds of kids how to ride unicycles and produce an annual show on the blacktop basketball court called KidZircus.The first thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that before working as a communications administrator at a school district, she used to be a journalist at a small newspaper, where she was assigned to write a profile about a local clown on "sabbatical" from his full-time job. The second thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that despite the word "sabbatical" doing a generous amount of euphemistic work in her final published piece, she married that unemployed clown.This was a woman who was very, very good at seeing—and supporting—the potential in the crazy.They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: Uncle Johnny.It took them 10 months to sell the 10,000 sets of 12 cups. Kids in south Denver, it turns out, went absolutely nuts over this new phenomenon called "cup stacking." That's mostly because my dad figured out the one thing Hasbro did not: The level of interest in the activity hinged almost exclusively on the enthusiasm and skill level of a real-life teacher. Without that, it was just inanimate plastic ephemera sitting on a shelf.The basic rules take about 15 minutes to learn. Like a track meet, the sport is built on completing different "distances" as fast as you can. The shortest, and simplest, is called the 3-3-3. Envision each one of those 3's as a nested column of cups. You start on one side and "upstack" the first 3 into a pyramid, then move to the middle, and then the last 3. Then you return to where you started, and "downstack" them back into columns in the same order. The 3-6-3 has the same principle, but with a pyramid of six cups in the middle. The "Cycle," is the sport's primetime event, starting with the 3-6-3, morphing into a 6-6, and ending with a 1-10-1.If you skimmed over that clunky paragraph, you've proved my dad's foundational epiphany: You really need to see it to buy in. In fact, scrap reading this for a few seconds (that's all it will take) and watch this video instead.Place a set of these cups in the corner of a room or on a toy shelf with paper instructions, and you might earn five minutes of an 8-year-old's frenzied attention. Put that same 8-year-old on the gym floor in front of a professionally trained clown with a passion for juggling, and they will be utterly hooked.A brief digression on nomenclature: The sport was known as "cup stacking" until 2005, when my parents had the savvy to officially change the name to "sport stacking." Why? 1) Because it sounds way cooler, and if enough people call it a sport then it must damn well be one. 2) The phrase "cup stacking" out of context evokes toddlers playing with blocks, a vibe they wanted to avoid. Confusingly, you might have also seen it referenced as "speed stacking," after the company they eventually founded, Speed Stacks. They strategically eschewed this label to avoid the fate of Roller Blades, Frisbee, and Kleenex, all formerly good standing trademarks, until you lot ruined everything. Except for this early-stage reference, I'll be calling it sport stacking hereafter so as to avoid a grumpy phone call from my dad (he'll probably still call about my use of "damn," though). If you have a problem with that, consider the last time you went berserk over a nine-darter or screamed at the Swedish curling team during the Olympics. As my dad likes to say, there used to be a man trying to convince the world that tossing balls made from dried cow skin into retrofitted peach baskets was fun—and you all bought in.It is important to note that my dad did not actually invent sport stacking. Credit goes to a group of bored kids at a Boys and Girls Club in Oceanside, Calif., in the early 1980s. They'd been given a stack of paper cups, and told to figure out a game that didn't involve messy liquid. Under the guidance of a program director named Wayne Godinet, both the rules and equipment evolved. He is responsible for the sport's first major innovation: He drilled a hole through the base of hard plastic cups to reduce air friction and prevent sticking. The California group's high-water mark came on Nov. 2, 1990, when they appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Among the millions watching that night, from his bed in a south Denver suburb: a clown and future PE teacher who thought it looked a bit like upside-down juggling.Hasbro must have been watching, too. Perhaps chasing the Hoola Hoop and Pogs high of the '80s, the company scooped up a license to sell "Kup Stax," popping sets in a rectangular plastic sleeve on toy store shelves around the world. Instead of becoming a fad, the product moved to the clearance rack. Someone in middle management was probably scolded. Manufacturing ceased. In 1995, my dad attended a physical education development workshop to give new teachers a dozen ideas on how to keep kids occupied, exercised, and docile. The classics were all there: four-wheeled square scooters designed to give 80 percent of users elbow burn, dodgeballs primed to pop kids like me in the face, that large circus tent you toss above your head until it temporarily inflates so you can sit under it for a few seconds. So were the cups. He brought them home and taught his kids. I was 4, my brother 6, our sister 9. We not only fell in love with them, we got good—. We weren't outliers. Among an elementary school of 500 students, 250 signed up for an afterschool program to keep stacking. My mom drove to every Toys "R" Us and Walmart within a 50-mile radius. She bought every set of Kup Stax she could find. They were always discounted, tucked in a back corner.The local supply ran dry as my parents hosted workshops. Demand started to skyrocket from other PE teachers. My parents needed to go upstream. They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: .Now 64 with a Colonel Sanders goatee and passion for intricate leather carving, my dad's brother has been at certain points in his life: a professor at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College; a street mime in San Diego; a director of a Las Vegas magic show, performed entirely on ice; and a consultant for Japan's oldest and largest circus. If you need to find a man in middle management at Hasbro's Tokyo corporate office, you call Uncle Johnny.The deal was struck. The shipment arrived. And the cups, rather magically, disappeared from our basement.By 1998, Bob Fox was a dealer with no product and an increasingly addicted customer base. There was only one logical next step: Transition from distribution to fabrication.He did make a final good-faith effort to partner with the sport's originator, Wayne Godinet, offering to purchase $20,000 worth of product. It was almost a third of the profit earned from reselling the Japanese shipment. Godinet sent back two sample sets with a bill for the cost of goods and shipping.In a similar vein, Nike was founded in 1964 only after a running shoe company called Onitsuka lost interest in partnering with a recent Oregon track grad named Phil Knight. While his shoe empire was born between the grooves of a waffle iron, Bob and Jill's cup empire was sketched on the back of a Fresh Fish Co. paper placemat.Speed Stacks LLC was incorporated in December 1998. My parents quit their full-time public school jobs in June 2000. This was to be an official test of a core tenet of the American Dream: With enough passion and even more prodigious work ethic, you can turn a ludicrous idea into a successful business. To get started, they just needed four things.First: a mold to mass produce the cups. It required $20,000 and overcoming the absolute befuddlement of executives at a Denver plastics manufacturer who did not understand the  to include three small holes at the base. As each cup came off the line, our family would inspect the shape; minor defects in its roundness caused sticking. Nearly every cup in the first run had to be tossed out for deformities.Second: a nylon and mesh cup-carrying bag. Those were sewn in the back basement of a Vietnamese immigrant–owned textile company. We bagged each set of 12 by hand, my parents staying up until 2:00 in the morning to fulfill orders after working full school days. Bob wasn't satisfied unless the logo of every cup perfectly faced forward.Third: to hit the road. Speed Stack's first tagline was "See it! Believe it! Teach it!" My parents meant it: They knew that success was linearly related to the number of PE teachers who witnessed the sport in person. Our family of five put almost 100,000 miles on our 1997 maroon Suburban in a little over four years.Fourth: kids who could stack the cups. . For some reason, all three of the Fox progeny developed both the interest and intrinsic skill to do just that.At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door. Legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer’s voice was always our music cue. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event!"It would blast over portable speakers on either side of a gym floor. Emmy, my older sister, would lead us out from a hidden corner, followed by my brother, Brennan, then me: a 7-year-old with Coke-bottle glasses, immensely satisfied by the fact that hundreds of eyes were watching my every move.We stopped when we reached separate tables spread evenly across our makeshift stage, usually under the basketball hoop. We stood still to let the tempo build. "Let’s get ready to rumble!"The synths would drop, and we would commence stacking plastic cups. Faster and with more skill than the students and teachers in Amarillo or Ft. Lauderdale or Butzbach, Germany, or Copenhagen, Denmark, could ever think possible. Our family performed hundreds of school assemblies in almost every corner of the country (and some overseas). The 30-minute spectacle was choreographed specifically to blow the minds of kids between the ages of 7 and 14 as quickly as possible. This wasn't a talk from your fire chief about safety, or puppets teaching you the value of sharing. We humiliated principals and popular teachers by making them race us. There was a fabricated jacket with holes cut in the back that we fitted onto a volunteer, then stuck our arms through the sleeves to make it appear like they were magically adept (performed to the  soundtrack). The finale was a choreographed stacking routine, set to "Dueling Banjos" from .But a school-by-school roadshow wasn't a scalable business model. So we went to the nexus of physical education sweatsuitdom: state and national teacher conventions. At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door. It's most likely that you learned how to sport stack because your teacher, with a lanyard badge bouncing over her multi-colored windbreaker on her way to get a free muffin from the guys who sell tug-o-war ropes, stopped in her tracks in the back corner of Exhibit Hall B at an exurban Renaissance hotel. She would watch as our hands manipulated dishware so fast it blurred.If my dad was adept at putting on a good show, my mom was equally adept at corralling the press. Her journalism and PR–honed chops put sport stacking in front of millions, from the D-block of local newscasts to 30 Rock Plaza during the . That's how I found myself chatting with a shirtless Simon Cowell in the makeup room before we both appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's show, taught Tiki Barber the basics of the 3-3-3, and tried to convince a baffled Michael Caine in the green room of LIVE with Regis and Kelly that yes, indeed, kids really do stack plastic cups for fun.All press, to my parents, was good. My dad was absolutely thrilled when Glenn Beck spent four minutes of his daily Fox News monologue staring directly into the camera, railing against the dangers of stacking cups."We can't fix our country by keeping our children weak," Beck sputtered, roughly two minutes in. "They need to have spines. They need to get hit in the face a few times with a ball, you know what I mean? They have to learn how to live with and thrive on past failures."Brands soon took advantage of sport stacking's essential power: No matter the context, it attracts near-instant attention. In 2005, I appeared in a nationwide Comcast commercial for high speed internet. FritoLay shut down part of Times Square to feature our stacking talents as it launched Stax, a competitor to Pringles. A beverage company in England flew a dozen of us to London to help launch an abomination of a drink called Freekee Soda. Main ingredient? Carbonated milk. (Did I pretend to enjoy drinking that carbonated milk so as to not piss off any of the execs helping to pay for my college education? Obviously. But it is a cursed flavor.)Perhaps the only media my parents turned down was an appearance on the infamous reality show . The producers, naturally, presumed the scions of a ludicrous gym activity would have some weird baggage to mine for the masses. Unfortunately, despite the cups, we were pretty normal.To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos.It was the Germans who made everything more serious.They arrived at the 2004 World Sport Stacking Championships in matching flag-inspired sweatsuits. Multiple coaches would analyze everything from hand-tag efficiency during the four-person relay event to the mental routines of stackers before their individual competition.Sport stacking, I believe, grew into a minor phenomenon for three reasons: 1) It's visually arresting, 2) it's easy to learn, and 3) competing against the clock is incredibly addicting.Media buzz and schoolteachers kindled the first two. But my dad's magnum opus—the reason the sport didn't wither in the way of skip ball and snake boards—was that he (with the help of the 20 employees at the burgeoning HQ) built the infrastructure and equipment to spur global competition. The sport's growth coincided with two of my dad's innovations: the StackMat, a patented self-timing device that allowed kids to practice on their own for hours, aiming to trim hundredths of a second off their best times; and the World Sport Stacking Association, a governing body to codify the rules and serve as the keeper of world, national, and local records.In 1997, 250 kids were hand-timed with stop watches at the first Colorado State Championship. By 2007, ESPN aired an hourlong David Lloyd–hosted special of the World Championships, featuring more than 1,000 competitors from seven countries (re-aired in 2020 during their pandemic "The Ocho" promotion). Like everything in his life, my dad choreographed a spectacle. He ordered a three-story banner to hang behind garbage can–sized cups that served as center stage. The competition floor was arranged with dozens of tables, all marked with laser-lined tape to demarcate relay boundaries.During the final "Stack of Champions," the top competitors (and relay teams) from each event competed under the scrutiny of spotlights, three officials, an instant replay camera, and hundreds of spectators. In individual events, you're allotted two warmups and three tries. Relays are conducted head-to-head in teams of four.For a few years, I was among those finalists. To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos. Push too hard and the cups tumble. Pull back and you'll lose by thousandths of a second.A relay race in the Stack of Champions, in which I (the third stacker on the left team) stumble at the start, allowing my brother (the last stacker on the right team) to beat us by two-hundredths of a second.For those moments, you exist at the outer physical boundary of human biology. When performing at your peak, the cups feel less like they're being stacked and more like they're being sprayed. In 2001, the world record for sport stacking's marquee event, the Cycle, was 7.43 seconds. It was held by my sister. At the time, most people assumed a sub-seven-second time was physically impossible. The pattern requires more than 40 separate moves. At those speeds, hands make micro-adjustments faster than the brain can register. Her time stood for nearly four years.In 2025, the world record for the cycle is 4.739 seconds. Please understand: I know this whole endeavor is silly, that it's worthy of your slight mockery and general patina of confusion. But also understand that my dad created a culture in which German coaches passed strategic tips to Australian competitors. Where Japanese teenagers became pen pals with suburban Texans. Where nerves collapsed faster than the cups. Where kids and adults shrieked with joy over millisecond improvements. Where tension and drama and friendship mingled with the clattering cacophony of sliding and tapping plastic (there really is no sound like the one at these competitions). Sport stacking had broad exposure in both mainstream and weird places. But it had a deep impact in a much smaller community. It changed lives.You've probably heard Rachael’s voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites," by Skrillex.Milo Ferguson discovered sport stacking in first-grade PE class. "My teacher was the final boss of butch lesbians. That's the only way I know how to describe her," Ferguson, now a 23-year-old co-founder of an independent animation studio, said. Their teacher loved competition and was beloved by her students, exactly the archetype to stop at a conference booth and believe in a quirky new cup-centric educational trend.Rachael Nedrow, now a 29-year-old product manager at Amazon, first saw the sport while scrolling YouTube when she was 11. She pulled paper cups from the kitchen drawer to try and mimic the movement.Both became obsessed, quickly. Though for different reasons."I was never the fastest kid. I was always kind of chubby. I was much more the creative person than an athletic one," Ferguson said. "Sport stacking was about hand-eye coordination more than strength. It was intricate. Delicate." For the first time, they were excited to attend PE class.Nedrow, an accomplished tennis player, was intrigued by the self-improvement and rigid strictures of the clock. She bought an official set of Speed Stacks and started logging her progress on her own YouTube channel."My first competition was at a local church," Nedrow said. "I did terribly, but I still won."Despite differing motivations, Ferguson and Nedrow's paths to competitive sport stacking mirror each other. Friends weren't interested, so they went looking for a community online and at competitions. For the thousand kids that congregated on the arena floor at each World Championships, like Ferguson and Nedrow, the sentiment was common. They had found  people. They fit in, sometimes for the first time in their life. There were future college athletes and kids with autism. There were rugby fans from New Zealand (riffing off their national team, they called themselves the "All Stacks") and South Koreans who had never been to the United States. Roll your eyes, but my dad loved to say that the sport only helped build "positive pyramids." Spend a few hours watching kids pat each other on the back after a fumbled cup, or earn a hug for achieving a new personal best, and you'd buy into the platitude too.Compared to other top-level stackers, Nedrow and Ferguson's experiences only differ in one way. You've probably heard Rachael's voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites," by Skrillex. Between Spotify and YouTube, it has more than 500 million streams.And you probably know Ferguson's dad, Craig, the comedian and host of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson from 2005 to 2014.Nedrow's collision with virality gave her backstage passes to several Skrillex concerts and the greatest fodder for "Two Truths and a Lie" of all time. But sport stacking also gave her something else she wasn’t expecting: a wide group of online friends."I don't think I would have taken stacking so far if it wasn't for the online community," Nedrow said. "When you are doing anything kind of competitive, it seems like it's much better when you are doing it with people. I really loved the aspect of kids commenting on my videos, saying they started stacking because of me. What greater pleasure can you get than inspiring other people to do what you love the most?"Sport stacking gave Ferguson inclusion and validation. But perhaps more important than what it gave them is what it gave their parents. While Craig and his ex-wife Sascha had been separated for a few years by the time their kid started competing, both fully committed to supporting this weird, wholesome obsession. Sascha helped Milo learn how to breathe and center themselves before starting to stack. And she supplied an ever-growing collection of stacking equipment, stored in a dedicated room in their Southern California home.To see what sport stacking gave Craig, you need to watch his show from April 20, 2009. He spends four minutes—more than half of the entire monologue—bragging about Milo. Beneath the scripted jokes and of-the-era references (Octomom is mentioned twice), you see a guy just genuinely proud of his kid. He's like any neighbor, going off a bit too effusively about the weekend's peewee football game or math test. Except this was done for millions. And it was about ... cups. "I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success. It gave them something new and different. And it created a community. It brought kids around the world together."Sport stacking gave different things to a lot of people.For a few, it genuinely improved their life. College funds were paid through YouTube viewership revenue and small brand endorsements. Children with autism and special needs learned, practiced, competed, and socialized with others for the first time. For me and my siblings, it gave us a stable home, trips to a dozen countries, and some excellent college essay material. My sister, Emmy, went on to play basketball for four years at the University of Minnesota, was drafted into the WNBA by the Minnesota Lynx, and then played professionally overseas with Sheryl Swoopes. My brother Brennan played D-III college football and turned into a mechanical engineer at a global cosmetics company. I turned into a fairly unathletic writer.For my parents, it gave them an early retirement. A sometimes-operational 1957 VW Bug and an obsession with growing ever-larger pumpkins occupied my dad, while training to run another marathon at age 70 became a focus for my mom. They left their active roles at Speed Stacks in 2015, leaving control to some of its earliest employees. Programs are still active in thousands of schools around the world."I was motivated to spread sport stacking for the same reason I taught my students how to juggle or unicycle," my dad recalled, nearly 10 years into retirement. "I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success. It gave them something new and different. And it created a community. It brought kids around the world together. And believe it or not, that all happened because of a couple million plastic cups."For some of you reading this, sport stacking gave you an identical memory. A cross-legged seat on a linoleum gym floor. The hush from the principal. The music crescendoing into ' most iconic synth riff. The sound of cups, stacking at lightning speed. You knew, in that moment, that you weren't in for another monotonous few hours at school. Your day was about to rock. For that, you can thank my dad.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Final Fantasy iOS Game Shuts Down Over Unfixable Bug</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/223226/final-fantasy-ios-game-shuts-down-over-unfixable-bug?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Verge's Jay Peters reports: Square Enix has shut down the iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and removed it from the App Store following an unfixable bug that blocked people from accessing content they had paid for.

We raised money to do that, and to place some bets; one of them: GPU-enabling our customers. A progress report: GPUs aren’t going anywhere, but: GPUs aren’t going anywhere.A Fly Machine is a Docker/OCI container running inside a hardware-virtualized virtual machine somewhere on our global fleet of bare-metal worker servers. A GPU Machine is a Fly Machine with a hardware-mapped Nvidia GPU. It’s a Fly Machine that can do fast CUDA.Like everybody else in our industry, we were right about the importance of AI/ML. If anything, we underestimated its importance. But the product we came up with probably doesn’t fit the moment. It’s a bet that doesn’t feel like it’s paying off.If you’re using Fly GPU Machines, don’t freak out; we’re not getting rid of them. But if you’re waiting for us to do something bigger with them, a v2 of the product, you’ll probably be waiting awhile.GPU Machines were not a small project for us. Fly Machines run on an idiosyncratically small hypervisor (normally Firecracker, but for GPU Machines Intel’s Cloud Hypervisor, a very similar Rust codebase that supports PCI passthrough). The Nvidia ecosystem is not geared to supporting micro-VM hypervisors.GPUs terrified our security team. A GPU is just about the worst case hardware peripheral: intense multi-directional direct memory transfers(not even bidirectional: in common configurations, GPUs talk to each other)with arbitrary, end-user controlled computation, all operating outside our normal security boundary.We did a couple expensive things to mitigate the risk. We shipped GPUs on dedicated server hardware, so that GPU- and non-GPU workloads weren’t mixed. Because of that, the only reason for a Fly Machine to be scheduled on a GPU machine was that it needed a PCI BDF for an Nvidia GPU, and there’s a limited number of those available on any box. Those GPU servers were drastically less utilized and thus less cost-effective than our ordinary servers.We funded two very large security assessments, from Atredis and Tetrel, to evaluate our GPU deployment. Matt Braun is writing up those assessments now. They were not cheap, and they took time.Security wasn’t directly the biggest cost we had to deal with, but it was an indirect cause for a subtle reason.We could have shipped GPUs very quickly by doing what Nvidia recommended: standing up a standard K8s cluster to schedule GPU jobs on. Had we taken that path, and let our GPU users share a single Linux kernel, we’d have been on Nvidia’s driver happy-path.Alternatively, we could have used a conventional hypervisor. Nvidia suggested VMware (heh). But they could have gotten things working had we used QEMU. We like QEMU fine, and could have talked ourselves into a security story for it, but the whole point of Fly Machines is that they take milliseconds to start. We could not have offered our desired Developer Experience on the Nvidia happy-path.Instead, we burned months trying (and ultimately failing) to get Nvidia’s host drivers working to map virtualized GPUs into Intel Cloud Hypervisor. At one point, we hex-edited the closed-source drivers to trick them into thinking our hypervisor was QEMU.I’m not sure any of this really mattered in the end. There’s a segment of the market we weren’t ever really able to explore because Nvidia’s driver support kept us from thin-slicing GPUs. We’d have been able to put together a really cheap offering for developers if we hadn’t run up against that, and developers love “cheap”, but I can’t prove that those customers are real.On the other hand, we’re committed to delivering the Fly Machine DX for GPU workloads. Beyond the PCI/IOMMU drama, just getting an entire hardware GPU working in a Fly Machine was a lift. We needed Fly Machines that would come up with the right Nvidia drivers; our stack was built assuming that the customer’s OCI container almost entirely defined the root filesystem for a Machine. We had to engineer around that in our  orchestrator. And almost everything people want to do with GPUs involves efficiently grabbing huge files full of model weights. Also annoying!And, of course, we bought GPUs. A lot of GPUs. Expensive GPUs.The biggest problem: developers don’t want GPUs. They don’t even want AI/ML models. They want LLMs.  may have smart, fussy opinions on how to get their models loaded with CUDA, and what the best GPU is. But  don’t care about any of that. When a software developer shipping an app comes looking for a way for their app to deliver prompts to an LLM, you can’t just give them a GPU.For those developers, who probably make up most of the market, it doesn’t seem plausible for an insurgent public cloud to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. Their APIs are fast enough, and developers thinking about performance in terms of “tokens per second” aren’t counting milliseconds.(you should all feel sympathy for us)This makes us sad because we really like the point in the solution space we found. Developers shipping apps on Amazon will outsource to other public clouds to get cost-effective access to GPUs. But then they’ll faceplant trying to handle data and model weights, backhauling gigabytes (at significant expense) from S3. We have app servers, GPUs, and object storage all under the same top-of-rack switch. But inference latency just doesn’t seem to matter yet, so the market doesn’t care.Past that, and just considering the system engineers who do care about GPUs rather than LLMs: the hardware product/market fit here is really rough.People doing serious AI work want galactically huge amounts of GPU compute. A whole enterprise A100 is a compromise position for them; they want an SXM cluster of H100s.Near as we can tell, MIG gives you a UUID to talk to the host driver, not a PCI device.We think there’s probably a market for users doing lightweight ML work getting tiny GPUs. This is what Nvidia MIG does, slicing a big GPU into arbitrarily small virtual GPUs. But for fully-virtualized workloads, it’s not baked; we can’t use it. And I’m not sure how many of those customers there are, or whether we’d get the density of customers per server that we need.That leaves the L40S customers. There are a bunch of these! We dropped L40S prices last year, not because we were sour on GPUs but because they’re the one part we have in our inventory people seem to get a lot of use out of. We’re happy with them. But they’re just another kind of compute that some apps need; they’re not a driver of our core business. They’re not the GPU bet paying off.Really, all of this is just a long way of saying that for most software developers, “AI-enabling” their app is best done with API calls to things like Claude and GPT, Replicate and RunPod.A very useful way to look at a startup is that it’s a race to learn stuff. So, what’s our report card?First off, when we embarked down this path in 2022, we were (like many other companies) operating in a sort of phlogiston era of AI/ML. The industry attention to AI had not yet collapsed around a small number of foundational LLM models. We expected there to be a diversity of  models, the world Elixir Bumblebee looks forward to, where people pull different AI workloads off the shelf the same way they do Ruby gems.But Cursor happened, and, as they say, how are you going to keep ‘em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus? It seems much clearer where things are heading.GPUs were a test of a Fly.io company credo: as we think about core features, we design for 10,000 developers, not for 5-6. It took a minute, but the credo wins here: GPU workloads for the 10,001st developer are a niche thing.Another way to look at a startup is as a series of bets. We put a lot of chips down here. But the buy-in for this tournament gave us a lot of chips to play with. Never making a big bet of any sort isn’t a winning strategy. I’d rather we’d flopped the nut straight, but I think going in on this hand was the right call.A really important thing to keep in mind here, and something I think a lot of startup thinkers sleep on, is the extent to which this bet involved acquiring assets. Obviously, some of our costs here aren’t recoverable. But the hardware parts that aren’t generating revenue will ultimately get liquidated; like with our portfolio of IPv4 addresses, I’m even more comfortable making bets backed by tradable assets with durable value.In the end, I don’t think GPU Fly Machines were going to be a hit for us no matter what we did. Because of that, one thing I’m very happy about is that we didn’t compromise the rest of the product for them. Security concerns slowed us down to where we probably learned what we needed to learn a couple months later than we could have otherwise, but we’re scaling back our GPU ambitions without having sacrificed any of our isolation story, and, ironically, GPUs  are making that story a lot more important. The same thing goes for our Fly Machine developer experience.We started this company building a Javascript runtime for edge computing. We learned that our customers didn’t want a new Javascript runtime; they just wanted their native code to work. We shipped containers, and no convincing was needed. We were wrong about Javascript edge functions, and I think we were wrong about GPUs. That’s usually how we figure out the right answers:  by being wrong about a lot of stuff.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Django Weblog: DjangoCongress JP 2025 Announcement and Live Streaming!</title><link>https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/feb/14/djangocongress-jp-2025-announcement-and-livestream/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:12:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It will be streamed on the following YouTube Live channels:This year there will be talks not only about Django, but also about FastAPI and other asynchronous web topics.

The document reveals a notable shift in OpenAI's content policies, particularly around "sensitive" content like erotica and gore -- allowing this type of content to be generated without warnings in "appropriate contexts." The change in policy has been in the works since May 2024, when the original Model Spec document first mentioned that OpenAI was exploring "whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT."
 
ChatGPT's guidelines now state that that "erotica or gore" may now be generated, but only under specific circumstances. "The assistant should not generate erotica, depictions of illegal or non-consensual sexual activities, or extreme gore, except in scientific, historical, news, creative or other contexts where sensitive content is appropriate," OpenAI writes. "This includes depictions in text, audio (e.g., erotic or violent visceral noises), or visual content." So far, experimentation from Reddit users has shown that ChatGPT's content filters have indeed been relaxed, with some managing to generate explicit sexual or violent scenarios without accompanying content warnings. OpenAI notes that its Usage Policies still apply, which prohibit building AI tools for minors that include sexual content.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eli Bendersky: Decorator JITs - Python as a DSL</title><link>https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/decorator-jits-python-as-a-dsl/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:49:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Spend enough time looking at Python programs and packages for machine learning,
and you'll notice that the "JIT decorator" pattern is pretty popular. For
example, this JAX snippet:In both cases, the function decorated with  doesn't get executed by the
Python interpreter in the normal sense. Instead, the code inside is more like
a DSL (Domain Specific Language) processed by a special purpose compiler built
into the library (JAX or Triton). Another way to think about it is that Python
is used as a  to describe computations.In this post I will describe some implementation strategies used by libraries to
make this possible.Preface - where we're goingThe goal is to explain how different kinds of  decorators work by using
a simplified, educational example that implements several approaches from
scratch. All the approaches featured in this post will be using this flow: Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" /> Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" class="align-center" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/decjit-python.png" />
These are the steps that happen when a Python function wrapped with
our educational  decorator is called:The function is translated to an "expression IR" - .This expression IR is converted to LLVM IR.Finally, the LLVM IR is JIT-executed.First, let's look at the  IR. Here we'll make a big simplification -
only supporting functions that define a single expression, e.g.:Naturally, this can be easily generalized - after all, LLVM IR can be used to
express fully general computations.Here are the  data structures:To convert an  into LLVM IR and JIT-execute it, we'll use this function:It uses the  class to actually generate LLVM IR from .
This process is straightforward and covered extensively in the resources I
linked to earlier; take a look at the full code here.My goal with this architecture is to make things simple, but .
On one hand - there are several simplifications: only single expressions are
supported, very limited set of operators, etc. It's very easy to extend this!
On the other hand, we could have just trivially evaluated the 
without resorting to LLVM IR; I do want to show a more complete compilation
pipeline, though, to demonstrate that an arbitrary amount of complexity can
be hidden behind these simple interfaces.With these building blocks in hand, we can review the strategies used by
 decorators to convert Python functions into s.Python comes with powerful code reflection and introspection capabilities out
of the box. Here's the  decorator:This is a standard Python decorator. It takes a function and returns another
function that will be used in its place ( ensures that
function attributes like the name and docstring of the wrapper match the
wrapped function).After  is applied to , what  holds is the
wrapper. When  is called, the wrapper is invoked with
.The wrapper obtains the AST of the wrapped function, and then uses
 to convert this AST into an :When  finishes visiting the AST it's given, its
 field will contain the  representing the function's
return value. The wrapper then invokes  with this .Note how our decorator interjects into the regular Python execution process.
When  is called, instead of the standard Python compilation and
execution process (code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed
by the VM), we translate its code to our own representation and emit LLVM from
it, and then JIT execute the LLVM IR. While it seems kinda pointless in this
artificial example, in reality this means we can execute the function's code
in any way we like.AST JIT case study: TritonThis approach is almost exactly how the Triton language works. The body of a
function decorated with  gets parsed to a Python AST, which then
- through a series of internal IRs - ends up in LLVM IR; this in turn is lowered
to PTX by the
NVPTX LLVM backend.
Then, the code runs on a GPU using a standard CUDA pipeline.Naturally, the subset of Python that can be compiled down to a GPU is limited;
but it's sufficient to run performant kernels, in a language that's much
friendlier than CUDA and - more importantly - lives in the same file with the
"host" part written in regular Python. For example, if you want testing and
debugging, you can run Triton in "interpreter mode" which will just run the
same kernels locally on a CPU.Note that Triton lets us import names from the  package
and use them inside kernels; these serve as the  for the language
- special calls the compiler handles directly.Python is a fairly complicated language with  of features. Therefore,
if our JIT has to support some large portion of Python semantics, it may make
sense to leverage more of Python's own compiler. Concretely, we can have it
compile the wrapped function all the way to bytecode,
and start our translation from there.Here's the  decorator that does just this :The Python VM is a stack machine; so we emulate a stack to convert the
function's bytecode to  IR (a bit like an RPN evaluator).
As before, we then use our  utility function to lower
 to LLVM IR and JIT execute it.Using this JIT is as simple as the previous one - just swap 
for :Bytecode JIT case study: NumbaNumba is a compiler for Python itself. The idea
is that you can speed up specific functions in your code by slapping a
 decorator on them. What happens next is similar in spirit to
our simple , but of course much more complicated because it
supports a very large portion of Python semantics.Numba uses the Python compiler to emit bytecode, just as we did; it then
converts it into its own IR, and then to LLVM using .By starting with the bytecode, Numba makes its life easier (no need to rewrite
the entire Python compiler). On the other hand, it also makes some analyses
, because by the time we're in bytecode, a lot of semantic information
existing in higher-level representations is lost. For example, Numba has to
sweat a bit to recover control flow information from the bytecode (by
running it through a special interpreter first).The two approaches we've seen so far are similar in many ways - both rely on
Python's introspection capabilities to compile the source code of the JIT-ed
function to some extent (one to AST, the other all the way to bytecode), and
then work on this lowered representation.The tracing strategy is very different. It doesn't analyze the source code of
the wrapped function at all - instead, it  its execution by means of
specially-boxed arguments, leveraging overloaded operators and functions, and
then works on the generated trace.The code implementing this for our smile demo is surprisingly compact:Each runtime argument of the wrapped function is assigned a , and
that is placed in a , a placeholder class which lets us
do operator overloading:The remaining key function is :To understand how this works, consider this trivial example:After the decorated function is defined,  holds the wrapper function
defined inside . When  is called, the wrapper runs:For each argument of  itself (that is  and ), it creates
a new  holding a . This denotes a named variable in
the  IR.It then calls the wrapped function, passing it the boxes as runtime
parameters.When (the wrapped)  runs, it invokes . This is caught by the overloaded
 operator of , and it creates a new  with
the s representing  and  as children. This
 is then returned .The wrapper unboxes the returned  and passes it to
 to emit LLVM IR from it and JIT execute it with the
actual runtime arguments of the call: .This might be a little mind-bending at first, because there are two different
executions that happen:The first is calling the wrapped  function itself, letting the Python
interpreter run it as usual, but with special arguments that build up the IR
instead of doing any computations. This is the .The second is lowering this IR our tracing step built into LLVM IR and then
JIT executing it with the actual runtime argument values ; this is
the .This tracing approach has some interesting characteristics. Since we don't
have to analyze the source of the wrapped functions but only trace through
the execution, we can "magically" support a much richer set of programs, e.g.:This  with our basic . Since Python variables are
placeholders (references) for values, our tracing step is oblivious to them - it
follows the flow of values. Another example:This also just works! The created  will be a long chain of 
additions of 's runtime values through the loop, added to the 
for .This last example also leads us to a limitation of the tracing approach; the
loop cannot be  - it cannot depend on the function's arguments,
because the tracing step has no concept of runtime values and wouldn't know
how many iterations to run through; or at least, it doesn't know this unless
we want to perform the tracing run for every runtime execution .Tracing JIT case study: JAXThe JAX ML framework uses a tracing
approach very similar to the one described here. The first code sample in this
post shows the JAX notation. JAX cleverly wraps Numpy with its own version which
is traced (similar to our , but JAX calls these boxes "tracers"),
letting you write regular-feeling Numpy code that can be JIT optimized and
executed on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs via XLA. JAX's tracer builds up an underlying IR (called
jaxpr) which can then be
emitted to XLA ops and passed to XLA for further lowering and execution.For a fairly deep overview of how JAX works, I recommend reading the
autodidax doc.As mentioned earlier, JAX has some limitations
with things like data-dependent control flow in native Python. This won't work,
because there's control flow
that depends on a runtime value ():When  is executed, JAX will throw an exception, saying something
like:
This concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the
value of the argument count.As a remedy, JAX has its
own built-in intrinsics from the jax.lax package.
Here's the example rewritten in a way that actually works: (and many other built-ins in the  package) is something JAX
can trace through, generating a corresponding XLA operation (XLA has support for
While loops, to which this
 can be lowered).The tracing approach has clear benefits for JAX as well; because it only cares
about the flow of values, it can handle arbitrarily complicated Python code,
as long as the flow of values can be traced. Just like the local variables and
data-independent loops shown earlier, but also things like closures. This makes
meta-programming and templating easy .The full code for this post is available on GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s DOJ Corruption Laid Bare… By His Own Conservative Prosecutors</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/trumps-doj-corruption-laid-bare-by-his-own-conservative-prosecutors/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:49:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ make sure you read the update at the end of this story.Here’s a fun thing about corruption investigations: Usually when prosecutors uncover one quid pro quo, they don’t resolve it by offering an even bigger quid pro quo. And yet, that appears to be exactly what’s happening with NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted last fall for allegedly trading favors with Turkish officials, and is now watching those charges evaporate in exchange for helping the Trump administration with its immigration agenda.The twist — and there’s always a twist — is that the people most effectively pointing out this corruption aren’t the usual suspects. Instead, it’s coming from a bunch of dyed-in-the-wool conservative prosecutors at SDNY who are resigning en masse rather than participate in what they see as a perversion of justice. When the Federalist Society crowd starts quitting over corruption, you know something interesting is happening.The apparent corruption here isn’t just brazen — it’s documented in black and white. The Justice Department’s order to drop the case doesn’t even pretend to assess the merits of the charges. Instead, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove explicitly tied the dismissal to Adams’ willingness to assist with federal deportation efforts — a textbook example of weaponizing prosecutorial discretion for political ends.Even more disturbing is the mechanism: the dismissal is “without prejudice,” meaning charges could be refiled at any time. This isn’t just prosecutorial discretion — it’s prosecutorial extortion. The Trump administration has effectively created a sword of Damocles to hang over Adams’ head, ensuring his continued compliance with their immigration agenda. The message is clear: step out of line, and those charges might suddenly become relevant again. It’s the kind of institutional corruption that would make a banana republic blush.It means that Adams’ personal freedom now outweighs the best interests of the people of New York City.The system’s response to this corruption has been revealing. For several days after the initial order, an unusual silence descended over the Southern District office — a silence that spoke volumes about the internal struggle taking place. Then came something remarkable: a scathing letter from Acting US Attorney Danielle Sassoon to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Sassoon — a Federalist Society stalwart and former Scalia clerk who’s about as far from a “progressive prosecutor” as you can get — laid bare the rot at the core of this decision in a document that reads like a conservative legal scholar’s manifesto against institutional corruption.Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations. As Justice Robert Jackson explained, “the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.” The Federal Prosecutor, 24 J. Am. Jud. Soc’y 18 (“This authority has been granted by people who really wanted the right thing done—wanted crime eliminated— but also wanted the best in our American traditions preserved. “). I understand my duty as a prosecutor to mean enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or to those who appointed me. A federal prosecutor “is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.” Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935).For the reasons explained above, I do not believe there are reasonable arguments in support of a Rule 48(a) motion to dismiss a case that is well supported by the evidence and the law. I understand that Mr. Bove disagrees, and I am mindful of your recent order reiterating prosecutors’ duty to make good-faith arguments in support of the Executive Branch’s positions. See Feb. 5, 2025 Mem. “General Policy Regarding Zealous Advocacy on Behalf of the United States.” But because I do not see any good-faith basis for the proposed position, I cannot make such arguments consistent with my duty of candor. N.Y.R.P.C.3.3; id. cmt. 2 (“A lawyer acting as an advocate in an adjudicative proceeding has an obligation to present the client’s case with persuasive force. Performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of the client, however, is qualified by the advocate’s duty of candor to the tribunal. ” ).In particular, the rationale given by Mr. Bove—an exchange between a criminal defendant and the Department of Justice akin to the Bout exchange with Russia— is, as explained above, a bargain that a prosecutor should not make. Moreover, dismissing without prejudice and with the express option of again indicting Adams in the future creates obvious ethical problems, by implicitly threatening future prosecution if Adams’s cooperation with enforcing the immigration laws proves unsatisfactory to the Department. See In re Christoff, 690 N.E.2d 1135 (Ind. 1997) (disciplining prosecutor for threatening to renew a dormant criminal investigation against a potential candidate for public office in order to dissuade the candidate from running); Bruce A. Green & Rebecca Roiphe, Who Should Police Politicization of the DOJ?, 35 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol’y 671, 681 (2021) (noting that the Arizona Supreme Court disbarred the elected chief prosecutor of Maricopa County, Arizona, and his deputy, in part, for misusing their power to advance the chief prosecutor’s partisan political interests) . Finally, given the highly generalized accusations of weaponization, weighed against the strength of the evidence against Adams, a court will likely question whether that basis is pretextual. See, e.g. , United States v. Greater Blouse, Skirt & Neckwear Contractors, 228 F. Supp. 483, 487 (S.D.N.Y. 1964)(courts “ should be satisfied that the reasons advanced for the proposed dismissal are substantial and the real grounds upon which the application is based”)I remain baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams’s counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal. Mr. Bove admonished me to be mindful of my obligation to zealously defend the interests of the United States and to advance good-faith arguments on behalf of the Administration. I hope you share my view that soliciting and considering the concerns of the U.S. Attorney overseeing the case serves rather than hinders that goal, and that we can find time to meet.But wait, it gets better! There’s a footnote in Sassoon’s letter that tells you everything you need to know about how modern corruption works. The old-school way was to have your shady meetings in smoke-filled back rooms. The new way, apparently, is to have them in official conference rooms while actively preventing anyone from taking notes:I attended a meeting on January 31, 2025, with Mr. Bove, Adams’s counsel, and members of my office. Adams’s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed. Mr. Bove admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting’s conclusionNothing quite says you know you’re engaging in some shady ass shit like demanding you collect the notes of anyone in attendance.What makes this story particularly significant is who’s blowing the whistle. Sassoon isn’t some “woke prosecutor” that the MAGA world can easily dismiss. She’s a card-carrying member of the conservative legal establishment who, until this week, was seen as a rising star in those circles. Her willingness to sacrifice her standing in that world to uphold basic constitutional principles reveals just how far the corruption has spread — and perhaps offers a glimmer of hope that some institutional guardrails still hold.Sassoon’s stand has triggered a cascade of resignations within SDNY, with seven prosecutors (and counting) choosing to walk away rather than participate in this corruption of justice. The latest resignation letter, a scorching indictment from lead prosecutor Hagan Scotten, is particularly noteworthy. Scotten — who clerked for both Justices Roberts and Kavanaugh and explicitly states his support for the Trump administration — makes it clear that this isn’t about politics; it’s about fundamental principles of justice being trampled for political gain.There is a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake. Some will view the mistake you are committing here in the light of their generally negative views of the new Administration. I do not share those views. I can even understand how a Chief Executive whose background is in business and politics might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal. But any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.Scotten’s prediction proved grimly prophetic. As reported just hours ago, Bove and Bondi found their willing executioner — though the circumstances reveal yet another layer of institutional corruption:The prosecutor acquiesced to file the motion in an attempt to spare other career staff from potentially being fired by Emil Bove, the acting US deputy attorney general and former personal lawyer to Trump, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. The news agency named the lawyer as Ed Sullivan, a veteran career prosecutor, who agreed to alleviate pressure on his colleagues in the department’s public integrity section of 30 attorneys, two sources said, after his team was given an hour by Bove to decide between them who would file the motion.“This is not a capitulation – this is a coercion,” one of the people briefed on the meeting later told Reuters. “That person, in my mind, is a hero.” The whole section had reportedly discussed resigning en masse.The cruel irony of forcing the Public Integrity Section to compromise its own integrity isn’t lost on anyone. This is how institutions die — not with a bang, but with an ultimatum.There’s a special kind of institutional poetry here: The Public Integrity Section was given an hour to decide who would compromise their integrity. And someone did, not out of cowardice or foolishness, but to protect their colleagues. “A hero,” his colleague called him, and maybe that’s right. But it’s the kind of heroism that only exists in broken systems.The NY Times has revealed even more disturbing details about the behind-the-scenes machinations. In what reads like a playbook for corrupting justice, Bove apparently coached Adams’ legal team (including Alex Spiro, better known as Elon Musk’s go-to counsel) in a wink-wink-nudge-nudge fashion on exactly what political commitments would make the charges disappear.During the meeting, Mr. Bove signaled that the decision about whether to dismiss the case had nothing to do with its legal merits.Instead, Mr. Bove said he was interested in whether the case was hindering Mr. Adams’s leadership, particularly with regard to the city’s ability to cooperate with the federal government on Mr. Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.Mr. Bove also said he was interested in whether the case, brought by the former U.S. attorney, Damian Williams, was a politically motivated prosecution meant to hurt Mr. Adams’s re-election prospects.In her letter to Ms. Bondi, Ms. Sassoon said that she was “baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams’s counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal.”There’s something almost elegant about it, in a horrifying sort of way. The Justice Department has managed to transform a corruption prosecution into what amounts to a compliance manual for corruption. It’s like they’ve created a template: “Here’s how to trade criminal charges for political favors while maintaining plausible deniability.” And the really wild part? This is all happening after years of the MAGA world screaming about supposed “lawfare” against conservatives. Turns out they weren’t complaining about weaponized justice — they were planning how to do it themselves.History rhymes: While mass resignations of principled lawyers helped topple Nixon’s presidency, in Trump’s second term they’ve become just another item in the daily digest of institutional erosion. The difference this time? It’s not the usual suspects sounding the alarm. Instead, it’s career conservatives — products of the Federalist Society pipeline — who are putting their careers on the line to preserve what’s left of prosecutorial independence.As we’ve previously discussed, any path through this constitutional crisis requires principled conservatives to find their voice. The fact that it’s taking career prosecutors to do what elected Republicans won’t speaks volumes about where the real courage in conservative circles resides.The question now isn’t just whether our institutions can survive this assault, but whether these acts of principled resistance can inspire others before the machinery of justice is fully converted into a tool of political control. The American experiment has survived previous challenges through the courage of individuals willing to place principle above party. We’re about to find out if enough of those individuals still exist. Incredibly, that report that a prosecutor had agreed to file the dismissal turned out to not be accurate. Many hours later, after no such filing was actually made a few very bizarre things happened. First, Emil Bove filed a notice of appearance in the case. That is… not normal.Finally, the “nolle prosequi” (a notice saying “we no longer want to prosecute”) was filed. But even the way it was filed is weird and somewhat unprecedented. Two lawyers, including Ed Sullivan (who was mentioned above as effectively agreeing to be the fool to protect his coworkers) signed , but they did not sign the final statement. Instead, there was a further “order” from the DOJ, signed by Bove alone, telling the Court to effectively dismiss the case: Even the language here is bizarre. The prosecutors don’t get to “direct” the Court to do anything. That’s likely why Bacon and Sullivan signed the part about “respectfully requests” that the Court issue an order. But Bove leaps in, acting like he gets to order around the judge, and separately signs that part.What will be interesting now, is to see what Judge Dale Ho does.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The hardest working font in Manhattan</title><link>https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/</link><author>robinhouston</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:45:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed a brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love. I admired American Typewriter in all of the I <3 NYC logos, watched Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica fighting over the subway signs, and even caught an occasional appearance of the flawlessly-named Gotham, still a year before it skyrocketed in popularity via Barack Obama’s first campaign. 
	
		But there was one font I didn’t even notice, even though it was everywhere around me.
			
		Last year in New York, I walked over 100 miles and took thousands of photos of one and one font only.
			
		The font’s name is Gorton.
			
		It’s hard to believe today that there was a time before I knew of Gorton and all its quirks and mysteries. The first time I realized the font even existed was some time in 2017, when I was researching for my book about the history of typing. 
			
		Many keyboards, especially older ones, sported a particular distinctive font on their keycaps. It was unusually square in proportions, and a weird mélange of “mechanical” and “childish.”
			 
		The more I looked at it, the more I realized how bizarre and amateurish it was. The G always felt like it was about to roll away on its side. There was a goofy wavy hook sticking out of Q. P and R were often too wide. & and @ symbols would be laughed away in a type crit, and the endings of C felt like grabbing something next to it – a beginning of a ligature that never came.
			
		The strangeness extended to the digits. There was a top-flatted 3 resembling a Cyrillic letter, 7 sloping down in a unique way, a very geometric 4, an unusual – perhaps even naïve – symmetry between 6 and 9, and a conflation of O with 0 that would be a fireable offense elsewhere.
				
		Looking at just a few keyboards, it was also obvious that it wasn’t just one rigid font. There were always variations, sometimes even on one keyboard. 0 came square, dotted, or slashed. The usually very narrow letter I sometimes sported serifs. The R and the 6 moved their middles higher or lower. There also seemed to be a narrower version of the font, deployed when a keycap needed a word and not just a letter. (Lowercase letters existed too, but not very often.) 
			
		My first thought was: What a mess. Is this how “grotesque” fonts got their name?
			
		Then, the second thought: I kind of like it.
	The most distinctive letterforms of Gorton		
		But what font was it? What The Font website posited TT Rounds, Identifont suggested it could be Divulge, my early guess was DIN Rounded or something related to road signage. Whatever it was, a flat R clearly separated it from Helvetica, and the shapes were not as round as even the un-rounded Gotham’s.
			
		A few places for keyboard nerds referred to the font as “Gorton,” but that phrase yielded zero results anywhere I typically looked for fonts I could download and install.
					
		I originally thought this had to do with how keys were made. Only in newer keyboards are the letters printed on top of the keys, or charred from their surface by a laser. In older ones – those from the early 1960s laboratory computers, or the 1980s microcomputers – the way every key was constructed was by first molding the letter from plastic of one color, and then grabbing a different plastic and molding the key around the letter. A Gorton letter was as physical as the key itself. It made the keys virtually indestructible – the legend could not wear off any more than its key – and I imagined required some specialized keyboard-making machinery that came with the “keyboard font” already there.
	
		An example of a “double-shot” key from above and from below
				
		But then, I started seeing Gorton in other places.
						
		Hours of looking at close-ups of keys made me sensitive to the peculiar shapes of some of its letters. No other font had a Q, a 9, or a C that looked like this.
						
		One day, I saw what felt like Gorton it on a ferry traversing the waters Bay Area. A few weeks later, I spotted it on a sign in a national park. Then on an intercom. On a street lighting access cover. In an elevator. At my dentist’s office. In an alley. 
							
		These had one thing in common. All of the letters were carved into the respective base material – metal, plastic, wood. The removed shapes were often filled in with a different color, but sometimes left alone.
						
		At one point someone explained to me Gorton must have been a routing font, meant to be carved out by a milling machine rather than painted on top or impressed with an inked press.
								
		Some searches quickly led me to George Gorton Machine Co., a Wisconsin-based company which produced various engraving machines. The original model 1 led to model 1A and then 3U and then, half a decade later, P1-2. They were all pantograph engravers: They allowed you to install one or more letter templates and then trace their shape by hand. A matching rotating cutter would mimic your movements, and the specially configured arms would enlarge or reduce the output to the size you wanted.
									
		This immediately explained both the metaphorical and literal rough edges of Gorton.
						
		A lot of typography has roots in calligraphy – someone holding a brush in their hand and making natural but delicate movements that result in nuanced curves filled with thoughtful interchanges between thin and thick. Most of the fonts you ever saw follow those rules; even the most “mechanical” fonts have surprising humanistic touches if you inspect them close enough.
				
		But not Gorton. Every stroke of Gorton is exactly the same thickness (typographers would call such fonts “monoline”). Every one of its endings is exactly the same rounded point. The italic is merely an oblique, slanted without any extra consideration, and while the condensed version has some changes compared to the regular width, those changes feel almost perfunctory.
		
		Monoline fonts are not respected highly, because every type designer will tell you: This is not how you design a font. 
			
		It seemed at this point that perhaps P1-2 and its predecessors were a somewhat popular machining product during the 20th century’s middle decades. But casual research through materials preserved by some of George Gorton Machine Company’s fans – including the grandson of the founder – revealed something even more interesting. Gorton the font was a lot older than I expected. 
			
		I found a 1935 catalog showing the very same font. Then one from 1925. And then, there was one all the way from 1902, showing the shapes I was starting to be mildly obsessed with.
				
		To put it in perspective: the font I first assumed was a peer to 1950s Helvetica was already of retirement age the day Helvetica was born. Gorton was older than Gill Sans, Futura, or Johnston’s London Underground font. It was contemporaneous to what today we recognize as the first modern sans serif font, Akzidenz-Grotesk, released but three years before the end of the century.
	
		Imagine how stripped down and exotic Gorton must have felt right next to George Gorton Machine’s then-current logo!
						
		I started researching Gorton more. Unfortunately, as I already suspected, no one ever wrote “I used Gorton to typeset this,” because Gorton was a tenuous name at best. It was the first font, and perhaps originally the  font that came with the engraver, so it suffered a nameless fate, familiar later to many bespoke bitmap fonts adoring the screens of early computers.
						
		The difference from these fonts, however, was that Gorton was meant to travel. And so, since searching for it by name was impossible, for months and years I just kept looking around for the now-familiar shapes.
	
		Gorton wasn’t just on computer keyboards, intercom placards, and sidewalk messages visited by many shoes. Gorton was there on typewriter keyboards, too. And on office signs and airline name tags. On boats, desk placards, rulers, and various home devices from fridges to tape dispensers.
						
		It was also asked to help in situations other fonts rarely did. I spotted Gorton on overengineered buttons that were put to heavy industrial and military use. I saw it carved into surfaces of traffic control devices, elevators and escalators, locomotives and subway trains, submarines and jet fighters. Gorton made its way to peace- and wartime nuclear facilities, it was there on the elevator at the Kennedy Space Center with labels marked EARTH and SPACE… and it went  and then the Moon, as key legends on Apollo’s onboard computer.
								
		But why? Why would anyone choose this kind of an ugly font where so many nicer fonts have already been around for ages?
						
		Some of it might be the power of the default. Popular engraving equipment comes with a built-in font that’s so standard it reuses the router’s name? Of course you will see it, the same way you saw a lot of Arial in the 1990s, or Calibri today.
	
		Gorton was also convenient. If your previous engraving work required you do to the routing equivalent of handwriting or lettering – every letter done by hand – then a modern font you could simply  and one designed with “a minimum of sharp corners for rapid tracing with a smooth stroke,” must have felt like a breath of fresh air.
								
		But why engraving to begin with? Because the affordable and casual printing options we enjoy today – the office laser printers and home inkjets, the FedEx Kinko’s, the various cheap labelers – weren’t there. Even things that today feel obsolete, like dot matrix printers, Letraset, and popular letter stencils, were yet to be invented. Often, your only realistic option was the complicated and time-consuming lettering by hand.
				
		On top of that, Gorton’s longevity must have felt attractive. Ink smudges. Paint fades away. Paper can catch fire (quickly) or germs (slowly). Carve something into plastic, on the other hand, and it can survive decades. Substitute plastic for metal, and you just turned decades into centuries. The text is not added atop heavy-duty material. The text  the material.
	Various items from the 20th century typeset in Gorton					
		I felt good about all my findings: What a strange story of a strange routing font! 
	
		But it turns out I was just getting started. Because soon, I noticed Gorton as ink on paper, and as paint on metal.
	We’re used to the flexibility of fonts today. Fonts as bits inside a computer can become a website, paint on paper, CNC routing, a wall projection, and many other things. But those freedoms weren’t as easy back when fonts were made out of metal. Life’s not as much fun outside of the glamor of a TTF file, and a routing font couldn’t immediately become a regular font – so seeing Gorton being additive and not subtractive was an unexpected discovery.
								
		It turns out that there developed a small cottage industry of things that extended Gorton past its engraving origins.
								
		A company called Keuffel & Esser Co. grabbed Gorton’s machines, and used them to create lettering sets called Leroy. This was Gorton abstracted away – still a pantograph, but cheap, small, completely manual, and a vastly simplified one: no possibility to make things bigger and smaller, and no carving – instead, you’d mount a special pen and draw letters by tracing them.
								
		Another company, Wood-Regan Instrument Co., made a similar set called (semi-eponymously) Wrico. But then, they simplified the process even more. Instead of a pantograph, they offered for sale a set of simple lettering guides used to guide your pen directly on paper.
								
		Some of the traditional draftspeople pooh-poohed these inventions – one handbook wrote “[Those are] of value chiefly to those who are not skilled in lettering. A professional show-card writer could work better and faster without it. A Leroy or Wrico lettering set permits work that is neat, rapid, and nearly foolproof, if not inspired.”
				
		But the products ended up being popular and influential. Their output appeared in many technical documents, but spread even a bit further than that. Eventually, there were stencils made by Unitech, Lutz, Tacro, Teledyne Post, Tamaya, Tech Graphic, Ridgway’s, Faber Castell, Zephyr, Charvoz, Rotring, Pickett, and probably many more.
				
		Then, both EC Comics and All-Star Comics used Leroy in the 1940s and 1950s, most notably in the first comic book that introduced Wonder Woman. This was Gorton spreading further than just technical documents, and inspiring more people.
				
		Elsewhere silkscreening – a pretty cool technique of applying paint on surfaces through a wet mesh of fabric – took Gorton and Leroy in a different direction, by allowing paint on metal.
				
		There was more. The popular plastic letters attached to felt boards, popularized by restaurants decades ago, and more recently revisited by Instagram mom influencers, also clearly derive from Gorton and Leroy.
	
		I also counted at least three different systems of “Gorton movable type” – some where you could assemble physical letters, and some where you could impress them into soft materials using steel types – and I imagine there were probably more.
				
		Letraset, a cheap technique of applying a font by rubbing a letter from a provided sheet onto paper, popular throughout the 1960s, introduced first- or second-hand Leroy too – and so did a few competitors.
						
		In the regulatory space, the U.S. military canonized Gorton in 1968 as a standard called MIL-SPEC-33558 for aircraft and other equipment dials, cancelled it in 1998… then brought it back again in 2007. NATO and STANAG followed. ANSI, American standardization body, made a more rounded Leroy an official font for technical lettering via ANSI Y14.2M, and so did institutions like the US National Park Service.
					
		Gorton went on and on and on. The early Hershey vector fonts, developed on very early computers and still popular in CAD applications today, were also derived from Gorton/Leroy shapes, simplified so that the already-simple curves weren’t even necessary – any letter could now be drawn by a series of straight lines.
						
		And even in the first universe Gorton inhabited things weren’t standing still. 
	
		As the engraving industry learned what’s popular and what is not, the offerings started getting more and more sophisticated. A promotional booklet called “The Whereabouts of 230 Engraving Machines” listed Gorton customers ranging from biscuit makers to fire engine constructors. Othercatalogsproudly listed applications like book covers, billiard balls, organ keys, and toothbrushes, as well as “tools making more tools” – using Gorton engravers to create legends for other machines.
			
		After you bought your pantograph engraver, you could buy attachments for sometimes surprising use cases:
	
		The original machine-shop pantographs were supplanted by smaller portable units (called Pantoetchers) on one side, and by increasingly complex  devices on the other. First generation of those were still huge room-size endeavors with Nixie tubes and complex interfaces labeled… in Gorton itself. 
	
		But the technology matured quickly and soon more and more early manual “tracer-guided” pantographs that forced the operator to put letters side by side and then trace them by hand, were superseded by computerized ones, with both the composition and the routing completely automated. They came from George Gorton Machine Co., and from competitors like New Hermes or H.P. Preis.
					
		You no longer had to buy the chromium-plated brass alphabets weighing up to 13 pounds, choosing the right size from 3/8´´ to 3´´ ahead of time (pantographs allowed for reductions and enlargements, but only gave you a few steps within a specific range.) 
	
		Now, fonts came as digits or formulas built into computer memory, or – for a moment in time – as separate cartridges you’d insert in eager slots. (And yes, before you ask: there were other routing monoline fonts, too. But I really don’t care about any of them.)
						
		It was the same story as in word processing right next door, where old-fashioned Gutenberg-era typesetting was being replaced by increasingly smaller and cheaper computers equipped with first-laughable-then-capable software.
						
		And automation came for the Leroy branch of the tree as well. A few companies grabbed Leroy lettering templates and abstracted them away once more. They created curious small typewriter/plotter hybrids where typing letters on a keyboard would make the pen draw them on paper for you. (I own one of them, a Max Cadliner. It might be one of the strangest typewriters I’ve seen – a weird combination of a machine pretending to be another machine pretending to be a human hand.)
					
		If this was a Gorton typewriter, there were also Gorton , even more sophisticated 1980s machines whose text could be programmed in advance rather than typed one line at a time, and mixed with graphics.
				
		I don’t think the – by now 80 years and counting – fractal explosion of Gorton made its original creators rich.
				
		Copy protection in the world of typography is complicated. The font’s name can be trademarked and other companies legally prevented from using it, and you can’t just grab matrices or font files and copy them without appropriate licenses. But take any text output using a font and then redraw it – and you are within your right to do so, and even to sell the final result. At least in America, or in some other countries until somewhat recently, the shapes of the letters themselves are not legally protected.
				
		This is why Keuffel & Esser, Wood-Regan Instrument, and Letraset could potentially grab Gorton and claim it their own, as long as they didn’t name it Gorton. 
								
		But of course, Gorton was barely named “Gorton” to begin with. In the early days of George Gorton pantographs, as the default pantograph font, it came without a name. (The font sets for purchase were called “standard copies.”) Then, as other fonts were added, it was retroactively named Gorton Normal – the name of the company and the most generic word possible.
						
		Leroy lettering sets started with one font, so similarly to Gorton the font started to be known as “Leroy,” then “Series C,” then “Gothic.” New Hermes called it simply “Block,” Letraset went with “Engineering Standard,” and Rotring – another producer of little computerized plotters – with “Universal.” I’ve also seen “A style,” “Plain Gothic,” and, mysteriously, “Standpoint.” 
								
		I don’t think this was meant to be disrespectful. “Standard,“ “Universal,” “A style” might not have had the connotations of “generic” we associate with them today, but rather meaning “the only one you need,” “approved of by millions,” or “the ultimate.”
								
		But there  one name that felt somewhat inconsiderate. It appeared in one product in the 1980s, a few decades after the birth of another font whose name became recognizable and distinguished. In that product, Gorton was referred to as “Linetica.”
	A few rare examples of Gorton Extended in use						
		Each of these reappearances made small changes to the shapes of some letters. Leroy’s ampersand was a departure from Gorton’s. Others softened the middle of the digit 3, and Wrico got rid of its distinctive shape altogether. Sometimes the tail of the Q got straightened, the other times K cleaned up. Punctuation – commas, quotes, question marks – was almost always redone. But even without hunting down the proof confirming the purchase of a Gorton’s pantograph or a Leroy template set as a starting point, the lineage of its lines was obvious. (The remixes riffed off of Gorton Condensed or the normal, squareish edition… and at times both. The extended version – not that popular to begin with – was often skipped.)
	Classic Gorton vs. Gorton Modified						
		The only “official” update to Gorton I know of, and one actually graced with a name, was Gorton Modified. It was made some time in the 1970s by one of the main keyboard keycap manufacturers, Comptec (later Signature Plastics). It was almost a fusion of Gorton and Futura, with more rounded letterforms. Gone was the quirkiness of 3, 7, Q, C, and the strange, tired ampersand. This is the version people might recognize from some of the 1980s computers, or mechanical keyboards today. 
	
		It is also that last Gorton that mattered.
	A collection of movies and TV shows featuring Gorton							
		My every walk in Chicago or San Francisco was counting down “time to Gorton” – sometimes mere minutes before I saw a placard or an intercom with the familiar font.
								
		This might be embarrassing to admit, but I have never been so happy seeing a font in the wild, particularly as there was almost always some new surprise – a numero, a line going through the Z, a new use, or a new imperfection. And, for a font that didn’t exist, I saw it surprisingly often.
										
		I even spotted Gorton a few times in Spain, or the U.K., and didn’t make too much of it, not thinking about the likelihood of machines from George Gorton’s company in a small town of Racine, Wisconsin making it all the way to different continents. In hindsight I should have.
	Gorton on old British cars, with a particularly delightful Rolls Royce logo made by a simple duplication of the classic Gorton letter R						
		It was only on a trip to Australia where something started connecting. Here, once more, I saw Gorton on the streets, put to work in all sorts of unglamorous situations:
								
		Some letterforms in the above photos felt slightly odd, and so did Gorton on the heavy machinery in an abandoned shipyard on an island near Sydney:
								
		And a visit to a naval museum cemented it all:
	
		It was Gorton, although with some consistent quirks: 2, 5, 6, and 9 were shorter, the centers of M and W didn’t stretch all the way across, and the distinctive shape of S was slightly different here.
								
		Fortunately, this time around, a type designer familiar with my now-public obsession with Gorton clued me in. Gorton didn’t actually originate from Racine, Wisconsin in the late 19th century. It started a bit earlier, and quite a bit further away, at a photographic lens maker in the U.K. called Taylor, Taylor & Hobson. 
								
		In 1894, TT&H needed some way to put markings on their lenses. This being late 19th century, their options were limited to manual engraving, which must have felt tricky given the small font sizes necessary. So the company did what makers sometimes do – instead of searching for a solution that might not have even existed, they made new types of machines to carve out letters, and then designed a font to be used with them.
	
		I don’t know how this first proto-Gorton was designed – unfortunately, Taylor, Taylor & Hobson’s history seems sparse and despite personal travels to U.K. archives, I haven’t found anything interesting – but I know simple technical writing standards existed already, and likely influenced the appearance of the newfangled routing font.
	From a 1895 “Free-hand lettering” book by Frank T. Daniels					
		This was perhaps the first modern pantograph engraver, and perhaps even the arrival of a concept of an engraving font – the first time technical writing was able to be replicated consistently via the aid of the machine.
				
		No wonder that other companies came knocking. Only a few years later, still deep within the 19th century, Taylor, Taylor & Hobson licensed their stuff to a fledgling American company named after its founder. Gorton Model 1 was the first U.S. version of the engraver, and the TT&H font must have been slightly adjusted on arrival. 
	A Taylor-Hobson pantograph in use in 1942			
		This adds to the accomplishments of Gorton – the font was actually  than even Akzidenz-Grotesk, and has been used on World War II equipment and later on on British rifles and motorcycles (and 3,775 finger posts in one of the UK’s national parks), but it complicates the story of the name even more. Turns out, the font without a name has even less of a name than I suspected.
				
		If the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson (or, Taylor-Hobson, as their engravers were known) “branch” of Gorton were more used, should it usurp the at least somewhat popular Gorton name? Or should it just because it was first and the letterform changes were small? Does it matter? Where does one font end and another begin? (Unsurprisingly, TT&H didn’t properly name the font either, eventually calling it “A style” for regular and “C style” for condensed variants. Google searches for “taylor hobson font” are a lot more sparse than those for Gorton.)  
	GortonGorton CondensedThe Gorton quasisuperfamily
		In the end, I’m sticking with Gorton for the whole branch since that feels the most well-known name, but I feel ill-equipped to make that call for everyone. You might choose to call it Gorton, Leroy, TT&H, Taylor-Hobson, or one of the many other names. (Just, ideally, not Linetica.)
	A comparison of all major editions of Gorton					
		And so, throughout the 20th century, Gorton has lived two parallel lives – one originating in the U.K. and later expanding to its colonies and the rest of Europe, and another one in America. 
								
		I am still tracing various appearences of Gorton and perhaps you, dear reader, will help me with that. (Chances are, you will see Gorton later today!) I’m curious about whether Gorton made it to Eastern Europe, Africa, or Asia. I’m interested in seeing if it appeared in Germany where the objectively better-designed DIN fonts became much more popular in Gorton’s niche.
	
		The history of this strange font spans over a century and I’ve seen it in so many countries by now, used in so many situations. But it’s impossible for me to say Gorton is the most hard-working font in the world.
								
		To this title, there are many contenders. Garamond has a head start of 300+ years and has been released in more versions than letters in any alphabet. Helvetica is so famous and used so much that even its ugly copy, Arial, became a household name. Whatever font MS Office or a popular operating system appoint to be “the default” – from Times New Roman through Calibri to Roboto – immediately enjoys the world premiere that any Hollywood movie would be envious of. There is even a 5×7 pixel font originally started by Hitachi that you can see everywhere on cheap electronic displays in cash registers and intercoms.
								
		But there is one place in the world where Gorton pulls triple duty, and I feel confident in saying at least this: Gorton is the hardest working font in Manhattan.
							
		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed my brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love: American Typewriter, Helvetica, Gotham. But, in hindsight, I missed the most obvious one.
								
		Gorton is everywhere in Manhattan. It’s there in the elevators, in the subway, on ambulances, in various plaques outside and inside buildings. And god knows it’s there on so, so many intercoms.
						
		I wouldn’t be surprised if there weren’t a single block without any Gorton in a whole of Manhattan.
	A complete inventory of Gorton outside, near my hotel, between 5th and 7th avenues and 25th and 35th streets. I didn’t have access to the interiors of most buildings.	
		The omnipresence of Gorton makes it easy to collect all the type crimes layered on top of the font’s already dubious typographical origins. Walking through Manhattan, you can spot the abominable lowercase that should better be forgotten:
								
		You can see all sorts of kerning mistakes:
										
		You will notice the many, many routing imperfections – an unfinished stroke, a shaky hand, or services of a pantograph that never felt the loving touch of regular maintenance:
	
		There are all the strange decisions to haphazardly mix various styles of Gorton, or even to mix Gorton with other fonts:
												
		You can even spot reappearing strange characters like a weirdly deep 3, or a flattened 4:
	
    I wish I understood how they came to be, but I have a hunch. The nature of pantographic reproduction is that Gorton carved into metal is not that far away from the original Gorton font template you started with! So in addition to the George Gorton and Taylor Hobson originals, and the other named and above-the-table copies, they might have been bigger or smaller Gorton . I have one myself, carved into acrylic, of unknown provenance and even more nameless than I thought possible for an already name-free font.
  
		But New York Gorton holds pleasant surprises, too. Despite the simplicity of Gorton itself, the combinations of font sizes, cutter sizes, materials, reproductions, and applications can still yield some striking effects:
	
	
			All my Gorton walks in Manhattan in 2024
		

		This was what made me walk 100 miles. Over and over again, Gorton found ways to make itself interesting. Without hyperbole, I consider the above photos simply beautiful.
	
		In a city that never sleeps, Gorton wasn’t allowed to sleep, either. Even in the richest and most glamorous neighborhoods of Manhattan, the font would be there, doing the devil’s work without complaining. Gorton made Gotham feel bougie; American Typewriter touristy.
	
		And once in a while, I’d find Gorton that would wink at me with a story – followed by that aching in the heart as I realized I’d never know what the story was.
				
		You’re not supposed to fall in love with an ugly font. No one collects specimens of Arial. No one gets into eBay fights for artifacts set in Papyrus. No one walks a hundred miles in a hot New York summer, sweating beyond imagination, getting shouted at by security guys, to capture photos of Comic Sans.
								
		So why do I love Gorton so much? 
								
		The Occam’s Razor seems sharp on this one. Perhaps I like it because I’m a boy and Gorton is often attached to heavy machinery. 
					
		But there must be more to it. Perhaps it’s all about the strange contrasts Gorton represents. The font is so ubiquitous, but also profoundly unrecognizable, sporting no designer and no name. Gorton is a decidedly toy-like, amateurish font deployed to for some of the most challenging type jobs: nuclear reactors, power plants, spacecraft. More than most other fonts, Gorton feels it’s been made by machines for machines – but in its use, it’s also the font that allows you to see so many human mistakes and imperfections.
					
		Gorton also feels mistake-friendly. The strange limitations of Gorton mean that some of the transgressions of other fonts don’t apply here. The monoline nature of the font means that messing with the size of Gorton is okay: Shrinking the font for small caps or superscript, for example, gives you still-valid letterforms, almost by accident. 
	
		Stretching or slanting Gorton is not as much a typographical crime as it would be with other fonts because you don’t stretch the tip of the router itself.
								
		There are genuinely moments where I felt Gorton gave people freedoms to maul it decades before variable fonts allowed us similar flexibiity.
		And on top of that, the simplicity of the letterforms themselves feels compatible with the typical naïveté of Gorton’s typesetting. 
	Various accessories and attachments allowing you to shift Gorton around in a way other fonts would not allow
    Sure, there are really bad renditions that are inexcusable. 

		But most of the time, the imperfections and bad decisions are what makes Gorton come alive. They don’t feel like a profound misunderstandings of typography, typesetting, or Gorton itself. They don’t feel like abuses or aberrations. No, they feel exactly how Gorton was supposed to be used – haphazardly, without much care, to solve a problem and walk away. (Later routing fonts copied Helvetica, but seeing Helvetica in this context with all the same mistakes grates so much more.)
				
		The transgressions are not really transgressions. They all feel honest. The font and its siblings just show up to work without pretense, without ego, without even sporting a nametag. Gorton isn’t meant to be admired, celebrated, treasured. It’s meant to do some hard work and never take credit for it. Gorton feels like it was always a font, and never a typeface. (Depending on how rigid you are with your definitions, some versions of Gorton – especially those without instructions on how letters are positioned against each other – might not even classify as a font!)
						
		And I think I love Gorton because over the years I grew a little tired of the ultra flat displays rendering miniature pixels with immaculate precision. 	
		With Gorton, carving into metal or plastic means good-looking fixes are impossible:
	
		And unsurprising given its roots, Gorton has dimensionality that most fonts cannot ever enjoy: A routing tip picked in the 1980s and a sun coming in from just the right angle forty years later can create a moment that thousands of letterpress cards can only dream of.
	
		Perhaps above everything else, Gorton is all about . 
  
    Every kind of engraving has it, of course. But these are not precise submillimeter letters at the bottom of your MacBook Pro or Apple Watch. This is the utilitarian, often harried, sometimes downright  Gorton, carved into steel of a  
		mid-century intercom and filled in with special paste or wax, or put on an office placard made out of a special two-layer material made especially so engraving it reveals the second color underneath, without the need for infill. 
				
		(This is also true when it comes to the original reason I learned of Gorton. Letters on keycaps show the same artifacts – you just have to look very, very closely.)
	
		That’s the last, and perhaps the best thing to fall in love with. 
	
		You won’t be able to fully appreciate it here, of course, but maybe this will give an approximation of how beautiful Gorton’s non-beauty can be:
						
		This has been a strange thing to write. Gorton has been around for over 135 years and used in so many countries for so many reasons, and yet I found no single article about it. 
						
		I feel the burden of being an amateur historian, wanting to know and share so much more, but only being able to provide little. I don’t know the full extent of Gorton’s use. I don’t know who designed it. My chronology is rickety and pieced together from a few breadcrumbs. I dream of seeing the original drawings or drafts once laid on the tables of Taylor, Taylor & Hobson offices, or some notes, or some correspondence. I fear they might no longer exist.
						
		Also, if part of the allure of Gorton is shying away from the limelight and not being admired, am I doing it a disservice by writing about it?
						
		But mostly, I can’t shake the feeling that we all missed a window. That this essay can’t be just a celebration, but also needs to be the beginnings of a eulogy.
						
		Walking around New York, you get a sense that even Gorton carved into metal can disappear. Some of the signs are rusted or destroyed beyond repair. Others get replaced by more modern, charmless equivalents.
								
		Gorton itself is obsolete. All the keyboards that use Gorton Modified you can still buy new today are tipping a hat to nostalgia. The omnipresence of Gorton in New York City is already time shifted from its decades of glory, a simple confirmation of what Robert Moses knew so well: that once built, cities don’t change all that much. But few of the new placards use Gorton, and none of the new intercoms do. 
	
		Taylor, Taylor & Hobson went through multiple splits and mergers and survives as a subsidiary of Ametek, chiefly working on measuring devices. George Gorton Machine Co. from Racine has been bought by Kearny & Trecker, which became Cross & Trecker, was acquired by Giddings & Lewis, and then acquired  by ThyssenKrupp, but not before the Gorton branch was spun off as Lars, and in a sequence of events now resembling a telenovella, eventually bought by Famco in 1987. I do not believe any corporate grandchildren of TT&H and George Gorton’s company are today selling Gorton in any capacity.
								
		It will take decades, perhaps even centuries, but one day the last of this font will be gone. The modern recreations (I eventually found quite a few) won’t help. They are perhaps all missing a point, anyway.
	
		But there’s a somewhat silver lining. Yes, when Gorton is carved into fresh metal, there might be nothing more pretty than seeing its depths glistening in the sun.
	
		But fresh, shining metal is at this point rare. Fortunately, the Gorton I love most is the weathered Gorton.
								
		Manhattan’s tired Gorton is the best variant of Gorton: infill cracked by hot summers followed by frigid winters, the surface scratched by keys or worn out by many finger presses, the routing snafus meeting decades of wear and tear. Gorton’s no stranger to water, snow, rust, or dirt.
			
		This is, perhaps, how you become gortonpilled. You learn to recognize the 7 with a crooked hook, the Q with a swung dash, the strange top-heavy 3, the simple R. You start noticing the endings of each character being consistently circular, rather than occasionally flat. A routing mistake, suspicious kerning, or the absence of lowercase are not a wrongdoing – they’re a .
								
		You find yourself enchanted with how this simple font went so very far. And then you touch the letters, just to be sure. If you can  them, chances are this is Gorton.

The multi-billion dollar project will connect the U.S., Brazil, India, South Africa, and other key regions. The system utilizes 24 fiber pairs and introduces what Meta describes as "first-of-its-kind routing" that maximizes cable placement in deep water at depths up to 7,000 meters. 

The company developed new burial techniques for high-risk areas near coasts to protect against ship anchors and other hazards.

Authentication through device code flow is designed for logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These devices typically don’t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a computer or other device that’s easier to sign in with and enters the code.

Although the usage of FEM is an avenue that will not be closed in future work, the large number of parameters to be set experimentally for each segment (Young’s modulus, moment of inertia. . . ), given that the manufacturing process is so variable meant that, in this first phase, we opted to use some type of PAUL modelling based on data collection.\
The output of the system is taken as the position and orientation reached by the final end –thus, at this stage, all the positions of the intermediate segments are ignored– and as input, the inflation times of each of the bladders. As there were not enough pressure sensors available at the time of the construction of the robot, it was decided to take inflation time as an input variable. As the working pressure is limited by the pressure limiting valve and the flow rate into each bladder can be assumed to be constant, the time is equivalent to the volume of air introduced into each cavity.\
All the control options considered have in common the need for a large amount of empirical data, which leads to the need to develop an experimental design to systematise the collection of this data. Since the capture of this information is done in different phases and the datasets have to represent the behaviour of the robot in an objective way, the re-applicability of the experiment takes on special importance.\
The data stored in the datasets was the position of the robot tip and the set of inflation times that achieve this configuration. The aforementioned limitation that only two of the three bladders in the segment are inflated reduces redundancies. As previously stated, more than two segments lead to redundancies, which implies that the inverse kinematic model of the robot can have multiple solutions.\
The data collection process involves several sequential steps. Initially, a set number of samples is determined. For each sample, Matlab commands dispatch a random combination of nine inflation times, corresponding to each valve of PAUL, to the actuation bench. Times are generated below a maximum time limit Tmax, and ensuring that only two cavities per segment are inflated. Following this, the robot’s bladders are inflated based on the sent times. Subsequently, the vision system’s two cameras capture images to determine the position and orientation of the robot’s end. This entire procedure is repeated for the specified number of iterations, and upon completion, the collected data is stored in the dataset\
The information on swelling times is stored as a percentage, with a value of 0 corresponding to a zero swelling of that segment and 100 corresponding to Tmax, the swelling for the maximum number of milliseconds defined for this data collection session. This value Tmax is stored, together with the values, in the dataset, in order to be able to compare different datasets. The reason for this coding comes from the lack of information, a priori, on what is the maximum pressure that a PAUL bladder admits. Although it is true that it was experimentally determined that inflation times of more than 1500 ms in a row led to punctures, the application of lower times during a repeated number of cycles also generated leaks. On this basis, it was decided never to inflate any valve, either in one or several steps, more than 1000 ms.\
Along with the inflation times of each bladder, the position and orientation reached by the end tip is stored, based on the camera readings. In particular, the position of the green marker and the orientation of the trihedron are stored. The latter is expressed in Euler angles, as it is a much efficient form of storage than a rotation matrix. In addition, the dataset also contains metadata from the collection process that are believed to influence the results, such as the pneumatic line pressure or the ambient temperature.\
Some aspects in the pneumatic system merit attention. Initially, bladder inflation and deflation are not symmetrical processes. Geometric constraints in the pneumatic components result in a lower deflation rate compared to inflation. Consequently, when the PAUL receives a deflation time, it multiplies it by an empirically derived factor, approximately 1.45 for a 1.2 bar working pressure. This multiplier compensates for the discrepancy between inflation and deflation times of a singular group of bladders, ensuring that the deflation time aligns with the time required to reach the same inflation point.\
Similarly, although it is physically possible to inflate several valves at the same time, it has been shown that this parallel flow distribution means that the effective fillings of each valve are not the same as if they were inflated individually. To prevent this phenomenon, it was decided to inflate each bladder individually both during the data acquisition process and utterly, when PAUL was asked to reach certain positions.\
Finally, there are hysteresis phenomena in the silicone that cause the position reached by inflating for a time t to be different from the position reached by inflating first for a time t1 and then for a time t2 = t − t1. The strategy employed to tackle this problem was to capture the dataset bringing PAUL back to its zero position between each sample. Nevertheless, when controlling the robot in open-loop this is not possible, or, at least, not desirable, as one may wish to follow trajectories or travel through a sequence of points. Therefore, transitioning from position x1 to x2 requires an additional factor of 1.2, also derived experimentally, to account for hysteresis effects.Once the dataset is generated, it can be used to model the behaviour of PAUL for open-loop control. It is foreseen, as a future line, to train a neural network for the direct kinematics and another one for the inverse kinematics. However, given the large amount of data that may be required (in [62] 24389 samples are used for a three-segment robot like this one), a table look-up method has been used for this work.\
The method for direct kinematics –which allows obtaining the position and orientation of the final end of the robot from the inflation times of the nine bladders– consists of searching, in the generated dataset in the previous step, the three inflation time values located at a shorter distance from the inflation time given as a reference. Obviously, if the set of inflation times sought were in the table, the value associated with these times would be returned as a result of the direct kinematic model. Otherwise, the average of the position and orientation values associated with the three closest inflation times, weighted by the distance (Euclidean norm) existing between each of them and the values of reference inflation times, is returned as the position and orientation value of the robot.\
\
with them, it is possible to calculate the position returned by the direct kinematic model using the expression:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NATO backs its first cohort of European dual-use startups</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/nato-backs-its-first-cohort-of-european-dual-use-startups/</link><author>Mike Butcher</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:16:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With both Vice President J.D.

It is a cube made of steel profiles with methacrylate sheets on the walls. The pneumatic bench, the power supply and the microcontroller were placed on top of the structure.\
The aim of the data acquisition system is to be able to measure, whenever required, the position and orientation of the end of the robot in order to be able to relate it to the inflation times of each bladder and thus be able to create an open-loop model of PAUL. For this purpose, three elements are available: the cameras, the calibration grid and the trihedron.\
Two Spedal AF926H USB cameras with 1920 x 1080 px, 80◦ field of view and a frequency of 60 fps are used to capture the images. These have been placed on two tripods external to the robot’s structure. They are calibrated with a checkerboard of 11 x 8 squares of 20 mm each, which can be seen in Figure 11a.\
The vision beacon, on the other hand, has the task of being recognised in space to determine the position and orientation of the mobile system with respect to the fixed system. The trihedron, displayed in Figure 11b, consists of three spheres, manufactured by 3D printing in PLA, inside which three LED diodes have been embedded. Thanks to these, it is possible to vary the luminosity of the spheres by means of software, keeping the system functioning correctly when the workplace or the environmental or lighting conditions vary.\
The existence of the central rod, which moves the luminous spheres away from the base of the robot end, makes possible the spheres to be visible to the cameras in all the poses that the robot can adopt. If the spheres were otherwise directly attached to the\
end of the robot, there would be numerous poses in which it would not be possible to determine the position, as the spheres would be hidden by the robot itself.4.2 Vision Capture System\

Because coordinates of the real world are independent of the camera, if Equation (1) is applied for both cameras and rk vector cleared in the two equations, it can be said that:\
\
System of equations (2) can be solved using the Least Squares Method:\
\
and then use the Rodrigues’ rotation formula to obtain it, respect to the real world base in the form of a rotation matrix:\

Treating drugs users as just as terrible as drug dealers has led to a ton of incarceration and a  ton of collected evidence that is apparently being consumed by things cops and crooks are used to dealing with: rats.“Drug-addicted rats” are eating narcotics seized and stored by Houston police, prompting a change in how long the police department is required to store the evidence, officials said.Houston Mayor John Whitmire, Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare and Houston Police Chief J. Noe Diaz announced new steps Friday to dispose of drugs and other evidence kept at police headquarters downtown, some of which has been sitting there for decades, attracting rodents, even though cases they are linked to have long been adjudicated.This is where it becomes clear that drugs have won the Drug War. This single evidence locker contains enough weed to start a drug empire. “We got 400,000 pounds of marijuana in storage,” Whitmire said. “The rats are the only ones enjoying it.”The Houston PD (which has more than its share of corrupt drug cops) is sitting on 200  of marijuana it has amassed over the years. And yet, I would wager that no Houston resident has any trouble obtaining this product on short notice.The same goes for the rest of the stuff in the warehouse, which apparently (until recently) contained cocaine seized in 1996. As police chief J. Noe Diaz pointed out, the evidence has outlasted the case. The suspect pled guilty, served his time, and was free to go long before the evidence used to convict him was.It’s apparently a nationwide problem, according to some of the forensic experts interviewed by NBC News, which carried a story early last year about a similar drug-eating rat problem in New Orleans. New rules are being put in place to destroy this evidence more frequently. On one hand, it makes sense to destroy evidence after defendants serve their time in jail. On the other hand, I wouldn’t get  carried away giving PDs permission to destroy evidence, since that’s the sort of thing that lends itself to cover-ups and the disappearance of evidence prisoners might use to challenge their convictions — a process that can take years, thanks to the justice system’s reluctance to reconsider its own calls and the byzantine processes convicted people are expected to navigate just to have (a very looooong) shot at having their cases heard. But above all that, there’s the sheer amount of drugs being held in evidence warehouses. If there’s nearly a half-million pounds of weed just laying around at any given time, it would seem law enforcement isn’t scoring many meaningful wins in the Drug War. At best, it’s a game of Whack-a-mole that won’t generate enough tickets to make it worth visiting the merchandise booth at the arcade. At worst, it’s just cops looking busy, a meaningless waste of time that unfortunately results in people losing years of their lives to a system that not only can’t fix what’s broken, but clearly prefers doing the things that don’t work as often as possible in perpetuity. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, said to be in talks to raise $10B</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/elon-musks-ai-company-xai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-raise-10b/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:54:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, is said to be in talks to raise $10 billion in a round that would value xAI at $75 billion.

This list was only online for a maximum of 30 minutes, starting around 4:50 p.m. EST; by 5:23 p.m. on February 11, it was gone from public view, according to the snapshots Schönemann’s app⁩ captured. According to the screenshots provided by Schönemann⁩, the list includes (all of the following are direct quotes): $78,000 to Palestinian activist group whose chairman was photographed attending an anniversary event celebrating the founding of the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Palestine terrorist group$1 Million for foreign DEI programs, including ‘indigenous language technology’ in Guatemala, per non-public funding docs reviewed by WFB$5 million for effort to treat eating disorders by “affirming” LGBTQIA+ patients’ sexual orientation and gender claimsUp to $3 million to defund the police advocacy group to pursue “climate justice” for convictsFunded performances of play “Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,” in which God is bisexual and communists are good, in North MacedoniaDisbursed $15,000 to “queer” Muslim writers in IndiaShelled out tens of thousands to create army of 2,500 LGBTQI+ alliesUp to $10 million worth of USAID-funded meals went to al Qaeda-linked terrorist group the Nusra Front$500,000 to group that “empowers women” in attempt to solve sectarian violence in Israel just ten days before Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks$4.67 million to EcoHealth Alliance – one of the key NGOs funding bat virus research at Wuhan Institute of Virology — in late 2021.

These are made by pouring paraffin wax into previously made female moulds (Figure 5a).\
After half an hour, the wax has solidified and the cores can be removed and inserted into the mould (Figure 5b). The mould consists of four 3D printed parts (two sides, a bottom cap and a top grip on which the cores rest) which are screwed together and then sealed with a hot silicone bead to prevent leakage during subsequent curing (Figure 5c).\
The silicone can then be poured into the mould, which must be filled to the top to counteract the aforementioned shrinkage. In particular, TinSil8015 requires a mass ratio of 10:1 liquid to catalyst. For the dimensions of the segment, about 175 g of total mixture are required.\
The curing process lasts 24 hours at ambient temperature (Figure 5d), after which it can be removed from the mould. It may be necessary to use a scalpel to remove the silicone burrs (Figure 5e).\
Once the segment has been built, the cores that have been used to create the bladders are removed. While the wood can be removed by pulling, it is necessary to apply heat to the segment to remove the wax. Thus, it is first placed in an oven at 110 ◦C (Figure 5f) and then immersed in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes, which ensures the elimination of the residual traces of wax (Figure 5g).\
Since the males are through, it is required to close the lower part of the segment. To do this, a layer of silicone is poured onto the plate of Figure 5h, glued onto the segment and left to cure for 24 hours. Finally, the pneumatic tubes are joined to the segment, adhering them with cyanoacrylate and strengthening the tightness with the usage of plastic flanges (Figure 5i).\
The final result, a functional segment is depicted in Figure 6. Experimentally, it is found that its weight is 161 g and that, as designed, it has a height of 100 mm and an external diameter of 45 mm.Within the robot, the function of the pneumatic bench is to control the flow of compressed air from the compressor according to the control signals. Specifically, the PAUL bench consists of 6 pairs of 2/2 valves (SMC VDW20BZ1D model) and 3/2 valves (SMC Y100 model) placed in series, which will therefore allow up to 12 degrees of freedom. Both are shown in Figure 7. The physical characteristics of the 2/2 valves limited the total pressure of the assembly to 4 bar, but to reduce the risk of segment leakage, it was reduced with a flow regulator to 2 bar. Figure 8 presents a schematic of the pneumatic circuit.\
\
The valves are operated via 24 V voltage signals. A MOSFET (model IRF540) is the switch in charge of managing them. Initially, the use of relays was considered, but the high current they would consume made their use unfeasible. An Arduino Due was chosen as the bench controller. A PC power supply, capable of supplying up to 8.5 A, is responsible for powering the unit, whose final layout is illustrated in Figure 9.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No Startup Has Ever Failed Because it Didn’t Have a Blog</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/no-startup-has-ever-failed-because-it-didnt-have-a-blog?source=rss</link><author>susie liu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Somewhere along the way, startup marketing got hijacked by creator economy logic.“If I build an audience, I’ll have an easier time selling.” “If I post valuable content, customers will come to me.” “Content is how you earn trust.”No startup has ever failed because it didn’t have a blog. Name one high-growth startup that failed because it didn’t have a content marketing strategy. \
  . Because it’s never happened. \
Startups fail because: 1) They didn’t find product-market fit. 2) They spent money like fools. 3) A combo of shaky financials plus bad operations. Not because they skipped the “10 SaaS Growth Hacks” Medium post.The Case Against Content Marketing\
Content isn’t just eating up your time—it’s going to eat your startup for lunch. You think you’re building something, but really, you’re just shuffling pixels around and calling it momentum. ==You’ll die because you’re wasting your best thinking on being interesting instead of being necessary.==\
Don’t try to be a media company when you haven’t even figured out how to be a business.You Ignore Your Most Powerful Asset: Your Product\
The best startups don’t need a perfect LinkedIn strategy. They need a product so good that people can’t shut up about it.Tesla didn’t become Tesla because Musk wrote aspirational posts. (Tesla happened, then people started dissecting every Elon tweet.) Superhuman didn’t win because they ranked for “best email productivity tool”.Notion didn’t explode because they had a “high-value” newsletter.\
They each built something so good that content wasn’t necessary.\
==But content marketing makes you spend more time talking about your product than making it actually worth talking about.== If you’re creating Canva graphics explaining why your product is amazing, ask yourself: Why isn’t it obvious already?You’re Playing To Your Weakness\
If you’re a tech founder, chances are your biggest strength isn’t crafting “valuable content.” But content marketing throws you into the most crowded, attention-starved battlefield on earth that’s populated by all the creative genius humanity has to offer: the Internet. \
Content marketing pulls you away from your strengths. It forces you into a slow, bloated, competitive game where you’re fighting against seasoned creators and media companies—people whose  is content. And you’re out here thinking you can compete?\
While you’re wasting time learning how to be a copywriter, you’re neglecting the strengths that gave you the guts to build a company in the first place. \
Content marketing is a wait-and-see game.Do this long enough, and you'll start convincing yourself that the reason you're not making progress is because you haven’t published enough. So, you rinse and repeat, cranking out more content—and waiting for something to happen. I promise you, nothing will. ==Unless you’re a media company, the real problem won’t be solved through content volume==. Look at the Airbnb guys. They tackled crappy check-in rates by bringing their cameras into homes and taking better photos, not by blogging about the future of holiday stays. \
Founders love content marketing because it’s a safe way to feel productive without doing the uncomfortable shit. Well, if you want to stay away from the uncomfortable, you should consider going back to your desk job. You’re Sprinting For The Wrong Finish Line\
==Content marketing subtly shifts the goalpost of what success looks like.== Instead of $$$ in the bank, founders start measuring social impressions. Instead of customers using the product, they’re tracking newsletter signups. Instead of winning market share, they’re focused on LinkedIn comments.\
 Awareness and engagement doesn’t pay the bills. Real growth is customers in, cash in. If you don’t know the difference between attention and action, content marketing is eating your brain. Are you really growing, or have you just gotten more people to consume free content?You’re Killing Your Brand\
Weird, right? You’d think viral content will help you build your brand. Nope, because going viral means you’ve got to jump on every buzzword, every new format, and every other trend because it’s what everyone’s talking about. Well, trends don’t care two cents about what your brand stands for. \
Every time you chase a trend, you’re stretching your brand thin, trying to force it into a mold that doesn’t fit. You’re watering down your purpose for a quick hit, all while ignoring the fact that ==building a memorable brand means sticking to your guns, even if it’s what the algorithm despises.==Inbound’s Still In. You Just Don’t Need Content To Do It.The content marketing trend is a byproduct of people misunderstanding HubSpot’s whole inbound marketing thing. \
  Inbound was and still is genius, but inbound marketing was never about “just create content.” It was about ==creating undeniable value before asking for the sale.== (That, and not relying on paid ads for awareness.) \
HubSpot made content work because information was scarce in 2006—they gave away what no one else would. Today, everyone’s got an “ultimate guide” to something. And if they don’t, GPT can make something up based on a prompt. The problem now isn’t lack of content. \
Here’s how to do inbound marketing in the post-content age.1. Figure Out If Content Even Makes Sense for You\
Before you waste another hour on a blog post, ask yourself:Is my audience actively looking for information, but struggling to find it? Is there a knowledge gap that makes them hesitate to buy? Are my competitors hoarding insights instead of sharing them?\
If the answer is yes, fine. Write. Publish. Own the space. If the answer is no, STOP. No one needs your “Top 10 Trends” list. They have Google and chatbots for that.\
Know what’s better than teaching people how to do something? ***Making sure they never have to learn it in the first place. ***\
You can write another 1,500-word thesis. Or, you can build something—a tool, a feature, an experience—that solves the same problem but without needing people to read a bunch of text. Look at the content that’s dominating your space—the posts that get all the likes, shares, and comments. Then ask yourself: How can I make this educational BS obsolete?Here’s a thought: Tell your audience exactly how much time and money you’re burning on content—and then tell them you’re ditching it to build something free that actually helps them. "We were going to spend $20K this quarter on content, but instead, we’re using it to build a free AI-powered email draft generator for sales teams. Tell us what you need, and we’ll make it happen." \
People will talk about it. They’ll share it, they’ll use it, and they’ll remember the one who actually did something instead of just saying something.3. Content Isn’t The Only Thing That Gets Organic Attention\
The other principle of inbound marketing?  Yes, content generates organic awareness and conversation. So do a lot of other things. . This is a last resort because stunts could backfire (but for a startup, any PR is good PR), but at least you’re exercising your creative brain cells. If you have to force people to see your content, why not just skip the middle step and force them to see your product instead? \
Stop badgering GPT for content ideas, and use that time to hijack attention—starting fights on X, sitting on the doorsteps of potential clients for weeks on end with a cardboard sign, anything that gets people talking about your company now, not in six months when Google decides to bless you with traffic.\
(Tip: When pulling a stunt, ==just make sure it barely costs you anything to execute.== That way you won’t hate yourself if you don’t get returns.) Final Thoughts: Why Are You Marketing Like a Coward?\
You built something from nothing. You ignored the safe path, told the doubters to shove it, and bet on yourself. You made a move.\
So where’d that nerve go?The second it came time to market, you swapped instinct for “best practices.” \
  ==Innovation doesn’t come from following rules, and attention won’t be earned through compliance.== \
  It’s taken. It’s ripped out of the market’s hands by people willing to do what no one else is doing.Treat marketing like you treat your product—or get used to being ignored.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Police Union Still Insists NY Misconduct Records Are Secret Despite Court Decisions Saying Otherwise</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/police-union-still-insists-ny-misconduct-records-are-secret-despite-court-decisions-saying-otherwise/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you’re playing with house money, playing one losing hand after another isn’t a sign of tenacity. It’s just a way of signaling you can’t be trusted with the house’s money.That’s why appeal after appeal from government entities don’t tend to indicate that they’re in the right. It just means they don’t care how much money they spend because it’s not coming from their own pockets. The same principle applies to police unions. The money they use to litigate comes from the officers they’re supposed to be serving. At some point, you’d think they would experience some fleeting shame against lighting their contributors’ money on fire repeatedly, but the sad fact is that most cops represented by New York’s Police Benevolent Association (PBA) are more than happy to keep burning their own money if it means there’s even the most remote chance their past misdeeds won’t come back to haunt them.There have been plenty of legal challenges against the repeal of 50-a, the shorthand that refers to the law that — up until June 2020 — gave law enforcement agencies the option to withhold misconduct records requested by members of the public.The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York asked a seven-judge panel of the New York Court of appeals to apply retroactivity analysis on the question of whether or not state lawmakers intended a confidentiality provision enacted in 1976 to be conferred to police officers as a vested right after it was repealed in 2020.“We’re just stuck, at best, with a very ambiguous record,” Police Benevolent Association lawyer Matthew Daly told the appeals court on Thursday afternoon. “Policy arguments can be made on both sides — there are policy arguments for disclosure, but there’s also policy to protect rights.”Fighting off document requests from the New York Post, the union says the mandate to retroactively make those old records public would infringe vested rights of police officers and other covered employees “who for more than four decades relied on the statutory confidentiality in deciding how to respond to disciplinary matters.”PBA attorney Matthew Daly is, at best, being disingenuous here. The PBA is asking this court to basically codify something that isn’t present in the law: a limitation that prevents disclosure of records generated before the law’s repeal in 2020. As the court pointed out in late 2023, there’s nothing in the law that forbids access to records created prior to this repeal. By their nature, FOIL requests seek records that were generated prior to the request date. In amending the Public Officers Law to provide for the disclosure of records relating to law enforcement disciplinary proceedings, the Legislature did not limit disclosure under FOIL to records generated after June 12, 2020, and we will not impose such a limitation ourselves. Yet, the PBA persists, guided by little more than its access to other people’s money and a burning desire to progress the rot in its barrel of apples by pretending there’s no way the legislature intended to make this law retroactive. It’s a stupid point to make, as NY Post attorney, Jeremy Chase, told the court:“The Legislature, if they wanted to carve out this period from 1976 to June 2020, they easily could have done that, they didn’t do that,” he said.This leaves the PBA as the last bulwark against… um… serving the public trust. If the PBA (or the NYPD officers it represents) actually cared about rebuilding trust and setting it back on the path towards earning the nickname “New York’s Finest,” it wouldn’t be blowing cash in court trying to keep its dirty laundry buried under empty body cam boxes in the back of the metaphorical closet. Instead, it has chosen to spend nearly a half-decade fighting this small move towards greater transparency despite having lost at every judicial level to this point. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: Linux/UNIX Training Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/daily-deal-linux-unix-training-bundle/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:45:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linux and UNIX operating systems have become increasingly popular in commercial computing environments.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dynamic Triple Buffering Merged For GNOME 48</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNOME-48-Triple-Buffering</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:35:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As quite a Valentine's Day treat, the long-in-development dynamic triple buffering support for GNOME's Mutter compositor was just merged ahead of next month's GNOME 48 desktop release!..]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jay Xiao on the Power of Technology and Surety Through SuretyNow</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/jay-xiao-on-the-power-of-technology-and-surety-through-suretynow?source=rss</link><author>Jon Stojan Journalist</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:31:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
 has always believed in the power of technology to improve people's lives. As a millennial, Xiao witnessed life before the internet as we know it and how much easier things became after it became more accessible to everyday people. He is now the co-founder and president of SuretyNow, a company that works to help protect the public from dishonest businesses.A Heart and Talent for Tech\
After graduating high school, Xiao attended Queen's University in Canada for commerce and computer science. Though his original goal was to go into consulting and finance, he made a decision to switch fully into tech after an unfulfilling internship at an asset management firm his first summer. During this time, he was balancing the internship while working on a startup with friends, eventually leading him to leave the asset management internship behind to dedicate his time to that startup.\
However, Xiao did not know how to code, so he began taking computer science classes to expand his horizons. He interned at a Toronto startup called Nuology and then parlayed that internship into full-time roles at Google, where he worked on the Google Ads and Google Stadia teams.Making an Impact with the Biggest Names in TechBreaking into the tech field was difficult for Xiao, partly because he was new to the industry and didn't go to a school with a strong history of tech company recruitment. As a result, he worked to better himself in technology through education and went from zero tech experience to interning with Google within three years. At Google Stadia, he helped build Stadia's publisher analytics platform from zero to launch. He helped facilitate an analytics platform used by around 30 publishers at its peak, including Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.As the driving force behind SuretyNow, Xiao's role extends far beyond the title of co-founder and president. He single-handedly built the company's website, developed the internal tooling and infrastructure, and now manages multiple teams. His strategic vision and hands-on approach have been instrumental in the company's success, making it a prime example of his entrepreneurial prowess.\
At SuretyNow, Xiao says that their agents can produce two times the industry average due to the automation they've built to make them more efficient. SuretyNow serves businesses who wish to buy surety to work like other modern tools they love, all with fast and affordable customer service. With exceptional customer service and a commitment to innovation through technology, they aim to educate and deliver peace of mind with their expertise in surety.\
Xiao's future goals for SuretyNow are simple: to lead and inspire others by hiring and mentoring interns. Ultimately, Xiao wants to make buying surety bonds and insurance as easy as purchasing a keychain on Amazon—a fact that can be difficult for some and challenging for others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Macro-Less, Highly Integrated OpenAPI Document Generation in Rust with Ohkami</title><link>https://medium.com/@kanarus786/macro-less-highly-integrated-openapi-document-generation-in-rust-with-ohkami-912de388adc1</link><author>/u/kanarus</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:26:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Rust web dev, utoipa is the most popular crate for generating OpenAPI document from server code. While it’s a great tool, it can be frustrating due to excessive macro use.A new web framework Ohkami offers a ,  way to generate OpenAPI document with its “openapi” feature.Let’s take following code as an example. It’s the same sample from the “openapi” section of the README, but with openapi-related parts removed:While this compiles and works as a pseudo user management server, activating “openapi” feature causes a compile error, telling that User and CreateUser don’t implement ohkami::openapi::Schema.As indicated by this, Ohkami with “openapi” feature effectively handles type information and intelligently collects its endpoints’ metadata. It allows code like:to assemble metadata into an OpenAPI document and output it to a file .Then, how we implement Schema? Actually we can easily impl Schema by hand, or just #[derive(Schema)] is available! In this case, derive is enough:That’s it! Just adding these derives allows Ohkami::generate to output following file:Additionally, it’s easy to define the User schema as a component instead of duplicating inline schemas. In derive, just add #[openapi(component)] helper attribute:And  #[operation] attribute is available to set summary, description, and override operationId and each response’s description:Let’s take a look at how this document generation works!First, the #[derive(Schema)]s are expanded as following:The DSL enables to easily impl manually.Schema trait links the struct to an item of type called “SchemaRef”.2. openapi_* hooks of FromParam, FromRequest, IntoResponseFromParam, FromRequest and IntoResponse are Ohkami’s core traits appeared in the handler bound:When “openapi” feature is activated, they additionally have following methods:Ohkami leverages these methods in IntoHandler to generate consistent openapi::Operation, reflecting the actual handler signature like this.Moreover, Ohkami properly propagates schema information in common cases like this, allowing users to focus only on the types and schemas of their app.3. routes metadata of RouterIn Ohkami, what’s called router::base::Router has “routes” property that stores all the routes belonging to an Ohkami instance. This is returned alongside router::final::Router from “finalize” step, and is used to assemble metadata of all endpoints.What Ohkami::generate itself does is just to serialize an item of type openapi::document::Document and write it to a file.The openapi::document::Document item is created by “gen_openapi_doc” of router::final::Router, summarized as follows:That’s how Ohkami generates OpenAPI document!There is, however, a problem in , Cloudflare Workers: Ohkami is loaded to Miniflare or Cloudflare Workers as WASM, so it can only generate OpenAPI document andcannot write it to the user’s local file system.To work around this, Ohkami provides a CLI tool scripts/workers_openapi.js.

This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it.The note essentially seems like a way for the current administration to legally comply with a court order while still signaling that it entirely rejects any government funded or endorsed research or policy sympathetic to LGBTQ+ community and diversity, equity, and inclusion, which Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have been purging from government websites. Earlier this week,  that a federal judge ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control, and Food and Drug Administration to restore several webpages they removed as a result of Trump’s executive order attacking diversity, equity, and inclusion. The agencies were given until 11:59 p.m. on February 11 to restore the webpages. The court ordered the administration to restore the webpages “to their versions as of January 30, 2025, meaning they were supposed to revert the webpages to what they looked like on January 30 with no changes. The versions that have been restored now have this additional disclaimer.A joint status update filed Thursday by lawyers for the Department of Justice and the Public Citizen Litigation Group says that the government has provided the court with a list of websites that it has restored, though the list of websites is not available. It also specifically says that the government is refusing to restore the website reproductiverights.gov: “Defendants have objected to restoring the website ‘reproductiverights.gov.’ Plaintiff’s counsel is conferring with their client,” it says.“Plaintiff’s lists include websites from Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) components other than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. The parties disagree about whether such websites properly fall within the scope of the Order. However, given Plaintiff’s forthcoming amended complaint and to avoid further emergency motions practice, Defendants will restore those websites consistent with the Order,” it adds.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI: The Age of AI Is Here!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97kQRYwL3P0</link><author>Two Minute Papers</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/97kQRYwL3P0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:18:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg">Two Minute Papers</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[❤️ Check out Lambda here and sign up for their GPU Cloud: https://lambdalabs.com/papers

Not in the usual way of submitting comments through a form, mind you, but by directly injecting content into their database. This seems suboptimal.The story here is that DOGE — Elon Musk’s collection of supposed coding “geniuses” brought in to “disrupt” government inefficiency — finally launched their official website. And what they delivered is a masterclass in how not to build government infrastructure. One possibility is that they’re brilliant disruptors breaking all the rules to make things better. Another possibility is that they have no idea what they’re doing.The latter seems a lot more likely.Last week, it was reported that the proud racist 25-year-old Marko Elez had been given admin access and was pushing untested code to the US government’s $6 trillion/year payment system. While the Treasury Department initially claimed (including in court filings!) that Elez had “read-only” access, others reported he had write access. After those reports came out, the Treasury Dept. “corrected” itself and said Elez had been “accidentally” given write privileges for the payments database, but only for the data, not the code. Still, they admitted that while they had put in place some security protections, it’s possible that Elez did copy some private data which “may have occasionally included screenshots of payment systems data or records.”Now, you might think that having a racist twenty-something with admin access to trillion-dollar payment systems would concern people. But Musk’s defenders had a compelling counterargument: he must be a genius! Because… well, because Musk hired him, and Musk only hires geniuses. Or so we’re told.The DOGE team’s actual coding prowess is turning out to be quite something. First, they decided that government transparency meant hiding everything from FOIA requests. When questioned about this interesting interpretation of “transparency,” Musk explained that actually DOGE was being super transparent by putting everything on their website and ExTwitter account.There was just one small problem with this explanation. At the time he said it, the DOGE website looked like this:That was it. That was the whole website.On Thursday, they finally launched a real website. Sort of. If by “real website” you mean “a collection of already-public information presented in misleading ways by people who don’t seem to understand what they’re looking at.” But that’s not even the interesting part.These supposed technical geniuses managed to build what might be the least secure government website in history. Let’s start with something basic: where does the website actually live? According to Wired, the source code actually tells search engines that ExTwitter, not DOGE.gov, is the real home of this government information:A WIRED review of the page’s source code shows that the promotion of Musk’s own platform went deeper than replicating the posts on the homepage. The source code shows that the site’sA canonical tag is a snippet of code that tells search engines what the authoritative version of a website is. It is typically used by sites with multiple pages as a search engine optimization tactic, to avoid their search ranking being diluted.In DOGE’s case, however, the code is informing search engines that when people search for content found on, they should not show those pages in search results, but should instead display the posts on X.“It is promoting the X account as the main source, with the website secondary,” Declan Chidlow,, tells WIRED. “This isn’t usually how things are handled, and it indicates that the X account is taking priority over the actual website itself.”If you’re not a web developer, here’s what that means: When you build a website, you can tell search engines “hey, if you find copies of this content elsewhere, this version here is the real one.” It’s like telling Google “if someone copied my site, mine is the original.”But DOGE did the opposite. They told search engines “actually, ExTwitter has the real version of this government information. Our government website is just a copy.” Which is… an interesting choice for a federal agency? It’s a bit like the Treasury Department saying “don’t look at our official reports, just check Elon’s tweets.”You might think that a government agency directing people away from its official website and toward the private company of its leader would raise some conflict-of-interest concerns. And you’d be right!But wait, it gets better. Or worse. Actually, yeah, it’s worse.Who built this government website? Through some sloppy coding, security researcher Sam Curry figured out it was DOGE employee Kyle Shutt. The same Kyle Shutt who, according to Drop Site News, has admin access to the FEMA payments system. The same Kyle Shutt who used the exact same Cloudflare ID to build Musk’s America PAC Trump campaign website. Because why maintain separate secure credentials for government systems and political campaigns when you can just… not do that?But the real cherry on top came Thursday when people discovered something amazing about the DOGE site database:  Not “anyone with proper credentials.” Not “anyone who passes security checks.” Just… anyone. As 404 Media reported, if you know basic database operations, you too can be a government website administrator:The doge.gov website that was spun up to track Elon Musk’s cuts to the federal government is insecure and pulls from a database that can be edited by anyone, according to two separate people who found the vulnerability and shared it with 404 Media. One coder added at least two database entries that are visible on the live site and say “this is a joke of a .gov site” and “THESE ‘EXPERTS’ LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN -roro.” While I imagine those will be taken down shortly, for now, the insertions are absolutely visible:Look, there’s a reason we called this whole thing a cyberattack. When someone takes over your computer systems and leaves them wide open to anyone who wants to mess with them, we usually don’t call that “disruption” or “innovation.” We call it a cybersecurity breach.“Feels like it was completely slapped together,” they added. “Tons of errors and details leaked in the page source code.”Both sources said that the way the site is set up suggests that it is not running on government servers.has its codebase, probably through GitHub or something,” the other developer who noticed the insecurity said. “They’re deploying the website on Cloudflare Pages from their codebase, andis a custom domain that theirURL is set to. So rather than having a physical server or even something like Amazon Web Services, they’re deploying using Cloudflare Pages which supports custom domains.”Here’s the thing about government computer systems: They’re under constant attack from foreign adversaries. Yes, they can be inefficient. Yes, they can be bloated. But you know what else they usually are? Not completely exposed to the entire internet. It turns out that some of that inefficient “bureaucracy” involves basic things like “security” and “not letting random people write whatever they want in federal databases.”This isn’t some startup where “move fast and break things” is a viable strategy. This is the United States government. And it’s been handed over to people whose main qualification appears to be “posts spicy memes on 4chan.” The implications go far beyond embarrassing database injections — this level of technical negligence in federal systems creates genuine national security concerns. When your “disruption” involves ignoring decades of hard-learned lessons about government systems security, you’re not innovating — you’re inviting disaster.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friday Squid Blogging: Squid the Care Dog</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/friday-squid-blogging-squid-the-care-dog.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>Schneider on Security</category><category>infosec</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:05:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Vanderbilt University Medical Center has a pediatric care dog named “Squid.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Upcoming Speaking Engagements</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/upcoming-speaking-engagements-43.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>Schneider on Security</category><category>infosec</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:01:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a current list of where and when I am scheduled to speak:I’m speaking at Boskone 62 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, which runs from February 14-16, 2025.

Sponsoring projects isn’t just about altruism, it’s about investing in the future. Many maintainers work on open source projects in their spare time. Sponsorships can help them dedicate more time to the projects you depend on. With financial support, maintainers can help cover costs such as development and hosting.When you sponsor a maintainer, you’re helping them continue their work and letting them know you value the creativity and love they’ve poured into their project. For this Valentine’s Day, let’s show love to the maintainers who keep our favorite projects alive and thriving.The benefits of financial sponsorshipSponsorship is a tangible way to show support for the open source community. It can be a huge morale boost, as well as bring visibility and validation. Sponsored projects often gain more attention, leading to a virtuous cycle of more contributors and users, which results in better software for everyone.Getting started: How to best invest in open sourceIdentify critical dependencies:Review your project’s dependencies to identify which open source libraries and tools are crucial to your operations. If you use tools like npm, pip, or maven, you can review their dependencies and prioritize which are critical to your project’s success.  Evaluate the project activity: Check the recent and trending activity of repositories and look for signs of contributions, shipped features, bug fixes, active maintenance, and community engagement. Helpful metrics like recent commits, issue resolution, and community engagement are all good markers for where funding could help. Projects with a high impact but low funding could be great candidates to prioritize for sponsorship.   Take the opportunity to look at the issues and contribution guidelines. Try to understand their funding needs and how your support makes a difference. But also consider investing in ways beyond just financial support. You could provide bug fixes if you feel confident in your code. You could also take the time to tell someone about the project and why you think it’s awesome. Maintainers can show love for their sponsors as well. Sponsors appreciate knowing their contribution is making a difference. Whether it’s a simple mention on social media to acknowledge their contribution, featuring them on your GitHub Sponsors profile, exclusive updates and behind-the-scenes insights about your project and community, or even a brief personalized thank-you message, tokens of appreciation can help bring more funding your way.This Valentine’s Day, let’s show our favorite projects a bit more appreciation. Whether it’s a heartfelt contribution to fix bugs or docs, spreading the word about why it’s a great project and helping people use it, or a sweet one-time donation, every bit helps keep our beloved digital world turning.Ready to start sponsoring? Visit GitHub Sponsors and find the projects that matter most to you.Happy Valentine’s Day to all the open source contributors and supporters out there! And remember, you don’t need to wait for a special occasion like Valentine’s Day to show your appreciation for maintainers—every day is a perfect day to support open source! 💖]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Roadmap to Becoming a Data Scientist, Part 4: Advanced Machine Learning</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/roadmap-to-becoming-a-data-scientist-part-4-advanced-machine-learning/</link><author>Vyacheslav Efimov</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Data science is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating fields today. Following significant breakthroughs in machine learning about a decade ago, data science has surged in popularity within the tech community. Each year, we witness increasingly powerful tools that once seemed unimaginable. Innovations such as the , , the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, and state-of-the-art  — including  — have had a profound impact on our world.However, with the abundance of tools and the ongoing hype surrounding AI, it can be overwhelming — especially for beginners — to determine which skills to prioritize when aiming for a career in data science. Moreover, this field is highly demanding, requiring substantial dedication and perseverance.The first three parts of this series outlined the necessary skills to become a data scientist in three key areas: math, software engineering, and machine learning. While knowledge of classical Machine Learning and neural network algorithms is an excellent starting point for aspiring data specialists, there are still many important topics in machine learning that must be mastered to work on more advanced projects.This article will focus solely on the math skills necessary to start a career in Data Science. Whether pursuing this path is a worthwhile choice based on your background and other factors will be discussed in a separate article.The importance of learning evolution of methods in machine learningThe section below provides information about the evolution of methods in natural language processing (NLP).In contrast to previous articles in this series, I have decided to change the format in which I present the necessary skills for aspiring data scientists. Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for NLP and computer vision.For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern large language models (LLMs) without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in  the key concepts that should be studied.Natural language processing (NLP) is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.Before being converted into vectors, words undergo , which includes simple techniques such as , stemming, lemmatization, normalization, or removing . After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into . Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.The  method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance — a concept introduced in the  and  methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings. are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10–20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:  and . Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other large language models (LLMs).When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of  and , introduced in GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.Another important technique developed in recent years is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training. As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model’s weights.This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include ,, and .Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of  is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT’s rich knowledge to a specific domain.Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.As the name suggests,  involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called .In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet, and .Speaking of the object detection task, the  algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about , which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how generative adversial networks (GAN) function to generate images is a good way to broaden one’s horizons.In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.It would be very hard to present in detail the Roadmaps for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.First of all, recommender systems (RecSys) have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions. often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.Closely related to ranking, there is also a  problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair is mapped “well” according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited. is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity. is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier. is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to  find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.The word “approximately” means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms — sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression. involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:the target variable can have an overall , where in the long term its values increase or decrease (e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming).the target variable can have a  which makes its values change based on the currently given period (e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer).Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is , which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning. In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the “trial and error approach”). By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect. After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem. Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.Currently the most popular applications are:. Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans. The most well-known examples are chess and Go.. Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.. Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist. While most of the mentioned topics require time to master, they can add significant value to your portfolio. This is especially true for the NLP and CV domains, which are in high demand today.After reaching a high level of expertise in data science, it is still crucial to stay motivated and consistently push yourself to learn new topics and explore emerging algorithms.Data science is a constantly evolving field, and in the coming years, we might witness the development of new state-of-the-art approaches that we could not have imagined in the past.All images are by the author unless noted otherwise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Behind the Blog: Backdoors and the Miracle of Wikipedia</title><link>https://www.404media.co/behind-the-blog-backdoors-and-the-miracle-of-wikipedia/</link><author>Samantha Cole</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/nl2.14--1-.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:40:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">Dev - 404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is Behind the Blog, where we share our behind-the-scenes thoughts about how a few of our top stories of the week came together.

All the facets that describe the shape and meaning of interesting data are not always captured in a handful of pre-generated figures. While we have powerful technologies available for presenting interactive figures — where a viewer can rotate, filter, zoom, and generally explore complex data  —  they always come with tradeoffs.Here I present my experience using a recently released Python library — marimo — which opens up exciting new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations across the entire field of data science.Interactive Data VisualizationThe tradeoffs to consider when selecting an approach for presenting data visualizations can be broken into three categories: — what visualizations and interactivity am I able to present to the user? — what are the resources needed for displaying this visualization to users (e.g. running servers, hosting websites)? – how much of a new skillset / codebase do I need to learn upfront? is the foundation of portable interactivity. Every user has a web browser installed on their computer and there are many different frameworks available for displaying any degree of interactivity or visualization you might imagine (for example, this gallery of amazing things people have made with three.js). Since the application is running on the user’s computer, no costly servers are needed. However, a significant drawback for the data science community is ease of use, as JS does not have many of the high-level (i.e. easy-to-use) libraries that data scientists use for data manipulation, plotting, and interactivity. provides a useful point of comparison. Because of its continually growing popularity, some have called this the “Era of Python”. For data scientists in particular, Python stands alongside R as one of the foundational languages for quickly and effectively wielding complex data. While Python may be easier to use than Javascript, there are fewer options for presenting interactive visualizations. Some popular projects providing interactivity and visualization have been Flask, Dash, and Streamlit (also worth mentioning — bokeh, HoloViews, altair, and plotly). The biggest tradeoff for using Python has been the cost for publishing – delivering the tool to users. In the same way that shinyapps require a running computer to serve up the visualization, these Python-based frameworks have exclusively been server-based. This is by no means prohibitive for authors with a budget to spend, but it does limit the number of users who can take advantage of a particular project. is an intriguing middle ground — Python code running directly in the web browser using WebAssembly (WASM). There are resource limitations (only 1 thread and 2GB memory) that make this impractical for doing the heavy lifting of data science. , this can be more than sufficient for building visualizations and updating based on user input. Because it runs in the browser, no servers are required for hosting. Tools that use Pyodide as a foundation are interesting to explore because they give data scientists an opportunity to write Python code which runs directly on users’ computers without their having to install or run anything outside of the web browser.As an aside, I’ve been interested previously in one project that has tried this approach: stlite, an in-browser implementation of Streamlit that lets you deploy these flexible and powerful apps to a broad range of users. However, a core limitation is that Streamlit itself is distinct from stlite (the port of Streamlit to WASM), which means that not all features are supported and that advancement of the project is dependent on two separate groups working along compatible lines.The interface resembles a Jupyter , which will be familiar to users.Execution of cells is , so that updating one cell will rerun all cells which depend on its output. can be captured with a flexible set of UI components.Notebooks can be quickly converted into , hiding the code and showing only the input/output elements.Apps can be run locally or converted into using WASM/Pyodide.marimo balances the tradeoffs of technology in a way that is well suited to the skill set of the typical data scientists: — user input and visual display features are rather extensive, supporting user input via Altair and Plotly plots. — deploying as static webpages is basically free — no servers required — for users familiar with Python notebooks, marimo will feel very familiar and be easy to pick up.Publishing Marimo Apps on the WebAs a simple example of the type of display that can be useful in data science, consisting of explanatory text interspersed with interactive displays, I have created a barebones GitHub repository. Try it out yourself here.Using just a little bit of code, users can:Generate visualizations with flexible interactivityWrite narrative text describing their findingsPublish to the web for free (i.e. using GitHub Pages)Public App / Private DataThis new technology offers an exciting new opportunity for collaboration — publish the app publicly to the world, but users can only see specific datasets that they have permission to access.Rather than building a dedicated data backend for every app, user data can be stored in a generic backend which can be securely authenticated and accessed using a Python client library — all contained within the user’s web browser. For example, the user is given an OAuth login link that will authenticate them with the backend and allow the app to temporarily access input data.As a proof of concept, I built a simple visualization app which connects to the Cirro data platform, which is used at my institution to manage scientific data. Full disclosure: I was part of the team that built this platform before it spun out as an independent company. In this manner users can:Load the public visualization app — hosted on GitHub PagesConnect securely to their private data storeLoad the appropriate dataset for displayShare a link which will direct authorized collaborators to the same dataAs a data scientist, this approach of publishing free and open-source visualization apps which can be used to interact with private datasets is extremely exciting. Building and publishing a new app can take hours and days instead of weeks and years, letting researchers quickly share their insights with collaborators and then publish them to the wider world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.15 To Ensure PlayStation 5 Controllers Use The Correct Driver</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-Ensures-PS5-Driver</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:49:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A change queued up by an Amazon engineer ahead of the upcoming Linux 6.15 kernel cycle will ensure that PlayStation 5 controllers on Linux load with the correctly desired driver...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DataRobot Acquires Agnostic to Gain Distributed Covalent Platform for AI Apps</title><link>https://devops.com/datarobot-acquires-agnostic-to-gain-distributed-covalent-platform-for-ai-apps/</link><author>Mike Vizard</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:22:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://devops.com/">DevOps.com</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hugo van Kemenade: Improving licence metadata</title><link>https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/improving-licence-metadata/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:11:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[PEP 639 defines a spec on how to document licences

Some of Disney’s price hikes were as much as 25 percent, hitting ad-based and ad-free versions alike. Customers were quick to complain.So not surprisingly, Disney+ has now seen the first quarterly subscriber loss in the streaming platform’s history, with 700,000 customers cancelling service. ESPN+, ESPN’s streaming service, also saw a 700,000 subscriber loss:“Total paid Disney+ subscriptions currently rest at 124.6 million compared with 125.3 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. ESPN+ also saw a loss of 700,000 subscribers, currently at 24.9 million, compared with 25.6 million at the end of last quarter.”Publicly-traded companies can’t just provide a quality, affordable service people like. That’s simply not allowed. They have to provide Wall Street ever-escalating quarterly returns in the pursuit of scale, even if that pursuit proves disastrous. If it’s not possible to achieve those returns through innovation and subscriber growth (which is no longer possible now that the streaming market is saturated), that’s when big companies get in trouble and start creatively nickel-and-diming their user base.Traditional cable TV, of course, went through this exact life cycle. And despite the fact many of those executives have shifted over to streaming, they’ve learned nothing from history or experience because they’re not financially incentivized to learn from experience. They’re incentivized to make stock values climb at any cost, then flee when things get rough; fat executive or investor compensation in hand.Which is to say don’t expect things to change, even if the economy tightens and customers increasingly balk at higher streaming video prices.Two, I suspect companies will work tirelessly to make cancelling streaming services (a major advantage over traditional bloated cable TV) more difficult, whether that means complicated wireless/broadband bundling that makes dumping services a confusing hassle (is your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill?), or some creative new restrictions we haven’t seen previously.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Handwriting an SVG Heart, With Our Hearts</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/handwriting-an-svg-heart-with-our-hearts/</link><author>Ryan Trimble</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 13:25:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[According to local grocery stores, it’s the Valentine’s Day season again, and what better way to express our love than with the symbol of love: . A while back on CSS-Tricks, we shared several ways to draw hearts, and the response was dreamy. Check out all these amazing, heart-filled submissions in this collection on CodePen:Temani Afif’s CSS Shapes site offers a super modern heart using only CSS:Now, to show  love, I wanted to do something personal, something crafty, something with a mild amount of effort.Handwriting a love note is a classic romantic gesture, but have you considered handwriting an SVG? We won’t need some fancy vector drawing tool to express our love. Instead, we can open a blank HTML document and add an  tag:We’ll need a way to see what we are doing inside the “SVG realm” (as I like to call it), which is what the  attribute provides. The 2D plane upon which vector graphics render is as infinite as our love, quite literally, complete with an x- and y-axis and all (like from math class).We’ll set the start coordinates as  and end coordinates as  to make a handsome, square . Oh, and by the way, we don’t concern ourselves over pixels,  values, or any other unit types; this is , and we play by our own rules.We add in these coordinates to the  as a string of values:<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">

</svg>Now we can begin drawing our heart,  our heart. Let’s make a line. To do that, we’ll need to know a lot more about coordinates, and where to stick ’em. We’re able to draw a line with many points using the  element, which defines paths using the  attribute. SVG path commands are difficult to memorize, but the effort means you care. The path commands are:, , , , , , We’re only interested in drawing line segments for now, so together we’ll explore the first two:  and . MDN romantically describes MoveTo as picking up a drawing instrument, such as a pen or pencil: we aren’t yet drawing anything, just moving our pen to the point where we want to begin our confession of love.We’ll  the coordinates of  represented in the  attribute as :<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path d="M2,2" />
</svg>Not surprising then to find that  is akin to putting pen to paper and  from one point to another. Let’s draw the first segment of our heart by drawing a  with coordinates , represented as  next in the  attribute:<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path d="M2,2 L4,4" />
</svg>We’ll add a final line segment as another LineTo  with coordinates , again appended to the  attribute as :<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path d="M2,2 L4,4 L6,2" />
</svg>If you stop to preview what we’ve accomplished so far, you may be confused as it renders an upside-down triangle; that’s not quite a heart yet, Let’s fix that.SVG shapes apply a  by default, which we can remove with :<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path d="M2,2 L4,4 L6,2" fill="none" />
</svg>Rather than filling in the shape, instead, let’s display our line path by adding a , adding color to our heart.<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path 
    d="M2,2 L4,4 L6,2" 
    fill="none" 
    stroke="rebeccapurple" />
</svg>Next, add some weight to the stroke by increasing the :<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path 
    d="M2,2 L4,4 L6,2" 
    fill="none" 
    stroke="rebeccapurple" 
    stroke-width="4" />
</svg>Finally, apply a  of  (sorry, no time for  jokes) to round off the start and end points of our line path, giving us that classic symbol of love:<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path 
    d="M2,2 L4,4 L6,2" 
    fill="none"
    stroke="rebeccapurple"

Critical functions have been halted, tens of thousands of federal staffers are being encouraged to resign, and congressional mandates are being disregarded. The next phase: The Department of Government Efficiency reportedly wants to use AI to cut costs. According to , Musk’s group has started to run sensitive data from government systems through AI programs to analyze spending and determine what could be pruned. This may lead to the elimination of human jobs in favor of automation. As one government official who has been tracking Musk’s DOGE team told the, the ultimate aim is to use AI to replace “the human workforce with machines.” (Spokespeople for the White House and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment.)Using AI to make government more efficient is a worthy pursuit, and this is not a new idea. The Biden administration disclosed more than 2,000 AI applications in development across the federal government. For example, FEMA has started using AI to help perform damage assessment in disaster areas. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started using AI to look for fraudulent billing. The idea of replacing dedicated and principled civil servants with AI agents, however, new—and complicated.The civil service—the massive cadre of employees who operate government agencies—plays a vital role in translating laws and policy into the operation of society. New presidents can issue sweeping executive orders, but they often have no real effect until they actually change the behavior of public servants. Whether you think of these people as essential and inspiring do-gooders, boring bureaucratic functionaries, or as agents of a “deep state,” their sheer number and continuity act as ballast that resists institutional change.This is why Trump and Musk’s actions are so significant. The more AI decision making is integrated into government, the easier change will be. If human workers are widely replaced with AI, executives will have unilateral authority to instantaneously alter the behavior of the government, profoundly raising the stakes for transitions of power in democracy. Trump’s unprecedented purge of the civil service might be the last time a president needs to replace the human beings in government in order to dictate its new functions. Future leaders may do so at the press of a button.To be clear, the use of AI by the executive branch doesn’t have to be disastrous. In theory, it could allow new leadership to swiftly implement the wishes of its electorate. But this could go very badly in the hands of an authoritarian leader. AI systems concentrate power at the top, so they could allow an executive to effectuate change over sprawling bureaucracies instantaneously. Firing and replacing tens of thousands of human bureaucrats is a huge undertaking. Swapping one AI out for another, or modifying the rules that those AIs operate by, would be much simpler.Social-welfare programs, if automated with AI, could be redirected to systematically benefit one group and disadvantage another with a single prompt change. Immigration-enforcement agencies could prioritize people for investigation and detainment with one instruction. Regulatory-enforcement agencies that monitor corporate behavior for malfeasance could turn their attention to, or away from, any given company on a whim.Even if Congress were motivated to fight back against Trump and Musk, or against a future president seeking to bulldoze the will of the legislature, the absolute power to command AI agents would make it easier to subvert legislative intent. AI has the power to diminish representative politics. Written law is never fully determinative of the actions of government—there is always wiggle room for presidents, appointed leaders, and civil servants to exercise their own judgment. Whether intentional or not, whether charitably or not, each of these actors uses discretion. In human systems, that discretion is widely distributed across many individuals—people who, in the case of career civil servants, usually outlast presidencies.Today, the AI ecosystem is dominated by a small number of corporations that decide how the most widely used AI models are designed, which data they are trained on, and which instructions they follow. Because their work is largely secretive and unaccountable to public interest, these tech companies are capable of making changes to the bias of AI systems—either generally or with aim at specific governmental use cases—that are invisible to the rest of us. And these private actors are both vulnerable to coercion by political leaders and self-interested in appealing to their favor. Musk himself created and funded xAI, now one of the world’s largest AI labs, with an explicitly ideological mandate to generate anti-“woke” AI and steer the wider AI industry in a similar direction.But there’s a second way that AI’s transformation of government could go. AI development could happen inside of transparent and accountable public institutions, alongside its continued development by Big Tech. Applications of AI in democratic governments could be focused on benefitting public servants and the communities they serve by, for example, making it easier for non-English speakers to access government services, making ministerial tasks such as processing routine applications more efficient and reducing backlogs, or helping constituents weigh in on the policies deliberated by their representatives. Such AI integrations should be done gradually and carefully, with public oversight for their design and implementation and monitoring and guardrails to avoid unacceptable bias and harm.Governments around the world are demonstrating how this could be done, though it’s early days. Taiwan has pioneered the use of AI models to facilitate deliberative democracy at an unprecedented scale. Singapore has been a leader in the development of public AI models, built transparently and with public-service use cases in mind. Canada has illustrated the role of disclosure and public input on the consideration of AI use cases in government. Even if you do not trust the current White House to follow any of these examples, U.S. states—which have much greater contact and influence over the daily lives of Americans than the federal government—could lead the way on this kind of responsible development and deployment of AI.As the political theorist David Runciman has written, AI is just another in a long line of artificial “machines” used to govern how people live and act, not unlike corporations and states before it. AI doesn’t replace those older institutions, but it changes how they function. As the Trump administration forges stronger ties to Big Tech and AI developers, we need to recognize the potential of that partnership to steer the future of democratic governance—and act to make sure that it does not enable future authoritarians.This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in The Atlantic.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Neurodiversity Can Help Your Life, Team &amp; Business • Katrine Hald Kjeldsen • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIBlbmk1U_c</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CIBlbmk1U_c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 13:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

ABSTRACT
Are you a little spicy? If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.

In this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.

Neurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it’s both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.

This talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it’s adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths.

The script has a low score on VT (4/59) (SHA256:d716c2edbcdb76c6a6d31b21f154fee7e0f8613617078b69da69c8f4867c9534)[1]. This sample attracted my attention because it uses the tkinter[2] library. This library is used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides tools to create windows, dialogs, buttons, labels, text fields, and other interactive elements, allowing developers to build desktop applications with visual interfaces in Python. Most Python scripts are intended to be executed from a command line. That's why I consider this library as a good sign of suspicious behavior (It does not mean that all Python scripts using this library are malicious!)While reviewing the script, a variable contains an interesting piece of text:info = "\nA problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage\nto your computer ... (removed) ..."The interesting piece of code is here:root = tk.Tk()
root.configure(background="dark blue")
ex = Example(root)
w, h = root.winfo_screenwidth(), root.winfo_screenheight()
root.overrideredirect(1)
root.geometry("%dx%d+0+0" % (w, h))
root.wm_attributes("-topmost", 1)
root.mainloop()
The attribute "-topmost" set to "1" or "TRUE" will make the window remain open on top of all windows. The window will also be created to fill the screen without any control elements to close or resize it. When the script is executed, you will get this screen:To be honest, that's not the best BSOD ("Blue Screen of Death") that I saw... but it's a nice trick to annoy the victim or slow down (a bit) the analysis of the file.Xavier Mertens (@xme)

If it’s DUI enforcement, you can talk to drivers and see if they seem intoxicated. If it’s near a border, you can stop every vehicle to search for undocumented immigrants or contraband.What you can’t do, however, is just set up a checkpoint to stop all cars just to eyeball the interiors and question occupants in hopes of discovering contraband or evidence of illegal activity. That’s pretty much the same thing as entering every house on the block to search for criminal evidence. Just because cars aren’t houses and are traveling on public roads doesn’t give the government the right to engage in some “general rummaging.” In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the Court held that because the checkpoint program’s primary purpose was indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control, the checkpoints violated the Fourth Amendment. “We cannot sanction stops justified only by the generalized and ever-present possibility that interrogation and inspection may reveal that any given motorist has committed some crime,” wrote Justice O’Connor.The city argued it had a justifiable reason for these checkpoints — during which occupants were questioned and drug dogs performed open-air sniffs: drug interdiction. Not good enough, said the Supreme Court. And yet, law enforcement agencies seem convinced they can still do this sort of thing. They can’t. Not legally. But they  get away with it, especially if they hand the job to the officer with the least amount of experience. Once again, ignorance of the law is the best excuse… at least if you’re a cop. That’s the upshot of this Mississippi Supreme Court decision [PDF], brought to our attention by FourthAmendment.com. In this case, two Puckett, MS police officers set up a “safety checkpoint” at a four-way intersection connecting two local highways. Lavern Kendrick was stopped and questioned by Officer Adam McGuffee. McGuffee claimed Kendrick was nervous, that he smelled “burnt plastic” which he took to be indicative of meth use, and happened to see a meth pipe inside Kendrick’s car. One thing led to another, which led to Kendrick’s arrest, and this suppression motion. The trial court saw no problem with any of this, even though Officer McGuffee testified that this checkpoint was mostly exploratory, allowing the officer to check licenses, registration, insurance, and “then whatever is seen in the vehicles.” That alone should have put it out of constitutional bounds, especially 23 years after the Supreme Court’s ruling in .But the lower court decided the cop was just too ignorant to understand what he was doing or saying, and credited the officer’s inexperience, rather than decide it was a clear and obvious violation of the Fourth Amendment.Following the hearing, the trial court acknowledged that Officer McGuffee’s testimony “was a little bit all over the board about the purpose for the stop.” The trial court stated that it was not surprised by this because Officer McGuffee“…was the most inexperienced law enforcement officer for the Town of Puckett. That’s not his fault. That’s just the nature of what it is. He started in January of 2023. He’s a part-time worker. He does other work primarily. This is a part-time job for him.“In other words, the less a cop knows, the more they can get away with. Kendrick argued more logically that McGuffee’s testimony during the trial made it clear the real purpose of the checkpoint was “general crime control,” rather than just ensuring drivers were properly licensed and insured. Unfortunately, the state’s top court agrees with the lower court: inexperience is a halo. We find that the record supports the trial court’s conclusion. With permission from the chief of police, Officer McGuffee and Officer Lathum set up a safety checkpoint, the primary purpose of which was to check that each driver passing through it was properly licensed and insured. Evidence was presented that this was a routine safety checkpoint and that every vehicle passing through was briefly stopped.The primary purpose of checking driver’s licenses and insurance cards substantially outweighed the minimal intrusion of Kendrick’s individual liberty. And the safety checkpoint did not violate the search-and-seizure provision of either the Fourth Amendment or the state constitution.And there it is: if a cop doesn’t have the experience to do this job properly, he can just blunder around and allow the court to undo the constitutional damage he has done… at least in Mississippi. My guess is these “safety checkpoints” are really the kind outlawed by the Supreme Court’s  decision but McGuffee just hadn’t been on the job long enough to know to how to better hide this fact from trial courts while testifying. He did his job just poorly enough to salvage an illicit possession/DUI bust. And the state’s law enforcement get their free pass on shady checkpoints extended.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a Data Engineering Center of Excellence</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-data-engineering-center-of-excellence/</link><author>Richie Bachala</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 02:35:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As data continues to grow in importance and become more complex, the need for skilled data engineers has never been greater. But what is data engineering, and why is it so important? In this blog post, we will discuss the essential components of a functioning data engineering practice and why data engineering is becoming increasingly critical for businesses today, and how you can build your very own Data Engineering Center of Excellence!I’ve had the privilege to build, manage, lead, and foster a sizeable high-performing team of data warehouse & ELT engineers for many years. With the help of my team, I have spent a considerable amount of time every year consciously planning and preparing to manage the growth of our data month-over-month and address the changing reporting and analytics needs for our 20000+ global data consumers. We built many data warehouses to store and centralize massive amounts of data generated from many OLTP sources. We’ve implemented Kimball methodology by creating star schemas both within our on-premise data warehouses and in the ones in the cloud.The objective is to enable our user-base to perform fast analytics and reporting on the data; so our analysts’ community and business users can make accurate data-driven decisions.It took me about three years to transform  () of data warehouse and ETL programmers into one cohesive Data Engineering team.I have compiled some of my learnings building a global data engineering team in this post in hopes that Data professionals and leaders of all levels of technical proficiency can benefit.Evolution of the Data EngineerIt has never been a better time to be a data engineer. Over the last decade, we have seen a massive awakening of enterprises now recognizing their data as the company’s heartbeat, making data engineering the job function that ensures accurate, current, and quality data flow to the solutions that depend on it.Historically, the role of Data Engineers has evolved from that of data warehouse developers and the  (extract, transform and load).The data warehouse developers are responsible for designing, building, developing, administering, and maintaining data warehouses to meet an enterprise’s reporting needs. This is done primarily via extracting data from operational and transactional systems and piping it using extract transform load methodology (ETL/ ELT) to a storage layer like a data warehouse or a data lake. The data warehouse or the data lake is where data analysts, data scientists, and business users consume data. The developers also perform transformations to conform the ingested data to a data model with aggregated data for easy analysis.A data engineer’s prime responsibility is to produce and make data securely available for multiple consumers.Data engineers oversee the ingestion, transformation, modeling, delivery, and movement of data through every part of an organization. Data extraction happens from many different data sources & applications. Data Engineers load the data into data warehouses and data lakes, which are transformed not just for the Data Science & predictive analytics initiatives (as everyone likes to talk about) but primarily for data analysts. Data analysts & data scientists perform operational reporting, exploratory analytics, service-level agreement (SLA) based business intelligence reports and dashboards on the catered data. In this book, we will address all of these job functions.The role of a data engineer is to acquire, store, and aggregate data from both cloud and on-premise, new, and existing systems, with data modeling and feasible data architecture. Without the data engineers, analysts and data scientists won’t have valuable data to work with, and hence, data engineers are the first to be hired at the inception of every new data team. Based on the data and analytics tools available within an enterprise, data engineering teams’ role profiles, constructs, and approaches have several options for what should be included in their responsibilities which we will discuss in this chapter.Software is increasingly automating the historically manual and tedious tasks of data engineers. Data processing tools and technologies have evolved massively over several years and will continue to grow. For example, cloud-based data warehouses (Snowflake, for instance) have made data storage and processing affordable and fast. Data pipeline services (like Informatica IICS, Apache Airflow, Matillion, Fivetran) have turned data extraction into work that can be completed quickly and efficiently. The data engineering team should be leveraging such technologies as force multipliers, taking a consistent and cohesive approach to integration and management of enterprise data, not just relying on legacy siloed approaches to building custom data pipelines with fragile, non-performant, hard to maintain code. Continuing with the latter approach will stifle the pace of innovation within the said enterprise and force the future focus to be around managing data infrastructure issues rather than how to help generate value for your business.The primary role of an enterprise Data Engineering team should be to  into a shape that’s ready for analysis — laying the foundation for real-world analytics and data science application.The Data Engineering team should serve as the  for enterprise-level data with the responsibility to curate the organization’s data and act as a resource for those who want to make use of it, such as Reporting & Analytics teams, Data Science teams, and other groups that are doing more self-service or business group driven analytics leveraging the enterprise data platform. This team should serve as the  of organizational knowledge, managing and refining the catalog so that analysis can be done more effectively. Let’s look at the essential responsibilities of a well-functioning Data Engineering team.Responsibilities of a Data Engineering TeamThe Data Engineering team should provide a  within the enterprise that cuts across to support both the Reporting/Analytics and Data Science capabilities to provide access to clean, transformed, formatted, scalable, and secure data ready for analysis. The Data Engineering teams’ core responsibilities should include:· Build, manage, and optimize the core data platform infrastructure· Build and maintain custom and off-the-shelf data integrations and ingestion pipelines from a variety of structured and unstructured sources· Manage overall data pipeline orchestration· Manage transformation of data either before or after load of raw data through both technical processes and business logic· Support analytics teams with design and performance optimizations of data warehousesData is an Enterprise Asset.Data as an Asset should be shared and protected.Data should be valued as an Enterprise asset, leveraged across all Business Units to enhance the company’s value to its respective customer base by accelerating decision making, and improving competitive advantage with the help of data. Good data stewardship, legal and regulatory requirements dictate that we protect the data owned from unauthorized access and disclosure.In other words, managing Security is a crucial responsibility.Why Create a Centralized Data Engineering Team?Treating Data Engineering as a standard and core capability that underpins both the Analytics and Data Science capabilities will help an enterprise evolve how to approach Data and Analytics. The enterprise needs to stop vertically treating data based on the technology stack involved as we tend to see often and move to more of a horizontal approach of managing a  or  that cuts across the organization and can connect to various technologies as needed drive analytic initiatives. This is a new way of thinking and working, but it can drive efficiency as the various data organizations look to scale. Additionally — there is value in creating a dedicated structure and career path for Data Engineering resources. Data engineering skill sets are in high demand in the market; therefore, hiring outside the company can be costly. Companies must enable programmers, database administrators, and software developers with a career path to gain the needed experience with the above-defined skillsets by working across technologies. Usually, forming a data engineering center of excellence or a capability center would be the first step for making such progression possible.Challenges for creating a centralized Data Engineering TeamThe centralization of the Data Engineering team as a service approach is different from how Reporting & Analytics and Data Science teams operate. It does, in principle, mean giving up some level of control of resources and establishing new processes for how these teams will collaborate and work together to deliver initiatives.The Data Engineering team will need to demonstrate that it can effectively support the needs of both Reporting & Analytics and Data Science teams, no matter how large these teams are. Data Engineering teams must effectively prioritize workloads while ensuring they can bring the right skillsets and experience to assigned projects.Data engineering is essential because it serves as the backbone of data-driven companies. It enables analysts to work with clean and well-organized data, necessary for deriving insights and making sound decisions. To build a functioning data engineering practice, you need the following critical components:The Data Engineering team should be a core capability within the enterprise, but it should effectively serve as a support function involved in almost everything data-related. It should interact with the Reporting and Analytics and Data Science teams in a collaborative support role to make the entire team successful.The Data Engineering team doesn’t create direct business value — but the value should come in making the Reporting and Analytics, and Data Science teams more productive and efficient to ensure delivery of maximum value to business stakeholders through Data & Analytics initiatives. To make that possible, the six key responsibilities within the data engineering capability center would be as follow –Let’s review the 6 pillars of responsibilities:1. Determine Central Data Location for Collation and WranglingUnderstanding and having a strategy for a (a centralized data repository or data warehouse for the mass consumption of data for analysis). Defining requisite data tables and where they will be joined in the context of data engineering and subsequently converting raw data into digestible and valuable formats.2. Data Ingestion and TransformationMoving data from one or more sources to a new destination (your data lake or cloud data warehouse) where it can be stored and further analyzed and then converting data from the format of the source system to that of the destinationExtracting, transforming, and loading data from one or more sources into a destination system to represent the data in a new context or style.Data modeling is an essential function of a data engineering team, granted not all data engineers excel with this capability. Formalizing relationships between data objects and business rules into a conceptual representation through understanding information system workflows, modeling required queries, designing tables, determining primary keys, and effectively utilizing data to create informed output.I’ve seen engineers in interviews mess up more with this than coding in technical discussions. It’s essential to understand the differences between Dimensions, Facts, Aggregate tables.Ensuring that sensitive data is protected and implementing proper authentication and authorization to reduce the risk of a data breach6. Architecture and AdministrationDefining the models, policies, and standards that administer what data is collected, where and how it is stored, and how it such data is integrated into various analytical systems.The six pillars of responsibilities for data engineering capabilities center on the ability to determine a central data location for collation and wrangling, ingest and transform data, execute ETL/ELT operations, model data, secure access and administer an architecture. While all companies have their own specific needs with regards to these functions, it is important to ensure that your team has the necessary skillset in order to build a foundation for big data success.Besides the Data Engineering following are the other capability centers that need to be considered within an enterprise:Analytics Capability CenterThe analytics capability center enables consistent, effective, and efficient BI, analytics, and advanced analytics capabilities across the company. Assist business functions in triaging, prioritizing, and achieving their objectives and goals through reporting, analytics, and dashboard solutions, while providing operational reports and visualizations, self-service analytics, and required tools to automate the generation of such insights.Data Science Capability CenterThe data science capability center is for exploring cutting-edge technologies and concepts to unlock new insights and opportunities, better inform employees and create a culture of prescriptive information usage using Automated AI and Automated ML solutions such as H2O.ai, Dataiku, Aible, DataRobot, C3.aiThe data governance office empowers users with trusted, understood, and timely data to drive effectiveness while keeping the integrity and sanctity of data in the right hands for mass consumption.As your company grows, you will want to make sure that the data engineering capabilities are in place to support the six pillars of responsibilities. By doing this, you will be able to ensure that all aspects of data management and analysis are covered and that your data is safe and accessible by those who need it. Have you started thinking about how your company will grow? What steps have you taken to put a centralized data engineering team in place?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Friday, February 14th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9324, (Fri, Feb 14th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31684</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 02:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree
cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional
complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go
over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.
This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,
building four new subsystems.One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,
which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the 
object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the
cloud-controller-manager. The initial  is missing the cloud-provider specific information,
like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the
Node, Region and Instance type information.sequenceDiagram

This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet
was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved
to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem
during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the
controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,
standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using
 (more on this below)Examples of the dependency problemAs noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be
unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few
concrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might
occur.These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource
(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods
rely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it
will schedule properly.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taintAs noted in the Kubernetes documentation, when the kubelet is started with the command line
flag --cloud-provider=external, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint
named node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized added. Because the cloud-controller-manager
is responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a
cloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a 
or , may not be able to schedule.If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the
control plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized no schedule taint. It also means that this taint
will not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no
schedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface
controllers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taintThe next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is
waiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not
tolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI."The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly."One of the conditions that can lead to a  resource having this taint is when the container
network has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible
for adding the IP addresses to a  resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container
network controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some
circumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the
cloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is
not able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container
network controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized and node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taints,
leaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the
specific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the
lifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager
will need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.
Setting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host
networking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as
the host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This
will ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check
your networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the
lifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy
as well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using
these primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple
replicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide
with each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other
controllers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager
controller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.
Use a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the
control plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital
to adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the
physical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run
with a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation
from non-privileged user workloads.
It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running
on the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade
the cloud controller performance.Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud
controller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run
in situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate
the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint, and it should also tolerate any
taints associated with the control plane (for example, node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
or node-role.kubernetes.io/master). It can also be useful to tolerate the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the
node is not yet available for health monitoring.For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,
in a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the
dependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice
for running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network
constraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology
for these scenarios.This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is
important to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please
consult your cloud provider’s documentation.apiVersion: apps/v1

When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that
cluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple
replicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and
redundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance
of a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It&apos;s time to go ESM-only</title><link>https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/723</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://javascriptweekly.com/">Javascript Weekly</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🤯 Pfft, vehicle data is a joke without CarsXE.

Google renames the Gulf of Mexico to flatter a wannabe autocrat’s ego. Business leaders draft contingency plans for the end of constitutional government. And the Democratic Party, funded by these same genuflecting corporations, responds with all the urgency of someone scheduling a dental cleaning.This isn’t just a failure of nerve—it’s a revelation of structural rot. We are witnessing a disturbing confluence: the same corporations prostrating themselves before Trump’s authoritarianism are simultaneously bankrolling the Democratic Party meant to resist it. It’s as if we’ve discovered that the fire department is taking donations from the arsonists while counseling residents not to use the emergency exits.While democracy burns, the Democratic leadership is worried about too many phone calls from concerned citizens. In a closed-door meeting this week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed frustration not with corporate America’s growing acquiescence to authoritarianism, but with grassroots organizations urging a more confrontational defense of democracy.“What leverage do we have?” Jeffries laments, apparently forgetting that the power to resist tyranny doesn’t come from parliamentary procedure but from the moral clarity and collective will of the people.When Jeffries asks this question, he’s revealing more than he intends about the Democratic Party’s compromised position. Their primary source of funding comes from corporations that are already signaling their willingness to accommodate authoritarian rule. Each act of corporate genuflection to Trump—whether it’s Google’s cartographic flattery or business leaders’ quiet contingency planning—further weakens the party’s ability to mount effective resistance.This creates a perverse incentive structure where the supposed defenders of democracy are financially dependent on institutions actively enabling its decline. Is it any wonder that Democratic leadership seems more irritated by grassroots pressure than by corporate America’s growing comfort with authoritarianism? They’re caught in a protection racket where the supposed guardians are funded by those hedging their bets on democracy’s collapse.The result is a kind of political paralysis dressed up as procedural wisdom. While activists and citizens recognize the urgent need for confrontational defense of democratic institutions, party leadership counsels restraint and bipartisan common ground. They’re treating an existential threat to democracy like a normal policy disagreement—as if the proper response to an emerging autocracy is to schedule more committee hearings.Now I am a capitalist, but there must be a healthy separation between the forces of wealth and power. The Founders understood this. We re-learned this lesson in the Gilded Age and we must re-learn it now.The danger isn’t markets themselves—it’s the fusion of corporate and political power into a single, self-reinforcing system. When corporations can simultaneously fund both political parties while hedging their bets on authoritarianism, we’ve lost the crucial separation that makes both democracy and healthy capitalism possible. We’re watching the creation of a system where political power becomes just another tradable commodity, where democracy itself becomes subject to market forces rather than civic virtue.This is exactly what the Founders feared when they warned about the corrupting influence of concentrated power. It’s what Progressive Era reformers fought against when they broke up the trusts and established regulatory frameworks to check corporate overreach. They understood that democracy requires maintaining boundaries between economic and political power—that when these boundaries collapse, both systems become corrupted.What we’re seeing now—with corporations funding Democrats while accommodating Trump’s authoritarianism—is the end stage of this collapse. It’s a form of political arbitrage where democracy itself becomes just another risk to be hedged against.Unfortunately, this institutional paralysis isn’t happening in normal times—it’s occurring while a literal coup is in motion. Elon Musk, his mind deranged by the hall of funhouse mirrors he calls X (formerly Twitter), leads a charge against democratic institutions with his merry band of neoreactionaries flanking him as they storm the administrative state.This isn’t just metaphorical—we’re watching in real-time as they attempt to dismantle the basic infrastructure of governance. While Democratic leadership wrings its hands about “leverage” and corporate America calculates its positions, Musk and his allies are actively working to replace democratic processes with private control. The distorted reality he sees reflected in his social media echo chamber has become a blueprint for dismantling democratic institutions.The neoreactionaries who once theorized about replacing democracy with corporate governance are now finding their way into positions of actual power. They’re not just writing blog posts anymore—they’re drafting executive orders, restructuring agencies, and building the infrastructure for authoritarian control. And they’re doing it while the supposed defenders of democracy debate parliamentary procedure and worry about donor relations.And so we find ourselves in the absurd position where Democratic leadership, in the form of Jeffries and Schumer, treats an ongoing coup like an inconvenient scheduling conflict. Their response to democracy’s crisis amounts to little more than checking  to see if authoritarianism requires a two-thirds majority.While Rome burns, they’re busy drafting strongly worded letters to the arsonists, pausing only to scold the citizens who dare suggest using the fire extinguishers. Their position would be merely comedic if it weren’t so catastrophically dangerous—like watching someone respond to a home invasion by suggesting the burglar fill out a visitor’s form.“What leverage do we have?” Jeffries asks—apparently unaware that he’s providing his own epitaph. The leverage of moral clarity. The leverage of democratic legitimacy. The leverage of millions of citizens demanding their representatives actually represent them. But perhaps that’s too much to expect from leaders who’ve grown so comfortable in their donor-funded cages that they mistake their chains for jewelry.“We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.” — Franklin D. Roosevelt.Mike Brock is a former tech exec who was on the leadership team at Block.

Your setup may be entirely different, and that is just fine. I simply want to set the stage on the infrastructure so that the rest of the discussion makes sense.This is a server you deploy that provides a user interface to for your subject matter experts to label and evaluate images for the image classification application. The server can run as a pod on your Kubernetes cluster, but you may find that running a dedicated server with faster disk may be better.Image files are stored in a directory structure like the following, which is self-documenting and easily modified.Image_Library/
  - cats/
    - image1001.png
  - dogs/
    - image2001.pngIdeally, these files would reside on local server storage (instead of cloud or cluster storage) for better performance. The reason for this will become clear as we see what happens as the image library grows.Cloud Storage allows for a virtually limitless and convenient way to share files between systems. In this case, the image library on your management system could access the same files as your Kubernetes cluster or Docker engine.However, the downside of cloud storage is the latency to open a file. Your image library will have  of images, and the latency to read each file will have a significant impact on your training run time. Longer training runs means more cost for using the expensive GPU processors!The way that I found to speed things up is to create a  file of your image library on your management system and copy them to cloud storage. Even better would be to create multiple tar files , each containing 10,000 to 20,000 images.This way you only have network latency on a handful of files (which contain thousands, once extracted) and you start your training run much sooner.Kubernetes or Docker engineA Kubernetes cluster, with proper configuration, will allow you to dynamically scale up/down nodes, so you can perform your model training on GPU hardware as needed. Kubernetes is a rather heavy setup, and there are other container engines that will work.The technology options change constantly!The main idea is that you want to spin up the resources you need — for only as long as you need them — then scale down to reduce your time (and therefore cost) of running expensive GPU resources.Once your GPU node is started and your Docker container is running, you can extract the  files above to  storage, such as an , on your node. The node typically has high-speed SSD disk, ideal for this type of workload. There is one caveat — the storage capacity on your node must be able to handle your image library.Assuming we are good, let’s talk about building your Docker container so that you can train your model on your image library.Building your Docker containerBeing able to execute a training run in a consistent manner lends itself perfectly to building a Docker container. You can “pin” the version of libraries so you know exactly how your scripts will run every time. You can version control your containers as well, and revert to a known good image in a pinch. What is really nice about Docker is you can run the container pretty much anywhere.The tradeoff when running in a container, especially with an Image Classification model, is the speed of file storage. You can attach any number of volumes to your container, but they are usually  attached, so there is latency on each file read. This may not be a problem if you have a small number of files. But when dealing with hundreds of thousands of files like image data, that latency adds up!This is why using the  file method outlined above can be beneficial.Also, keep in mind that Docker containers could be terminated unexpectedly, so you should make sure to store important information outside the container, on cloud storage or a database. I’ll show you how below.Knowing that you will need to run on GPU hardware (here I will assume Nvidia), be sure to select the right base image for your Dockerfile, such as  with the “devel flavor that will contain the right drivers.Next, you will add the script files to your container, along with a “batch” script to coordinate the execution. Here is an example Dockerfile, and then I’ll describe what each of the scripts will be doing.#####   Dockerfile   #####

CMD tail -f /dev/nullDockerfiles are declarative, almost like a cookbook for building a small server — you know what you’ll get every time. Python libraries benefit, too, from this declarative approach. Here is a sample  file that loads the TensorFlow libraries with CUDA support for GPU acceleration.#####   requirements.txt   #####

tensorflow[and-cuda]Extract Image Library scriptIn Kubernetes, the Docker container can access local, high speed storage on the physical node. This can be achieved via the  volume type. As mentioned before, this will only work if the local storage on your node can handle the size of your library.#####   sample 25GB emptyDir volume in Kubernetes   #####
containers:
  - name: training-container
    volumeMounts:
      - name: image-library
        mountPath: /mnt/image-library
volumes:
  - name: image-library
    emptyDir:
      sizeLimit: 25GiYou would want to have another  to your cloud storage where you have the  files. What this looks like will depend on your provider, or if you are using a persistent volume claim, so I won’t go into detail here.Now you can extract the  files — ideally in parallel for an added performance boost — to the local mount point.As AI/ML engineers, the model training is where we want to spend most of our time.This is where the magic happens!With your image library now extracted, we can create our train-validation-test sets, load a pre-trained model or build a new one, fit the model, and save the results.One key technique that has served me well is to load the most recently trained model as my base. I discuss this in more detail in Part 4 under “Fine tuning”, this results in faster training time and significantly improved model performance.Be sure to take advantage of the local storage to checkpoint your model during training since the models are quite large and you are paying for the GPU even while it sits idle writing to disk.This of course raises a concern about what happens if the Docker container dies part-way though the training. The risk is (hopefully) low from a cloud provider, and you may not want an incomplete training anyway. But if that does happen, you will at least want to understand , and this is where saving the main log file to cloud storage (described below) or to a package like MLflow comes in handy.After your training run has completed and you have taken proper precaution on saving your work, it is time to see how well it performed.Normally this evaluation script will pick up on the model that just finished. But you may decide to point it at a previous model version through an interactive session. This is why have the script as stand-alone.With it being a separate script, that means it will need to read the completed model from disk — ideally local disk for speed. I like having two separate scripts (training and evaluation), but you might find it better to combine these to avoid reloading the model.Now that the model is loaded, the evaluation script should generate predictions on  image in the training, validation, test, and benchmark sets. I save the results as a  matrix with the softmax confidence score for each class label. So, if there are 1,000 classes and 100,000 images, that’s a table with 100 million scores!I save these results in  files that are then used in the score generation next.Taking the matrix of scores produced by the evaluation script above, we can now create various metrics of model performance. Again, this process could be combined with the evaluation script above, but my preference is for independent scripts. For example, I might want to regenerate scores on previous training runs. See what works for you.Here are some of the  functions that produce useful insights like F1, log loss, AUC-ROC, Matthews correlation coefficient.from sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss, matthews_corrcoef, roc_auc_scoreAside from these basic statistical analyses for each dataset (train, validation, test, and benchmark), it is also useful to identify:Which  labels get the most number of errors?Which  labels get the most number of incorrect guesses?How many ground-truth-to-predicted label pairs are there? In other words, which classes are easily confused?What is the  when applying a minimum softmax confidence score threshold?What is the  above that softmax threshold?For the “difficult” benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently  score?For the “out-of-scope” benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently  score?As you can see, there are multiple calculations and it’s not easy to come up with a single evaluation to decide if the trained model is good enough to be moved to production.In fact, for an image classification model, it is helpful to manually review the images that the model got wrong, as well as the ones that got a low softmax confidence score. Use the scores from this script to create a list of images to manually review, and then get a  for how well the model performs.Check out Part 3 for more in-depth discussion on evaluation and scoring.All of the heavy lifting is done by this point. Since your Docker container will be shutdown soon, now is the time to copy the model artifacts to cloud storage and prepare them for being put to use.The example Python code snippet below is more geared to Keras and TensorFlow. This will take the trained model and export it as a . Later, I will show how this is used by TensorFlow Serving in the  section below.# Increment current version of model and create new directory
next_version_dir, version_number = create_new_version_folder()

# Copy model artifacts to the new directory
copy_model_artifacts(next_version_dir)

# Create the directory to save the model export
saved_model_dir = os.path.join(next_version_dir, str(version_number))

# Save the model export for use with TensorFlow Serving
tf.keras.backend.set_learning_phase(0)
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(keras_model_file)
tf.saved_model.save(model, export_dir=saved_model_dir)This script also copies the other training run artifacts such as the model evaluation results, score summaries, and log files generated from model training. Don’t forget about your label map so you can give human readable names to your classes!Bulk identification scriptYour training run is complete, your model has been scored, and a new version is exported and ready to be served. Now is the time to use this latest model to assist you on trying to identify unlabeled images.As I described in Part 4, you may have a collection of “unknowns” — really good pictures, but no idea what they are. Let your new model provide a best guess on these and record the results to a file or a database. Now you can create filters based on closest match and by high/low scores. This allows your subject matter experts to leverage these filters to find new image classes, add to existing classes, or to remove images that have very low scores and are no good.By the way, I put this step inside the GPU container since you may have thousands of “unknown” images to process and the accelerated hardware will make light work of it. However, if you are not in a hurry, you could perform this step on a separate CPU node, and shutdown your GPU node sooner to save cost. This would especially make sense if your “unknowns” folder is on slower cloud storage.All of the scripts described above perform a specific task — from extracting your image library, executing model training, performing evaluation and scoring, exporting the model artifacts for deployment, and perhaps even bulk identification.One script to rule them allTo coordinate the entire show, this batch script gives you the entry point for your container and an easy way to trigger everything. Be sure to produce a log file in case you need to analyze any failures along the way. Also, be sure to write the log to your cloud storage in case the container dies unexpectedly.#!/bin/bash
# Main batch control script

# Redirect standard output and standard error to a log file
exec > /cloud_storage/batch-logfile.txt 2>&1

/app/ExtractImageLibrary.py
/app/Training.py
/app/Evaluation.py
/app/ScorePerformance.py
/app/ExportModel.py
/app/BulkIdentification.pyExecuting your training runSo, now it’s time to put everything in motion…Let’s go through the steps to prepare your image library, fire up your Docker container to train your model, and then examine the results.Image library ‘tar’ filesYour image management system should now create a  file backup of your data. Since  is a single-threaded function, you will get significant speed improvement by creating multiple tar files in parallel, each with a portion of you data.Now these files can be copied to your shared cloud storage for the next step.All the hard work you put into creating your container (described above) will be put to the test. If you are running Kubernetes, you can create a Job that will execute the  script.Inside the Kubernetes Job definition, you can pass environment variables to adjust the execution of your script. For example, the batch size and number of epochs are set here and then pulled into your Python scripts, so you can alter the behavior without changing your code.#####   sample Job in Kubernetes   #####
containers:
  - name: training-job
    env:
      - name: BATCH_SIZE
        value: 50
      - name: NUM_EPOCHS
        value: 30
    command: ["/app/BatchControl.sh"]Once the Job is completed, be sure to verify that the GPU node properly scales back down to zero according to your scaling configuration in Kubernetes — you don’t want to be saddled with a huge bill over a simple configuration error.With the training run complete, you should now have model artifacts saved and can examine the performance. Look through the metrics, such as F1 and log loss, and benchmark accuracy for high softmax confidence scores.As mentioned earlier, the reports only tell part of the story. It is worth the time and effort to manually review the images that the model got wrong or where it produced a low confidence score.Don’t forget about the bulk identification. Be sure to leverage these to locate new images to fill out your data set, or to find new classes.Once you have reviewed your model performance and are satisfied with the results, it is time to modify your TensorFlow Serving container to put the new model into production.TensorFlow Serving is available as a Docker container and provides a very quick and convenient way to serve your model. This container can listen and respond to API calls for your model.Let’s say your new model is version 7, and your  script (see above) has saved the model in your cloud share as /image_application/models/007. You can start the TensorFlow Serving container with that volume mount. In this example, the  points to folder for version 007.#####   sample TensorFlow pod in Kubernetes   #####
containers:
  - name: tensorflow-serving
    image: bitnami/tensorflow-serving:2.18.0
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8501
    env:
      - name: TENSORFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_NAME
        value: "image_application"
    volumeMounts:
      - name: models-subfolder
        mountPath: "/bitnami/model-data"

volumes:
  - name: models-subfolder
    azureFile:
      shareName: "image_application/models/007"A subtle note here — the export script should create a sub-folder, named 007 (same as the base folder), with the saved model export. This may seem a little confusing, but TensorFlow Serving will mount this share folder as  and detect the numbered sub-folder inside it for the version to serve. This will allow you to query the API for the model version as well as the identification.As I mentioned at the start of this article, this setup has worked for my situation. This is certainly not the only way to approach this challenge, and I invite you to customize your own solution.I wanted to share my hard-fought learnings as I embraced cloud services in Kubernetes, with the desire to keep costs under control. Of course, doing all this while maintaining a high level of model performance is an added challenge, but one that you can achieve.I hope I have provided enough information here to help you with your own endeavors. Happy learnings!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer — Part 3: The Evaluation</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/</link><author>David Martin</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 21:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this third part of my series, I will explore the evaluation process which is a critical piece that will lead to a cleaner data set and elevate your model performance. We will see the difference between evaluation of a  model (one not yet in production), and evaluation of a  model (one making real-world predictions).In Part 1, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your Image Classification project. I showed how to define “good” images and create sub-classes. In Part 2, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, such as benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images.Evaluation of the trained modelAs machine learning engineers we look at accuracy, F1, log loss, and other metrics to decide if a model is ready to move to production. These are all important measures, but from my experience, these scores can be deceiving especially as the number of classes grows.Although it can be time consuming, I find it very important to manually review the images that the model gets , as well as the images that the model gives a  softmax “confidence” score to. This means adding a step immediately after your training run completes to calculate scores for  images — training, validation, test, and the benchmark sets. You only need to bring up for manual review the ones that the model had problems with. This should only be a small percentage of the total number of images. See the Double-check process belowWhat you do during the manual evaluation is to put yourself in a “” to ensure that the labelling standards are being followed that you setup in Part 1. Ask yourself:“Is this a good image?” Is the subject front and center, and can you clearly see all the features?“Is this the correct label?” Don’t be surprised if you find wrong labels.You can either remove the bad images or fix the labels if they are wrong. Otherwise you can keep them in the data set and force the model to do better next time. Other questions I ask are:“Why did the model get this wrong?”“Why did this image get a low score?”“What is it about the image that caused confusion?”Sometimes the answer has nothing to do with  specific image. Frequently, it has to do with the  images, either in the ground truth class or in the predicted class. It is worth the effort to Double-check all images in both sets if you see a consistently bad guess. Again, don’t be surprised if you find poor images or wrong labels.When doing the evaluation of the trained model (above), we apply a lot of subjective analysis — “Why did the model get this wrong?” and “Is this a good image?” From these, you may only get a .Frequently, I will decide to hold off moving a model forward to production based on that gut feel. But how can you justify to your manager that you want to hit the brakes? This is where putting a more  analysis comes in by creating a weighted average of the softmax “confidence” scores.In order to apply a weighted evaluation, we need to identify sets of classes that deserve adjustments to the score. Here is where I create a list of “commonly confused” classes.Commonly confused classesCertain animals at our zoo can easily be mistaken. For example, African elephants and Asian elephants have different ear shapes. If your model gets these two mixed up, that is not as bad as guessing a giraffe! So perhaps you give partial credit here. You and your subject matter experts (SMEs) can come up with a list of these pairs and a weighted adjustment for each.This weight can be factored into a modified cross-entropy loss function in the equation below. The back half of this equation will reduce the impact of being wrong for specific pairs of ground truth and prediction by using the “weight” function as a lookup. By default, the weighted adjustment would be 1 for all pairings, and the commonly confused classes would get something like 0.5.In other words, it’s better to be unsure (have a  confidence score) when you are wrong, compared to being super confident and wrong.Once this weighted log loss is calculated, I can compare to previous training runs to see if the new model is ready for production.Confidence threshold reportAnother valuable measure that incorporates the confidence threshold (in my example, 95) is to report on accuracy and false positive rates. Recall that when we apply the confidence threshold before presenting results, we help reduce false positives from being shown to the end user.In this table, we look at the breakdown of “true positive above 95” for each data set. We get a sense that when a “good” picture comes through (like the ones from our train-validation-test set) it is very likely to surpass the threshold, thus the user is “happy” with the outcome. Conversely, the “false positive above 95” is extremely low for good pictures, thus only a small number of our users will be “sad” about the results.We expect the train-validation-test set results to be exceptional since our data is curated. So, as long as people take “good” pictures, the model should do very well. But to get a sense of how it does on extreme situations, let’s take a look at our benchmarks.The “difficult” benchmark has more modest true positive and false positive rates, which reflects the fact that the images are more challenging. These values are much easier to compare across training runs, so that lets me set a min/max target. So for example, if I target a minimum of 80% for true positive, and maximum of 5% for false positive on this benchmark, then I can feel confident moving this to production.The “out-of-scope” benchmark has no true positive rate because  of the images belong to any class the model can identify. Remember, we picked things like a bag of popcorn, etc., that are not zoo animals, so there cannot be any true positives. But we do get a false positive rate, which means the model gave a confident score to that bag of popcorn as some animal. And if we set a target maximum of 10% for this benchmark, then we may not want to move it to production.Right now, you may be thinking, “Well, what animal did it pick for the bag of popcorn?” Excellent question! Now you understand the importance of doing a manual review of the images that get bad results.Evaluation of the deployed modelThe evaluation that I described above applies to a model immediately after . Now, you want to evaluate how your model is doing in the . The process is similar, but requires you to shift to a “” and asking yourself, “Did the model get this correct?” and “Should it have gotten this correct?” and “Did we tell the user the right thing?”So, imagine that you are logging in for the morning — after sipping on your cold brew coffee, of course — and are presented with 500 images that your zoo guests took yesterday of different animals. Your job is to determine how satisfied the guests were using your model to identify the zoo animals.Using the softmax “confidence” score for each image, we have a threshold before presenting results. Above the threshold, we tell the guest what the model predicted. I’ll call this the “happy path”. And below the threshold is the “sad path” where we ask them to try again.Your review interface will first show you all the “happy path” images one at a time. This is where you ask yourself, “Did we get this right?” Hopefully, yes!But if not, this is where things get tricky. So now you have to ask, “Why not?” Here are some things that it could be:“Bad” picture — Poor lighting, bad angle, zoomed out, etc — refer to your labelling standards.Out-of-scope — It’s a zoo animal, but unfortunately one that isn’t found in  zoo. Maybe it belongs to another zoo (your guest likes to travel and try out your app). Consider adding these to your data set.Out-of-scope — It’s not a zoo animal. It could be an animal in your zoo, but not one typically  there, like a neighborhood sparrow or mallard duck. This might be a candidate to add.Out-of-scope — It’s something found in the zoo. A zoo usually has interesting trees and shrubs, so people might try to identify those. Another candidate to add.Prankster — Completely out-of-scope. Because people like to play with technology, there’s the possibility you have a prankster that took a picture of a bag of popcorn, or a soft drink cup, or even a selfie. These are hard to prevent, but hopefully get a low enough score (below the threshold) so the model did not identify it as a zoo animal. If you see enough pattern in these, consider creating a class with special handling on the front-end.After reviewing the “happy path” images, you move on to the “sad path” images — the ones that got a low confidence score and the app gave a “sorry, try again” message. This time you ask yourself, “ the model have given this image a higher score?” which would have put it in the “happy path”. If so, then you want to ensure these images are added to the training set so next time it will do better. But most of time, the low score reflects many of the “bad” or out-of-scope situations mentioned above.Perhaps your model performance is suffering and it has nothing to do with your model. Maybe it is the ways you users interacting with the app. Keep an eye out of non-technical problems and share your observations with the rest of your team. For example:Are your users using the application in the ways you expected?Are they not following the instructions?Do the instructions need to be stated more clearly?Is there anything you can do to improve the experience?Collect statistics and new imagesBoth of the manual evaluations above open a gold mine of data. So, be sure to collect these statistics and feed them into a dashboard — your manager and your future self will thank you!Keep track of these stats and generate reports that you and your can reference:How often the model is being called?What times of the day, what days of the week is it used?Are your system resources able to handle the peak load?What classes are the most common?After evaluation, what is the accuracy for each class?What is the breakdown for confidence scores?How many scores are above and below the confidence threshold?The single best thing you get from a deployed model is the additional real-world images! You can add these now images to improve coverage of your existing zoo animals. But more importantly, they provide you insight on  classes to add. For example, let’s say people enjoy taking a picture of the large walrus statue at the gate. Some of these may make sense to incorporate into your data set to provide a better user experience.Creating a new class, like the walrus statue, is not a huge effort, and it avoids the false positive responses. It would be more embarrassing to identify a walrus statue as an elephant! As for the prankster and the bag of popcorn, you can configure your front-end to quietly handle these. You might even get creative and have fun with it like, “Thank you for visiting the food court.”It is a good idea to double-check your image set when you suspect there may be problems with your data. I’m not suggesting a top-to-bottom check, because that would a monumental effort! Rather specific classes that you suspect could contain bad data that is degrading your model performance.Immediately after my training run completes, I have a script that will use this new model to generate predictions for my  data set. When this is complete, it will take the list of incorrect identifications, as well as the low scoring predictions, and automatically feed that list into the Double-check interface.This interface will show, one at a time, the image in question, alongside an example image of the ground truth and an example image of what the model predicted. I can visually compare the three, side-by-side. The first thing I do is ensure the original image is a “good” picture, following my labelling standards. Then I check if the ground-truth label is indeed correct, or if there is something that made the model think it was the predicted label.Remove the original image if the image quality is poor.Relabel the image if it belongs in a different class.During this manual evaluation, you might notice dozens of the same wrong prediction. Ask yourself why the model made this mistake when the images seem perfectly fine. The answer may be some incorrect labels on images in the ground truth, or even in the predicted class!Don’t hesitate to add those classes and sub-classes back into the Double-check interface and step through them all. You may have 100–200 pictures to review, but there is a good chance that one or two of the images will stand out as being the culprit.With a different mindset for a trained model versus a deployed model, we can now evaluate performances to decide which models are ready for production, and how well a production model is going to serve the public. This relies on a solid Double-check process and a critical eye on your data. And beyond the “gut feel” of your model, we can rely on the benchmark scores to support us.In Part 4, we kick off the training run, but there are some subtle techniques to get the most out of the process and even ways to leverage throw-away models to expand your library image data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zed Editor Introduces Open-Source &quot;Zeta&quot; Edit Prediction Model</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Zed-Zeta-AI-Model-Edit-Predict</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:58:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Zed code editor for macOS and Linux systems has proven to be quite popular for this Rust-based editor started by the creators of the Atom editor.

We are seeing Amazon Bedrock Agents applied in investment research, insurance claims processing, root cause analysis, advertising campaigns, and much more. Agents use the reasoning capability of foundation models (FMs) to break down user-requested tasks into multiple steps. They use developer-provided instructions to create an orchestration plan and carry out that plan by securely invoking company APIs and accessing knowledge bases using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to accurately handle the user’s request.Although organizations see the benefit of agents that are defined, configured, and tested as managed resources, we have increasingly seen the need for an additional, more dynamic way to invoke agents. Organizations need solutions that adjust on the fly—whether to test new approaches, respond to changing business rules, or customize solutions for different clients. This is where the new inline agents capability in Amazon Bedrock Agents becomes transformative. It allows you to dynamically adjust your agent’s behavior at runtime by changing its instructions, tools, guardrails, knowledge bases, prompts, and even the FMs it uses—all without redeploying your application.In this post, we explore how to build an application using Amazon Bedrock inline agents, demonstrating how a single AI assistant can adapt its capabilities dynamically based on user roles.Inline agents in Amazon Bedrock AgentsThis runtime flexibility enabled by inline agents opens powerful new possibilities, such as: – Inline agents minimize the time-consuming create/update/prepare cycles traditionally required for agent configuration changes. Developers can instantly test different combinations of models, tools, and knowledge bases, dramatically accelerating the development process.A/B testing and experimentation – Data science teams can systematically evaluate different model-tool combinations, measure performance metrics, and analyze response patterns in controlled environments. This empirical approach enables quantitative comparison of configurations before production deployment.Subscription-based personalization – Software companies can adapt features based on each customer’s subscription level, providing more advanced tools for premium users.Persona-based data source integration – Institutions can adjust content complexity and tone based on the user’s profile, providing persona-appropriate explanations and resources by changing the knowledge bases associated to the agent on the fly. – Developers can create applications with hundreds of APIs, and quickly and accurately carry out tasks by dynamically choosing a small subset of APIs for the agent to consider for a given request. This is particularly helpful for large software as a service (SaaS) platforms needing multi-tenant scaling.Inline agents expand your options for building and deploying agentic solutions with Amazon Bedrock Agents. For workloads needing managed and versioned agent resources with a pre-determined and tested configuration (specific model, instructions, tools, and so on), developers can continue to use InvokeAgent on resources created with CreateAgent. For workloads that need dynamic runtime behavior changes for each agent invocation, you can use the new InvokeInlineAgent API. With either approach, your agents will be secure and scalable, with configurable guardrails, a flexible set of model inference options, native access to knowledge bases, code interpretation, session memory, and more.Our HR assistant example shows how to build a single AI assistant that adapts to different user roles using the new inline agent capabilities in Amazon Bedrock Agents. When users interact with the assistant, the assistant dynamically configures agent capabilities (such as model, instructions, knowledge bases, action groups, and guardrails) based on the user’s role and their specific selections. This approach creates a flexible system that adjusts its functionality in real time, making it more efficient than creating separate agents for each user role or tool combination. The complete code for this HR assistant example is available on our GitHub repo.This dynamic tool selection enables a personalized experience. When an employee logs in without direct reports, they see a set of tools that they have access to based on their role. They can select from options like requesting vacation time, checking company policies using the knowledge base, using a code interpreter for data analysis, or submitting expense reports. The inline agent assistant is then configured with only these selected tools, allowing it to assist the employee with their chosen tasks. In a real-world example, the user would not need to make the selection, because the application would make that decision and automatically configure the agent invocation at runtime. We make it explicit in this application so that you can demonstrate the impact.Similarly, when a manager logs in to the same system, they see an extended set of tools reflecting their additional permissions. In addition to the employee-level tools, managers have access to capabilities like running performance reviews. They can select which tools they want to use for their current session, instantly configuring the inline agent with their choices.The inclusion of knowledge bases is also adjusted based on the user’s role. Employees and managers see different levels of company policy information, with managers getting additional access to confidential data like performance review and compensation details. For this demo, we’ve implemented metadata filtering to retrieve only the appropriate level of documents based on the user’s access level, further enhancing efficiency and security.Let’s look at how the interface adapts to different user roles.The employee view provides access to essential HR functions like vacation requests, expense submissions, and company policy lookups. Users can select which of these tools they want to use for their current session.The manager view extends these options to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent can be configured with a broader set of tools based on user permissions.The manager view extends these capabilities to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent dynamically adjusts its available tools based on user permissions. Without inline agents, we would need to build and maintain two separate agents.As shown in the preceding screenshots, the same HR assistant offers different tool selections based on the user’s role. An employee sees options like Knowledge Base, Apply Vacation Tool, and Submit Expense, whereas a manager has additional options like Performance Evaluation. Users can select which tools they want to add to the agent for their current interaction.This flexibility allows for quick adaptation to user needs and preferences. For instance, if the company introduces a new policy for creating business travel requests, the tool catalog can be quickly updated to include a Create Business Travel Reservation tool. Employees can then choose to add this new tool to their agent configuration when they need to plan a business trip, or the application could automatically do so based on their role.With Amazon Bedrock inline agents, you can create a catalog of actions that is dynamically selected by the application or by users of the application. This increases the level of flexibility and adaptability of your solutions, making them a perfect fit for navigating the complex, ever-changing landscape of modern business operations. Users have more control over their AI assistant’s capabilities, and the system remains efficient by only loading the necessary tools for each interaction.Technical foundation: Dynamic configuration and action selectionInline agents allow dynamic configuration at runtime, enabling a single agent to effectively perform the work of many. By specifying action groups and modifying instructions on the fly, even within the same session, you can create versatile AI applications that adapt to various scenarios without multiple agent deployments.The following are key points about inline agents: – Change the agent’s configuration, including its FM, at runtime. This enables rapid experimentation and adaptation without redeploying the application, reducing development cycles. – Apply governance and access control at the tool level. With agents changing dynamically at runtime, tool-level governance helps maintain security and compliance regardless of the agent’s configuration. – Provide only necessary tools and instructions at runtime to reduce token usage and improve the agent accuracy. With fewer tools to choose from, it’s less complicated for the agent to select the right one, reducing hallucinations in the tool selection process. This approach can also lead to lower costs and improved latency compared to static agents because removing unnecessary tools, knowledge bases, and instructions reduces the number of input and output tokens being processed by the agent’s large language model (LLM). – Create reusable actions for dynamic selection based on specific needs. This modular approach simplifies maintenance, updates, and scalability of your AI applications.The following are examples of reusable actions:Enterprise system integration – Connect with systems like Salesforce, GitHub, or databases – Perform common tasks such as sending emails or managing calendars – Interact with specialized internal tools and services – Analyze text, structured data, or other information – Fetch weather updates, stock prices, or perform web searches – Use specific machine learning (ML) models for targeted tasksWhen using inline agents, you configure parameters for the following:Contextual tool selection based on user intent or conversation flowAdaptation to different user roles and permissionsSwitching between communication styles or personasModel selection based on task complexityThe inline agent uses the configuration you provide at runtime, allowing for highly flexible AI assistants that efficiently handle various tasks across different business contexts.Building an HR assistant using inline agentsLet’s look at how we built our HR Assistant using Amazon Bedrock inline agents: – We developed a demo catalog of HR-related tools, including: 
   – Using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for accessing company policies and guidelines based on the role of the application user. In order to filter the knowledge base content based on the user’s role, you also need to provide a metadata file specifying the type of employee’s roles that can access each file– For requesting and tracking time off.– For submitting and managing expense reports. – For performing calculations and data analysis.– for conducting and reviewing employee compensation assessments (manager only access). – We defined multiple conversation tones to suit different interaction styles: 
   – For formal, business-like interactions. – For friendly, everyday support. – For upbeat, encouraging assistance. – We implemented role-based access control. The application backend checks the user’s role (employee or manager) and provides access to appropriate tools and information and passes this information to the inline agent. The role information is also used to configure metadata filtering in the knowledge bases to generate relevant responses. The system allows for dynamic tool use at runtime. Users can switch personas or add and remove tools during their session, allowing the agent to adapt to different conversation needs in real time.Integrate the agent with other services and tools – We connected the inline agent to: 
  Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for company policies, with metadata filtering for role-based access.AWS Lambda functions for executing specific actions (such as submitting vacation requests or expense reports).A code interpreter tool for performing calculations and data analysis. – We created a Flask-based UI that performs the following actions: 
  Displays available tools based on the user’s role.Allows users to select different personas.Provides a chat window for interacting with the HR assistant.To understand how this dynamic role-based functionality works under the hood, let’s examine the following system architecture diagram.As shown in preceding architecture diagram, the system works as follows:The end-user logs in and is identified as either a manager or an employee.The user selects the tools that they have access to and makes a request to the HR assistant.The agent breaks down the problems and uses the available tools to solve for the query in steps, which may include: 
  Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases (with metadata filtering for role-based access).Lambda functions for specific actions.Code interpreter tool for calculations.Compensation tool (accessible only to managers to submit base pay raise requests).The application uses the Amazon Bedrock inline agent to dynamically pass in the appropriate tools based on the user’s role and request.The agent uses the selected tools to process the request and provide a response to the user.This approach provides a flexible, scalable solution that can quickly adapt to different user roles and changing business needs.In this post, we introduced the Amazon Bedrock inline agent functionality and highlighted its application to an HR use case. We dynamically selected tools based on the user’s roles and permissions, adapted instructions to set a conversation tone, and selected different models at runtime. With inline agents, you can transform how you build and deploy AI assistants. By dynamically adapting tools, instructions, and models at runtime, you can:Create personalized experiences for different user rolesOptimize costs by matching model capabilities to task complexityStreamline development and maintenanceScale efficiently without managing multiple agent configurationsFor organizations demanding highly dynamic behavior—whether you’re an AI startup, SaaS provider, or enterprise solution team—inline agents offer a scalable approach to building intelligent assistants that grow with your needs.

While this is true (and pretty much obvious), it is extremely difficult to define, build, and sustain good data. Let me share with you the unique processes that I have learned over several years building an ever-growing image classification system and how you can apply these techniques to your own application.With persistence and diligence, you can avoid the classic “garbage in, garbage out”, maximize your model accuracy, and demonstrate real business value.In this series of articles, I will dive into the care and feeding of a multi-class, single-label image classification app and what it takes to reach the highest level of performance. I won’t get into any coding or specific user interfaces, just the main concepts that you can incorporate to suit your needs with the tools at your disposal.Here is a brief description of the articles. You will notice that the model is last on the list since we need to focus on curating the data first and foremost:Over the past six years, I have been primarily focused on building and maintaining an image classification application for a manufacturing company. Back when I started, most of the software did not exist or was too expensive, so I created these from scratch. In this time, I have deployed two identifier applications, the largest handles 1,500 classes and achieves 97–98% accuracy.It was about eight years ago that I started online studies for Data Science and machine learning. So, when the exciting opportunity to create an AI application presented itself, I was prepared to build the tools I needed to leverage the latest advancements. I jumped in with both feet!I quickly found that building and deploying a model is probably the easiest part of the job. Feeding high quality data into the model is the best way to improve performance, and that requires focus and patience. Attention to detail is what I do best, so this was a perfect fit.It all starts with the dataI feel that so much attention is given to the model selection (deciding which neural network is best) and that the data is just an afterthought. I have found the hard way that even one or two pieces of bad data can significantly impact model performance, so that is where we need to focus.For example, let’s say you train the classic cat versus dog image classifier. You have 50 pictures of cats and 50 pictures of dogs, however one of the “cats” is clearly (objectively) a picture of a dog. The computer doesn’t have the luxury of ignoring the mislabelled image, and instead adjusts the model weights to make it fit. Square peg meets round hole.Another example would be a picture of a cat that climbed up into a tree. But when you take a wholistic view of it, you would describe it as a picture of a tree (first) with a cat (second). Again, the computer doesn’t know to ignore the big tree and focus on the cat — it will start to identify trees as cats, even if there is a dog. You can think of these pictures as outliers and should be removed.It doesn’t matter if you have the best neural network in the world, you can count on the model making poor predictions when it is trained on “bad” data. I’ve learned that any time I see the model make mistakes, it’s time to review the data.Example Application — Zoo animalsFor the rest of this write-up, I will use an example of identifying zoo animals. Let’s assume your goal is to create a mobile app where guests at the zoo can take pictures of the animals they see and have the app identify them. Specifically, this is a multi-class, single-label application. — There are a lot of different animals at the zoo and many of them look very similar. — Guests using the app don’t always take good pictures (zoomed out, blurry, too dark), so we don’t want to provide an answer if the image is poor. — The zoo keeps expanding and adding new species all the time. — Occasionally you might find that people take pictures of the sparrows near the food court grabbing some dropped popcorn. — Just for fun, guests may take a picture of the bag of popcorn just to see what it comes back with.These are all real challenges — being able to tell the subtle differences between animals, handling out-of-scope cases, and just plain poor images.Before we get there, let’s start from the beginning.There are a lot of tools these days to help you with this part of the process, but the challenge remains the same — collecting, labelling, and curating the data.Having data to collect is challenge #1. Without images, you have nothing to train. You may need to get creative on sourcing the data, or even creating synthetic data. More on that later.A quick note about image pre-processing. I convert all my images to the input size of my neural network and save them as PNG. Inside this square PNG, I preserve the aspect ratio of the original picture and fill the background black. I don’t stretch the image nor crop any features out. This also helps center the subject.Challenge #2 is to establish standards for data quality…and ensure that these standards are followed! These standards will guide you toward that “good” data. And this assumes, of course, correct labels. Having both is much easier said than done!I hope to show how “good” and “correct” actually go hand-in-hand, and how important it is to apply these standards to every image.First, I want to point out that the image data discussed here is for the training set. What qualifies as a good image for  is a bit different than what qualifies as a good image for . More on that in Part 3.So, what is “good” data when talking about images? “A picture is worth a thousand words”, and if the  you use to describe the picture do not include the subject you are trying to label, then it is not good and you need remove it from your training set.For example, let’s say you are shown a picture of a zebra and (removing bias toward your application) you describe it as an “open field with a zebra in the distance”. In other words, if “open field” is the first thing you notice, then you likely do  want to use that image. The opposite is also true — if the picture is way too close, you would described it as “zebra pattern”.What you want is a description like, “a zebra, front and center”. This would have your subject taking up about 80–90% of the total frame. Sometimes I will take the time to crop the original image so the subject is framed properly.Keep in mind the use of image augmentation at the time of training. Having that buffer around the edges will allow “zoom in” augmentation. And “zoom out” augmentation will simulate smaller subjects, so don’t start out less than 50% of the total frame for your subject since you lose detail.Another aspect of a “good” image relates to the label. If you can only see the back side of your zoo animal, can you really tell, for example, that it is a cheetah versus a leopard? The key identifying features need to be visible. If a human struggles to identify it, you can’t expect the computer to learn anything.What does a “bad” image look like? Here is what I frequently watch out for:Wide angle lens stretchingHigh contrast or dark shadows“Doctored” images, drawn lines and arrows“Unusual” angles or situationsPicture of a mobile device that has a picture of your subjectIf you have a team of subject matter experts (SMEs) on hand to label the images, you are in a good starting position. Animal trainers at the zoo know the various species, and can spot the differences between, for example, a chimpanzee and a bonobo.To a Machine Learning Engineer, it is easy for you to assume all labels from your SMEs are correct and move right on to training the model. However, even experts make mistakes, so if you can get a second opinion on the labels, your error rate should go down.In reality, it can be prohibitively expensive to get one, let alone two, subject matter experts to review image labels. The SME usually has years of experience that make them more valuable to the business in other areas of work. My experience is that the machine learning engineer (that’s you and me) becomes the second opinion, and often the first opinion as well.Over time, you can become pretty adept at labelling, but certainly not an SME. If you do have the luxury of access to an expert, explain to them the labelling standards and how these are required for the application to be successful. Emphasize “quality over quantity”.It goes without saying that having a  label is so important. However, all it takes is one or two mislabelled images to degrade performance. These can easily slip into your data set with careless or hasty labelling. So, take the time to get it right.Ultimately, we as the ML engineer are responsible for model performance. So, if we take the approach of only working on model training and deployment, we will find ourselves wondering why performance is falling short.A lot of times, you will come across a really good picture of a very interesting subject, but have no idea what it is! It would be a shame to simply dispose of it. What you can do is assign it a generic label, like “Unknown Bird” or “Random Plant” that are  included in your training set. Later in Part 4, you’ll see how to come back to these images at a later date when you have a better idea what they are, and you’ll be glad you saved them.If you have done any image labelling, then you know how time consuming and difficult it can be. But this is where having a model, even a less-than-perfect model, can help you.Typically, you have a large collection of unlabelled image and you need to go through them one at a time to assign labels. Simply having the model offer a best guess and display the top 3 results lets you step through each image in a matter of seconds!Even if the top 3 results are wrong, this can help you narrow down your search. Over time, newer models will get better, and the labelling process can even be somewhat fun!In Part 4, I will show how you can bulk identify images and take this to the next level for faster labelling.I mentioned the example above of two species that look very similar, the chimpanzee and the bonobo. When you start out building your data set, you may have very sparse coverage of one or both of these species. In machine learning terms, we these “classes”. One option is to roll with what you have and hope that the model picks up on the differences with only a handful of example images.The option that I have used is to merge two or more classes into one, at least temporarily. So, in this case I would create a class called “chimp-bonobo”, which is composed of the limited example pictures of chimpanzee and bonobo species classes. Combined, these may give me enough to train the model on “chimp-bonobo”, with the trade-off that it’s a more generic identification.Sub-classes can even be normal variations. For example,  pink flamingos are grey instead of pink. Or, male and female orangutans have distinct facial features. You wan to have a fairly balanced number of images for these normal variations, and keeping sub-classes will allow you to accomplish this.Don’t be concerned that you are merging completely different looking classes — the neural network does a nice job of applying the “OR” operator. This works both ways — it can help you identify male or female variations as one species, but it can hurt you when “bad” outlier images sneak in like the example “open field with a zebra in the distance.”Over time, you will (hopefully) be able to collect more images of the sub-classes and then be able to successfully split them apart (if necessary) and train the model to identify them separately. This process has worked very well for me. Just be sure to double-check all the images when you split them to ensure the labels didn’t get accidentally mixed up — it will be time well spent.All of this certainly depends on your user requirements, and you can handle this in different ways either by creating a unique class label like “chimp-bonobo”, or at the front-end presentation layer where you notify the user that you have intentionally merged these classes and provide guidance on further refining the results. Even after you decide to split the two classes, you may want to caution the user that the model could be wrong since the two classes are so similar.I realize this was a long write-up for something that on the surface seems intuitive, but these are all areas that I have tripped me up in the past because I didn’t give them enough attention. Once you have a solid understanding of these principles, you can go on to build a successful application.In Part 2, we will take the curated data we collected here to create the classic data sets, with a custom benchmark set that will further enhance your data. Then we will see how best to evaluate our trained model using a specific “training mindset”, and switch to a “production mindset” when evaluating a deployed model.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer — Part 4: The Model</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/</link><author>David Martin</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:53:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this latest part of my series, I will share what I have learned on selecting a model for Image Classification and how to fine tune that model. I will also show how you can leverage the model to accelerate your labelling process, and finally how to justify your efforts by generating usage and performance statistics.In Part 1, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your image classification project. I showed how define “good” images and create sub-classes. In Part 2, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, with benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images. In Part 3, I explained how to apply different evaluation criteria to a trained model versus a deployed model, and using benchmarks to determine when to deploy a model.So far I have focused a lot of time on labelling and curating the set of images, and also evaluating model performance, which is like putting the cart before the horse. I’m not trying to minimize what it takes to design a massive neural network — this is a very important part of the application you are building. In my case, I spent a few weeks experimenting with different available models before settling on one that fit the bill.Once you pick a model structure, you usually don’t make any major changes to it. For me, six years into deployment, I’m still using the same one. Specifically, I chose Inception V4 because it has a large input image size and an adequate number of layers to pick up on subtle image features. It also performs inference fast enough on CPU, so I don’t need to run expensive hardware to serve the model.Your mileage may vary. But again, the main takeaway is that focusing on your data will pay dividends versus searching for the best model.I will share a process that I found to work extremely well. Once I decided on the model to use, I randomly initialized the weights and let the model train for about 120 epoch before improvements plateau at a fairly modest accuracy, like 93%. At this point, I performed the evaluation of the trained model (see Part 3) to clean up the data set. I also incorporated new images as part of the data pipeline (see Part 1) and prepared the data sets for the next training run.Before starting the next training run, I simply take the last trained model, pop the output layer, and add it back in with random weights. Since the number of output classes are constantly increasing in my case, I have to pop that layer anyway to account for the new number of classes. Importantly, I leave the rest of the trained weights as they were and allow them to continue updating for the new classes.This allows the model to train much faster before improvements stall. After repeating this process dozens of times, the training reaches plateau after about 20 epochs, and the test accuracy can reach 99%! The model is building upon the low-level features that it established from the previous runs while re-learning the output weights to prevent overfitting.It took me a while to trust this process, and for a few years I would train from scratch every time. But after I attempted this and saw the training time (not to mention the cost of cloud GPU) go down while the accuracy continued to go up, I started to embrace the process. More importantly, I continue to see the evaluation metrics of the deployed model return solid performances.During training, you can apply transformations on your images (called “augmentation”) to give you more diversity from you data set. With our zoo animals, it is fairly safe to apply left-right flop, slight rotations clockwise and counterclockwise, and slight resize that will zoom in and out.With these transformations in mind, make sure your images are still able to act as good training images. In other words, an image where the subject is already small will be even smaller with a zoom out, so you probably want to discard the original. Also, some of your original pictures may need to be re-oriented by 90 degrees to be upright since a further rotation would make them look unusual.As I mentioned in Part 1, you can use the trained model to assist you in labelling images one at a time. But the way to take this even further is to have your newly trained model identify hundreds at a time while building a list of the results that you can then filter.Typically, we have large collections of  images that have come in either through regular usage of the application or some other means. Recall from Part 1 assigning “unknown” labels to interesting pictures but you have no clue what it is. By using the bulk identification method, we can sift through the collections quickly to target the labelling once we know what they are.By combining your current image counts with the bulk identification results, you can target classes that need expanded coverage. Here are a few ways you can leverage bulk identification:Increase low image counts — Some of your classes may have just barely made the cutoff to be included in the training set, which means you need more examples to improve coverage. Filter for images that have low counts.Replace staged or synthetic images — Some classes may be built entirely using non-real-world images. These pictures may be good enough to get started with, but may cause performance issues down the road because they look different than what typically comes through. Filter for classes that depend on staged images. — A class in your data set may look like another one. For example, let’s say your model can identify an antelope, and that looks like a gazelle which your model cannot identify yet. Setting a filter for antelope and a lower confidence score may reveal gazelle images that you can label. — You may not have known how to identify the dozens of cute wallaby pictures, so you saved them under “Unknown” because it was a good image. Now that you know what it is, you can filter for its look-alike kangaroo and quickly add a new class.Mass removal of low scores — As a way to clean out your large collection of unlabelled images that have nothing worth labelling, set a filter for lowest scores.Recall the decision I made to have image cutoffs from Part 2, which allows us to ensure an adequate number of example images of a class before we train and server a model to the public. The problem is that you may have a number of classes that are  below your cutoff (in my case, 40) and don’t make it into the model.The way I approach this is with a “throw-away” training run that I do not intend to move to production. I will decrease the lower cutoff from 40 to perhaps 35, build my train-validation-test sets, then train and evaluate like I normally do. The most important part of this is the bulk identification at the end!There is a chance that somewhere in the large collection of unlabelled images I will find the few that I need. Doing the bulk identification with this throw-away model helps find them.One very important aspect of any machine learning application is being able to show usage and performance reports. Your manager will likely want to see how many times the application is being used to justify the expense, and you as the ML engineer will want to see how the latest model is performing compared to the previous one.You should build logging into your model serving to record every transaction going through the system. Also, the manual evaluations from Part 3 should be recorded so you can report on performance for such things as accuracy over time, by model version, by confidence scores, by class, etc. You will be able to detect trends and make adjustments to improve the overall solution.There are a lot of reporting tools, so I won’t recommend one over the other. Just make sure you are collecting as much information as you can to build these dashboards. This will justify the time, effort, and cost associated with maintaining the application.We covered a lot of ground across this four-part series on building an image classification project and deploying it in the real world. It all starts with the data, and by investing the time and effort into maintaining the highest quality image library, you can reach impressive levels of model performance that will gain the trust and confidence of your business partners.As a Machine Learning Engineer, you are primarily responsible for building and deploying your model. But it doesn’t stop there — dive into the data. The more familiar you are with the data, the better you will understand the strengths and weaknesses of your model. Take a close look at the evaluations and use them as an opportunity to adjust the data set.I hope these articles have helped you find new ways to improve your own machine learning project. And by the way, don’t let the machine do all the learning — as humans, our job is to continue our own learning, so don’t ever stop!Thank you for taking this deep dive with me into a data-driven approach to model optimization. I look forward to your feedback and how you can apply this to your own application.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Use language embeddings for zero-shot classification and semantic search with Amazon Bedrock</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-language-embeddings-for-zero-shot-classification-and-semantic-search-with-amazon-bedrock/</link><author>Tom Rogers</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:53:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this post, we discuss what embeddings are, show how to practically use language embeddings, and explore how to use them to add functionality such as zero-shot classification and semantic search. We then use Amazon Bedrock and language embeddings to add these features to a really simple syndication (RSS) aggregator application.Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon available through an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock offers a serverless experience, so you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and integrate and deploy them into your applications using Amazon Web Services (AWS) services without having to manage infrastructure. For this post, we use the Cohere v3 Embed model on Amazon Bedrock to create our language embeddings.To demonstrate some of the possible uses of these language embeddings, we developed an RSS aggregator website. RSS is a web feed that allows publications to publish updates in a standardized, computer-readable way. On our website, users can subscribe to an RSS feed and have an aggregated, categorized list of the new articles. We use embeddings to add the following functionalities:This post uses this application as a reference point to discuss the technical implementation of the semantic search and zero-shot classification features.This solution uses the following services:The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.This section offers a quick primer on what embeddings are and how they can be used.Embeddings are numerical representations of concepts or objects, such as language or images. In this post, we discuss language embeddings. By reducing these concepts to numerical representations, we can then use them in a way that a computer can understand and operate on.Let’s take Berlin and Paris as an example. As humans, we understand the conceptual links between these two words. Berlin and Paris are both cities, they’re capitals of their respective countries, and they’re both in Europe. We understand their conceptual similarities almost instinctively, because we can create a model of the world in our head. However, computers have no built-in way of representing these concepts.To represent these concepts in a way a computer can understand, we convert them into language embeddings. Language embeddings are high dimensional vectors that learn their relationships with each other through the training of a neural network. During training, the neural network is exposed to enormous amounts of text and learns patterns based on how words are colocated and relate to each other in different contexts.Embedding vectors allow computers to model the world from language. For instance, if we embed “Berlin” and “Paris,” we can now perform mathematical operations on these embeddings. We can then observe some fairly interesting relationships. For instance, we could do the following: Paris – France + Germany ~= Berlin. This is because the embeddings capture the relationships between the words “Paris” and “France” and between “Germany” and “Berlin”—specifically, that Paris and Berlin are both capital cities of their respective countries.The following graph shows the word vector distance between countries and their respective capitals.Subtracting “France” from “Paris” removes the country semantics, leaving a vector representing the concept of a capital city. Adding “Germany” to this vector, we are left with something closely resembling “Berlin,” the capital of Germany. The vectors for this relationship are shown in the following graph.For our use case, we use the pre-trained Cohere Embeddings model in Amazon Bedrock, which embeds entire texts rather than a single word. The embeddings represent the meaning of the text and can be operated on using mathematical operations. This property can be useful to map relationships such as similarity between texts.One way in which we use language embeddings is by using their properties to calculate how similar an article is to one of the topics.To do this, we break down a topic into a series of different and related embeddings. For instance, for culture, we have a set of embeddings for sports, TV programs, music, books, and so on. We then embed the incoming title and description of the RSS articles, and calculate the similarity against the topic embeddings. From this, we can assign topic labels to an article.The following figure illustrates how this works. The embeddings that Cohere generates are highly dimensional, containing 1,024 values (or dimensions). However, to demonstrate how this system works, we use an algorithm designed to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), so that we can view them in two dimensions. The following image uses these embeddings to visualize how topics are clustered based on similarity and meaning.You can use the embedding of an article and check the similarity of the article against the preceding embeddings. You can then say that if an article is clustered closely to one of these embeddings, it can be classified with the associated topic.This is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. This algorithm is used to perform classification and regression tasks. In k-NN, you can make assumptions around a data point based on its proximity to other data points. For instance, you can say that an article that has proximity to the music topic shown in the preceding diagram can be tagged with the culture topic.The following figure demonstrates this with an ArsTechnica article. We plot against the embedding of an article’s title and description: (The climate is changing so fast that we haven’t seen how bad extreme weather could get: Decades-old statistics no longer represent what is possible in the present day).The advantage of this approach is that you can add custom, user-generated topics. You can create a topic by first creating a series of embeddings of conceptually related items. For instance, an AI topic would be similar to the embeddings for AI, Generative AI, LLM, and Anthropic, as shown in the following screenshot.In a traditional classification system, we’d be required to train a classifier—a supervised learning task where we’d need to provide a series of examples to establish whether an article belongs to its respective topic. Doing so can be quite an intensive task, requiring labeled data and training the model. For our use case, we can provide examples, create a cluster, and tag articles without having to provide labeled examples or train additional models. This is shown in the following screenshot of results page of our website.In our application, we ingest new articles on a schedule. We use EventBridge schedules to periodically call a Lambda function, which checks if there are new articles. If there are, it creates an embedding from them using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere.We calculate the article’s distance to the different topic embeddings, and can then determine whether the article belongs to that category. This is done with Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector. We store the embeddings of the topics and then calculate their distance using the following SQL query:const topics = await sqlClient.then(it=> it.query(
    `SELECT name, embedding_description, similarity
     FROM (SELECT topic_id as name, embedding_description, (1- ABS( 1 –(embed.embedding <-> $1))) AS "similarity" FROM topic_embedding_link embed)  topics
     ORDER BY similarity desc`,
    [toSql(articleEmbedding)]
  ))
The <-> operator in the preceding code calculates the Euclidean distance between the article and the topic embedding. This number allows us to understand how close an article is to one of the topics. We can then determine the appropriateness of a topic based on this ranking.We then tag the article with the topic. We do this so that the subsequent request for a topic is as computationally as light as possible; we do a simple join rather than calculating the Euclidean distance.const formattedTopicInsert = pgformat(
    `INSERT INTO feed_article_topic_link(topic_id, feed_article_id) VALUES %L ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`,
    topicLinks
  )We also cache a specific topic/feed combination because these are calculated hourly and aren’t expected to change in the interim.As previously discussed, the embeddings produced by Cohere contain a multitude of features; they embed the meanings and semantics of a word of phrase. We’ve also found that we can perform mathematical operations on these embeddings to do things such as calculate the similarity between two phrases or words.We can use these embeddings and calculate the similarity between a search term and an embedding of an article with the k-NN algorithm to find articles that have similar semantics and meanings to the search term we’ve provided.For example, in one of our RSS feeds, we have a lot of different articles that rate products. In a traditional search system, we’d rely on keyword matches to provide relevant results. Although it might be simple to find a specific article (for example, by searching “best digital notebooks”), we would need a different method to capture multiple product list articles.In a semantic search system, we first transform the term “Product list” in an embedding. We can then use the properties of this embedding to perform a search within our embedding space. Using the k-NN algorithm, we can find articles that are semantically similar. As shown in the following screenshot, despite not containing the text “Product list” in either the title or description, we’ve been able to find articles that contain a product list. This is because we were able to capture the semantics of the query and match it to the existing embeddings we have for each article.In our application, we store these embeddings using pgvector on Aurora PostgreSQL. pgvector is an open source extension that enables vector similarity search in PostgreSQL. We transform our search term into an embedding using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere v3 Embed.After we’ve converted the search term to an embedding, we can compare it with the embeddings on the article that have been saved during the ingestion process. We can then use pgvector to find articles that are clustered together. The SQL code for that is as follows:SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT feed_articles.id as id, title, feed_articles.feed_id as feed, feedName, slug, description, url, author, image, published_at as published, 1 - ABS(1 - (embedding <-> $2)) AS "similarity"
    FROM feed_articles
    INNER JOIN (select feed_id, name as feedName from feed_user_subscription fus where fus.user_id=$1) sub on feed_articles.feed_id=sub.feed_id
    ${feedId != undefined ? `WHERE feed_articles.feed_id = $4` : ""}
)
WHERE similarity > 0.95
ORDER BY similarity desc
LIMIT $3;
This code calculates the distance between the topics, and the embedding of this article as “similarity.” If this distance is close, then we can assume that the topic of the article is related, and we therefore attach the topic to the article.To deploy this application in your own account, you need the following prerequisites:Model access for Cohere Embed English.

Also, we talked about classes and sub-classes of your data. These may seem pretty straight forward concepts, but it’s important to have a solid understanding going forward. So, if you haven’t, please check it out.Now we will discuss how to build the various data sets and the techniques that have worked well for my application. Then in the next part, we will dive into the evaluation of your models, beyond simple accuracy.I will again use the example zoo animals image classification app.As machine learning engineers, we are all familiar with the train-validation-test sets, but when we include the concept of sub-classes discussed in Part 1, and incorporate to concepts discussed below to set a minimum and maximum image count per class, as well as staged and synthetic data to the mix, the process gets a bit more complicated. I had to create a custom script to handle these options.I will walk you through these concepts before we split the data for training: — Too few images and your model performance will suffer. Too many and you spend more time training than it’s worth. — Your model indicates how confident it is in the predictions. Let’s use that to decide when to present results to the user. — Real-world data is messy and the benchmark sets should reflect that. These need to stretch the model to the limit and help us decide when it is ready for production.Staged and synthetic data — Real-world data is king, but sometimes you need to produce the your own or even generate data to get off the ground. Be careful it doesn’t hurt performance. — Repeat data can skew your results and give you a false sense of performance. Make sure your data is diverse. — Combine sub-classes, apply cutoffs, and create your train-validation-test sets. Now we are ready to get the show started.In my experience, using a minimum of 40 images per class provides descent performance. Since I like to use 10% each for the test set and validation set, that means at least 4 images will be used to check the training set, which feels just barely adequate. Using fewer than 40 images per class, I notice my model evaluation tends to suffer.On the other end, I set a maximum of about 125 images per class. I have found that the performance gains tend to plateau beyond this, so having more data will slow down the training run with little to show for it. Having more than the maximum is fine, and these “overflow” can be added to the test set, so they don’t go to waste.There are times when I will drop the minimum cutoff to, say 35, with no intention of moving the trained model to production. Instead, the purpose is to leverage this throw-away model to find more images from my unlabelled set. This is a technique that I will go into more detail in Part 3.You are likely familiar with the softmax score. As a reminder, softmax is the probability assigned to each label. I like to think of it as a confidence score, and we are interested in the class that receives the highest confidence. Softmax is a value between zero and one, but I find it easier to interpret confidence scores between zero and 100, like a percentage.In order to decide if the model is confident enough with its prediction, I have chosen a threshold of 95. I use this threshold when determining if I want to present results to the user.Scores above the threshold have a better changes of being right, so I can confidently provide the results. Scores below the threshold may not be right — in fact it could be “out-of-scope”, meaning it’s something the model doesn’t know how to identify. So, instead of taking the risk of presenting incorrect results, I instead prompt the user to try again and offer suggestions on how to take a “good” picture.Admittedly this is somewhat arbitrary cutoff, and you should decide for your use-case what is appropriate. In fact, this score could probably be adjusted for each trained model, but this would make it harder to compare performance across models.I will refer to this confidence score frequently in the evaluations section in Part 3.Let me introduce what I call the benchmark sets, which you can think of as extended test sets. These are hand-picked images designed to stretch the limits of your model, and provide a measure for specific classes of your data. Use these benchmarks to justify moving your model to production, and for an objective measure to show to your manager. — These are the “extra credit” images, like the bonus questions a professor would add to the quiz to see which students are paying attention. You need a keen eye to spot the difference between the ground truth and a similar looking class. For example, a cheetah sleeping in the shade that could pass as a leopard if you don’t look closely. — These are the “trick question” images. Our model is trained on zoo animals, but people are known for not following the rules. For example, a zoo guest takes a picture of their child wearing cheetah face paint. — These are your “bread and butter” classes that need to get near perfect scores and zero errors. This would be a make-or-break benchmark for moving to production. — These are your “rare but exceptional” classes that again need to be correct, but reach a minimum score like the confidence threshold.When looking for images to add to the benchmarks, you can likely find them in real-world images from your deployed model. See the evaluation in Part 3.For each benchmark, calculate the min, max, median, and mean scores, and also how many images get scores above and below the confidence threshold. Now you can compare these measures against what is currently in production, and against your minimum requirements, to help decide if the new model is production worthy.Perhaps the biggest hurdle to any supervised machine learning application is having data to train the model. Clearly, “real-world” data that comes from actual users of the application is ideal. However you can’t really collect these until the model is deployed. Chicken and egg problem.One way to get started to is to have volunteers collect “staged” images for you, trying to act like real users. So, let’s have our zoo staff go around taking pictures of the animals. This is a good start, but there will be a certain level of bias introduced in these images. For example, the staff may take the photos over a few days, so you may not get the year-round weather conditions.Another way to get pictures is use computer-generated “synthetic” images. I would avoid these at all costs, to be honest. Based on my experience, the model struggles with these because they look…different. The lighting is not natural, the subject may superimposed on a background and so the edges look too sharp, etc. Granted, some of the AI generated images look very realistic, but if you look closely you may spot something unusual. The neural network in your model will notice these, so be careful.The way that I handle these staged or synthetic images is as a sub-class that gets merged into the training set, but only  giving preference to the real-world images. I cap the number of staged images to 60, so if I have 10 real-world, I now only need 50 staged. Eventually, these staged and synthetic images are phased out completely, and I rely entirely on real-world.One problem that can creep into your image set are duplicate images. These can be exact copies of pictures, or they can be extremely similar. You may think that this is harmless, but imagine having 100 pictures of an elephant that are exactly the same — your model will not know what to do with a different angle of the elephant.Now, let’s say you have only  pictures that are nearly the same. Not so bad, right? Well, here is what can happen to them:Both pictures go in the training set — The model doesn’t learn anything from the repeated image and it wastes time processing them.One goes into the training set, the other goes into the test set — Your test score will be higher, but it is not an accurate evaluation.Both are in the test set — Your test score will be compounded either higher or lower than it should be.None of these will help your model.There are a few ways to find duplicates. The approach I have taken is to calculate a hamming distance on all the pictures and identify the ones that are very close. I have an interface that displays the duplicates and I decide which one I like best, and remove the other.Another way (I haven’t tried this yet) is to create a vector representation of your images. Store these a vector database, and you can do a similarity search to find nearly identical images.Whatever method you use, it is important to clean up the duplicates.Now we are ready to build the traditional training, validation, and test sets. This is no longer a straight forward task since I want to:Merge sub-classes into a main class.Prioritize real-world images over staged or synthetic images.Apply a minimum number of images per class.Apply a maximum number of images per class, sending the “overflow” to the test set.This process is somewhat complicated and depends on how you manage your image library. First, I would recommend keeping your images in a folder structure that has sub-class folders. You can get image counts by using a script to simply read the folders. Second is to keep a configuration of how the sub-classes are merged. To really set yourself up for success, put these image counts and merge rules in a database for faster lookups.My train-validation-test set splits are usually 90–10–0. I originally started out using 80–10–10, but with diligence on keeping the entire data set clean, I noticed validation and test scores became pretty even. This allowed me to increase the training set size, and use “overflow” to become the test set, as well as using the benchmark sets.In this part, we’ve built our data sets by merging sub-classes and using the image count cutoffs. Plus we handle staged and synthetic data as well as cleaning up duplicate images. We also created benchmark sets and defined confidence thresholds, which help us decide when to move a model to production.In Part 3, we will discuss how we are going to evaluate the different model performances. And then finally we will get to the actual model training and the techniques to enhance accuracy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nearly a Year Later, Mozilla is Still Promoting OneRep</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/nearly-a-year-later-mozilla-is-still-promoting-onerep/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>Krebs on Security</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:14:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In mid-March 2024, KrebsOnSecurity revealed that the founder of the personal data removal service  also founded dozens of people-search companies. Shortly after that investigation was published,  said it would stop bundling Onerep with the  browser and wind down its partnership with the company. But nearly a year later, Mozilla is still promoting it to Firefox users.Mozilla offers Onerep to Firefox users on a subscription basis as part of Mozilla Monitor Plus. Launched in 2018 under the name Firefox Monitor, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website Have I Been Pwned? to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.The ink on that partnership agreement had barely dried before KrebsOnSecurity published a story showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder  launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called  that sells background reports on people. This seemed to contradict Onerep’s stated motto, “We believe that no one should compromise personal online security and get a profit from it.”Shelest released a lengthy statement (PDF) wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in , a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he started Onerep.Onerep.com CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest, as pictured on the “about” page of onerep.com.Shelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.“I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.”When asked to comment on the findings, Mozilla said then that although customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep’s CEO did not align with their values.“We’re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first,” Mozilla said.In October 2024, Mozilla published a statement saying the search for a different provider was taking longer than anticipated.“While we continue to evaluate vendors, finding a technically excellent and values-aligned partner takes time,” Mozilla wrote. “While we continue this search, Onerep will remain the backend provider, ensuring that we can maintain uninterrupted services while we continue evaluating new potential partners that align more closely with Mozilla’s values and user expectations. We are conducting thorough diligence to find the right vendor.”Asked for an update, Mozilla said the search for a replacement partner continues.“The work’s ongoing but we haven’t found the right alternative yet,” Mozilla said in an emailed statement. “Our customers’ data remains safe, and since the product provides a lot of value to our subscribers, we’ll continue to offer it during this process.”It’s a win-win for Mozilla that they’ve received accolades for their principled response while continuing to partner with Onerep almost a year later. But if it takes so long to find a suitable replacement, what does that say about the personal data removal industry itself?Onerep appears to be working in partnership with another problematic people-search service: , which has a history of ignoring opt-out requests or failing to honor them. A week before breaking the story about Onerep, KrebsOnSecurity published research showing the co-founders of Radaris were two native Russian brothers who’d built a vast network of affiliate marketing programs and consumer data broker services.Lawyers for the Radaris co-founders threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that story was retracted in full, claiming the founders were in fact Ukrainian and that our reporting had defamed the brothers by associating them with the actions of Radaris. Instead, we published a follow-up investigation which showed that not only did the brothers from Russia create Radaris, for many years they issued press releases quoting a fictitious CEO seeking money from investors.Several readers have shared emails they received from Radaris after attempting to remove their personal data, and those messages show Radaris has been promoting Onerep.An email from Radaris promoting Onerep.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bcachefs Freezes Its On-Disk Format With Future Updates Optional</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Bcachefs-On-Disk-Format-Freeze</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 19:18:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest round of Bcachefs file-system fixes have been submitted today for the in-development Linux 6.14 kernel.

Section 230 embodies that principle that we should all be responsible for our own actions and statements online, but generally not those of others. The law prevents most civil suits against users or services that are based on what others say.The correspondence among DOJ officials shows that the group delayed unveiling the agency’s official plans to amend Section 230 in light of Trump’s executive order, which was challenged on First Amendment grounds and later rescinded by President Joe Biden. EFF represented the groups who challenged Trump’s Executive Order and filed two FOIA suits for records about the administration’s implementation of the order.In the most recent FOIA case, the DOJ has been slowly releasing records detailing its work to propose amendments to Section 230, which predated Trump’s Executive Order. The DOJ released the text of its proposed amendments to Section 230 in September 2020, and the proposal would have substantially narrowed the law’s protections.For example, the DOJ’s proposal would have allowed federal civil suits and state and federal criminal prosecutions against online services if they learned that users’ content broke the law. It also would have established notice-and-takedown liability for user-generated content that was deemed to be illegal. Together, these provisions would likely result in online services screening and removing a host of legal content, based on a fear that any questionable material might trigger liability later.The DOJ’s proposal had a distinct emphasis on imposing liability on services should they have hosted illegal content posted by their users. That focus was likely the result of the team DOJ assembled to work on the proposal, which included officials from the agency’s cybercrime division and the FBI.The documents also show that DOJ officials met with attorneys who brought lawsuits against online services to get their perspective on Section 230. This is not surprising, as the DOJ had been meeting with multiple groups throughout 2020 while it prepared a report about Section 230.EFF’s FOIA suit is ongoing, as the DOJ has said that it still has thousands of potential pages to review and possibly release. Although these documents reflect DOJ’s activity from Trump’s first term, they are increasingly relevant as the administration appoints officials who have previously threatened online intermediaries for exercising their own First Amendment rights. EFF will continue to publish all documents released in this FOIA suit and push back on attempts to undermine internet users’ rights to speak online.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lawyers Caught Citing AI-Hallucinated Cases Call It a &apos;Cautionary Tale&apos;</title><link>https://www.404media.co/lawyers-caught-citing-ai-hallucinated-cases-call-it-a-cautionary-tale/</link><author>Samantha Cole</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/photo-1620424393934-04e772be09f4.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:33:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">Dev - 404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After a judge called out a law firm for citing fake cases in court documents, the attorneys admitted to AI “hallucinating” the cases. In a court order filed last week, Wyoming District Judge Kelly Rankin demanded the attorneys explain why they shouldn’t be sanctioned or disciplined for citing made-up information, including referencing eight non-existent cases. , first filed in 2023, is against Walmart and Jetson Electronic Bikes, Inc., which makes hoverboards for sale at Walmart. The plaintiffs, including a woman, her husband, and four minor children, claim a Jetson hoverboard’s lithium ion battery malfunctioned and caught fire while they were sleeping and burned their house down, severely injuring several members of the family.In a motion in limine filed by the plaintiff’s attorneys in January, they cited multiple cases (a "motion in limine" is a pretrial motion where attorneys request specific evidence or arguments be excluded from presentation during the trial) that don’t exist. “The cases are not identifiable by their Westlaw cite, and the Court cannot locate the District of Wyoming cases by their case name in its local Electronic Court Filing System,” Rankin wrote. She demanded each of the attorneys “provide a thorough explanation for how the motion and fake cases were generated,” and “explain their role in drafting or supervising the motion.” Four days later, they responded: “Our internal artificial intelligence platform ‘hallucinated’ the cases in question while assisting our attorney in drafting the motion in limine,” the law firm said in a filed response. “This matter comes with great embarrassment and has prompted discussion and action regarding the training, implementation, and future use of artificial intelligence within our firm. This serves as a cautionary tale for our firm and all firms, as we enter this new age of artificial intelligence.” Lawyers increasingly use AI tools for research and analyzing documents. But this isn’t the first time using AI to draft legal cases has gotten lawyers in trouble. In 2022, a man filed an action alleging he was injured by an Avianca airlines metal serving cart during an Avianca Airlines flight. His lawyers cited non-existent cases, and instead of admitting it and apologizing immediately, they doubled down and defended the filings. Eventually, they were fined $5,000 for fabricating the case,  that they “abandoned their responsibilities when they submitted non-existent judicial opinions with fake quotes and citations created by the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, then continued to stand by the fake opinions after judicial orders called their existence into question.” And , disbarred former celebrity attorney Michael Cohen gave his own lawyer, David Schwartz fake case citations generated by Google Bard. Cohen and Schwartz weren’t fined, but the judge who let them off without discipline did call the error “embarrassing” for them. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coding Interviews were HARD Until I Learned These 20 Tips</title><link>https://blog.algomaster.io/p/20-coding-interviews-tips</link><author>Ashish Pratap Singh</author><category>dev</category><category>blog</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61c3f6c0-4027-4d37-b4a7-a30fc183fa12_1602x1032.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:30:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.algomaster.io/">Algomaster</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I gave my first  in 2016—and failed.

The real game-changer was my approach— and  during the interview.In this article, I’ll share  that made coding interviews significantly easier for me.These tips cover everything you need to know, including:How to systematically approach coding interview problemsKey concepts and patterns you should knowThe type of problems you should practiceHow to choose the right algorithm for a given problemTechniques to optimize your solutionHow to communicate your thought process effectivelyBy applying these strategies, you’ll be able to tackle coding interviews with confidence and massively increase your chances of success.In a coding interview, interviewers want to see how well you , , and  under pressure.Here's a breakdown of what they look for:Understanding the problem: Do you ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions to ensure you fully understand the problem?: Can you decompose the problem into smaller, manageable parts?: Can you design an optimal solution in terms of time and space complexity?: Do you handle edge cases like empty inputs, duplicates, large values, or special conditions?: Can you explain why one approach is better than another?: Do you have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, and can you choose the right one for the problem?Can you quickly compute the time and space complexity of your solution?Explaining your thought process: Can you clearly articulate your approach and why it works?: Are you receptive to hints and able to adjust your approach accordingly?: Do you follow good coding practices (meaningful variable names, proper indentation, modular functions etc..)?Improving the initial solution: Can you optimize and refine your first solution when prompted?Are you able to tackle variations of the original problem?Can you manually walk through your code with sample inputs to verify correctness?Most coding interviews last Depending on the company and interviewer, you may be asked to solve 2-3easy/medium problems or 1 hard problem with follow-ups.Lets assume you are given one problem, with a follow up in a 45-minute interview. Here’s how you can optimally allocate your time:The interviewer may ask you to introduce yourself. Prepare a concise 1-2 minute introduction that highlights your background, experience, and key strengths. Practice it beforehand so that you can deliver it smoothly.Understand the Problem (5-10 mins):  Carefully read the problem statement, ask clarifying questions, and walk through sample inputs and expected outputs.Plan the Approach (10-20 mins): Brainstorm possible solutions, evaluate trade-offs, and discuss time and space complexity.Implement the Code (20-30 mins): Write a clean, modular and readable code.Dry-run your code with sample inputs, debug any issues, and ensure edge cases are handled.Follow-ups and Wrap Up (35-45 mins): Answer follow up questions, and ask thoughtful questions to the interviewer about the company, role, or team.One of the biggest mistakes candidates make in coding interviews is jumping into coding too soon.If you don't fully understand the question, you might end up solving the Here’s how to ensure you grasp the problem before coding:Read the Problem CarefullyTake a moment to absorb the problem statement. Rephrase it in your own words to confirm your understanding. Identify the expected input/output format and any hidden constraints.If anything is unclear, ask questions before diving into the solution. Interviewers appreciate when you seek clarity. Never assume details that aren’t explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.Common clarifications include:Are there duplicate values?Can the input be empty? If so, what should the output be?Should the solution handle negative numbers?Should the output maintain the original order of elements?Is the graph directed or undirected?Does the input contain only lowercase English letters, or can it have uppercase, digits, or special characters?What should happen if multiple solutions exist? Should I return any valid solution, or does the problem have specific requirements?Walk Through Input/Output ExamplesOnce you understand the problem statement and constraints, go over a few input and output examples to make sure you get it.Draw them out if it helps, especially for visual data structures like trees or graphs.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios of the problem. Think about any  that might come up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_izoDLdUW0</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>Darknet diaries</category><category>infosec</category><category>video</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n_izoDLdUW0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Jack Rhysider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications

Introduction 2. Terraform Architecture4. Terraform Best Practices6. ReferencesInfrastructure as Code (IaC), is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure by writing code instead of the manual processes , “ClickOps”. IaC can be described as a mindset where you treat all aspects of operations (servers, databases, networks) as software. When you define your infrastructure using code , it enables you to automate and use all the best practices of software development. IaC eliminates human errors , speeds up infrastructure deployments and ensures infrastructure is version-controlled, just like software code.Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp and the most popular and widely used IaC tool used by DevOps, SREs and cloud architects. Terraform is widely used because of it’s declarative syntax, platform agnostic and its simplicity. Understanding how terraform works behind the hood will go along way to help you in write better terraform code.In this article, we will explore Terraform architecture, its core components, and how it orchestrates infrastructure provisioning efficiently.2. Terraform ArchitectureTerraform follows a standard architecture to fulfill the necessary IaC tasks. Terraform architecture mainly consists of the following components: 1 Terraform core 2 Plugins (Providers and Provisioners) Terraform core is the engine/brain behind how terraform works. It is responsible for reading configurations files , building the dependency graphs from resources and data sources, managing state and applying changes. Terraform Core does not directly interact with cloud providers but communicates with plugins via remote procedure calls (RPCs) and the plugins in turn communicates with their corresponding platforms via HTTPs.Plugins (Providers and Provisioners)Terraform ability is enhance by plugins, which enable terraform to interact with cloud services and configure resources dynamically. Plugins acts as connectors or the glue between terraform and external APIs such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker etc. Each plugin is written in the Go programming language and implements a specific interface. Terraform core knows how to install and execute plugins. Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or commands on a resource after it has been created or modified.State is one of the most important core components of Terraform. Terraform state is a record about all the infrastructure and resources it created. It is a costumed JSON file that terraform uses to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures. By default, state is stored in a local file named “terraform.tfstate”. You can read more about terraform state here There are two ways to manage state: Local State refers to the default way by which Terraform stores state files (terraform.tfstate). It is suitable for small-scale projects or development environments and single person managing Terraform.Remote State refers to storing the Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) in a remote backend rather than locally on your machine. This enables collaboration, prevents state loss, and supports features like state locking and versioning. Some common remote backends include AWS S3,Terraform Cloud, Azure Blob Storage etc. More on Remote StateTerraform follows a structured execution flow to provision, update, and manage infrastructure. This process ensures that infrastructure is deployed in a controlled and predictable manner. Terraform workflow consist of mainly three steps: The first step is to write your terraform configuration just like any other code using any editor of your choice. This is the step where you review your configurations. Terraform plan will define the infrastructure to be created, modified, or destroyed depending on the current configuration and infrastructure. The final step in the workflow is Apply, where you are ready to provision real infrastructure. Once you approve of the changes ,terraform will go ahead perform the desired actions as defined execution.4. Terraform Best Practices1. You should never edit the Terraform state files by hand or write code that reads them directly. If for some reason you need to manipulate the state file which should be a relatively rare occurrence, use the terraform import or terraform state commands.2. It’s a good practice to store your work in a version controlled repository even when you’re just operating as an individual.3. When working as a team, it’s important to delegate ownership of infrastructure across these teams and empower them to work in parallel without conflicts.4. Never Store your state file in a version controlled repository.5. Always use state locking on your state files to prevent data loss, conflicts and state file corruption.6. Integrate Terraform to your CI/CD pipelines to make your DevOps pipeline efficient.Well well, we have come to the end of this deep dive into terraform Architecture.

Think of an API like a waiter in a restaurant — customers (the client application) don’t need to know how the kitchen (the server) prepares their food; they need to know how to place their order through the waiter (the API).I designed and developed an e-commerce web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end,  for the back end, and  for the database. I will use this as an example to explain the core concepts of APIs.E-commerce Web Application API Flow Chart:To check the complete source code:APIs in the E-Commerce ApplicationThis E-Commerce application consists of the following API endpoints:1. Authentication API (auth_routes): /api/auth/login (POST) → Authenticates users and starts a session.: /api/auth/logout (POST) → Clears session and logs out users.2. Product API (product_routes): /api/products (GET) → Returns a list of products.: /api/products/<int:product_id> (GET) → Fetches details of a specific product.3. Cart API (cart_routes): /api/cart (GET) → Returns the current user's cart.: /api/cart (POST) → Adds a product to the cart.: /api/cart/<int:item_id> (DELETE) → Removes an item from the cart.4. Order API (order_routes): /api/orders (POST) → Places an order with the items in the cart.: /api/orders/<int:order_id> (GET) → Fetches details of a specific order.: /api/health (GET) → Provides API uptime, session data, and frontend path.: /<path:filename> (GET) → Serves frontend files.: / (GET) → Serves index.html or API running message.: Handles missing resources.500 Internal Server Error: Handles unexpected issues.: Handles invalid requests.An API consists of several key components that work together:These are the URLs where the  can be accessed. Similar to a , each endpoint serves a specific purpose. For example,📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/products → Retrieves a list of available products.📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/cart → Fetches the current user's shopping cart details.📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/orders → Handles order-related operations.These actions can be performed on the allowed endpoints. They’re like verbs telling the API what to do with the data. → Read data (View products, orders, cart items). → Create new data (Add product, register user, place order). → Update existing data (Update profile, modify cart quantity). → Remove data (Delete cart item, cancel order). Additional data is sent to fine-tune the API request, such as specifying which page of results you want to see.: Parameters are extra details added to an API request to filter or refine the results.Fetch  of products:GET /api/products?category=laptopsSecurity measures ensure that only authorized users can access the API.: Ensures that only authorized users can access the API.When a user logs in, the API gives a :{  "message": "Login successful",  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUz..."}To add a product to the cart, the request must include this :POST /api/cart/addAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUz... Prevents unauthorized access and protects user data. The structure of the data returned by the API, commonly in formats like JSON or XML.: The structure of the data sent back by the API. (because it’s easy to read and use).{  "id": 1,  "price": 799.99,} Frontend uses this data to display products to users.APIs are classified according to their usage patterns and architectures.API Types According to Purposes of Use🔹  — Used within a company, hidden from public access. Helps teams share data securely.🔹  — Available to everyone, can be free or paid. Example: Google Maps API.🔹  — Used between business partners for secure data exchange. Example: E-commerce & shipping company integration.🔹  — Combines multiple APIs into one request for efficiency. Example: Fetching account balance + transaction history in one call.API Types According to Architectural Structure:1. Web APIs (HTTP/HTTPS APIs)These are the most common APIs, operating over the internet using HTTP protocols. They come in several varieties:1.1. REST (Representational State Transfer):The most popular type of web API today. REST APIs follow these principles:Stateless: Each request contains all the information neededResource-based: Everything is treated as a resource with a unique URLUses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)Supports multiple data formats (usually JSON)Example REST API Request in an E-Commerce Web Application:This request fetches all available products from the online store.✅ Request (Client → Server)GET /api/products HTTP/1.1Host: api.ecommerce.comAuthorization: Bearer <User_Token>Content-Type: application/json✅ Response (Server → Client)[    {"id": 1, "name": "iPhone 15", "price": 999.99, "stock": 20},    {"id": 2, "name": "Samsung Galaxy S24", "price": 899.99, "stock": 15}]catalog.html Fetches and Displays Products1️⃣ User Visits catalog.htmlThe user opens the  page in their browser (http://52.90.222.178:5000/catalog.html).The browser  to fetch product data.2️⃣ Frontend (JavaScript) Sends an API RequestJavaScript code in catalog.html makes a GET request to the  /api/products.3️⃣ Backend API (GET /api/products) Fetches DataThe get_all_products() function runs when the frontend calls /api/products.4️⃣ Database Retrieves Product InformationThe backend queries the  in the databaseExample database response:[    {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "price": 799.99},    {"id": 2, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 499.99}]5️⃣ Frontend Renders Product Data in catalog.htmlThe JavaScript loops through the  and dynamically  to display products.<div class="product-card">  <h3>Laptop</h3>  <button onclick="addToCart(1)">Add to Cart</button><div class="product-card">  <p>Price: $499.99</p>  <button onclick="addToCart(2)">Add to Cart</button></div>1.2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):SOAP has strict rules and rigid messaging standards that can make it more secure than protocols such as REST.

Instead of maintaining multiple endpoints with small amounts of disjointed data, GraphQL provides a single endpoint that inputs complex queries and outputs only as much information as is needed for the query.query {  user(id: "123") {    email      title  }These are programming interfaces provided by software libraries or frameworks:Used directly in your codeNo network requests are neededUsually specific to a programming languageExample using a Python library API:import pandas as pd# Using pandas API to read a CSV filedf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')These allow applications to interact with the operating system:Example using Python’s OS API:import os# Using OS API to create a directoryos.mkdir('new_folder')The foundation of web APIs, using well-defined methods and status codes:PUT: Update existing dataPATCH: Partially update data2xx: Success (e.g., 200 OK)Enables real-time, two-way communication:Ideal for chat apps and live updatesExample WebSocket connection:const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/chat');ws.onmessage = (event) => {    console.log('Received:', event.data);};gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a  framework for inter-service communication in microservices architecture.

POST: Creates new resourcesThe  method is a request used to insert data. Posted data type — JSON.✅ Authentication EndpointsThis is handled in auth_routes.py, prefixed with /api/auth. → The frontend sends a request to the backend API (POST /api/auth/login). This is handled in auth_routes.py, prefixed with /api/auth.User sends a  with username & password.If credentials are valid:The user session is stored.API returns a success message.3. If credentials are invalid:API returns 3. PUT : Updates existing resourcesPUT method is used to create or update (replace) a resource. Useful for syncing data.Ex: We can add a “Change Password” feature for an existing user using a PUT /api/auth/change-password API endpoint.Steps to Implement “Change Password” APIPUT request with their old and new password.curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/auth/change-password      -H "Content-Type: app     -d '{"old_password": "currentPass123", "new_password": "newPass456"}'2. API verifies the old password:If incorrect, return an error (401 Unauthorized).3. If correct, update the password in the database.4. Save the new password (after hashing it for security).5. Return a success message.{"message": "Password changed successfully"}In an e-commerce application like yours, a PUT method would typically be used in: → PUT /api/auth/update-profileUpdating Product Information (Admin) → PUT /api/products/<product_id> → PUT /api/cart/<cart_id> → PUT /api/orders/<order_id>4. DELETE: Removes resourcesThe DELETE method deletes the specified resource./api/cart API to Remove a Product from the Cart1️⃣ Endpoint Definition (Flask API):@cart_bp.route('/cart', methods=['DELETE'])def remove_from_cart():    Remove a product from the cart for the logged-in user.    Expects JSON payload: { product_id }.

(if missing, returns 400 Bad Request). to remove the product from the cart_items table.If the product does not exist, it returns 404 Not Found., it commits the transaction and returns a success message (200 OK).Handles database errors and ensures the connection is closed.3️⃣ Example API Request & Response:Now User wanted to delete iPhone 15 Pro from the cart:Click the  button under “iPhone 15 Pro”.The item should disappear, and the cart total should update.Run this command in the terminal:curl -X DELETE http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/cart      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -H "Cookie: session=00068d4c-4b41-4e3e-8884-7389cabbb9b0"     -d '{"product_id": 4}'{    "message": "Product removed from cart successfully"After deletion of that item:5. PATCH: Partially updates resourcesPATCH method is to request used to update data. Only passed data will be updated. You don’t need to provide all the data set.The  method is used to  a resource. Instead of sending the entire data set, we only send the fields that need to be updated.Use Case: Updating a User’s Profile (PATCH /api/auth/update-profile)Imagine a user wants to update  or  without changing their username.1️⃣ PATCH Endpoint: PATCH /api/auth/update-profile2️⃣ Sending a PATCH RequestIf the user wants to update curl -X PATCH http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/auth/update-profile \     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \     -H "Cookie: session=your_valid_session_id" \     -d '{"email": "newemail@example.com"}'🔹 Only the  field will be updated.✅ {    "message": "Profile updated successfully"❌ If no fields are provided:{    "message": "No valid fields provided for update"{    "message": "User not authenticated"4️⃣ Why Use PATCH Instead of PUT?Conclusion: Understanding APIs, Endpoints, and Methods in Web DevelopmentAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different systems to  with each other. They define how requests and responses are exchanged between a client (browser, app) and a server.An  acts as a bridge between two applications, enabling data exchange.Example: A shopping website uses an API to fetch product details from a database.An  is a URL that clients use to request or send data.Example: GET /api/products retrieves all products. → Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage data. → Lets clients request specific data fields, reducing unnecessary data transfer. → Uses XML messaging, mainly in enterprise applications. → Maintains a continuous connection for real-time updates (e.g., live chat).Use  (JWT, API Keys, OAuth) to restrict access.Protect sensitive data with .Implement  to prevent abuse.APIs are the backbone of modern applications, enabling data sharing between different services.

Ensuring its availability and data persistence is crucial for uninterrupted CI/CD pipelines. In this guide, we’ll walk through deploying Jenkins in Kubernetes, configuring its resources, and setting up persistent storage to safeguard critical data.In this configuration, we have a Deployment resource for deploying Jenkins in Kubernetes, along with associated PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), PersistentVolume (PV), Service, and StorageClass resources. Let’s break down each partkind: StorageClassapiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1  name: localstorageprovisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisionervolumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumerThis StorageClass resource defines storage provisioning and management policies.Since provisioner is set to kubernetes.io/no-provisioner, it indicates that no dynamic provisioning is performed by Kubernetes.volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer ensures that volume binding waits for the first Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim to be created.PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Resource:apiVersion: v1kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  name: pvc-jenkinsspec:  storageClassName: localstorage  accessModes:  resources:      storage: 2GiThis PVC resource requests storage from a PersistentVolume using the localstorage StorageClass.It requests 2Gi of storage with access mode ReadWriteOnce, meaning it can be mounted as read-write by a single node.PersistentVolume (PV) Resource:apiVersion: v1kind: PersistentVolume  name: pv-jenkins    type: local  claimRef:    namespace: jenkins    storage: 3Gi    - ReadWriteOnce    path: /mnt  storageClassName: localstorageThis PV resource represents the actual storage volume available for use by the PVC.It is bound to the PVC pvc-jenkins within the jenkins namespace.The PV has a capacity of 3Gi and is accessible in ReadWriteOnce mode.The storage is provided by a hostPath /mnt on the host machine, with storage class localstorage.apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: jenkins-deployment    name: jenkinsspec:    matchLabels:  replicas: 1    metadata:      labels:    spec:        - name: deployment-jenkins          image: jenkins/jenkins:lts          resources:              memory: "0.5Gi"            requests:              cpu: "125m"            - name: http-port            - name: jnlp-port          livenessProbe:              path: "/login"            initialDelaySeconds: 60            timeoutSeconds: 5          readinessProbe:              path: "/login"            initialDelaySeconds: 60            timeoutSeconds: 5          volumeMounts:              mountPath: /var/jenkins_home        - name: data-jenkins            claimName: pvc-jenkins        runAsUser: 0        fsGroup: 0This Deployment resource defines how Jenkins is deployed.It specifies a single replica (replicas: 1) of the Jenkins container.The container is based on the jenkins/jenkins:lts image.Resource limits and requests for CPU and memory are set to ensure resource allocation.Ports 8080 and 50000 are exposed for HTTP and JNLP respectively.Liveness and readiness probes are configured to check the health of the container.The Jenkins home directory (/var/jenkins_home) is mounted to a PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc-jenkins) named data-jenkins.SecurityContext ensures that Jenkins runs with the appropriate user and group permissions. securityContext:        runAsUser: 0        fsGroup: 0When you deploy this deployment instance in kubernetes cluster, make sure the user have the right privileges to read and write the host volume For this demo purpose, I am using the root user to do this task, but this is not encouraged to do in real environment.apiVersion: v1kind: Service  name: jenkins-servicespec:    app: jenkins-pod  ports:      port: 8080      nodePort: 32000This Service resource exposes the Jenkins deployment internally within the jenkins namespace.It selects pods with the label app: jenkins-pod.The service type is NodePort, making the service accessible from outside the cluster on each node's IP at a static port (nodePort: 32000).Port 8080 is mapped to the targetPort 8080 where Jenkins is listening.Once you execute all the manifiest file in kubernetes cluster.Check the host volume path ls -al /mntExecute the below command to see the whether the same files are present in the jenkins containerkubectl exec -it POD_NAME /bin/bash -n jenkinsls -al /var/jenkins_homeThis configuration sets up Jenkins deployment in Kubernetes with persistence using a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim. It ensures that Jenkins data stored in /var/jenkins_home persists across container restarts and pod rescheduling. Additionally, the Service resource exposes Jenkins for external access within the Kubernetes cluster.For now, that’s it guys, If you like this article don’t forget to give a clap. 👏]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Build and Deploy a Simple Frontend App with Python Backend</title><link>https://blog.devops.dev/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-simple-frontend-app-with-python-backend-108b505be2be?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4</link><author>krth1k</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:50:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.devops.dev/?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4">Devops.dev blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building a full-stack web application might seem daunting, especially if you’re primarily a backend developer.

However, this shared structure introduces complexities in managing access and authorization. A robust authorization strategy is essential to ensure that users can only access resources belonging to their tenant without compromising scalability or performance.This article explores the best practices and technical solutions that we adopt at Xinthe, for implementing efficient authorization mechanisms in multi-tenant systems, with a focus on nested resource structures, such as companies, clients, projects, and tasks. After having read this entire article, you will be armed with actionable insights to build secure, efficient, and future-proof authorization strategies for multi-tenant applications.Understanding Multi-Tenant Database AuthorizationDefinition Of Multi-TenancyMulti-tenancy refers to an architectural pattern where a single instance of a software application and its database serves multiple tenants (e.g., companies, organizations, or users). Each tenant’s data remains logically isolated, ensuring that no tenant can access another’s data, while sharing underlying resources for efficiency.Key Multi-Tenancy Models:Each tenant has a dedicated database or schema.Offers strong isolation and security.Higher costs and maintenance complexity due to multiple instances.Multiple tenants share the same database.Logical separation is maintained through identifiers (e.g., tenant_id or company_id).Cost-effective and scalable but requires robust authorization mechanisms.Challenges Of AuthorizationImplementing authorization in multi-tenant systems is a non-trivial task, especially as the scale and complexity of resources grow. Common challenges include -Cross-Tenant Data Leakage:Risk: Improper queries or configurations can expose data to unauthorized tenants.Example: A user from Company A inadvertently accessing tasks belonging to Company B due to a missing or incorrect WHERE clause.Deeply nested resource structures often require joins across multiple tables.Queries with extensive joins can degrade performance as data volume increases.Scalability & Maintainability:The need to balance fast access controls with a maintainable schema.Adding new authorization rules or resource types without overhauling the system.Data Localization & Compliance:For multi-tenant systems spanning regions, ensuring that tenant data complies with regulations like GDPR can complicate authorization logic.Importance Of Nested Resource StructuresIn many applications, resources are interconnected in a hierarchical fashion. Consider the following nested structure -Company → Client → Project → TaskA  has multiple .Each  manages several .Each  contains multiple .Why Nested Structures Matter:Access Control Complexity: Permissions must flow through the hierarchy (e.g., a user’s access to a task must be verified against their company). Hierarchical access often necessitates multiple joins, impacting query efficiency. Hierarchical structures reflect real-world use cases like SaaS platforms, where users must operate within their organization’s boundaries.A user from Company A should only edit tasks within their projects. Authorization must ensure that the task → project → client → company linkage is maintained without exposing data from Company B.Comparing Authorization ApproachesWhen implementing authorization in a multi-tenant database, there are three common strategies to choose from: the , the , and Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables. Each comes with its own set of benefits and trade-offs. Let’s break them down -1. Flat Model (Adding Tenant IDs)In this approach, a tenant_id or company_id is added to every resource table (e.g., tasks, projects, clients), enabling direct filtering for authorization. Queries can directly filter by tenant_id without traversing the hierarchy.SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id AND id = :task_id; Reduces query complexity by avoiding multiple table joins to enforce access. Straightforward implementation makes it easy to debug and maintain. tenant_id is replicated across multiple tables, introducing redundancy. Adding tenant_id and other metadata can lead to bloated schemas, especially as the number of attributes grows. Schema updates (e.g., adding new relationships) might require extensive changes across multiple tables.Ideal for systems where performance is critical and the schema is relatively stable, such as SaaS platforms with many small tenants.2. Hierarchical Model (Enforcing Relationships)In this approach, the relationships between resources (e.g., task → project → client → company) are strictly enforced through foreign keys. Authorization is achieved by traversing the hierarchy. Avoids redundant fields by relying on inherent relationships.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id),    ...    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    client_id INT REFERENCES clients(id),    ...    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    company_id INT REFERENCES companies(id),    ... Reduces duplication of metadata like tenant_id.Relationship-Centric Queries: Makes it easier to enforce hierarchical constraints and maintain referential integrity. Queries require multiple joins to verify access, which can impact performance.SELECT t.*FROM tasks tJOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.idJOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.idWHERE c.company_id = :tenant_id AND t.id = :task_id; Deep hierarchies with large datasets can significantly increase query execution time. As the hierarchy grows, maintaining performance becomes challenging.Suitable for applications where maintaining strict relationships between resources is essential, such as ERP systems or large enterprise applications.3. Tenant-Specific Databases Or TablesThis approach creates separate databases or tables for each tenant, isolating their data entirely. Each tenant’s data can be managed independently, making it easier to scale horizontally by distributing databases across servers. Ensures complete data isolation, reducing the risk of cross-tenant data leakage. Simplifies adherence to regulations like GDPR by enabling tenant-specific backups, retention policies, and deletions. Managing multiple databases or schemas requires sophisticated deployment and CI/CD pipelines. Schema updates need to be applied consistently across all tenant databases. For tenants with small datasets, the resource consumption of separate databases might be inefficient.Best for large organizations with high regulatory or security requirements, or when dealing with tenants that require dedicated resources (e.g., enterprise customers).Summary Table — Comparing ApproachesCriteria For Choosing An Authorization ModelSelecting the right authorization model for a multi-tenant database is critical for ensuring scalability, performance, and compliance. The decision hinges on a combination of technical, regulatory, and operational factors. Below are the primary criteria to consider -The level of traffic and query complexity your application handles directly impacts the choice of an authorization model.High-Traffic Applications:Benefit from simpler and faster queries, such as those enabled by the .SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id AND id = :task_id;Minimal joins mean lower query latency, ensuring the system performs well under heavy loads.Suitable for SaaS platforms or e-commerce systems with a high volume of tenant interactions.:Can afford the  with more joins, as performance trade-offs are less significant.Allows for cleaner schema designs and strict relational integrity.Suitable for internal enterprise tools or smaller-scale applications.2. Regulatory RequirementsCompliance with data protection and privacy regulations often dictates how data is stored and accessed.Using Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables simplifies compliance for regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.Tenant isolation reduces the risk of data leakage and ensures tenant-specific data retention and deletion policies.An enterprise customer requires dedicated storage with separate backups and audit logs.A  can still meet compliance needs with appropriate access controls and audit mechanisms.Challenges arise in managing and enforcing tenant-specific data governance policies within shared infrastructure.The ability to handle growth in the number of tenants and data volumes is a critical factor.Planning For Tenant Growth:For a rapidly scaling user base, Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables provide the most flexibility -Each tenant can be distributed across servers to balance load.Tenant databases can be independently scaled based on specific needs.A B2B SaaS platform serving both small businesses and large enterprises can allocate resources dynamically based on tenant size.The  can handle larger datasets more efficiently as indexes on tenant_id make filtering faster.The  may struggle as table sizes grow, requiring optimization for complex joins.Ease of schema management and updates is essential for long-term maintainability.Simplified Schema Updates:The  simplifies schema updates by centralizing data attributes like tenant_id.However, redundant fields may increase the risk of errors during updates.The  enforces relational integrity, ensuring data consistency.Complex queries for nested structures may require more effort to maintain and optimize.Automated CI/CD Pipelines:For Tenant-Specific Databases, CI/CD automation becomes critical to manage schema changes across multiple databases.Tools like Octopus Deploy or Liquibase can help automate schema migrations and ensure consistency.Key Considerations SummaryDesigning Authorization Strategies For Multi-TenancyDesigning robust authorization strategies for multi-tenant systems requires careful consideration of schema design, indexing, and data partitioning to ensure scalability, security, and performance. This section outlines best practices for implementing these strategies effectively.The foundation of a successful multi-tenant authorization system lies in a well-thought-out schema.Add a tenant_id column to all relevant tables (e.g., clients, projects, tasks) for direct tenant filtering.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id));Ensure tenant_id is a mandatory field in all write operations to enforce multi-tenancy constraints.Defining Relationships In Hierarchical Structures:Maintain strict referential integrity between hierarchical entities.Example for hierarchical relationships -CREATE TABLE projects (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id)Flat schema enables quick lookups for tenant-specific data.Hierarchical relationships ensure data consistency and logical separation.2. Indexing Best PracticesIndexes are essential for optimizing queries in multi-tenant systems. However, improper indexing can lead to inefficiencies.Compound Indexes For Tenant-Specific Queries:Use composite indexes combining tenant_id with frequently queried columns.CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_tenant_projectON tasks (tenant_id, project_id, status);This enables efficient filtering and sorting within a tenant’s scope.Balancing Indexing Depth & Query Speed:Avoid over-indexing, which can slow down write operations.Prioritize indexing columns involved in filtering, joining, and sorting operations.Regularly analyze query performance using tools like  in PostgreSQL or  in MySQL.Partitioning improves scalability by dividing data into smaller, more manageable segments, reducing query times for tenant-specific operations.Horizontal Partitioning By Tenants:Partition data within a single database based on tenant_id.CREATE TABLE tasks_1 PARTITION OF tasksFOR VALUES IN (1); -- Partition for tenant_id 1Faster tenant-specific queries as partitions reduce the search space.Simplifies maintenance for large datasets.Database Sharding For High-Scale Systems:Distribute tenant data across multiple databases (shards).Example Sharding Strategy -Use tenant_id % shard_count to assign tenants to shards.Tools like  or  can manage sharding in distributed database systems.Eliminates contention in single-database systems.Enhances fault isolation and scalability.Example Use Case — Applying These StrategiesAn application manages 100,000 tenants, each with thousands of projects and tasks.Add tenant_id to all tables.Use foreign keys to link tasks → projects → clients.Create a compound index on tasks (tenant_id, project_id) for common queries like -SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND project_id = 456;For smaller tenants, use horizontal partitioning -CREATE TABLE tasks_tenant_123 PARTITION OF tasks FOR VALUES IN (123);For larger tenants, shard data across multiple databases to scale.A well-designed schema with tenant_id simplifies multi-tenant data filtering.Proper indexing ensures efficient queries, even at scale.Partitioning and sharding prepare the system for growth, reducing query times and enhancing reliability.This section provides concrete examples of implementing different authorization models for multi-tenant systems, including schemas, queries, and tooling. Each approach demonstrates how to enforce tenant-specific access effectively.1. Flat Model ImplementationThe flat model relies on adding a tenant_id column to all relevant tables, ensuring that queries are scoped to the tenant directly.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id)    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id));: Access tasks for a user’s company -SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND status = 'in_progress';Simplifies authorization logic with direct lookups.Reduces query complexity by avoiding joins.Potential schema bloat with additional tenant_id columns.2. Hierarchical Model ImplementationIn this model, tenant authorization is enforced by traversing relationships between resources (e.g., Company → Client → Project → Task).CREATE TABLE companies (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    company_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id));    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id));    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    description TEXT,    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id): Check task access by traversing relationships -SELECT t.* FROM tasks tINNER JOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.idINNER JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.idINNER JOIN companies co ON c.company_id = co.idWHERE co.id = 123 AND t.status = 'in_progress';Maintains normalized relationships.Avoids redundant tenant_id columns.Complex joins increase query costs.Requires optimized indexes to maintain performance.3. Tenant-Specific Database/Table ImplementationFor scenarios requiring strict isolation, separate databases or tables for each tenant can be used.Create a separate database or schema for each tenant -CREATE DATABASE company_123;CREATE TABLE company_123.tasks (    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);: Access tasks for a specific tenant -USE company_123;SELECT * WHERE status = 'in_progress';: Use CI/CD tools like  to manage multi-tenant databases:Automate schema changes across databases.Track versioning for each tenant’s database.Complete tenant isolation for security and compliance (e.g., GDPR).Simplifies data archival and backup for individual tenants.Deployment complexity increases with the number of tenants.Resource-intensive for systems with many small tenants.Choosing The Right ImplementationUse the flat model for simplicity in high-traffic environments.Use the hierarchical model when data relationships must be preserved and redundancy minimized.Opt for tenant-specific databases for strict isolation and compliance requirements.Each implementation can be tailored based on application needs, tenant size, and regulatory requirements. Balancing performance, scalability, and maintainability is key to successful multi-tenant authorization systems.Security Best Practices For AuthorizationEnsuring robust security in multi-tenant systems is essential to prevent data breaches, maintain compliance, and build user trust. This section outlines key practices for implementing secure and reliable authorization mechanisms.1. Strict Access ControlsImplementing strong access controls ensures that only authorized users can access or modify resources.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):Assign roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User) to users based on their responsibilities.Enforce role-specific permissions at the application and database layers.Example: Use database roles to restrict access to tenant-specific tables.CREATE ROLE company_admin;GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO company_admin;REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES FROM PUBLIC; -- Restrict public access:Enforce tenant-level data segregation directly at the database layer.RLS ensures that queries automatically filter data based on the user’s tenant.PostgreSQL Example For RLS:CREATE POLICY tenant_policyON tasksUSING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::BIGINT);ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;SET app.current_tenant = '123'; -- Simulate tenant contextSELECT * FROM tasks; -- Only tasks with tenant_id = 123 will be visible2. Preventing Cross-Tenant Data LeaksPreventing accidental or intentional cross-tenant data leaks is critical in multi-tenant architectures.Multi-Layer Access Checks:Enforce tenant isolation at both the database and application layers.Validate all queries to ensure they are scoped to the user’s tenant.Always include a tenant_id check in database queries.Use database views or abstractions to simplify tenant-specific filtering.Application-Layer Validation:Add additional validation at the application level as a guardrail.Ensure that APIs restrict data access to the authenticated tenant context.def get_user_tasks(user):    if user.tenant_id != request.tenant_id:        raise PermissionDenied("Cross-tenant access is not allowed.")    return db.query(Tasks).filter(Tasks.tenant_id == user.tenant_id).all()Audit logs are essential for monitoring, compliance, and debugging. They provide visibility into access patterns and help detect unauthorized access attempts.User ID and tenant ID for all queries.Access attempts (successful and failed).Data modification operations (insert, update, delete).Timestamps and IP addresses for requests.SQL Example For Logging Queries:CREATE TABLE audit_logs (    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT,    table_name VARCHAR(255),    executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPINSERT INTO audit_logs (user_id, tenant_id, action, table_name, query)VALUES (123, 456, 'SELECT', 'tasks', 'SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 456');Integrating Logging Tools:Use database triggers to log operations automatically.Combine with external tools like  (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or  for advanced monitoring.CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_task_changes()RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$    INSERT INTO audit_logs (user_id, tenant_id, action, table_name, query)    VALUES (current_user_id(), NEW.tenant_id, TG_OP, TG_TABLE_NAME, current_query());    RETURN NEW;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE TRIGGER audit_task_changesAFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON tasksFOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION log_task_changes();Combine RBAC, RLS, and application-level validation for comprehensive protection.Use multi-layered access checks and robust query scoping to ensure tenant isolation.Maintain detailed audit logs to track access and modifications for accountability and compliance.These practices create a secure foundation for multi-tenant authorization systems, ensuring that each tenant’s data is isolated, protected, and auditable.Designing a robust multi-tenant authorization system involves navigating a set of challenges and trade-offs. Each approach has its own set of complexities that must be carefully managed to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.1. Balancing Performance & FlexibilityChoosing between speed and schema cleanliness can significantly impact your database design and performance.Prioritizing Performance (Flat Model):Direct lookups using a tenant_id column ensure fast query execution.Reduced join complexity leads to quicker response times.: May result in data redundancy (e.g., repeating tenant IDs across multiple tables).SQL Example For Optimized Query:SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND status = 'pending';Prioritizing Schema Cleanliness (Hierarchical Model):Using a normalized schema ensures a clean and consistent database structure.: Requires more complex joins and increased query times, especially for deeply nested relationships.Hierarchical Query Example:SELECT tasks.*FROM tasksJOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.idJOIN clients ON projects.client_id = clients.idWHERE clients.tenant_id = 123;Managing tenant-specific setups adds complexity, particularly as the number of tenants grows.Tenant-Specific Databases:Each tenant has its own database, simplifying compliance and data isolation.: Maintaining consistency across databases for schema changes.: Use automation tools like  or  to manage schema migrations across tenants.# Liquibase command to apply migrations to multiple tenant databasesliquibase --url="jdbc:mysql://db_host/tenant1" updateliquibase --url="jdbc:mysql://db_host/tenant2" updateSingle Multi-Tenant Database:Shared schema reduces maintenance but requires more sophisticated query scoping and indexing.: Tracking and isolating tenant data effectively without introducing query overhead.3. Handling Schema Updates In Multi-Tenant DatabasesEnsuring all tenants have consistent schemas while minimizing downtime is one of the most significant challenges in multi-tenant systems.Use versioned migrations to apply incremental updates across all tenants.Maintain backward compatibility to prevent disruptions during updates.CREATE TABLE schema_versions (    tenant_id BIGINT,    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPApply updates to a subset of tenants, validate, and then roll out to the rest.Use feature flags to selectively enable new schema features.Code Example For Rolling Updates:tenants = get_tenant_list()for tenant in tenants:    apply_schema_update(tenant_id=tenant.id)Testing & CI/CD For Multi-Tenant Systems:Test migrations on a staging environment with realistic tenant data before deploying.Use CI/CD tools like  to automate and track updates across tenant databases.Performance Vs. Flexibility:Use a flat model for high-speed queries or hierarchical models for cleaner schemas but expect performance trade-offs.Tenant-specific databases simplify compliance but require robust automation for schema management.Implement version control and rolling updates to ensure seamless schema changes across all tenants.Addressing these challenges with well-defined strategies ensures a scalable and maintainable multi-tenant authorization system, capable of adapting to evolving application needs.Real-world applications of multi-tenant database authorization vary depending on the complexity of the resource structure, performance requirements, and compliance needs. Below are three illustrative scenarios demonstrating how different authorization models can be applied effectively.Scenario 1 — Flat Model For A SaaS CRM AppA SaaS customer relationship management (CRM) application needs to store and manage customer interactions for multiple companies, ensuring users can only access data associated with their organization.: Each company has its own sales team, and users need quick access to customer records and sales data.: Use a flat model by adding tenant_id to every table, such as customers, leads, and sales.CREATE TABLE customers (    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    phone VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    customer_id BIGINT,    status VARCHAR(50),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);SELECT * FROM customers Simple queries without joins for tenant-specific data.High performance due to direct lookups.Wider tables due to the inclusion of tenant_id.Potential redundancy if relationships between entities are not properly normalized.Scenario 2 — Hierarchical Model For A Project Management ToolA project management tool with a nested structure: Company → Client → Project → Task. Users need to manage projects while maintaining strict access control based on their organization.: Each company has multiple clients, each with its own projects and tasks. Users must only access tasks related to their company.: Use a hierarchical model to enforce relationships and control access through joins.CREATE TABLE companies (    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    company_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    description TEXT,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPSELECT tasks.*FROM tasksJOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.idJOIN clients ON projects.client_id = clients.idWHERE clients.company_id = 123;Clean, normalized schema without redundant data.Access naturally follows the hierarchy.Complex queries due to multi-level joins.Slower query performance for deep hierarchies.Scenario 3 — Single-Tenant Databases For An Enterprise AppAn enterprise application handles sensitive data, requiring strict data isolation for compliance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations.: Each tenant’s data must be completely isolated to ensure compliance and scalability.: Use a single-tenant database model where each company has its own dedicated database.Database Names:  tenant_1_db  tenant_3_db: Use  to manage database updates across multiple tenants.deploy:  steps:    - name: Update Tenant Databases      script: |        for db in $(list_databases); do          apply_migrations $dbComplete isolation ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.Scalability: Large tenants can have dedicated resources (e.g., separate hardware).Higher operational complexity in managing multiple databases.Requires robust CI/CD pipelines for schema updates.Each use case demonstrates how careful consideration of application requirements, data relationships, and compliance needs can guide the choice of the best authorization model for a multi-tenant database.Efficient, scalable, and secure authorization in multi-tenant databases as we’ve found often at Xinthe, requires a well-thought-out approach tailored to the application’s needs.Authorization in multi-tenant databases isn’t a one-size-fits-all challenge. Developers and database architects must carefully evaluate their application’s structure, expected growth, and regulatory needs to select the most effective approach. Armed with the insights and strategies outlined in this article, you can design multi-tenant database systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient, ensuring both developer productivity and a seamless user experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Docker, Kubernetes, and NATS — The Backbone of Cloud-Native Apps</title><link>https://blog.devops.dev/docker-kubernetes-and-nats-the-backbone-of-cloud-native-apps-af724f41c17d?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4</link><author>Cristhian Ferrufino</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:48:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.devops.dev/?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4">Devops.dev blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Docker, Kubernetes, and NATS — The Backbone of Cloud-Native AppsWelcome back to the ! In the last article, we explored the world of message brokers and why NATS is a standout choice for modern microservices. Now, it’s time to dive into the backbone of cloud-native applications:  and . If microservices are the chefs in our restaurant analogy, containers are the kitchen tools that keep everything running smoothly. And Kubernetes? That’s the head chef, making sure everyone works in harmony.In this article, we’ll break down  and , explore how they work together, and even touch on how  fits into the mix. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to containerize your applications and orchestrate them like a pro. Let’s get cooking!What Is Containerization, and Why Is It Important?Imagine you’re shipping a fragile package across the world. You’d want to pack it in a sturdy container, right? That’s exactly what containerization does for your applications. It packages your app and all its dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc.) into a lightweight, portable unit called a . This ensures that your app runs consistently across different environments — whether it’s your laptop, a testing server, or a production cluster.Why developers love containers:✅ : “Works on my machine” becomes “Works everywhere.”✅ : No more dependency hell — each app lives in its own bubble.✅ : Deploy to AWS, Azure, or your grandma’s PC (if she’s cool with Kubernetes).✅ : 10x lighter than VMs. Think EVs vs. a gas-guzzling truckIntroduction to Docker: Building, Running, and Managing ContainersDocker is the most popular tool for containerization, and for good reason. It’s simple, powerful, and widely supported. Let’s break it down:To create a container, you start with a  — a text file that defines the steps to build your app’s environment. Here’s a simple example:# Use a lightweight Python image (because nobody likes bloat)FROM python:3.9-slim# Set the stage for your appWORKDIR /app# Install dependencies (Pro tip: Skip the cache to shrink your image)COPY requirements.txt .RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt# Copy the rest of the codeCOPY . .# Open the app’s “front door”EXPOSE 8080CMD ["python", "app.py"]With this Dockerfile, you can build a container image using the `` command:🚀 Run this: docker build -t my-python-app .Once you’ve built your image, you can run it as a container:🎯 Pro tip: Map ports like a pirate mapping treasure.  docker run -p 8080:8080 my-python-appThis command starts your app and maps port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container. Easy, right?Docker also provides tools to manage your containers:: List running containers.docker logs <container_id>: View logs for a specific containerdocker stop <container_id>: Stop a running container.Docker vs. Podman: A Detailed ComparisonWhile Docker is the most popular containerization tool, it’s not the only one.  is a rising star in the container world, and it’s worth understanding how it compares to Docker.+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Feature              | Docker 🐳                           | Podman 📦                         |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Daemon Requirement   | Requires a daemon (dockerd)         | Daemonless (runs containers       ||                      |                                     | directly)                         |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Root vs. Rootless    | Runs as root by default              | Supports rootless containers out  ||                      |                                     | of the box                        |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Compatibility        | Uses Docker CLI and Dockerfiles     | Fully compatible with Docker CLI  ||                      |                                     | and Dockerfiles                   |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Security             | Requires root privileges, which can | Rootless mode reduces attack      ||                      | be a security risk                  | surface                           |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Orchestration        | Requires Docker Swarm for           | Integrates with Kubernetes        ||                      | orchestration                       | natively                          |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Community Support    | Larger community and ecosystem      | Growing community, backed by Red  ||                      |                                     | Hat                               |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+You need a mature, widely supported tool with a large ecosystem.You’re already using Docker Swarm for orchestration.You’re okay with running containers as root.You want a daemonless, more secure alternative to Docker.You’re working in environments where root privileges are restricted.You’re already using Kubernetes and want tighter integration.Both tools are excellent choices, so pick the one that best fits your needs.Kubernetes Overview: Orchestration, Scaling, and Self-HealingWhile Docker is great for running containers, managing them at scale can get tricky. Enter  (or K8s for short), the de facto standard for container orchestration. Think of Kubernetes as the conductor of an orchestra — it ensures all your containers play in harmony.Key Features of Kubernetes: Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containers.: Automatically adjusts the number of running containers based on demand.: Restarts failed containers and replaces unhealthy ones.: Automatically assigns IP addresses and DNS names to containers.Kubernetes organizes containers into , which are the smallest deployable units. A pod can contain one or more containers that share resources like storage and networking. Here’s a simple Kubernetes deployment file:apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: my-python-app  replicas: 3    matchLabels:  template:      labels:    spec:      - name: my-python-app        image: my-python-app:latest        ports:his file tells Kubernetes to run three replicas of your app and expose it on port 8080. You can apply it using:🔥 Run this: kubectl apply -f deployment.yamlHow NATS Shines in a Kubernetes EnvironmentNow, let’s talk about . As a lightweight, high-performance messaging system, NATS plays well with Kubernetes. Here’s how it stands out:Use Cases for NATS in KubernetesService-to-Service Communication: NATS excels at enabling fast, reliable communication between microservices. Its lightweight design makes it perfect for Kubernetes’ dynamic environment.Event-Driven Architectures: NATS’s pub/sub, request-reply or streams patterns make it ideal for event-driven systems, where services need to react to events in real time.Scalability: NATS can handle millions of messages per second, making it a great fit for high-throughput applications running on Kubernetes.Resilience: NATS’s built-in fault tolerance ensures that your messaging system remains reliable, even in the face of node failures.Deploying NATS on KubernetesDeploying NATS on Kubernetes is straightforward. Here’s a basic NATS deployment file:apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: nats  replicas: 1    matchLabels:  template:      labels:    spec:      - name: nats        ports:        - containerPort: 4222 # The messaging highway 🛣️Once deployed, NATS can be used by your microservices for seamless communication.Best Practices for Containerizing MicroservicesTo wrap things up, here are some best practices for containerizing your microservices:Keep Containers Lightweight: Use minimal base images (e.g.,  or  versions) to reduce size and improve performance.: Separate the build and runtime environments to keep production images small.Leverage Kubernetes Features: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data.: Integrate tools like Prometheus and Fluentd for monitoring and logging.: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate building, testing, and deploying containers.In the next article, we’ll explore “NATS as a Service Mesh — The Lightweight Superhero Your Microservices Deserve” and how it simplifies communication between microservices.

They’re all impressive as heck, as you’d expect from Adam. But it’s the simplicity of the first few examples that I love most. Here I am recreating two of the effects in a CodePen, which you’ll want to view in the latest version of Chrome for support.This is a perfect example of how a scroll-driven animation is simply a normal CSS animation, just tied to scrolling instead of the document’s default timeline, which starts on render. We’re talking about the same set of keyframes:@keyframes slide-in-from-left {
  from {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
}All we have to do to trigger scrolling is call the animation and assign it to the timeline:li {
  animation: var(--animation) linear both;
  animation-timeline: view();
}Notice how there’s no duration set on the animation. There’s no need to since we’re dealing with a scroll-based timeline instead of the document’s timeline. We’re using the  function instead of the  function, which acts sort of like JavsScript’s Intersection Observer where scrolling is based on where the element comes into view and intersects the scrollable area.It’s easy to drop your jaw and ooo and ahh all over Adam’s demos, especially as they get more advanced. But just remember that we’re still working with plain ol’ CSS animations. The difference is the timeline they’re on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Scale Sklearn with Dask</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/how-to-scale-sklearn-dask</link><author>Iván Palomares Carrascosa</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/crVYYGyvTE2Jilsmvukhpw.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's how Dask applies the building blocks of sklearn to bring ML modeling workflows to the next level of scalability via high-performance parallel computing]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Better Value Sooner Safer Happier • Simon Rohrer &amp; Eduardo da Silva • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oqT5tjqf-0</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8oqT5tjqf-0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub

Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.
 
The programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as "Activities," you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.
 
I remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind. Perhaps in a future, GNOME could return to the Linux desktop and join forces with Cinnamon -- so that we may once again have the year of the Linux desktop.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fostering open source culture (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/628</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/628/the-changelog-628.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Arun Gupta is back, this time with his latest book in hand titled “Fostering Open Source Culture” to share his wisdom and experiences of fostering open source culture.

It’s
something that feels “obvious” to me since I’ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn’t find something that explained all of the steps – a lot of them just
said “add this to ”, but what if you’re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some
of the gotchas I’ve run into over the years.Here’s a table of contents:step 1: what shell are you using?If you’re not sure what shell you’re using, here’s a way to find out. Run this:if you’re using , it’ll print out if you’re using , it’ll print out if you’re using , it’ll print out an error like “In fish, please use
$fish_pid” ( isn’t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you’re using fish, which you probably already knew)Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I’ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.step 2: find your shell’s config filein zsh, it’s probably in bash, it might be , but it’s complicated, see the note in the next sectionin fish, it’s probably ~/.config/fish/config.fish (you can run  if you want to be 100% sure)a note on bash’s config fileBash has three possible config files: , , and .If you’re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I’d recommend
testing this way:add  to your If you see “hi there”, that means  is being used! Hooray!Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with You can also try  if the first two options don’t work.(there are a lot of elaborate flow charts out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it’s not worth it and just testing is
the fastest way to be sure)step 3: figure out which directory to addLet’s say that you’re trying to install and run a program called 
and it doesn’t work, like this:$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
How do you find what directory  is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy – often the answer is something like “it depends on how npm is
configured”. A few ideas:Often when setting up a new installer (like , , , etc),
when you first set it up it’ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you’re paying attention you can get the directions then.Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell’s config file
to update your  for youSometimes just Googling “where does npm install things?” will turn up the
answerSome tools have a subcommand that tells you where they’re configured to
install things, like:
Node/npm:  (then append )Go:  (then append )asdf: asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR (then append  and )step 3.1: double check it’s the right directoryOnce you’ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it’s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine,  is
in . I can make sure that it’s the right directory by trying to
run the program  in that directory like this:$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your ,
let’s move to the next step!step 4: edit your shell configNow we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:Which directory you’re trying to add to your PATH (like  )Where your shell’s config is (like , , or ~/.config/fish/config.fish)Now what you need to add depends on your shell:Open your shell’s config file, and add a line like this:export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
(obviously replace  with the actual directory you’re trying to add)You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
In fish, the syntax is different:set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
(in fish you can also use , some notes on that further down)step 5: restart your shellNow, an extremely important step: updating your shell’s config won’t take
effect if you don’t restart it!open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don’t get confusedRun  to start a new shell (or  if you’re using zsh, or  if you’re using fish)I’ve found that both of these usually work fine.And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:problem 1: it ran the wrong programIf the wrong  of a is program running, you might need to add the
directory to the  of your PATH instead of the end.For example, on my system I have two versions of  installed, which I
can see by running :$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
The one your shell will use is the .If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
() to the  of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell’s config file (it’s  instead of the usual )export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
problem 2: the program isn’t being run from your shellAll of these directions only work if you’re running the program . If you’re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you’ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.use the full path to the program you’re running, like /home/bork/bin/my-programput the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:….). You can get the full PATH you’re
using in your shell by running .I’m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven’t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.problem 3: duplicate  entries making it harder to debugIf you edit your path and start a new shell by running  (or , or
), you’ll often end up with duplicate  entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your  every time you start your shell.Personally I don’t think I’ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what’s going on with your  if you’re trying to understand its contents.Some ways you could deal with this:If you’re debugging your , open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a “fresh” state. This should avoid the duplication.Deduplicate your  at the end of your shell’s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with )Check that the directory isn’t already in your  when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with fish_add_path --path /some/directory)How to deduplicate your  is shell-specific and there isn’t always a
built in way to do it so you’ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.problem 4: losing your history after updating your Here’s a situation that’s easy to get into in bash or zsh:Run  to reload your configPress the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)The failed command isn’t in your history! Why not?This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.Some options for fixing this:Instead of running  to reload your config, run  (or
 in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you’re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I’m
not exactly sure what the best way is)When you install  (Rust’s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don’t mention a specific
directory at all.This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. "$HOME/.cargo/env"        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
The idea is that you add that line to your shell’s config, and their script
automatically sets up your  (and potentially other things) for you.This is pretty common (for example Homebrew suggests you eval ), and there are
two ways to approach this:Just do what the tool suggests (like adding  to your shell’s config)Figure out which directories the script they’re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here’s how I’d do that:
Run  in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)Run echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo to figure out which directories it addedSee that it says  and shorten that to Add the directory  to PATH (with the directions in this post)I don’t think there’s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the “best way”!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I’m changing.fish has a handy function called  that you can run to add a directory to your  like this:fish_add_path /some/directory
This is cool (it’s such a simple command!) but I’ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:Sometimes  will update the  for every session in the
future (with a “universal variable”) and sometimes it will update the 
just for the current session and it’s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DOGE as a National Cyberattack</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/doge-as-a-national.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>Schneider on Security</category><category>infosec</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 12:03:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the span of just weeks, the US government has experienced what may be the most consequential security breach in its history—not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role. And the implications for national security are profound.First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had accessedtheUSTreasury computer system, giving them the ability to collect data on and potentially control the department’s roughly $5.45 trillion in annual federal payments.Then, we learned that uncleared DOGE personnel had gained access to classified data from the US Agency for International Development, possibly copying it onto their own systems. Next, the Office of Personnel Management—which holds detailed personal data on millions of federal employees, including those with security clearances—wascompromised. After that, Medicaid and Medicare records were compromised.Meanwhile, only partially redacted names of CIA employees were sent over an unclassified email account. DOGE personnel are also reported to be feeding Education Department data into artificial intelligence software, and they have also started working at the Department of Energy.This story is moving very fast. On Feb. 8, a federal judge blocked the DOGE team from accessing the Treasury Department systems any further. But given that DOGE workers have already copied data and possibly installed and modified software, it’s unclear how this fixes anything.In any case, breaches of other critical government systems are likely to follow unless federal employees stand firm on the protocols protecting national security.The systems that DOGE is accessing are not esoteric pieces of our nation’s infrastructure—they are the sinews of government.For example, the Treasury Department systems contain the technical blueprints for how the federal government moves money, while the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) network contains information on who and what organizations the government employs and contracts with.What makes this situation unprecedented isn’t just the scope, but also the method of attack. Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. The Chinese government’s 2015 breach of OPM was a significant US security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.In this case, external operators with limited experience and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny: gaining the highest levels of administrative access and making changes to the United States’ most sensitive networks, potentially introducing new security vulnerabilities in the process.But the most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted. It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—by removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.The Treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: No single person should have unlimited power. Just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.This approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. When your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. When a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. These aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. These measures have been bypassed or ignored. It’s as if someone found a way to rob Fort Knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.The implications for national security are staggering. Sen. Ron Wyden said his office had learned that the attackers gained privileges that allow them to modify core programs in Treasury Department computers that verify federal payments, access encrypted keys that secure financial transactions, and alter audit logs that record system changes. Over at OPM, reports indicate that individuals associated with DOGE connected an unauthorized server into the network. They are also reportedly trainingAI software on all of this sensitive data.This is much more critical than the initial unauthorized access. These new servers have unknown capabilities and configurations, and there’s no evidence that this new code has gone through any rigorous security testing protocols. The AIs being trained are certainly not secure enough for this kind of data. All are ideal targets for any adversary, foreign or domestic, also seeking access to federal data.There’s a reason why every modification—hardware or software—to these systems goes through a complex planning process and includes sophisticated access-control mechanisms. The national security crisis is that these systems are now much more vulnerable to dangerous attacks at the same time that the legitimate system administrators trained to protect them have been locked out.By modifying core systems, the attackers have not only compromised current operations, but have also left behind vulnerabilities that could be exploited in future attacks—giving adversaries such as Russia and China an unprecedentedopportunity. These countries have long targeted these systems. And they don’t just want to gather intelligence—they also want to understand how to disrupt these systems in a crisis.Now, the technical details of how these systems operate, their security protocols, and their vulnerabilities are now potentially exposed to unknown parties without any of the usual safeguards. Instead of having to breach heavily fortified digital walls, these parties  can simply walk through doors that are being propped open—and then erase evidence of their actions.The security implications span three critical areas.First, system manipulation: External operators can now modify operations while also altering audit trails that would track their changes. Second, data exposure: Beyond accessing personal information and transaction records, these operators can copy entire system architectures and security configurations—in one case, the technical blueprint of the country’s federal payment infrastructure. Third, and most critically, is the issue of system control: These operators can alter core systems and authentication mechanisms while disabling the very tools designed to detect such changes. This is more than modifying operations; it is modifying the infrastructure that those operations use.To address these vulnerabilities, three immediate steps are essential. First, unauthorized access must be revoked and proper authentication protocols restored. Next, comprehensive system monitoring and change management must be reinstated—which, given the difficulty of cleaning a compromised system, will likely require a complete system reset. Finally, thorough audits must be conducted of all system changes made during this period.This is beyond politics—this is a matter of national security. Foreign national intelligence organizations will be quick to take advantage of both the chaos and the new insecurities to steal US data and install backdoors to allow for future access.Each day of continued unrestricted access makes the eventual recovery more difficult and increases the risk of irreversible damage to these critical systems. While the full impact may take time to assess, these steps represent the minimum necessary actions to begin restoring system integrity and security protocols.Assuming that anyone in the government still cares.This essay was written with Davi Ottenheimer, and originally appeared in Foreign Policy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Device Trees For Apple T2 SoCs Slated For Upstreaming In Linux 6.15</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-Apple-T2-SoC-DTs</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:58:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While there has been the recent drama over upstream maintainership over Apple Silicon / Asahi Linux code, Sven Peter is continuing to move things forward for the upstream kernel and this week sent out a set of Apple SoC DeviceTree updates intended for the upcoming Linux 6.15 kernel cycle...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NVIDIA Wiring Up Autonomous Performance Level Selection To Linux CPPC CPUFreq Driver</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-Auto-Perf-CPPC-CPUFreq</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:40:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Similar to the Autonomous Performance Level Selection and Energy Performance Preference (EPP) support already found within the Intel P-State and AMD P-State CPU frequency scaling drivers for their modern processors, NVIDIA engineers are working on similar support for the CPPC CPUFreq driver that can benefit their Grace processor...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wayland Color Management &amp; HDR Protocols Expected To Be Merged Imminently</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wayland-Color-HDR-Merging-Soon</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:30:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today could finally be the day.

On Tuesday, the Google-owned Mandiant security firm said the uptick comes amid tighter purse strings and as a means for concealing nation-state-sponsored espionage by making it blend in with financially motivated cyberattacks.“Modern cybercriminals are likely to specialize in a particular area of cybercrime and partner with other entities with diverse specializations to conduct operations,” Mandiant researchers explained. “The specialization of cybercrime capabilities presents an opportunity for state-backed groups to simply show up as another customer for a group that normally sells to other criminals. Purchasing malware, credentials, or other key resources from illicit forums can be cheaper for state-backed groups than developing them in-house, while also providing some ability to blend in to financially motivated operations and attract less notice."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GenAI Patterns: Reranker</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/#reranker</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LLMs struggle with large amounts of context.

      Cherry Mui
      13 February 2025
      Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the  directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System InterfaceWebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
 port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new  port.Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, , which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm export
in the resulting Wasm binary.To use the  directive, simply add it to a function definition://go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named  that
can be called from the host.This is analogous to the cgo  directive,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though  uses a different, simpler mechanism.A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the  build
flag.$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the  function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
 function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The  function must be called before any other exported functions.
The  function will not be automatically invoked.To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using Wazero, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions("_initialize")

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction("add")
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.Supporting rich types between the host and the clientGo 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with  functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a
pointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported
field types
(see the documentation for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A  function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the  function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with  and
 functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>2024 State of Rust Survey Results</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/13/2024-State-Of-Rust-Survey-results.html</link><author>The Rust Survey Team</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.rust-lang.org/">Dev - Rust Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rust Survey Team is excited to share the results of our 2024 survey on the Rust Programming language, conducted between December 5, 2024 and December 23, 2024.
As in previous years, the 2024 State of Rust Survey was focused on gathering insights and feedback from Rust users, and all those who are interested in the future of Rust more generally.This ninth edition of the survey surfaced new insights and learning opportunities straight from the global Rust language community, which we will summarize below. In addition to this blog post,  containing charts with aggregated results of all questions in the survey.Our sincerest thanks to every community member who took the time to express their opinions and experiences with Rust over the past year. Your participation will help us make Rust better for everyone.There's a lot of data to go through, so strap in and enjoy!As shown above, in 2024, we have received fewer survey views than in the previous year. This was likely caused simply by the fact that the survey ran only for two weeks, while in the previous year it ran for almost a month. However, the completion rate has also dropped, which seems to suggest that the survey might be a bit too long. We will take this into consideration for the next edition of the survey.The State of Rust survey not only gives us excellent insight into how many Rust users around the world are using and experiencing the language but also gives us insight into the makeup of our global community. This information gives us a sense of where the language is being used and where access gaps might exist for us to address over time. We hope that this data and our related analysis help further important discussions about how we can continue to prioritize global access and inclusivity in the Rust community.Same as every year, we asked our respondents in which country they live in. The top 10 countries represented were, in order: United States (22%), Germany (14%), United Kingdom (6%), France (6%), China (5%), Canada (3%), Netherlands (3%), Russia (3%), Australia (2%), and Sweden (2%). We are happy to see that Rust is enjoyed by users from all around the world! You can try to find your country in the chart below:We also asked whether respondents consider themselves members of a marginalized community. Out of those who answered, 74.5% selected no, 15.5% selected yes, and 10% preferred not to say.We have asked the group that selected “yes” which specific groups they identified as being a member of. The majority of those who consider themselves a member of an underrepresented or marginalized group in technology identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or otherwise non-heterosexual. The second most selected option was neurodivergent at 46% followed by trans at 35%.Each year, we must acknowledge the diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) related gaps in the Rust community and open source as a whole. We believe that excellent work is underway at the Rust Foundation to advance global access to Rust community gatherings and distribute grants to a diverse pool of maintainers each cycle, which you can learn more about here. Even so, global inclusion and access is just one element of DEI, and the survey working group will continue to advocate for progress in this domain.The number of respondents that self-identify as a Rust user was quite similar to last year, around 92%. This high number is not surprising, since we primarily target existing Rust developers with this survey.Similarly as last year, around 31% of those who did not identify as Rust users cited the perception of difficulty as the primary reason for not using Rust. The most common reason for not using Rust was that the respondents simply haven’t had the chance to try it yet.Of the former Rust users who participated in the 2024 survey, 36% cited factors outside their control as a reason why they no longer use Rust, which is a 10pp decrease from last year. This year, we also asked respondents if they would consider using Rust again if an opportunity comes up, which turns out to be true for a large fraction of the respondents (63%). That is good to hear!Closed answers marked with N/A were not present in the previous version(s) of the survey.Those not using Rust anymore told us that it is because they don't really need it (or the goals of their company changed) or because it was not the right tool for the job. A few reported being overwhelmed by the language or its ecosystem in general or that switching to or introducing Rust would have been too expensive in terms of human effort.Of those who used Rust in 2024, 53% did so on a daily (or nearly daily) basis — an increase of 4pp from the previous year. We can observe an upward trend in the frequency of Rust usage over the past few years, which suggests that Rust is being increasingly used at work. This is also confirmed by other answers mentioned in the Rust at Work section later below.Rust expertise is also continually increasing amongst our respondents! 20% of respondents can write (only) simple programs in Rust (a decrease of 3pp from 2023), while 53% consider themselves productive using Rust — up from 47% in 2023. While the survey is just one tool to measure the changes in Rust expertise overall, these numbers are heartening as they represent knowledge growth for many Rustaceans returning to the survey year over year.Unsurprisingly, the most popular version of Rust is , either the most recent one or whichever comes with the users' Linux distribution. Almost a third of users also use the latest nightly release, due to various reasons (see below). However, it seems that the beta toolchain is not used much, which is a bit unfortunate. We would like to encourage Rust users to use the beta toolchain more (e.g. in CI environments) to help test soon-to-be stabilized versions of Rust.People that use the nightly toolchain mostly do it to gain access to specific unstable language features. Several users have also mentioned that rustfmt works better for them on nightly or that they use the nightly compiler because of faster compilation times.To use Rust, programmers first have to learn it, so we are always interested in finding out how do they approach that. Based on the survey results, it seems that most users learn from Rust documentation and also from The Rust Programming Language book, which has been a favourite learning resource of new Rustaceans for a long time. Many people also seem to learn by reading the source code of Rust crates. The fact that both the documentation and source code of tens of thousands of Rust crates is available on docs.rs and GitHub makes this easier.In terms of answers belonging to the "Other" category, they can be clustered into three categories: people using LLM (large language model) assistants (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), reading the official Rust forums (Discord, URLO) or being mentored while contributing to Rust projects. We would like to extend a big thank you to those making our spaces friendly and welcoming for newcomers, as it is important work and it pays off. Interestingly, a non-trivial number of people "learned by doing" and used rustc error messages and clippy as a guide, which is a good indicator of the quality of Rust diagnostics.In terms of formal education, it seems that Rust has not yet penetrated university curriculums, as this is typically a very slowly moving area. Only a very small number of respondents (around 3%) have taken a university Rust course or used university learning materials.In terms of operating systems used by Rustaceans, Linux was the most popular choice, and it seems that it is getting increasingly popular year after year. It is followed by macOS and Windows, which have a very similar share of usage.As you can see in the wordcloud, there are also a few users that prefer Arch, btw.Rust programmers target a diverse set of platforms with their Rust programs. We saw a slight uptick in users targeting embedded and mobile platforms, but otherwise the distribution of platforms stayed mostly the same as last year. Since the WebAssembly target is quite diverse, we have split it into two separate categories this time. Based on the results it is clear that when using WebAssembly, it is mostly in the context of browsers (23%) rather than other use-cases (7%).We cannot of course forget the favourite topic of many programmers: which IDE (developer environment) they use. Although Visual Studio Code still remains the most popular option, its share has dropped by 5pp this year. On the other hand, the Zed editor seems to have gained considerable traction recently. The small percentage of those who selected "Other" are using a wide range of different tools: from CursorAI to classics like Kate or Notepad++. Special mention to the 3 people using "ed", that's quite an achievement.You can also take a look at the linked wordcloud that summarizes open answers to this question (the "Other" category), to see what other editors are also popular.We were excited to see that more and more people use Rust at work for the majority of their coding, 38% vs 34% from last year. There is a clear upward trend in this metric over the past few years.The usage of Rust within companies also seems to be rising, as 45% of respondents answered that their organisation makes non-trivial use of Rust, which is a 7pp increase from 2023.Once again, the top reason employers of our survey respondents invested in Rust was the ability to build relatively correct and bug-free software. The second most popular reason was Rust’s performance characteristics. 21% of respondents that use Rust at work do so because they already know it, and it's thus their default choice, an uptick of 5pp from 2023. This seems to suggest that Rust is becoming one of the baseline languages of choice for more and more companies.Similarly to the previous year, a large percentage of respondents (82%) report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals. In general, it seems that programmers and companies are quite happy with their usage of Rust, which is great!In terms of technology domains, the situation is quite similar to the previous year. Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends, web and networking services and cloud technologies. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use-cases.You can scroll the chart to the right to see more domains. Note that the Automotive domain was not offered as a closed answer in the 2023 survey (it was merely entered through open answers), which might explain the large jump.It is exciting to see the continued growth of professional Rust usage and the confidence so many users feel in its performance, control, security and safety, enjoyability, and more!As always, one of the main goals of the State of Rust survey is to shed light on challenges, concerns, and priorities on Rustaceans’ minds over the past year.We have asked our users about aspects of Rust that limit their productivity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, slow compilation was at the top of the list, as it seems to be a perennial concern of Rust users. As always, there are efforts underway to improve the speed of the compiler, such as enabling the parallel frontend or switching to a faster linker by default. We invite you to test these improvements and let us know if you encounter any issues.Other challenges included subpar support for debugging Rust and high disk usage of Rust compiler artifacts. On the other hand, most Rust users seem to be very happy with its runtime performance, the correctness and stability of the compiler and also Rust's documentation.In terms of specific unstable (or missing) features that Rust users want to be stabilized (or implemented), the most desired ones were async closures and if/let while chains. Well, we have good news! Async closures will be stabilized in the next version of Rust (1.85), and if/let while chains will hopefully follow soon after, once Edition 2024 is released (which will also happen in Rust 1.85).Other coveted features are generators (both sync and async) and more powerful generic const expressions. You can follow the Rust Project Goals to track the progress of these (and other) features.In the open answers to this question, people were really helpful and tried hard to describe the most notable issues limiting their productivity. We have seen mentions of struggles with async programming (an all-time favourite), debuggability of errors (which people generally love, but they are not perfect for everyone) or Rust tooling being slow or resource intensive (rust-analyzer and rustfmt). Some users also want a better IDE story and improved interoperability with other languages.This year, we have also included a new question about the speed of Rust's evolution. While most people seem to be content with the status quo, more than a quarter of people who responded to this question would like Rust to stabilize and/or add features more quickly, and only 7% of respondents would prefer Rust to slow down or completely stop adding new features.Interestingly, when we asked respondents about their main worries for the future of Rust, one of the top answers remained the worry that Rust will become too complex. This seems to be in contrast with the answers to the previous question. Perhaps Rust users still seem to consider the complexity of Rust to be manageable, but they worry that one day it might become too much.We are happy to see that the amount of respondents concerned about Rust Project governance and lacking support of the Rust Foundation has dropped by about 6pp from 2023.Each year, the results of the State of Rust survey help reveal the areas that need improvement in many areas across the Rust Project and ecosystem, as well as the aspects that are working well for our community.If you have any suggestions for the Rust Annual survey, please let us know!We are immensely grateful to those who participated in the 2024 State of Rust Survey and facilitated its creation. While there are always challenges associated with developing and maintaining a programming language, this year we were pleased to see a high level of survey participation and candid feedback that will truly help us make Rust work better for everyone.If you’d like to dig into more details, we recommend you to browse through the full survey report.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Giampaolo Rodola: psutil: drop Python 2.7 support</title><link>https://gmpy.dev/blog/2025/psutil-drop-python-27-support</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[About dropping Python 2.7 support in psutil, 3 years ago
I stated:Not a chance, for many years to come. [Python 2.7] currently represents 7-10%
of total downloads, meaning around 70k / 100k downloads per day.Only 3 years later, and to my surprise, downloads for Python 2.7 dropped to
0.36%! As such, as of psutil 7.0.0, I finally decided to drop support for
Python 2.7!These are downloads per month:According to pypistats.org Python 2.7 downloads
represents the 0.28% of the total, around 15.000 downloads per day.Maintaining 2.7 support in psutil had become increasingly difficult, but still
possible. E.g. I could still run tests by using old PYPI
backports.
GitHub Actions could still be
tweaked
to run tests and produce 2.7 wheels on Linux and macOS. Not on Windows though,
for which I had to use a separate service (Appveyor). Still, the amount of
hacks in psutil source code necessary to support Python 2.7 piled up over the
years, and became quite big. Some disadvantages that come to mind:Having to maintain a Python compatibility layers like
  psutil/_compat.py.
  This translated in extra extra code and extra imports.The C compatibility layer to differentiate between Python 2 and 3 (#if
  PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 3, etc.).Dealing with the string vs. unicode differences, both in Python and in C.Inability to use modern language features, especially f-strings.Inability to freely use s, which created a difference on how CONSTANTS
  were exposed in terms of API.Having to install a specific version of  and other (outdated)
  deps.Relying on the third-party Appveyor CI service to run tests and produce 2.7
  wheels.Running 4 extra CI jobs on every commit (Linux, macOS, Windows 32-bit,
  Windows 64-bit) making the CI slower and more subject to failures (we have
  quite a bit of flaky tests).The distribution of 7 wheels specific for Python 2.7. E.g. in the previous
  release I had to upload:psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-none-win32.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27m-manylinux2010_i686.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux2010_i686.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl
The removal was done in
PR-2841, which removed around
1500 lines of code (nice!). . In doing so, in the doc I
still made the promise that the 6.1.* serie will keep supporting Python 2.7
and will receive  (no new features). It will be
maintained in a specific python2
branch. I explicitly kept
the
setup.py
script compatible with Python 2.7 in terms of syntax, so that, when the tarball
is fetched from PYPI, it will emit an informative error message on . The user trying to install psutil on Python 2.7 will see:$pip2installpsutil
Asofversion.0.0psutilnolongersupportsPython.7.
LatestversionsupportingPython.7ispsutil.1.X.
Installitwith:.
As the informative message states, users that are still on Python 2.7 can still
use psutil with:pip2 install psutil==6.1.*

This was due to a deployment which introduced a query that saturated a primary database server. On average, the error rate was 6% and peaked at 6.85% of update requests.We were able to mitigate the incident by identifying the source of the problematic query and rolling back the deployment. The internal tooling and our dashboards surfaced the relevant data that helped us quickly identify the problematic query. It took us a total of 14 minutes from the time to engage to finding the errant query.However, we are investing in tooling to detect problematic queries prior to deployment to prevent and to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.January 13 23:35 UTC (lasting 49 minutes)On January 13, 2025, between 23:35 UTC and 00:24 UTC, all Git operations were unavailable due to a configuration change related to traffic routing and testing that caused our internal load balancer to drop requests between services that Git relies upon.We mitigated the incident by rolling back the configuration change.We are improving our monitoring and deployment practices to improve our time to detection and automated mitigation for issues like this in the future.January 30 14:22 UTC (lasting 26 minutes)On January 30, 2025, between 14:22 UTC and 14:48 UTC, web requests to github.com experienced failures (at peak the error rate was 44%), with the average successful request taking over three seconds to complete.This outage was caused by a hardware failure in the caching layer that supports rate limiting. In addition, the impact was prolonged due to a lack of automated failover for the caching layer. A manual failover of the primary to trusted hardware was performed following recovery to ensure that the issue would not reoccur under similar circumstances.As a result of this incident, we will be moving to a high availability cache configuration and adding resilience to cache failures at this layer to ensure requests are able to be handled should similar circumstances happen in the future.Please follow our status page for real-time updates on status changes and post-incident recaps.

From a report: Fragmented sets of data about a population's health, agriculture, infrastructure, procurement and borders should be unified into a single, secure database that can be accessed by AI models, Ellison said in an on-stage interview with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the World Government Summit in Dubai. 

Countries with rich population data sets, such as the UK and United Arab Emirates, could cut costs and improve public services, particularly health care, with this approach, Ellison said. Upgrading government digital infrastructure could also help identify wastage and fraud, Ellison said. IT systems used by the US government are so primitive that it makes it difficult to identify "vast amounts of fraud," he added, pointing to efforts by Elon Musk's team at the Department of Government Efficiency to weed it out.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When Platforms and the Government Unite, Remember What’s Private and What Isn’t</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/when-platforms-and-government-unite-remember-whats-private-and-what-isnt</link><author>Matthew Guariglia</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/social-media-surveillance-1b_0.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 18:07:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mesa 25.0-rc3 Released With Numerous RADV &amp; RadeonSI Fixes</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-25.0-rc3-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:51:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mesa 25.0-rc3 is out today as a rather large weekly release candidate to Mesa 25.0 that will be debuting as stable later this month...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fine-tune LLMs with synthetic data for context-based Q&amp;A using Amazon Bedrock</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fine-tune-llms-with-synthetic-data-for-context-based-qa-using-amazon-bedrock/</link><author>Sue Cha</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:44:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There’s a growing demand from customers to incorporate generative AI into their businesses. Many use cases involve using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) through approaches like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, for advanced, domain-specific tasks or those requiring specific formats, model customization techniques such as fine-tuning are sometimes necessary. Amazon Bedrock provides you with the ability to customize leading foundation models (FMs) such as Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku and Meta’s Llama 3.1.Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available through an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock offers a serverless experience, so you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and integrate and deploy them into your applications using AWS tools without having to manage any infrastructure.Fine-tuning is a supervised training process where labeled prompt and response pairs are used to further train a pre-trained model to improve its performance for a particular use case. One consistent pain point of fine-tuning is the lack of data to effectively customize these models. Gathering relevant data is difficult, and maintaining its quality is another hurdle. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs requires substantial resource commitment. In such scenarios, synthetic data generation offers a promising solution. You can create synthetic training data using a larger language model and use it to fine-tune a smaller model, which has the benefit of a quicker turnaround time.In this post, we explore how to use Amazon Bedrock to generate synthetic training data to fine-tune an LLM. Additionally, we provide concrete evaluation results that showcase the power of synthetic data in fine-tuning when data is scarce.The solution comprises two main steps:Generate synthetic data using the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API.Fine-tune using an Amazon Bedrock custom model.For synthetic data generation, we use a larger language model (such as Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock) as the teacher model, and a smaller language model (such as Anthropic’s Claude Instant 1.2 or Claude 3 Haiku on Amazon Bedrock) as the student model for fine-tuning. We use the larger teacher model to generate new data based on its knowledge, which is then used to train the smaller student model. This concept is similar to knowledge distillation used in deep learning, except that we’re using the teacher model to generate a new dataset from its knowledge rather than directly modifying the architecture of the student model.The following diagram illustrates the overall flow of the solution.Finally, we share our experiment results, where we compare the performance of the model fine-tuned with synthetic data to the baseline (not fine-tuned) model and to a model fine-tuned with an equal amount of original training data.To generate synthetic data and fine-tune models using Amazon Bedrock, you first need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role with the appropriate permissions. This role is used by Amazon Bedrock to access the necessary resources on your behalf.If you’re running this code using an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance, edit the IAM role that’s attached to the notebook (for example, AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-XXX) instead of creating a new role. Follow Create a service role for model customization to modify the trust relationship and add the S3 bucket permission. Additionally, on the role’s tab, create the following inline policies:Policy name: bedrock-customization{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel",
                "bedrock:ListModelCustomizationJobs",
                "bedrock:DeleteCustomModel",
                "bedrock:CreateModelCustomizationJob",
                "bedrock:StopModelCustomizationJob",
                "bedrock:ListCustomModels",
                "bedrock:GetCustomModel",
                "bedrock:GetModelCustomizationJob"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Policy name: iam-pass-role{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": [
                "${sagemaker-execution-role-arn}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}The final permission policies for the SageMaker execution role should look like the following, which include AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionPolicy, AmazonSageMakerFullAccess, bedrock-customization, and iam-pass-role.Generate synthetic data using the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel APIWe use the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning. You can use the API to programmatically send an inference (text generation) request to the model of your choice. All you need is a well-crafted prompt tailored for data synthesis. We used the following sample prompt for our use case:PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant who is an expert in Amazon services. Your task is to understand a system that takes in a list of documents, and based on that, answers a question by providing citations for the documents that it referred the answer from.

Your job is to generate three new Question/Answer pairs, emulating the tone, style, and grammar of the original data provided.

Here is the original data :
Input Documents and Question : {document}\n\nQuestion: {question}
Output Answer : {answer}

Strictly return a jsonl with the keys (question, answer, topic). Every topic should be different. The answers should be in the exact same format as the original. The question and the answer should be different in content from the original data provided, and all questions should be diverse and different from each other. Do not answer in any other format. The response should be parsable as a jsonl.
"""The goal of our use case was to fine-tune a model to generate a relevant and coherent answer based on a given reference document and a question. RAG is a popular technique used for such Q&A tasks; however, one significant challenge with RAG is the potential for retrieving unrelated or irrelevant documents, which can lead to inaccurate responses. You can apply fine-tuning to guide the model to better focus on the relevance of the documents to the question instead of using the provided documents without context to answer the question.Our dataset includes Q&A pairs with reference documents regarding AWS services. Each sample has up to five reference documents as context, and a single-line question follows. The following table shows an example.Step 1: Prepare to work with AWS CodeStar projectsIn this step, you create an AWS CodeStar service role and an Amazon EC2 key pair, so that you can begin creating and working with AWS CodeStar projects.

However, you can adjust the number as needed. The crucial part is to make the model think deeply about a variety of topics. Because the purpose of generating synthetic data is to enrich the training dataset, it’s more beneficial to have the model look at different parts of the documents and create Q&A pairs with different topics than the original.The following example shows how to generate synthetic data with the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API. We tested the preceding prompt with Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet. If you want to test a different model, retrieve the corresponding model ID from Amazon Bedrock model IDs, and replace the modelId variable in the function.import boto3
import json

bedrock = boto3.client(service_name="bedrock-runtime")

def generate_synthetic_data(document, question, answer):
    
    values = {
        "document": document,
        "question": question,
        "answer": answer
    }
    
    body = {
        "messages": [{
            "role": "user", "content": PROMPT.format(**values)
        }],
        "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
        "max_tokens": 2048,
        "temperature" : 0.5
    }
    
    response = bedrock.invoke_model(
        body=json.dumps(body),
        modelId="anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
        accept="application/json",
        contentType="application/json"
    )
    
    response_body = json.loads(response.get('body').read())
    
    return response_body['content'][0]['text']
The preceding function returns three JSONL records in strings with question, answer, and topic as keys. The following parse_llm_output function loads the strings and uses regular expressions to retrieve the generated questions and answers. Then, the create_synthetic_samples function combines those two functionalities to produce the final synthetic training samples.import re
import pd

def parse_llm_output(jsonl_string):
    
    question_pattern = re.compile(r'"question":\s*"([^"]+)"')
    answer_pattern = re.compile(r'"answer":\s*"(.*?)"\s*,\s*"topic"') 
    questions = question_pattern.findall(jsonl_string)
    answers = answer_pattern.findall(jsonl_string)
    
    return questions, answers


def create_synthetic_samples(row: pd.Series) -> pd.DataFrame:

    jsonl_string = generate_synthetic_data(row['document'], row['question'], row['answer'])
    questions, answers = parse_llm_output(jsonl_string)
    
    return pd.DataFrame({
        "document": [row['document']] * len(questions),
        "question": questions,
        "answer": answers
    })


def to_customization_format(row):

    msg = {
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{row['document']}\n\nQuestion: {row['question']}"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": row['answer']}
        ]
    }
    
    return msg
The following script combines all of the preceding functions and gives you the final training set with both original and synthetic samples. We convert the samples into the format required by the customization job using the to_customization_format function and save them as train.jsonl. Assume the input data is a CSV file with three columns: document, question, and answer.import pandas as pd

# Load original training samples
original_train = pd.read_csv(input_df_path)

# Create synthetic training samples
synthetic_train = pd.concat(original_train.apply(create_synthetic_samples, axis=1).tolist())

# Combine original and synthetic samples
final_train_df = pd.concat([original_train, synthetic_train])

# Convert to the format required by the customization job
final_train = final_train_df.apply(to_customization_format, axis=1).tolist()

# Write to JSONL file    
with open('train.jsonl', 'w') as file:
    for item in final_train:
        json.dump(item, file)
        file.write('\n')
Fine-tune using an Amazon Bedrock custom modelNow that you have the synthetic data generated by the teacher model along with your original data, it’s time to train the student model. We fine-tune the student model using the Amazon Bedrock custom model functionality.Model customization is the process of providing training data to an FM to improve its performance for specific use cases. Amazon Bedrock offers three model customization methods as of this writing:You can create your own custom model using any of these methods through the Amazon Bedrock console or API. For more information on supported models and AWS Regions with various customization methods, please see User guide for model customization. In this section, we focus on how to fine-tune a model using the API.To create a fine-tuning job in Amazon Bedrock, complete the following prerequisite steps:Upload the jsonl file to the training data bucket.Make sure that you have created an IAM role, as described in the PrerequisitesWhen these steps are complete, run the following code to submit a new fine-tuning job. In our use case, the student model was Anthropic’s Claude Instant 1.2. At the time of writing, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku is generally available, and we recommend following the rest of the code using Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku. For the release announcement, see Fine-tuning for Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku in Amazon Bedrock is now generally available.If you want to try different models, you must check the model provider’s terms of service yourself. Many providers restrict using their models to train competing models. For the latest model support information, see Supported Regions and models for model customization, and replace baseModelIdentifier accordingly. Different models have different hyperparameters. For more information, see Custom model hyperparameters.import boto3
import json
import time

bedrock = boto3.client(service_name='bedrock')
    
# Set parameters
customizationType = "FINE_TUNING"
baseModelIdentifier = "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1:2:100k"
roleArn = "${customization-role-arn}"
jobName = "${customization-job-name}"
customModelName = "${customization-model-name}"
hyperParameters = {
    "epochCount": "1",
    "batchSize": "96",
    "learningRateMultiplier": "0.5",
 }
trainingDataConfig = {"s3Uri": "s3://${training-bucket}/train.jsonl"}
outputDataConfig = {"s3Uri": "s3://${output-bucket}/myOutputData"}

# Create job
response_ft = bedrock.create_model_customization_job(
    jobName=jobName, 
    customModelName=customModelName,
    roleArn=roleArn,
    baseModelIdentifier=baseModelIdentifier,
    hyperParameters=hyperParameters,
    trainingDataConfig=trainingDataConfig,
    outputDataConfig=outputDataConfig
)

jobArn = response_ft.get('jobArn')

# Check job status
while True:
    status = bedrock.get_model_customization_job(jobIdentifier=jobArn).get('status')
    if status != 'InProgress':
        print(status)
        break
    else:
        print(status)
    time.sleep(30)
When the status changes to , your fine-tuned student model is ready for use. To run an inference with this custom model, you need to purchase . A flexible option is available for custom models, which can be turned off when not in use and billed by the hour. A cost estimate is provided on the console prior to purchasing provisioned throughput.On the Amazon Bedrock console, choose in the navigation pane. Select the model you fine-tuned and choose Purchase provisioned throughput.The model name and type are automatically selected for you. Select  for . After you make this selection, the estimated cost is shown. If you’re okay with the pricing, choose .When the Provisioned Throughput becomes available, retrieve the ARN of the provisioned custom model and run the inference:import boto3

        }],
        "max_tokens": 2048,
        "temperature" : 0.5
    }
    
    response = bedrock.invoke_model(
        body=json.dumps(body),
        modelId="${provisioned_model_arn}",
        accept="application/json",
        contentType="application/json"
    )
    
    response_body = json.loads(response.get('body').read())
    
    return response_body['content'][0]['text']
In this section, we share our experiment results to provide data points on how the synthetic data generated by a teacher model can improve the performance of a student model. For evaluation methods, we used an LLM-as-a-judge approach, where a judge model compares responses from two different models and picks a better response. Additionally, we conducted a manual evaluation on a small subset to assess whether the LLM-as-a-judge and human judges have aligned preferences.We carried out controlled experiments where we compared four different models as follows: 1,500 synthetic training samples for the 4 model were generated by Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet, and we created three synthetic samples per one original reference document (3 samples * 500 original reference documents = 1,500 synthetic samples).Anthropic’s Claude Instant without any customizationAnthropic’s Claude Instant fine-tuned with 500 original training samplesAnthropic’s Claude Instant fine-tuned with 2,000 original training samplesAnthropic’s Claude Instant fine-tuned with 500 original training samples plus 1,500 synthetic training samplesLLM output evaluation is an important step in developing generative AI applications, but it is expensive and takes considerable time if done manually. An alternative solution to systematically evaluate output quality in large volume is the LLM-as-a-judge approach, where an LLM is used to evaluate another LLM’s responses.For our use case, we used Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet and Meta Llama 3 70B as the judges. We asked the LLM judges to compare outputs from two different models and choose one over the other or state a tie. The following chart summarizes the judges’ decisions. Each number represents the percentage of times when the respective model was selected as providing a better answer, excluding tie cases. The test set contained 343 samples.As shown in the preceding chart, the Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet judge preferred the response from the fine-tuned model with synthetic examples over the Anthropic’s Claude Instant base model (84.8% preference) and the fine-tuned model with original 500 samples (72.3% preference). However, the judge concluded that the fine-tuned model with 2,000 original examples was preferred over the fine-tuned model with synthetic examples (32.3% preference). This aligns with the expectation that when large, high-quality original data is available, it’s better to use the large training data that accurately reflects the target data distribution.The Meta Llama judge reached a similar conclusion. As shown in the preceding chart, it preferred the response from the fine-tuned model with synthetic samples over the Anthropic’s Claude Instant base model (75.6% preference) and the fine-tuned model with original 500 examples (76.4% preference), but the fine-tuned model with 2,000 original examples was the ultimate winner.To complement the LLM-as-a-judge result, we conducted manual evaluation with two human judges. We asked the two human evaluators to perform the same pairwise comparison task as the LLM judge, but for 20 examples. The following chart summarizes the results.As shown in the preceding chart, the two human evaluators reached a similar conclusion, reinforcing the LLM-as-a-judge result. The fine-tuned model with synthetic examples produced outputs that were more preferable than the Anthropic’s Claude Instant base model and the fine-tuned model with the original 500 examples; however, it didn’t outperform the fine-tuned model with the 2,000 original examples.These comparative evaluation results from both the LLM judges and human judges strongly demonstrate the power and potential of using data synthesis when training data is scarce. Moreover, by using high-quality data from the teacher model, we can effectively train the student model, which is lightweight and cost-effective for deployment in a production environment.Amazon Bedrock evaluationsRunning LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluation has become much easier with Amazon Bedrock. Model evaluation on Amazon Bedrock allows you to evaluate, compare, and select the best FMs for your use case. Human evaluation workflows can use your own employees or an AWS-managed team as reviewers. For more information on how to set up a human evaluation workflow, see Creating your first model evaluation that uses human workers. The latest feature, LLM-as-a-judge, is now in preview and allows you to assess multiple quality dimensions including correctness, helpfulness, and responsible AI criteria such as answer refusal and harmfulness. For step-by-step instructions, see New RAG evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge capabilities in Amazon Bedrock.Make sure to delete the following resources to avoid incurring cost:Provisioned throughput for the custom modelThe training_bucket and output_bucket S3 bucketsIn this post, we explored how to use Amazon Bedrock to generate synthetic training data using a large teacher language model and fine-tune a smaller student model with synthetic data. We provided instructions on generating synthetic data using the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API and fine-tuning the student model using an Amazon Bedrock custom model. Our evaluation results, based on both an LLM-as-a-judge approach and human evaluation, demonstrated the effectiveness of synthetic data in improving the student model’s performance when original training data is limited.Although fine-tuning with a large amount of high-quality original data remains the ideal approach, our findings highlight the promising potential of synthetic data generation as a viable solution when dealing with data scarcity. This technique can enable more efficient and cost-effective model customization for domain-specific or specialized use cases.If you’re interested in working with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and learning more about LLM customization and other generative AI use cases, visit Generative AI Innovation Center. is a Deep Learning Architect at the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, where she specializes in model customization and optimization.

Furthermore, companies are increasingly investing resources in customizing LLMs through few-shot learning and fine-tuning to optimize their performance for specialized applications.However, the impressive performance of LLMs comes at the cost of significant computational requirements, driven by their large number of parameters and autoregressive decoding process which is sequential in nature. This combination makes achieving low latency a challenge for use cases such as real-time text completion, simultaneous translation, or conversational voice assistants, where subsecond response times are critical.Researchers developed Medusa, a framework to speed up LLM inference by adding extra heads to predict multiple tokens simultaneously. This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on Amazon SageMaker AI and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used. In this post, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a 1.8 times speedup observed on a sample dataset.Introduction to Medusa and its benefits for LLM inference speedLLMs generate text in a sequential manner, which involves autoregressive sampling, with each new token conditional on the previous ones. Generating K tokens necessitates K sequential executions of the model. This token-by-token processing introduces an inherent latency and computational overhead because the model needs to perform a separate forward pass for each new token in the output sequence. The following diagram from Role-Play with Large Language Models illustrates this flow.Speculative decoding tackles this challenge by using a smaller, faster draft model to generate multiple potential token continuations in parallel, which are then verified by a larger, more accurate target model. This parallelization speeds up text generation while maintaining the quality of the target model because the verification task is faster than autoregressive token generation. For a detailed explanation of the concept, refer to the paper Accelerating Large Language Model Decoding with Speculative Sampling. The speculative decoding technique can be implemented using the inference optimization toolkit on Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart.The paper Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads introduced Medusa as an alternative to speculative decoding. Instead of adding a separate draft model, it adds extra decoding heads to the LLM that generate candidate continuations simultaneously. These candidates are then evaluated in parallel using a tree-based attention mechanism. This parallel processing reduces the number of sequential steps needed, leading to faster inference times. The main advantage of Medusa over speculative decoding is that it eliminates the need to acquire and maintain a separate draft model while achieving higher speedups. For example, when tested on the MT-Bench dataset, the paper reports that Medusa-2 (the second version of Medusa) speeds up inference time by 2.8 times. This outperforms speculative decoding, which only manages to speed up inference time by 1.5 times on the same dataset.The Medusa framework currently supports Llama and Mistral models. Although it offers significant speed improvements, it does come with a memory trade-off (similar to speculative decoding). For instance, adding five Medusa heads to the 7-billion-parameter Mistral model increases the total parameter count by 750 million (150 million per head), which means these additional parameters must be stored in GPU memory, leading to a higher memory requirement. However, in most cases, this increase doesn’t necessitate switching to a higher GPU memory instance. For example, you can still use an  instance with 24 GB of GPU memory to host your 7-billion-parameter Llama or Mistral model with extra Medusa heads.Training Medusa heads requires additional development time and computational resources, which should be factored into project planning and resource allocation. Another important limitation to mention is that the current framework, when deployed on an Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint, only supports a batch size of one—a configuration typically used for low-latency applications.The following diagram from the original Medusa paper authors’ FasterDecoding repository gives a visual Medusa framework overview.There are two main variants of Medusa: – Requires a two-stage approach where you first fine-tune your LLM and then add Medusa heads and train them on top of your frozen fine-tuned LLM – Introduced later as an improvement, fine-tunes both the additional heads and the backbone LLM parameters together, enabling potentially even further latency speedupsThe Medusa paper reports that across models of varying sizes, you can achieve inference speedups of around two times for Medusa-1 and around three times for Medusa-2. With Medusa-1, the predictions are identical to those of the originally fine-tuned LLM. In contrast, with Medusa-2, we might observe slightly different results compared to simple fine-tuning of the LLM because both the heads and the backbone LLM parameters are updated together. In this post, we focus on Medusa-1.We cover the following steps in our solution:Load and prepare the datasetFine-tune an LLM using a SageMaker AI training jobTrain Medusa heads on top of a frozen fine-tuned LLM using a SageMaker AI training jobDeploy the fine-tuned LLM with Medusa heads on a SageMaker AI endpointDemonstrate LLM inference speedupBy following this solution, you can accelerate LLM inference in your applications, leading to faster response times and improved user experience.To build the solution yourself, there are the following prerequisites:Load and prepare the datasetNow that you have cloned the GitHub repository and opened the  notebook, you will load and prepare the dataset in the notebook. We encourage you to read this post while running the code in the notebook. For this post, we use a dataset called sql-create-context, which contains samples of natural language instructions, schema definitions and the corresponding SQL query. It contains 78,577 examples of natural language queries, SQL CREATE TABLE statements, and SQL queries answering the question using the CREATE statement as context. For demonstration purposes, we select 3,000 samples and split them into train, validation, and test sets.You need to run the “Load and prepare the dataset” section of the  to prepare the dataset for fine-tuning. We also included a data exploration script to analyze the length of input and output tokens. After data exploration, we prepare the train, validation, and test sets and upload them to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).Fine-tune an LLM using SageMaker AI training jobWe use the Zephyr 7B β model as our backbone LLM. Zephyr is a series of language models trained to act as helpful assistants, and Zephyr 7B β is a fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1, trained on a mix of publicly available and synthetic datasets using Direct Preference Optimization.To launch a SageMaker AI training job, we need to use the PyTorch or Hugging Face estimator. SageMaker AI starts and manages all the necessary Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for us, supplies the appropriate containers, downloads data from our S3 bucket to the container and uploads and runs the specified training script, in our case . We select the hyperparameters based on the QLoRA paper, but we encourage you to experiment with your own combinations. To expedite the execution of this code, we set the number of epochs to 1. However, for better results, it’s generally recommended to set the number of epochs to at least 2 or 3.from sagemaker.pytorch.estimator import PyTorch

To visualize the training metrics in Tensorboard, you can follow the guidance in this documentation: Load and visualize output tensors using the TensorBoard applicationTrain Medusa heads on top of frozen fine-tuned LLM using a SageMaker AI training jobFor training Medusa heads, we can reuse the functions previously mentioned to launch the training job. We selected hyperparameters based on a combination of what the Medusa paper reported and what we found to be best performing after a few experiments. We set the number of Medusa heads to 5 and used the 8-bit AdamW optimizer, as recommended by the paper. For simplicity, we maintained a constant learning rate of 1e-4 with a constant scheduler, similar to the previous fine-tuning step. Although the paper recommends an increased learning rate and a cosine scheduler, we found that our chosen combination of hyperparameters performed well on this dataset. However, we encourage you to experiment with your own hyperparameter settings to potentially achieve even better results.# hyperparameters, which are passed into the training job

Assuming the table has a primary key (which is not mentioned in the SCHEMA), we can join the table with itself to compare the heat and name of Liu Limin in heat 4 with all the records in the table.  Here's the SQL query:  ``sql SELECT t1.time FROM my_table t1 JOIN my_table t2 ON t1.name = t2.name AND t2.heat = 4 WHERE t1.name = 'Liu Limin' AND t1.heat <> 4; `  Explanation:  1. We're selecting the time` column from the first table (t1) in the FROM clause. 2. We're joining the table with itself (my_table t1 JOIN my_table t2) to compare the name and heat of Liu Limin in heat 4 with all the records in the table. 3. We're filtering the results using the WHERE clause. We're selecting only the records where the name is 'Liu Limin' and the heat is not equal to 4 (i.e., not heat 4). This is to ensure that we're selecting the time of Liu Limin in heat 3.  Note: This query assumes that the table has a unique primary key. If the table doesn't have a primary key, you may need to add additional conditions to the JOIN and WHERE clauses to ensure that we're selecting the correct records.“The fine-tuned LLM response is improved significantly, and contains only the required output:'SELECT time FROM table_name_32 WHERE heat = 4 AND name = "liu limin"'The fine-tuned LLM with trained Medusa heads provides the exact same response as the fine-tuned model, demonstrating that Medusa-1, by design, maintains the output (quality) of the original model:'SELECT time FROM table_name_32 WHERE heat = 4 AND name = "liu limin"'Demonstrate LLM inference speedupTo measure the inference speed improvements, we compare the response times of the deployed fine-tuned LLM and the fine-tuned LLM with Medusa heads on 450 test observations with the following code:import time
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm

def request(sample, deployed_llm):
    prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(sample, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
    outputs = deployed_llm.predict({
      "inputs": prompt,
      "parameters": {
        "max_new_tokens": 512,
        "do_sample": False,
        "return_full_text": False,
      }
    })
    return {"role": "assistant", "content": outputs[0]["generated_text"].strip()}

def predict(deployed_llm, test_dataset):
    predicted_answers = []
    latencies = []

    for sample in tqdm(test_dataset):
        start_time = time.time()
        predicted_answer = request(sample["messages"][:2], deployed_llm)
        end_time = time.time()

        latency = end_time - start_time
        latencies.append(latency)
        predicted_answers.append(predicted_answer)

    # Calculate p90 and average latencies
    p90_latency = np.percentile(latencies, 90)
    avg_latency = np.mean(latencies)

    print(f"P90 Latency: {p90_latency:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"Average Latency: {avg_latency:.2f} seconds")

    return predicted_answersFirst, we run predictions using the fine-tuned LLM:sft_predictions = predict(sft_deployed_llm, test_dataset)
P90 Latency: 1.28 seconds
Average Latency: 0.95 secondsThen, we run predictions using the fine-tuned LLM with Medusa heads:medusa_predictions = predict(medusa_deployed_llm, test_dataset)
P90 Latency: 0.80 seconds
Average Latency: 0.53 secondsThe prediction runs should take around 8 and 4 minutes respectively. We can observe that the average latency decreased from 950 to 530 milliseconds, which is an improvement of 1.8 times. You can achieve even higher improvements if your dataset contains longer inputs and outputs. In our dataset, we only had an average of 18 input tokens and 30 output tokens.We want to once again highlight that, with this technique, the output quality is fully maintained, and all the prediction outputs are the same. The model responses for the test set of 450 observations are the same for both with Medusa heads and without Medusa heads:match_percentage = sum(a["content"] == b["content"] for a, b in zip(sft_predictions, medusa_predictions)) / len(sft_predictions) * 100
print(f"Predictions with the fine-tuned model with medusa heads are the same as without medusa heads: {match_percentage:.2f}% of test set ")

Predictions with fine-tuned model with medusa heads are the same as without medusa heads: 100.00% of test set You might notice in your run that a few observations aren’t exactly matching, and you might get a 99% match due to small errors in floating point operations caused by optimizations on GPUs.At the end of this experiment, don’t forget to delete the SageMaker AI endpoints you created:base_deployed_llm.delete_model()
base_deployed_llm.delete_endpoint()
sft_deployed_llm.delete_model()
sft_deployed_llm.delete_endpoint()
medusa_deployed_llm.delete_model()
medusa_deployed_llm.delete_endpoint()In this post, we demonstrated how to fine-tune and deploy an LLM with Medusa heads using the Medusa-1 technique on Amazon SageMaker AI to accelerate LLM inference. By using this framework and SageMaker AI scalable infrastructure, we showed how to achieve up to twofold speedups in LLM inference while maintaining model quality. This solution is particularly beneficial for applications requiring low-latency text generation, such as customer service chat assistants, content creation, and recommendation systems.As a next step, you can explore fine-tuning your own LLM with Medusa heads on your own dataset and benchmark the results for your specific use case, using the provided GitHub repository. is a Senior ML Engineer at AWS Professional Services.

The introduction of an  framework represents a significant step forward in simplifying and streamlining the model evaluation process. This approach allows organizations to assess their AI models’ effectiveness using pre-defined metrics, making sure that the technology aligns with their specific needs and objectives. By adopting this method, companies can more accurately gauge the performance of their AI systems, making informed decisions about model selection, optimization, and deployment. This not only enhances the reliability and efficiency of AI applications, but also contributes to a more strategic and informed approach to technology adoption within the organization.Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service offering high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies through a single API, has recently introduced two significant evaluation capabilities: LLM-as-a-judge under Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation and RAG evaluation for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. Both features use the LLM-as-a-judge technique behind the scenes but evaluate different things. This blog post explores LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation, providing comprehensive guidance on feature setup, evaluating job initiation through both the console and Python SDK and APIs, and demonstrating how this innovative evaluation feature can enhance generative AI applications across multiple metric categories including quality, user experience, instruction following, and safety.Before we explore the technical aspects and implementation details, let’s examine the key features that make LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation particularly powerful and distinguish it from traditional evaluation methods. Understanding these core capabilities will help illuminate why this feature represents a significant advancement in AI model evaluation.Key features of LLM-as-a-judgeAutomated intelligent evaluation: LLM-as-a-judge uses pre-trained models to evaluate responses automatically, providing human-like evaluation quality with up to 98% cost savings. The system dramatically reduces evaluation time from weeks to hours while maintaining consistent evaluation standards across large datasets.Comprehensive metric categories: The evaluation system covers four key metric areas: quality assessment (correctness, completeness, faithfulness), user experience (helpfulness, coherence, relevance), instruction compliance (following instructions, professional style), and safety monitoring (harmfulness, stereotyping, refusal handling).: The feature integrates directly with Amazon Bedrock and remains compatible with existing Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation features. Users can access the functionality through the AWS Management Console for Amazon Bedrock and quickly integrate their custom datasets for evaluation purposes.: The system supports the evaluation of models hosted on Amazon Bedrock, custom fine-tuned models, and imported models. Users can seamlessly connect their evaluation datasets through Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, making the evaluation process streamlined and efficient.: Amazon Bedrock provides pre-selected, high-quality evaluation models with optimized prompt engineering for accurate assessments. Users don’t need to bring external judge models, because the Amazon Bedrock team maintains and updates a selection of judge models and associated evaluation judge prompts.: The feature enables organizations to perform comprehensive model evaluations at scale without the traditional costs and time investments associated with human evaluation. The automated process maintains high-quality assessments while significantly reducing operational overhead.These features create a powerful evaluation framework that helps organizations optimize their AI model performance while maintaining high standards of quality and safety, all within their secure AWS environment.Now that you understand the key features of LLM-as-a-judge, let’s examine how to implement and use this capability within Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and walks through each component, demonstrating how they work together to deliver accurate and efficient model evaluations.LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation provides a comprehensive, end-to-end solution for assessing and optimizing AI model performance. This automated process uses the power of LLMs to evaluate responses across multiple metric categories, offering insights that can significantly improve your AI applications. Let’s walk through the key components of this solution as shown in the following diagram:LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation follows a streamlined workflow that enables systematic model evaluation. Here’s how each component works together in the evaluation process:: The process begins with a prepared dataset containing prompts that will be used to test the model’s performance. The evaluation can be conducted with or without ground truth responses—while including ground truth provides additional comparison points, it’s entirely optional and not required for successful evaluation.: The prompt dataset is converted into JSONL format, which is specifically structured for LLM-as-a-judge evaluation jobs. This format promotes proper processing of evaluation data.: The prepared JSONL file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, serving as the secure storage location for the evaluation data.: The Amazon Bedrock LLM-as-a-judge model evaluation job processes the stored data, running comprehensive assessments across the selected metric categories (including quality, user experience, instruction following, and safety).Automated report generation: Upon completion, the system generates detailed evaluation reports containing metrics, scores, and insights at both aggregate and individual response levels.: Data scientists or machine learning engineers analyze the generated reports to derive actionable insights and make informed decisions.With this solution architecture in mind, let’s explore how to implement LLM-as-a-judge model evaluations effectively, making sure that you get the most valuable insights from your assessment process.To use the LLM-as-a-judge model evaluation, make sure that you have satisfied the following requirements:Selected  and  models enabled in Amazon Bedrock. You can confirm that the models are enabled for your account on the  page of the Amazon Bedrock console.If you’re using a custom model instead of an on-demand model for your generator model, make sure that you have sufficient quota for running a Provisioned Throughput during inference. 
  Go to the AWS Service Quotas console, and check the following quotas: 
    Model units no-commitment Provisioned Throughputs across custom models.Model units per provisioned model for [your custom model name].Both of these fields need to have enough quota to support your Provisioned Throughput model unit. Request a quota increase if necessary to accommodate your expected inference workload.When preparing your dataset for LLM-as-a-judge model evaluation jobs, each prompt must include specific key-value pairs. Here are the required and optional fields:: This key indicates the input for various tasks. It can be used for general text generation where the model needs to provide a response, question-answering tasks where the model must answer a specific question, text summarization tasks where the model needs to summarize a given text, or classification tasks where the model must categorize the provided text.referenceResponse (used for specific metrics with ground truth): This key contains the ground truth or correct response. It serves as the reference point against which the model’s responses will be evaluated if it is provided.: This key is used to generate evaluation scores reported by category, helping organize and segment evaluation results for better analysis.Each line must be a valid JSON objectThe file must use JSONL formatThe dataset should be stored in an Amazon S3 bucketExample JSONL format without ground truth ( is optional):{
    "prompt": "What is machine learning?"
    "category": "technical"
}
{
    "prompt": "Summarize climate change impacts",
    "category": "environmental"
}
Example JSONL format with ground truth ( is optional):{
    "prompt": "What is machine learning?",
    "referenceResponse": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data, allowing computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions.",
    "category": "technical"
}
{
    "prompt": "Summarize climate change impacts",
    "referenceResponse": "Climate change leads to rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, sea level rise, and disruption of ecosystems. These changes result in more frequent natural disasters, threats to food security, loss of biodiversity, and various public health challenges. The impacts affect agriculture, coastal communities, and vulnerable populations disproportionately.",
    "category": "environmental"

# Run model comparison
evaluation_jobs = run_model_comparison(GENERATOR_MODELS, EVALUATOR_MODEL)Correlation analysis for LLM-as-a-judge evaluationsYou can use the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to compare evaluation results between different generator models using LLM-as-a-judge in Amazon Bedrock. After retrieving the evaluation results from your S3 bucket, containing evaluation scores across various metrics, you can begin the correlation analysis.Using , compute the correlation coefficient between pairs of generator models, filtering out constant values or error messages to have a valid statistical comparison. The resulting correlation coefficients help identify how similarly different models respond to the same prompts. A coefficient closer to 1.0 indicates stronger agreement between the models’ responses, while values closer to 0 suggest more divergent behavior. This analysis provides valuable insights into model consistency and helps identify cases where different models might produce significantly different outputs for the same input.import json

By using the same evaluator model across all comparisons, you’ll get consistent, scalable results. The following best practices will help you establish standardized benchmarking when comparing different foundation models.Create diverse test datasets that represent real-world use cases and edge cases. For large workloads (more than 1,000 prompts), use stratified sampling to maintain comprehensive coverage while managing costs and completion time. Include both simple and complex prompts to test model capabilities across different difficulty levels.Choose evaluation metrics that align with your specific business objectives and application requirements. Balance quality metrics (correctness, completeness) with user experience metrics (helpfulness, coherence). Include safety metrics when deploying customer-facing applications.Maintain consistent evaluation conditions when comparing different models. Use the same evaluator model across comparisons for standardized benchmarking. Document your evaluation configuration and parameters for reproducibility.Schedule regular evaluation jobs to track model performance over time. Monitor trends across different metric categories to identify areas for improvement. Set up performance baselines and thresholds for each metric.Optimize batch sizes based on your evaluation needs and cost constraints. Consider using smaller test sets for rapid iteration and larger sets for comprehensive evaluation. Balance evaluation frequency with resource utilization.Maintain detailed records of evaluation jobs, including configurations and results. Track improvements and changes in model performance over time. Document any modifications made based on evaluation insights. The optional job description field can help you here.Use evaluation results to guide model selection and optimization. Implement feedback loops to continuously improve prompt engineering. Regularly update evaluation criteria based on emerging requirements and user feedback.Design your evaluation framework to accommodate growing workloads. Plan for increased complexity as you add more models or use cases. Consider automated workflows for regular evaluation tasks.These best practices help establish a robust evaluation framework using LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock.

However, the journey from a proof of concept to a production-ready application comes with challenges and opportunities. Moving from proof of concept to production is about creating scalable, reliable, and impactful solutions that can drive business value and user satisfaction.One of the most promising developments in this space is the rise of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. RAG is the process of optimizing the output of a foundation model (FM), so it references a knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.The following diagram illustrates a sample architecture.In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems. When transitioning a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, optimization becomes crucial to make sure the solution is reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing. Let’s explore these optimization techniques in greater depth, setting the stage for future discussions on hosting, scaling, security, and observability considerations.The diagram below illustrates the tradeoffs to consider for a production-ready RAG application.The success of a production-ready RAG system is measured by its quality, cost, and latency. Machine learning (ML) engineers must make trade-offs and prioritize the most important factors for their specific use case and business requirements. For example, consider the use case of generating personalized marketing content for a luxury fashion brand. The brand might be willing to absorb the higher costs of using a more powerful and expensive FMs to achieve the highest-quality classifications, because misclassifications could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage the brand’s reputation. Consider another use case of generating personalized product descriptions for an ecommerce site. The retailer might be willing to accept slightly longer latency to reduce infrastructure and operational costs, as long as the generated descriptions remain reasonably accurate and compelling. The optimal balance of quality, cost, and latency can vary significantly across different applications and industries.Let’s look into practical guidelines on how you can enhance the overall quality of your RAG workflow, including the quality of the retriever and quality of the result generator using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and other features of Amazon Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides a fully managed capability that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows.An effective evaluation framework is crucial for assessing and optimizing RAG systems as they move from proof of concept to production. These frameworks typically include overall metrics for a holistic assessment of the entire RAG pipeline, as well as specific diagnostic metrics for both the retrieval and generation components. This allows for targeted improvements in each phase of the system. By implementing a robust evaluation framework, developers can continuously monitor, diagnose, and enhance their RAG systems, achieving optimal performance across quality, cost, and latency dimensions as the application scales to production levels. Amazon Bedrock Evaluations can help you evaluate your retrieval or end-to-end RAG workflow in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. In the following sections, we discuss these specific metrics in different phases of the RAG workflow in more detail.For better retrieval performance, the way the data is stored in the vector store has a big impact. For example, your input document might include tables within the PDF. In such cases, using an FM to parse the data will provide better results. You can use advanced parsing options supported by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for parsing non-textual information from documents using FMs. Many organizations store their data in structured formats within data warehouses and data lakes. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers a feature that lets you connect your RAG workflow to structured data stores. This fully managed out-of-the-box RAG solution can help you natively query structured data from where it resides.Another important consideration is the way your source document is split up into chunks. If your document would benefit from inherent relationships within your document, it might be wise to use hierarchical chunking, which allows for more granular and efficient retrieval. Some documents benefit from semantic chunking by preserving the contextual relationship in the chunks, helping make sure that the related information stays together in logical chunks. You can also use your own custom chunking strategy for your RAG application’s unique requirements.RAG applications process user queries by searching across a large set of documents. However, in many situations, you might need to retrieve documents with specific attributes or content. You can use metadata filtering to narrow down search results by specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases now also supports auto generated query filters, which extend the existing capability of manual metadata filtering by allowing you to narrow down search results without the need to manually construct complex filter expressions. This improves retrieval accuracy by making sure the documents are relevant to the query.Writing an effective query is just as important as any other consideration for generation accuracy. You can add a prompt providing instructions to the FM to provide an appropriate answer to the user. For example, a legal tech company would want to provide instructions to restrict the answers to be based on the input documents and not based on general information known to the FM. Query decomposition by splitting the input query into multiple queries is also helpful in retrieval accuracy. In this process, the subqueries with less semantic complexity might find more targeted chunks. These chunks can then be pooled and ranked together before passing them to the FM to generate a response.Reranking, as a post-retrieval step, can significantly improve response quality. This technique uses LLMs to analyze the semantic relevance between the query and retrieved documents, reordering them based on their pertinence. By incorporating reranking, you make sure that only the most contextually relevant information is used for generation, leading to more accurate and coherent responses.Adjusting inference parameters, such as temperature and top-k/p sampling, can help in further refining the output.You can use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to configure and customize queries and response generation. You can also improve the relevance of your query responses with a reranker model in Amazon Bedrock.The key metrics for retriever quality are context precision, context recall, and context relevance. Context precision measures how well the system ranks relevant pieces of information from the given context. It considers the question, ground truth, and context. Context recall provides the percentage of ground truth claims or key information covered by the retrieved context. Context relevance measures whether the retrieved passages or chunks are relevant for answering the given query, excluding extraneous details. Together, these three metrics offer insight into how effectively the retriever is able to surface the most relevant and focused source material to support a high-quality response.Generator quality can be assessed through several key metrics. Context utilization examines how effectively the generator uses relevant information from the provided source material. Noise sensitivity gauges the generator’s propensity to include inaccurate details from the retrieved content. Hallucination measures the extent to which the generator produces incorrect claims not present in the source data. Self-knowledge reflects the proportion of accurate statements generated that can’t be found in the retrieved chunks. Finally, faithfulness evaluates how closely the generator’s output aligns with the information contained in the source material.For measuring the overall generation quality, the key metrics include measuring the precision, recall, and answer similarity. Precision suggests the proportion of the correct claims in model’s response, whereas recall suggests the proportion of the ground truth claims covered by the model’s response. Answer similarity compares the meaning and content of a generated answer with a reference or ground truth answer. It evaluates how closely the generated answer matches the intended meaning of the ground truth answer.Establishing a feedback loop with an evaluation framework against these quality metrics allows for continuous improvement, where the system can learn from user interactions and refine its performance over time. By optimizing these quality metrics, the RAG system can be designed to deliver reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing results for users.Implementing responsible AI practices is crucial for maintaining ethical and safe deployment of RAG systems. This includes using guardrails to filter harmful content, deny certain topics, mask sensitive information, and ground responses in verified sources to reduce hallucinations.Cost considers the compute resources and infrastructure required to run the system, and latency evaluates the response times experienced by end-users. To optimize cost and latency, implement caching strategies to reduce the need for expensive model inferences. Efficient query batching can also improve overall throughput and reduce resource usage. Balance performance and resource usage to find the ideal configuration that meets your application’s requirements.Use tools like Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases so you can take advantage of fully managed support for the end-to-end RAG workflow. It supports many of the advanced RAG capabilities we discussed earlier. By addressing these optimization techniques, you can transition your RAG-powered proof of concept to a robust, production-ready system that delivers high-quality, cost-effective, and low-latency responses to your users.In addition to the server or compute layer, you will also need to consider an orchestration tool, testing environments, and a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline your application deployment. Having a feedback loop established based on the quality metrics along with a CI/CD pipeline is an important first step to creating self-healing architectures.As your application grows, you will need to make sure your infrastructure can scale to meet the increasing demand. This can involve containerization with Docker or choosing serverless options, implementing load balancing, setting up auto scaling, and choosing between on-premises, cloud, or hybrid solutions. It also includes unique scaling requirements of your frontend application and backend generative AI workflow, as well as the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) and disaster recovery and backup strategies.The following is a sample architecture for a secure and scalable RAG-based web application. This architecture uses Amazon ECS for hosting the service, Amazon CloudFront as a CDN, AWS WAF as a firewall, and Amazon MemoryDB for providing a semantic cache.By carefully considering these aspects of hosting and scaling your infrastructure, you can build a resilient and adaptable system to support your growing web application or service. Stay tuned for more detailed information on these topics in upcoming blog posts.Data privacy, security, and observabilityMaintaining data privacy and security is of utmost importance. This includes implementing security measures at each layer of your application, from encrypting data in transit to setting up robust authentication and authorization controls. It also involves focusing on compute and storage security, as well as network security. Compliance with relevant regulations and regular security audits are essential. Securing your generative AI system is another crucial aspect. By default, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases encrypts the traffic using AWS managed AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys. You can also choose customer managed KMS keys for more control over encryption keys. For more information on application security, refer to Safeguard a generative AI travel agent with prompt engineering and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and maintenance are crucial to maintaining a healthy infrastructure. This includes setting up structured logging, centralized log management, real-time monitoring, and strategies for system updates and migrations.By addressing these critical areas, you can build a secure and resilient infrastructure to support your growing web application or service. Stay tuned for more in-depth coverage of these topics in upcoming blog posts.To successfully transition a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, you should focus on optimizing the solution for reliability, cost-effectiveness, and high performance. Key areas to address include enhancing retriever and generator quality, balancing cost and latency, and establishing a robust and secure infrastructure.By using purpose-built tools like Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to streamline the end-to-end RAG workflow, organizations can successfully transition their RAG-powered proofs of concept into high-performing, cost-effective, secure production-ready solutions that deliver business value. is a Solution Architect at Amazon Web Services, where he helps organizations architect and implement cutting-edge cloud solutions.

Game Bub also supports the Game Link Cable in both GB and GBA modes for multiplayer games. I designed the hardware with a number of bonus features, like video out (HDMI) via a custom dock, a rumble motor, real-time clock (for certain games). Additionally, the hardware is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing future software improvements to expand its capabilities.Game Bub has a custom-designed 6 layer PCB featuring a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA with integrated memory,  display, speakers, rechargable battery, GB/GBA cartridge slot, all packaged up in a custom 3D-printed enclosure.Check out the instructions, code, and design files on GitHub. Note that building a Game Bub unit is fairly complex. If you might be interested in buying a complete Game Bub kit, please fill out this form to help me gauge interest.I had a lot of fun implementing a Game Boy at the hardware level, and I started thinking about how far I could take the project. I was using a Pynq-Z2 development board, which was definitely the right way to get started, but it came with a lot of limitations.I had to use an external monitor for audio/video, and an external gamepad for input, but a real Game Boy, of course, is a portable handheld. I also wanted to add Game Boy Advance support, but the memory architecture of the Pynq-Z2 had access latency that was just barely acceptable for the Game Boy, and would have been completely unacceptable for the Game Boy Advance. I also wanted to make something less “hacky”: a real device that I could play and give to people, not just a bare PCB.Furthermore, while there are open-source FPGA retrogaming projects (e.g. MiSTer), there doesn’t appear to be anything open-source that supports physical Game Boy and Game Boy Advance cartridges, let alone an open-source handheld device.Thus, I somewhat naively set out to design what would become by far my most complex electrical engineering and hardware design project to date.I set out some goals for the project:Build a standalone, rechargable battery-powered FPGA handheldMinimize cost and complexity by using off-the-shelf components wherever possibleCapable of playing Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance gamesCapable of using physical cartridges, or emulating cartridges (reading ROM files off of a microSD card)Easy to use: graphical menu and in-game overlayIntegrated display and speakers, with headphone supportIntegrated peripherals (rumble, real-time clock, accelerometer) for emulated cartridgesHDMI video output support for playing on a big screenDecent looking design with good ergonomicsExpansion opportunities in the future: support for more systems, Wi-Fi, etc.And finally, since I was building this project for fun and learning, I wanted to be able to fully understand every single component of the system. I wanted to use my own emulator cores (e.g. not just port them from MiSTer), do my own board design, and write my own drivers to interface with peripherals.A brief rant about FPGA retrogaming#There’s a lot of misleading marketing and hype out there around FPGA retrogaming. Some claim that FPGA retrogaming devices are not emulators (because they supposedly “act like [the system] at the gate level”), that they achieve “perfect accuracy”, or that they’re superior to software emulators.In my opinion, this is blatantly wrong and actively harmful. FPGA retrogaming devices are emulators: they pretend to be something they’re not. And they’re only as accurate as they’re programmed to be, since they’re recreations. An FPGA can make certain aspects of accuracy easier to achieve, but it doesn’t guarantee it.Software emulators can be extremely accurate. Furthermore, perfect accuracy (if it’s even possible) is by no means a requirement to play an entire system’s library of games. Some people claim that FPGA emulators are the only way to “preserve” a system, but I’d argue that software emulators are a significantly more accessible (no special hardware needed!) way to further this goal.I believe that FPGA emulators have only one real advantage over software emulators: they can more easily interface with original hardware, such as physical cartridges or other consoles via link cables.I did this project not because I think that FPGA emulators are inherently better than software emulators, but because I think they’re interesting and fun to build.I began work on the project by doing some initial research and sketching out a high level design.My previous FPGA emulator project used a Xilinx Zynq chip, which integrates FPGA fabric (“PL”) with a dual-core ARM processor running Linux (“PS”). I implemented the entire emulator on the FPGA, and used the Linux system to configure the FPGA, render the UI, and load ROM files from the filesystem.I decided to keep this same division of responsibilities: using the FPGA to do the core emulation, with a separate processor to do support tasks. However, to make the overall design easier to reason about, I decided to to use an FPGA-only chip (without any hard processor cores), and an external microcontroller (MCU) to do the tasks that the ARM cores did before.The FPGA would consume input, directly interface to the game cartridges (through level shifters to support both the 3.3 volt GBA and 5 volt Game Boy), and output audio and video to the speakers and display. The MCU would handle the UI, read ROM files from the microSD card, initialize peripherals (display, DAC, IMU), handle power sequencing, and load the FPGA configuration.I wanted to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support: Wi-Fi for software updates, and the possibility of emulating the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, and Bluetooth to support wireless game controllers (when connected to an external display). To reduce complexity (and avoid the need for careful RF design), I looked only for complete Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules with integrated antennas.An early block diagram I sketched outI also drew out rough sketches of what the final device might look like: placement of buttons, screen, speakers, ports, cartridge slot, and battery. I settled on a vertical Game Boy Color-esque design (as opposed to a horizontal Game Boy Advance-style design), because I felt that this would maximize the space in the back of the device for full-size Game Boy Color cartridges and a battery.After sketching out the goals and high level design, I started component selection: picking out each non-trivial component of the system, evaluating features and requirements (e.g. how they communicate, power consumption and voltages needed).Since I intended to have this manufactured and assembled at JLCPCB, I strongly preferred parts that were available in their part library. One technique I even used for narrowing down part choices was finding the relevant category in their part search, and sorting by their stock count.I initially planned to use an RP2040 microcontroller, with a separate ESP32-WROOM module to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.The ESP32 supports both Bluetooth Classic and LE, which is essential for supporting a wide range of controllers, and the RP2040 has USB host support, to support wired controllers.During the schematic design process, I ended up simplifying the RP2040 + ESP32 combination to just a single ESP32-S3 module for a few reasons:I started running out of GPIOs on the RP2040, and I was dedicating 4 of them (2 for UART, 1 for reset, 1 for booting in firmware download mode) to communication with the ESP32. Plus, the ESP32-S3 has more GPIOs overall.I wanted to write the MCU firmware in Rust, and the ESP32-S3 had support for the Rust standard library (via ESP-IDF and esp-idf-hal). This seemed like it would be easier to get the software up and running.Fewer components means easier routing and assemblyThe ESP32-S3 has an SDIO module (for interfacing with the microSD card), and FAT filesystem support (via ESP-IDF). It would be possible to do this with the RP2040 PIO, but having a proper peripheral and driver for this makes it a lot easier.The ESP32-S3 is more powerful than the RP2040, and would probably be able to render a smoother UI.However, the ESP32-S3 has one main disadvantage compared to the original ESP32: it doesn’t have Bluetooth Classic support, only LE. This would greatly limit the range of supported wireless controllers, but I believed the compromise was worth it. I also decided to scrap USB host support, because supporting USB-C dual role (switchable device or host) would have added a lot of additional complexity.If the RP2350 microcontroller (the successor to the RP2040) had been available when I started this project, I may very well have chosen it, since it has even more power, PIO blocks, memory, and GPIO pins. I might have paired it with an RM2 radio module for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.I wanted a display that would support integer scaling for the Game Boy Advance, which has a 240x160 pixel screen. I was also looking for a screen roughly on the order of 3.0-3.5 inches wide (diagonal), to be comfortable to hold in the hand.I found the ER-TFT035IPS-6 LCD module from EastRising, with a 3.5 inch display, and a 320x480 pixel resolution. This allows for a 2x integer scale for the Game Boy Advance (and a 2x scale plus centering for the 160x144 Game Boy display). This checked off almost all of the boxes: integer scaling, a good size, available at a reasonable price, pretty good documentation (for the ILI9488 LCD controller).ER-TFT035IPS-6 LCD moduleThe main issue, which actually ended up being fairly annoying, is that it’s a 320x480 display, not 480x320. Meaning, it’s oriented in portrait mode, not landscape. I rotated the device 90 degrees to fit in a landscape orientation, but this created two issues:In landscape orientation, the bottom of the display (containing the LCD driver chip and the flex cable) faces to the left or the right, which means that larger bazels are required on the left and right of the display to center the “active area” of the LCD within the handheld.In landscape orientation, the display refreshes from left to right, not top to bottom.The problem with refreshing from left to right is that the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance (and almost every other system) refresh from top to bottom. This means that the display can’t be refreshed perfectly in sync with the game (zero buffering), and single buffering leads to unsightly diagonal tearing. Instead, I had to use triple buffering, where the game is writing to one framebuffer, the LCD driver is reading from another buffer, and there’s one spare swap buffer. This increases the amount of memory used – and because it needed to be accessed by both the game and LCD driver simultaneously (dual port), it needed to be stored in internal block RAM in the FPGA, a scarce resource.So, even though the Game Boy emulator uses <10% of the total logic resources of the FPGA, and the Game Boy Advance uses around 30%, I had to use a large (more expensive, and power hungry) FPGA so that I had enough block RAM.I also stuck a standard size HDMI port into the design, connected directly to the FPGA. HDMI has a few additional, non-video signals that need level shifting from 5V to 3.3V (I opted for discrete transistors), and it requires the source (me!) to supply a small amount of power.I had never previously designed anything that used a lithium ion battery, so I had a fair amount of learning to do. Adafruit was a helpful resource. I needed a way to charge the battery from USB power, and a way to measure how charged it is.Lithium ion batteries can be dangerous if misused. Safely charging a battery is non-trivial, and requires a feedback loop and adjustable voltage sources. A dedicated IC seemed like the best way to do this. A lot of hobbyists use the ultra-cheap TP4056 1A battery charger, but I’d read about a lot of issues it has around safely charging the battery while using it. I decided instead to opt for the TI BQ2407x series of battery charger ICs. They seem to be widely used in commercial products, came with a comprehensive datasheet, and had a few critical features: programmable input and charge current limits, safety timers, and “power path management” for safely charging the battery while the device is on.Typical discharge curve for a 3.7V lipo battery (source: Adafruit)There are a few ways to measure the charge level of the battery, which generally relies on the fact that a lithium ion battery’s voltage depends on its charge level. A fully charged battery is about 4.2 volts, a battery with between 80% and 20% charge is about 3.7 volts, and below that a drained battery falls off pretty quickly to under 3.0 volts. If all you want is a coarse estimate of the battery level, you can use an ADC to read the voltage and estimate whether the battery is fully charged or nearly discharged. However, since the voltage curve is nearly flat between 20% and 80% charge (and is also dependent on the load), this can’t give the fine-grained battery percentage that we’re used to on phones and laptops. Instead, I opted for a discrete fuel gauge IC, the MAX17048. It’s simple to integrate and inexpensive.I decided to use a push button for the main power switch, because I needed to be able to do a graceful shutdown, where the microcontroller could save state (e.g. the current save file for an emulated cartridge) before it actually powered off.I briefly considered using an ultra-low power, always on microcontroller to act as a custom PMIC to provide power switch functionality (and perhaps avoid the need for a separate real-time clock IC, and even a battery gauge). While this would have been flexible and really cool, I figured it wasn’t worth the additional complexity.The main system power ranges from about 3.4 V when the battery is discharged, to 4.2 V when the battery is fully charged, up to 5.0 V when the device is plugged in with USB.The ESP32-S3 module required 3.3 V, and most of the other ICs in the system did too. The main exception is the FPGA, which requires a 1.0 V core power rail, a 1.8 V “auxiliary” power rail, and a 3.3 V power rail for I/O. Moreover, according to the Xilinx Artix-7 datasheet (DS181), these power rails need to be powered on in a particular sequence: for my use, this means 1.0 V, then 1.8 V, then 3.3 V. Additionally, I needed a 5.0 V supply to interface with Game Boy / Game Boy Color cartridges.There are multi-rail power regulators available, and a lot of FPGA development boards use them. However, they all seemed to be expensive and difficult to purchase in low quantities. Instead, I opted for separate power regulators for each rail. I used buck converters instead of linear regulators to maximize power efficiency.I used the TLV62585 converter for the 3.3 V, 1.8 V, and 1.0 V rails. This is a simple, performant buck converter with a “power good” output, which is useful for power sequencing: you can connect the  output of one regulator to the  pin of the next regulator, to power on the rails in the desired order.For the 5.0 V rail, I used the TPS61022 boost converter. This converter is way overkill for the 5.0 V rail (which might use 75mA ), but it was readily available, and conveniently compatible with the same 1µH inductor as the buck converters.According to the FPGA datasheet, the XC7A100T consumes more than 100mW of static power. That is, it consumes that as long as it’s connected to power, even if it’s doing absolutely nothing. I figured I might want to support a low power sleep mode, so I decided to split the FPGA into a separate power domain with an explicit power enable signal from the MCU. I also used an AP2191W load switch for the FPGA’s 3.3 V rail to be able to keep the 1.0 V → 1.8 V → 3.3 V sequencing.I wanted the device to have both speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Ultimately, the FPGA generates an I2S digital audio signal, and I needed a DAC to convert it to an analog audio signal, and then an amplifier to drive the speakers (or headphones). I wanted digital volume control (to support volume buttons, rather than a volume knob or slider), and I needed some way to switch the audio output between speakers and the headphones, depending on whether or not headphones are plugged in. With no real audio experience, this seemed like a daunting task.While searching for multiple separate components, I stumbled upon the TLV320DAC3101. It combines a stereo DAC with a speaker amplifier and a headphone driver. Additionally, it supports digital volume control, and headphone detection. I think this chip is a good example of how thoughtful component selection can simplify the overall design. Looking through the datasheet, it required a 1.8 V core voltage (unlike essentially every other component other than the FPGA) and a fair amount of configuration registers to set over I2C, but it had all of the features I needed.I was originally planning to have just a single (mono) speaker, but I figured if I had a stereo DAC, I might as well put two in there. I chose the CES-20134-088PMB, an enclosed microspeaker with a JST-SH connector. Having an enclosed speaker simplified audio design, because as it turns out, you can’t just stick a speaker to a board and expect it to sound okay (Same Sky, the manufacturer of that speaker, has a blog post explaining some of the nuances).I prefer the feeling of clicky, tactile buttons (such as those found in the GBA SP, Nintendo DS (original), Nintendo 3DS, Switch) compared to “mushy” membrane buttons (such as those found in the Game Boy Color, original GBA, and Nintendo DS Lite). I learned that the tactile switches used in the GBA SP are a widely available off-the-shelf part from Alps Alpine. I used similar, but smaller buttons for the Start/Select/Home buttons, and a right-angle button from the same manufacturer for side volume and power buttons.Although I only had plans to support Game Boy and Game Boy Advance (requiring a D-pad, A and B buttons, L and R shoulder buttons, and Start/Select), I opted to add two more “X” and “Y” face buttons to leave the possibility open of supporting more systems in the future.The L and R buttons posed an additional challenge – I found numerous right-angle tactile buttons (to be soldered onto the back, facing towards the top). However, none of them seemed to have the actuator (the part of the button you make contact with) far enough away from the PCB to be easily pressed. At first, I thought about making a separate shoulder button board to move them at the correct distance, but then I started looking at what existing devices do for inspiration. The Game Boy Advance SP actually uses a more complex mechanism for the shoulder buttons: rather than a simple actuator like the face buttons, there’s a hinge with a torsion spring that hits the actuator at an angle. This is actually part of what makes the shoulder buttons pleasant to press: you don’t need to hit them from exactly the right direction, because they pivot. I ended up just going with a standard right-angle tactile button, opting to solve the problem with the mechanism in the enclosure.GBA SP shoulder button mechanismOne of my main goals was to allow ROM files to be loaded from a microSD card, rather than only being able to be played from a physical cartridge. To do this, I’d need dedicated RAM for the FPGA to hold the game. Game Boy Advance games, typically, are a maximum of 32 MB. They don’t make SRAMs that large (and if they did, they’d be very expensive). Instead, I needed to use DRAM.Asynchronous SRAM is very simple: supply a read address to the address pins, and some amount of nanoseconds later, the data you’re reading appears on the data pins. DRAM is more complex: the simplest kind is “single data rate synchronous DRAM” (SDR SDRAM, or just SDRAM, distinguishing it from the significantly more complex DDR SDRAM). However, even SDRAM is non-trivial to use. DRAM is organized into banks, rows, and columns, and accessing DRAM requires sending commands to “activate” (open) a row before reading out “columns”, and then “precharging” (closing) a row. Handling all of this requires a DRAM controller (see this simple description of the state machine required). This isn’t terribly complex, but I was signing myself up for more work.Alternatively, I could have chosen a PSRAM chip (essentially DRAM with an integrated controller to make it have a more SRAM-like interface). However, I couldn’t find a PSRAM part that I was happy with (cost, availability, interface), and so I ended up going with the inexpensive W9825G6KH 32MB 16-bit SDRAM.I also decided to stick a 512 KiB SRAM chip in the design in case I ended up needing some more simple memory later, like for emulating the SRAM used for Game Boy cartridge save files. Despite being 1/64 the capacity, this chip was about 3x the cost of the SDRAM. This ended up being a wise decision, since a lot of my internal FPGA block ram was eaten up by the triple buffer for the display (see above).Cartridge and Link Ports#The cartridge slot and link ports are no-name parts from AliExpress, easily available for cheap. These seem to mostly be GBA SP compatible, and are often used as repair parts.The Game Boy Advance can play both Game Boy [Color] and Game Boy Advance games. These run at different voltages and use different protocols, so the device needed some way of determining which type of cartridge is inserted.GBA cartridge (top) vs GB cartridge (bottom)The cartridges are physically different at the bottom: GBA cartridges (the top cartridge in the image) have a notch on either side. The GBA has a  that senses the absence of a notch on an inserted cartridge and switches the device into Game Boy Color mode.I measured the size and position of this notch, and searched Digi-Key and Mouser for switches that met these constraints. In the end, I was only able to find a single switch that would work.Miscellaneous peripherals#I used the surprisingly cheap LSM6DS3TR-C IMU from ST. This tiny IMU has a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, more than sufficient for emulating the few GB/GBA cartridges that have motion controls.For keeping track of time even when the device was off, I used the PCF8563T real-time clock chip. I chose this because it was 1) I2C (no additional pins required), 2) cheap, and 3) readily available from JLCPCB. Interestingly, all of the real-time clock chips I found count in seconds/minutes/hours/days/months/years. This makes sense for a really simple device with minimal computational power. However, it’s annoying for my purposes, since all I really want is a timestamp I can pass to some other datetime library, and converting between the calendar time and a unix timestamp is non-trivial due to how the chips incompletely handle leap years.I picked up a few cheap coin vibration motors to use for vibration support (for the rare cartridge that had a built-in vibration motor).I also used a TCA9535 I2C I/O expander to connect the face buttons to the MCU. I ran out of pins, and while I  have used the FPGA as a sort of I/O expander, I figured I’d make it simpler for myself (and allow the buttons to be used even if the FPGA was powered off) by letting the MCU read them itself.For this project, as with my previous ones, I used KiCad to create my schematic and do PCB layout. I really can’t recommend KiCad enough: it’s a great program, intuitive to use, and it’s free and open source.This was a very ambitious project for my level of electrical engineering experience, and creating the schematic took a couple of weeks. I spent a lot of time designing the circuit for each component, because I was afraid I’d do something wrong and end up with a stack of useless boards without the skills needed to debug them. A lot of the component selection actually happened in parallel with schematic design, as I found new requirements or problems and had to change components.I gained a lot of experience reading component datasheets. It’s a really valuable skill, both for component selection and for creating designs that use the components. Nearly every datasheet has a “typical application” section, where the manufacturer shows how the component would fit into a circuit. At minimum, this has power supply information (e.g. these voltages to these pins with these decoupling capacitors). For more complex components like the DAC, it also has information about power sequencing, different ways the device could be connected to the rest of the system, a register list, that sort of thing. Some components also included PCB layout recommendations. This information was all really helpful, and gave me a good deal of confidence that my board would work as long as I read through the datasheet and followed the manufacturer’s recommendations.Then I got to the FPGA. Nearly every component has a single datasheet. Some of them have an additional application note or two. Particularly complex chips (like the ESP32-S3 microcontroller) have a separate datasheet, reference manual, and hardware design guide. The Xilinx Series 7 FPGAs have . Overviews, packaging and pinout, configuration guides, BGA design rules, power specifications, clocking resources, I/O specifications, PCB layout guides, design checklists… even a 4MB Excel spreadsheet for estimating power consumption! And believe me, Xilinx didn’t just write documentation for fun: there’s so much documentation because the chip  this much documentation.Designing with the FPGA was overwhelming, and  beyond my experience level. At several points I genuinely considered dropping the project altogether. Fortunately, I persevered, and gradually internalized a lot of the information. I also read through the schematics of any open-source Artix-7 development board I could get my hands on. Seeing what other people were doing gave me more confidence that I was doing the right thing.Eventually, after I placed all of the components, connected them, ensured all of the nets were labeled, and ran KiCad’s electrical rules checker (ERC) to find obvious mistakes, I moved on to layout.I did PCB layout at the same time as some of the initial enclosure CAD. The mechanics of how everything fit together influenced the placement of the display connector, cartridge slot, buttons, speakers, and connectors. After I came up with a plausible enclosure design, I placed some of the first key components onto the PCB and locked them into place while I did the rest of the routing.Rough enclosure design to help with board layoutI first focused on components that would be hardest to route. Primarily, the FPGA: the package I was using (CSG324) is a BGA, 18x18 with 0.8mm pitch between pins. “Fanning out” all of the I/O signals requires careful routing, and at 0.8mm pitch, it’s difficult to do this routing with cheap PCB manufacturing techniques. I ended up being able to do this routing with a 6-layer PCB (three signal, two ground, one power), with 0.1mm track width and spacing, and 0.4/0.25mm vias. Fortunately, this is all within the realm of JLCPCB’s capabilities.BGA fanout with thin traces and small viasAs I routed signals out from the FPGA to other parts, I assigned those signals to the FPGA pins. Similarly, with the MCU, I assigned signals to pins in a way that made routing easier. Certain signals had restrictions (e.g. on the FPGA, the main 50 MHz clock signal can only go into certain pins, or the configuration bitstream can only go to certain pins, or certain pins are differential pairs for HDMI output), but overall, I had a lot of flexibility with pin assignment.KiCad has a feature where it automatically backs up your project as you work on it. I changed the settings to save every 5 minutes and not delete old backups, which allowed me to generate this timelapse of my layout process:Revision 1 board layout timelapseOnce I finished placing and routing all of the components, I ran the design rules checker (DRC) and fixed issues. I hesitated for a while before sending the PCB for manufacturing. I re-read the schematics, reviewed the layout, and eventually felt confident enough that I was done. I submitted the order to JLCPCB, and after a few questions by their engineers about component placement, they started manufacturing it.Board testing and bring-up#After two weeks or so, I received the assembled boards in the mail:An assembled board and an unassembled boardFirst, I probed the power rail test points with a multimeter to check for shorts. Then, I plugged the boards in for the first time, and pressed the power button. To my delight, the green LED turned on, indicating that the power button circuit, power path, and 3.3V regulator worked. The microcontroller USB enumerated, and I could see that it logged some errors (since I hadn’t flashed anything to it yet).I intended to write the MCU firmware in Rust, but I did initial board testing and bring-up with MicroPython. This would let me interactively type in Python and write basic scripts to communicate with the peripherals on the board and make sure I had connected everything correctly. I didn’t have to worry about writing efficient or well-organized code, and could just focus on functionality.I flashed the MicroPython firmware image, and wrote a couple lines of Python to blink the LED. I powered on the FPGA power domain, and checked that the , , and  rails had the correct voltage.Next, I wrote a simple bitstream for the FPGA that read the state of the buttons and produced a pattern on the shared signals between the FPGA and the MCU. I wrote simple Python code to configure the FPGA, loaded up the bitstream, and polled the signals from the FPGA. Pressing buttons changed the state, and confirmed that the FPGA was properly powered, and configurable from the MCU.After I confirmed the FPGA worked, I started writing a simple display driver to initialize the LCD and push some pixels from the MCU over SPI. The initialization sequence uses a number of LCD-specific parameters (voltages, gamma correction, etc.), that I learned from the LCD manufacturer’s example code.(Slowly) pushing pixels to the LCDThe LCD module’s controller, an ILI9488, has a few quirks: despite claiming that it supports 16-bit colors over SPI, it actually only supports 18-bit colors. This unfortunately meant that the MCU’s LCD driver would be more inefficient than I expected, since it has to expand 16-bit colors to 18-bit before sending them over the bus. This didn’t end up being a huge issue, however, because the FPGA is the one driving the display most of the time.Another quirk (hardware bug?) is that the ILI9488 doesn’t stop driving its SPI output line, even when its chip-select signal is inactive. This means that the chip will interfere with any other communication on the bus… including the FPGA, which sits on the same bus. I never actually needed to read any data back from the LCD (and even if I did, it supports three-wire SPI), so I just cut the trace between the LCD’s SDO line and the SPI bus.Debugging the LCD test codeTrouble with power domains#I started trying to communicate with the I2C peripherals (I/O expander, RTC, etc.), and found that nothing was responding. A bit of probing with a logic analyzer revealed that the SCL/SDA lines were being held low, and that powering on the FPGA power domain let the lines be pulled high and communication to happen.I deduced that this was due to the DAC, which had its IOVDD powered by , which likely caused its protection diodes to pull the IO lines (SCL and SDA) low:The problematic portion of the schematicI tested out this theory by cutting the PCB traces connecting the DAC’s IOVDD and  with a knife. After this, I2C worked even with the FPGA power disabled. Then, I tested a possible fix by adding a wire to power the DAC’s IOVDD from the  rail. I confirmed that I could still talk to the other I2C devices, and once enabling FPGA power, that I could talk to the DAC too.While bringing up the LCD, I saw that the FPGA was also pulling down the shared SPI bus lines while it was unpowered. Not enough to prevent communication with the LCD, but it still wasn’t great. Between this and the DAC issue, I learned an important EE lesson: be careful when connecting components in different power domains together. A tristate buffer, such as the 74LVC1G125, could have helped here to isolate the buses.Once I2C was working, I wrote some basic driver code for the fuel gauge, real-time clock, IMU, and I/O expander, just to check that they all worked correctly. I also checked that the MCU could read from and write to the attached microSD card.Audio and video output from the FPGA#Next, I updated my testing FPGA bitstream to output a test pattern over the LCD parallel interface (“DPI”), and a test tone to the DAC over the I2S interface. Then, I began poking on the MCU side to configure the LCD controller and DAC appropriately.With some amount of trial and error, I convinced the LCD to accept input from the FPGA. Most of the trial and error revolved around the rotation of the LCD module. Soon after, I configured the DAC properly, and it played the test tone from the FPGA over the speakers and the headphones.WIP video output from the FPGAAt this point, much of the board was working, so I soldered on the rest of the components (cartridge slot, cartridge switch, link port, shoulder buttons).With the cartridge slot in place, I had everything I needed to port over the Game Boy emulator from my last project. I did a quick-and-dirty port of the emulator, with some hacking around to connect the core to the audio, video, and the physical cartridge. I was able to play the first Game Boy game on the device far sooner than I was expecting:Pokemon Silver running from cartridgeI spent the next month or so implementing things on the FPGA. I started on the SPI receiver implementation, so that the MCU and FPGA could communicate.It was relatively straightforward to write the initial version, which 4x oversampled the SPI signals from the main system clock. For the Game Boy, that was ~8 MHz, for a maximum SPI speed of 2 MHz. The MicroPython ESP32-S3 SPI implementation supported only single SPI, so that allowed for a maximum transfer speed of 256 KB/s. This was sufficient to do most of my initial testing, but I later wrote an improved SPI receiver to run with an internal 200 MHz clock (from a PLL that turned on and off with the chip-select signal to save power), communicating with the rest of the system via a pair of FIFOs. This added a lot of complexity and edge cases, but it greatly improved performance, allowing the bus to run at 40 MHz.I wrote the SPI interface to the FPGA with memory-like semantics: each SPI transfer starts with a command byte, encoding whether it’s a read or write transfer, the size of each word in the transfer (8, 16, or 32 bits), and whether the “target address” should autoincrement as the transfer progresses. Then, a 32-bit address, followed by reading or writing the data. Each thing that the MCU might want to access (control registers, blocks of memory) are mapped into the 32-bit address space.As with my previous FPGA project, I wrote almost all of the FPGA code in Chisel, a Scala-based HDL. The remaining bits were the top-level Verilog. Chisel made it really simple to parametrize, compose, and test the various modules that I wrote.Once I had the SPI receiver working, I wrote controllers for the on-board SRAM and SDRAM. The SRAM was relatively simple (although I still got it slightly wrong at first). The SDRAM was a bit tricky, and even as I write this I’m not quite satisfied with its performance, and intend to rewrite it in the future.I exposed the SRAM and SDRAM interfaces to the MCU via SPI, which allowed me to read and write to these pieces of memory from the MCU. I used this a lot for testing: writing patterns into memory and reading them back to ensure that read and write both worked.Side note: SDRAM has to be continuously refreshed, otherwise the stored data decays over time. It depends on the chip, but typically each row has to be read and written back (or auto-refreshed, which does the same thing) at least once every 64 milliseconds to avoid losing state. What I found interesting, however, is that the data can actually persist for quite a bit longer. I discovered that when I was reconfiguring the FPGA between tests, most of the test data that I had previously written would still stick around even without being refreshed. In the first few seconds some bits would start flipping, and over the course of a few minutes, most of what was written was completely unintelligible.With the SDRAM controller and SPI receiver written, I was then able to implement the “emulated cartridge” part of the Game Boy emulator, where the MCU reads a ROM file off of the microSD card and sends it to the FPGA to be stored in SDRAM. Then, the FPGA “emulates” a cartridge (rather than interfacing with a real physical cartridge). After a few stupid mistakes, I was able to run test ROMs and homebrew. As an added bonus, since I was using my own SDRAM controller directly, I didn’t have any of the performance issues I’d faced before when accessing the ROM stored in memory.Writing the microcontroller firmware in Rust#By this point I had tested, in some form or another, all of the different components of the system. I’m really surprised that everything worked in my first board revision – even the rework I did early on wasn’t actually required for functionality.I decided now was a good time to start building an interactive GUI. Up until this point, I had just been running commands in the MicroPython REPL. However, I didn’t want to build a whole UI in Python just to throw it away later, so I also started working on the “production” Rust firmware.In the last few years, a lot of progress has been made towards making Rust on the ESP32 chips work well, even on the chips that use the Xtensa ISA. I followed the Rust on ESP Book and quickly had an environment set up. I opted for the “Rust with the Standard Library” approach, so that I could benefit from ESP-IDF, especially the built-in support for USB and SD cards with the FAT filesystem.I started porting over the drivers I had written in Python. I found embedded Rust to be a bit verbose in some cases, but overall pleasant to use and worth the (little) trouble.I starting writing my own minimal GUI framework for basic menus. I poked around with the  library, but soon found that the typical patterns I was expecting to use weren’t a great fit for Rust. I also started planning out different screens and realized that I probably actually wanted to use a more comprehensive UI framework.Ultimately, I settled on Slint, a Rust-native declarative GUI framework with excellent support for embedded devices. Slint has a custom DSL to describe the UI and composable components. After a bit of practice I found myself to be really productive with it. I enjoyed using Slint, and I’d use it again in the future. The authors are responsive on GitHub, and the project has steadily improved over the year or so that I’ve been using it.There were a few rough edges for my use case, however:The built-in GUI elements and examples were all heavily oriented around mouse or touchscreen navigation. Game Bub only has buttons for navigation, however, so I had to make my own widgets (buttons, lists) that worked with key navigation. This involved a few hacks, because Slint’s focus handling was a little bit simplistic.The built-in GUI styles looked (in my opinion) bad on a low DPI screen. Text was excessively anti-aliased and hard to read at small sizes. This was also fixed by building my own widgets.Slint doesn’t have a great story around supporting different “screens” – I had to build some of my own infrastructure to be able to support navigation between the main menu, games, rom select, settings, etc.The GUI is rendered on the MCU, and then the rendered framebuffer is sent over to the FPGA. Slint supports partial rendering, where only the parts of the screen that have changed are updated, which improved performance. The FPGA maintains a copy of the framebuffer and ultimately is responsible for driving the display. This has a few advantages over driving the display directly from the MCU:Sending a framebuffer at 40 MHz QSPI to the FPGA is 16x faster than sending it to the LCD controller at 10 MHz (the fastest speed supported by the ILI9488)The UI is rendered at 240x160 to improve performance and maintain the GBA aesthetic, but the LCD controller doesn’t have a scaler, so the MCU would have to send 4x the pixels. The FPGA can easily scale the UI framebuffer itself.The FPGA can composite the emulator output with a semi-transparent “overlay” to support an in-game menu, volume / brightness bars, battery notifications, etc.An external display (e.g. monitor or TV) can be driven by the FPGA via HDMII spent some time making a variety of firmware improvements, mostly polish and quality-of-life. I added a settings screen to set the date and time, whether to use Game Boy (DMG) or Game Boy Color (CGB) mode when playing Game Boy games, etc.Then I improved the ROM select file browser, and added a battery level indicator.I also got sick of having to take the microSD card out of the device and connect it to my computer through a series of adapters (microSD to SD to USB-A to USB-C), so I implemented a basic utility to expose the microSD card as a USB Mass Storage Device, using TinyUSB and the ESP32-S3’s USB-OTG capabilities.It was a little bit more difficult than I expected, because USB Mass Storage requires the device to provide raw block access. This means that the filesystem has to be unmounted by the device, otherwise the device and host could conflict and corrupt the filesystem. The ESP32-S3 also only supports USB Full Speed, for a practical maximum transfer speed of ~600KB/sec. It’s really useful for transferring save files or updating the FPGA bitstreams, but less useful for transferring a large number of ROM files.Later, I implemented MBC7 support in the Game Boy emulator for Kirby Tilt ’n Tumble, using the on-board accelerometer.After I implemented a decent amount of software functionality, I decided to finish the enclosure design. The bare board just wasn’t cutting it anymore, and the taped LCD module/loose speakers/rubber-banded battery contraption was fragile.Game Bub looking rough without an enclosureI came into this project without any CAD or 3D printing experience. I looked at a few different CAD software packages, and I ultimately settled on FreeCAD, primarily because it was free and open source. I learned how to use the software with some video tutorials. FreeCAD, unfortunately, was a little bit rough around the edges and I ended up running into some annoying issues. Nevertheless, I powered through and finished the design.FreeCAD view of the enclosure and some buttonsI found parametric modeling, where the geometry of the model is defined by constraints and dimensions, to be intuitive. However overall, I found 3D CAD to be very time consuming. I think a large part of this is my inexperience, but thinking in three dimensions is a lot more difficult than, say, a 2D PCB layout. Creating a full assembly was even more difficult: I had to visualize how the front and rear pieces would fit together, where the screws would go, and how the buttons, screen, speaker, cartridge slot, battery, and ports would all fit in. This project definitely pushed the boundaries of my (previously non-existent) product design skills.After finishing the design, I printed out the technical drawing at a 1:1 scale and physically placed the board and other components down as a final check. Then, I sent it to JLCPCB for manufacturing. I opted for SLA resin printing, for high precision and a smooth finish.Enclosure technical drawingAfter a couple weeks, I got the finished enclosure and custom buttons back.Front and rear half, outsideI put the buttons, speakers, and screen into the enclosure, screwed on the PCB, and put the whole thing together.Assembling the front sideGame Bub, fully assembled and functionalI wasn’t sure how dimensionally accurate the 3D printing would be, so I added a lot of extra clearance around the buttons and ports. As it turned out, the printing was very precise, so the buttons rattled around a little in the oversized button holes.It’s a little bit chunky (smaller than an original Game Boy, though!) and the ergonomics aren’t ideal, but I was really happy to finally have an enclosure. It actually started (sort of) looking like a real product, and I wasn’t constantly worried about breaking it anymore.Game Boy Advance support#I won’t go into all of the details of how I wrote the emulator here (this article is already long enough!). If you’re interested, my previous article about my Game Boy FPGA emulator goes into detail about the general process of writing an emulator, and for a high-level introduction to the Game Boy Advance (from a technical perspective), I recommend Rodrigo Copetti’s article. In general, I tried to implement the emulator the way it might actually have been implemented in the original hardware: each cycle of the FPGA corresponds to one actual hardware cycle (no cheating!).As with the Game Boy, I did nearly all of my development with a simulator backed by Verilator and SDL. By the end of the development process, the simulator was running at about 8% of the real-time speed (on an M3 MacBook Air with excellent single-core performance), which was a bit painful.The Game Boy Advance CPU, the ARM7TDMI, is significantly more complicated than the Game Boy’s SM83 (a Z80 / 8080-ish hybrid). However, in some ways, it was easier to understand and implement: the ARM7TDMI is much closer to a simple modern processor architecture, and it’s extensively documented by ARM. For example, the ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual has block diagrams and detailed cycle-by-cycle instruction timing descriptions.I had a lot of fun implementing the CPU. The architecture has a three-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute) – a division that feels natural when you implement it in hardware. The ARM7TDMI has two instruction sets: the standard 32-bit ARM instruction set, and the compressed 16-bit THUMB instruction set. I implemented the CPU the way it works in hardware, where the only difference between ARM and THUMB is the decode stage.As I was implementing the CPU, I wrote test cases for each instruction. Each test checks the functionality of the instruction: processor state, register values after, as well as the cycle-by-cycle behavior and interaction with the memory bus. This was helpful for catching regressions as I implemented more and more control logic. It was also really satisfying to be able to implement individual instructions, then write the tests, and check that everything worked.Chisel made it easy to write out the CPU control logic. The CPU control logic is a state machine that generates microarchitectural control signals (e.g. bus A should hold the value from the first read register, bus B should hold an immediate value, the memory unit should start fetching the computed address, etc.). Chisel allowed me to collect common functionality into functions (e.g.  to set up the signals to dispatch the next decoded instruction, or  to signal that the pipeline should be flushed and a new instruction should be fetched from the current program counter).I found it helpful to draw out timing diagrams with WaveDrom when working through instructions, especially to deal with the pipelined memory bus.My timing diagram of the ARM7TDMI branch instructionsBy mid-May (about a month later), I finished the CPU implementation (with occasional bug fixes after) and moved onto the rest of the system.PPU, MMIO, and everything else#Over the next month and a half, I implemented the majority of the rest of the Game Boy Advance. The CPU interacts with the rest of the system via memory-mapped IO (MMIO) registers. Unlike the Game Boy CPU, which can only access memory a single byte at a time, the ARM7TDMI can make 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit accesses. This complicates MMIO, and the different hardware registers and memory regions in the GBA respond to different access widths in different ways.I started with the Picture Processing Unit (PPU), which produces the video output. The author of NanoBoyAdvance, fleroviux, had helpfully documented the PPU VRAM access patterns, which gave a lot of insight into how the PPU might work internally. Tonc was also immensely helpful for implementing the PPU and testing individual pieces of functionality.(Sort of) running a Tonc PPU demoThe PPU took a few weeks, and then I moved onto DMA, followed by hardware timers, and audio. Of course, as I’d try new tests, demos, and games, I’d uncover bugs and fix them.Kirby  in Dream LandGame Boy and Game Boy Advance cartridges use the same 32-pin connector. However, they work very differently. The Game Boy cartridge bus is asynchronous: the game outputs the 16-bit address (64 KiB address space) on one set of pins and lowers the  pin. Some time later, the 8-bit read data from the ROM stabilizes on a separate set of pins.For the GBA, Nintendo extended the bus data width to 16-bit and the address space to 25-bit (32 MiB). However, they kept roughly the same set of pins, accomplishing this by multiplexing the 24 data/address pins: the console outputs the address (in increments of the data word size of 16-bits, for a 24-bit physical address), then lowers the  signal to “latch” the address in the cartridge. Then, each time the console pulses the  pin, the cartridge increments its latched address and outputs the next data over the same pins. This allows for a continuous read of sequential data without having to send a new address for each access. The GBA also allows games to configure cartridge access timings to support different ROM chips.I had to do a lot of my own research here. Software emulators don’t need to care about the precise timing of the cartridge bus, so there wasn’t much documentation. To figure out the exact cycle-accurate timing, I used a Saleae logic analyzer and connected it to the cartridge bus. I wrote a test program for the GBA to do different types of accesses (reads, writes, sequential, non-sequential, DMA) with different timing configurations.Cartridge bus analysis setupAfter coming up with numerous scenarios (especially around the interaction between DMA and the CPU, and starting and stopping burst accesses), I came up with a consistent model for how cartridge accesses worked. I created some timing diagrams to help:Timing diagram of a non-sequential access followed by a sequential accessFinally, I started implementing the cartridge controller state machine based on my observations, paired with an emulated cartridge implementation. With the emulated cartridge, I was able to properly run real games in the simulator.I quickly implemented physical cartridge support, to be able to finally run it on the actual FPGA. I connected the signals, built a new bitstream, and… it didn’t work at all. The Game Boy Advance boot screen ran, but it didn’t get any further than that. I implemented the emulated cartridge on the FPGA (reading ROM files from the SD card), and it worked! Which was great, but physical cartridges still didn’t.I used the logic analyzer to observe how my emulator was interacting with the cartridge compared to how an actual GBA, and found numerous issues.One of the first things I noticed was short glitches on the  line. I knew these had to be glitches (rather than incorrect logic), because they were 8 nanoseconds long, much shorter than the ~59.6ns clock period. Since the cartridge latches the address on a falling edge of , glitches cause it to latch an address when it shouldn’t, screwing up reads.Glitches on the cartridge busHere, I learned an important lesson in digital design: output signals should come directly from flip-flops, with no logic in between.After each flip-flop outputs a new value (on the rising edge of the clock), the signals propagate through the chip. As they propagate, taking different paths of different lengths throughout the chip, the output from each lookup table (LUT) is unstable. These values only stabilize near the end of the clock cycle (assuming the design met timing closure), and then each flip-flop stores the stable value at the next rising edge. If you output a signal from logic, this instability is visible from outside of the chip, manifesting as glitches in the output signal. If you instead output the signal from a flip-flop, it’ll change only on each clock edge, remaining stable in the middle.And of course, I had written the cartridge controller without thinking about this, and  of the output signals were generated from logic. I rewrote the controller to output everything from flip-flops, which had a series of cascading changes since all of the signals now had to be computed one clock cycle earlier than I expected.There were other issues too – part of the problem was that my emulated cartridge model was too permissive, and didn’t catch some fairly obvious incorrect behavior. After a few days of intensive debugging with the logic analyzer, I got to the point where I could play games from physical cartridges.Metroid: Zero Mission running from the cartridgeCartridge prefetch buffer#The ARM7TDMI has a single shared instruction and data memory bus. As a result, a long series of sequential memory accesses is rare. Even a linear piece of code without branches that includes “load” or “store” instructions would produce a series of non-sequential memory accesses, as the CPU fetches an instruction from one location, loads a register from a different location, and then goes back to fetching the next instruction.This poses a real performance issue on the GBA, because every non-sequential access from the cartridge incurs a multi-cycle penalty. Nintendo attempted to mitigate this somewhat with the “prefetch buffer” (read this post by endrift, the author of mGBA, for more details) which attempts to keep a cartridge read burst active between CPU accesses. Without emulating the prefetch buffer, some games lag (I noticed this the most in Mario Kart Super Circuit, and some rooms of Metroid: Zero Mission).The prefetch buffer, while simple in theory, is not well documented and has a lot of corner cases and weird interactions. Emulator developers often start by taking a shortcut: making all cartridge accesses take a single cycle when the prefetch buffer is enabled. This wouldn’t work for me, since I actually had to interface with the physical cartridge.So, I set out to do some more research to figure out exactly how the prefetch buffer worked. After making some educated guesses and tests, I came up with a reasonable model of how it might work.Notes about the prefetch state machineActually implementing it took a lot of work, and I kept stumbling upon more and more corner cases. Eventually I got to the point where all games appeared to run at full speed, and most importantly, didn’t randomly crash. My implementation isn’t perfect: there are still a few mGBA test suite timing tests I don’t pass, but it’s certainly sufficient to play games.: standard duplex SPI, used for communicating with accessories: custom multi-drop UART-like protocol, used to link up to four GBAs together for multiplayer games: the Nintendo N64 and GameCube controller protocol, used to connect to a GameCube: duplex UART with flow control, : controlling the four pins individually as GPIO, The timing of these isn’t well documented, so I did my own research.A  mode transfer with no attached consolesI did a lot of testing with examples from the gba-link-connection library, intended for homebrew GBA games, but helpful for testing the different transfer modes in a controlled environment.Multiplayer Mario Kart with Game Bub and a GBAGame Bub linked to a GameCube playing Animal CrossingDuring the emulator development, I had used various test ROMs (mentioned before) to test basic functionality in isolation. As my emulator became mature enough to run commercial games, however, I started to shift some of my focus to accuracy-focused test ROMs.These test ROMs (such as the mGBA test suite) generally test really specific hardware quirks and timing. For example, they might test what happens when you run an instruction that ARM calls “unpredictable”, or the exact number of cycles it takes to service an interrupt in specific scenarios, or the value of the “carry” flag after performing a multiplication. These are the kinds of things that don’t actually matter for playing games, but present a fun challenge and a way to “score” your emulator against others. This also highlights the collaborative nature of the emulation development community: people sharing their research and helping each other out.I won’t talk about all of the tests here (for my emulator’s test results, see this page). But I do want to mention the . This is an official test cartridge from Nintendo, likely used as part of a factory test or RMA procedure. Apparently, Nintendo has  used it to test their emulators (e.g. their GBA emulator on the Nintendo Switch). This test has generally been considered to be difficult to pass (it tests some specific hardware quirks), but it’s easier now that the tests have been thoroughly reverse engineered and documented. Still, passing it is a nice milestone:Passing the AGB Aging CartridgeSecond hardware revision#Towards the end of 2024, approximately one year after I originally designed Game Bub, I decided to make a second hardware revision. Over the past year, I had been keeping track of all of the things I would want to change in a future revision. Since the first version of Game Bub miraculously worked without any major issues, this list was primarily minor issues and ergonomics changes.I fixed the minor I2C power issues, removed the reference designators from the PCB silkscreen (they looked messy with the dense board, and I didn’t use them for anything anyway), and changed around some test points. I improved the rumble circuit to be more responsive, and switched to a PCB-mounted vibration motor.The first version of Game Bub was fairly thick, measuring 12.9mm at the top and 21.9mm on the bottom. The thickness of the rear enclosure was dictated by the thickness of Game Boy cartridges, but I made several changes to the front. I moved the  (8.5mm!) link port to the back, and removed the HDMI port (more on that later). I changed the headphone jack (5.0mm tall – no wonder they started getting removed from phones) to a mid-mount one that sunk into the PCB and reduced the overall height.I also switched from an  module (3.1mm depth) to an  (2.4mm depth). I should have done this from the beginning, I just didn’t even know the ESP32-S3-MINI existed. This had the side effect of giving me 3 more GPIOs, which allowed me to put the FPGA and LCD on separate SPI busses, avoiding the minor issue of an unpowered FPGA interfering with LCD communication, and allowed for faster boot because the LCD could be configured at the same time as the FPGA.I switched the speakers, from the fully-enclosed CES-20134-088PMB to the CMS-160903-18S-X8. I made this change primarily for ease of assembly. The first speaker had a wire connector that plugged into the board, and I found it difficult to connect during assembly without having the wire interfere with buttons. The new speaker is smaller and has a spring contact connector, so it just presses against the PCB as the device is assembled. This required some speaker enclosure design – an unenclosed speaker in free air sounds quiet and tinny.I reworked the layout of the face buttons and D-pad to match the spacing of the Nintendo DSi. This allowed me to use the silicone membranes from the DSi for an improved button feel and reduced rattling. I was also hoping to use the plastic buttons from the DSi (which were higher quality compared to my 3D printed buttons), but even with the new thinner design, the buttons weren’t quite tall enough to be easily pressed.I created another timelapse of my modifications to produce the second version of the PCB:Revision 2 board layout timelapseFor the second revision of the enclosure, I switched to Fusion 360 for the CAD work. While I would have preferred to keep using FreeCAD, I found that it was making it harder for me to be productive. Fusion 360 has a free version for hobbyists (with some limitations that have gradually increased over time), and overall I’ve found it very pleasant to use.Fusion 360 view of the second enclosure, fully assembledUnlike with the first revision, I waited until I had a final design for both the enclosure and the PCB before getting anything manufactured. This let me go back and forth, making small modifications to each of them as needed.I wanted to make the end result look more polished and professional, so I contracted a factory to produce custom LCD cover glass, made out of 0.7mm thick tempered glass with a black silkscreen. It was relatively expensive for a low quantity order, but I’m really happy with how it turned out.Custom LCD cover glass with adhesive backingManufacturing and assembly#I got the PCBs manufactured and assembled, this time with black solder mask to look .Assembled PCB, revision 2I had two enclosures made. The first was black PA-12 Nylon, printed with MJF. Nylon is strong and durable, and the MJF 3D printing technology produces a slightly grainy surface that’s really pleasant to hold in your hand.Closeup of the nylon grainy textureThe second one was made of transparent resin (SLA, like before). This lets me show off the PCB that I worked so hard on, and evokes the transparent electronics trend from the 90s.Assembly was a lot easier this time around: the silicone membranes held the face buttons in place, the speakers had a spring contact instead of wires, and the shoulder button assembly was better. In the first revision, I had excessively large tolerances because I wasn’t sure how precise the 3D printing would be. In the second version, I was able to shrink these.The final product looked and felt a lot better, too. The edges were more rounded, and the device was thinner and easier to hold. The buttons felt  better to press and didn’t rattle around, and the cover glass over the LCD added polish.First revision (left), second revision (center and right)I previously mentioned that I removed the full-size HDMI port from the first revision. I had first planned to change it to a mini-HDMI or micro-HDMI port to reduce the size, but I was worried about durability.What I  wanted to do was output video through the USB-C port, avoiding the need for any HDMI port at all. Unfortunately, I had already concluded earlier that I wouldn’t be able to output DisplayPort video signals from the FPGA, which meant that I couldn’t use the standard USB-C DisplayPort alternate mode.However, an idea struck me towards the end of 2024: I didn’t actually  to use the DisplayPort alt-mode. The USB-C connector, in addition to the USB 2.0 D+/D- pins, has four differential pairs (for USB superspeed). Conveniently, HDMI  uses four differential pairs. The USB specification allows for vendor-specific alt-modes, so I could just implement my own, outputting the HDMI signal directly from the FPGA over the additional pins. Then I could build a custom dock that takes those pins and connects them to the data lines of an HDMI port.According to the USB specification, alternate modes must be negotiated by both sides first, using the USB-C Power Delivery (USB-PD) protocol, to prevent them from interfering with devices that aren’t expecting them. I don’t actually have a USB-PD controller in Game Bub (too much added complexity), so I took a shortcut: have a microcontroller in the dock communicate with the Game Bub over regular USB and perform a handshake before enabling HDMI output from the FPGA. Once Game Bub detects that it’s been disconnected from the dock, it can just switch back to using the internal display.I realized that the dock also presents another opportunity for controller support. I originally wanted to build wireless controller support into the handheld, but the ESP32-S3 only supports Bluetooth Low Energy, and the majority of controllers use Bluetooth Classic. Fortunately, the Raspberry Pi Pico W (with an RP2040 MCU) supports both types of Bluetooth, so I just decided to use that as the microcontroller on the dock. Game controllers connect to the dock over Bluetooth, and the Pico sends the controller inputs to the device. I wired up the  and  USB-C pins as a direct connection between the FPGA and the dock for low latency input.The RP2040 acts as the USB host, and Game Bub only needs to be a device. I also added a USB hub chip and some additional USB ports on the back of the dock to allow for wired controller support too. Just like with wireless controllers, the dock handles the direct controller communication, and just passes inputs back to the main Game Bub unit.Since the dock is so simple (comparatively), it only took about a day to design and lay out.I had also hoped to use the dock to solve another problem around HDMI output: HDMI sinks (monitors, TVs) pull the HDMI data lines up to 3.3 volts, and can actually backfeed power to the HDMI source. For Game Bub, this meant that a powered-off unit would turn itself on when connected over HDMI. I used a HDMI buffer chip in the dock to try to alleviate this problem, but the chip I used wasn’t actually properly suited to this use-case and interfered with video output, so I had to carefully rework the board to bypass the chip. I’ll have to fix it in a later revision.Bypassing the HDMI buffer chipAfter the rework, HDMI output worked! The rest of the features are still a work in progress.Game Bub PCB on the dock, connected to an external monitorCongratulations on reading this far! This writeup ended up being incredibly long, even with a lot of details left out.I’m proud of what I accomplished over the last year and a half: I met all of my goals to produce a polished handheld FPGA retrogaming device. I pushed my electrical engineering and product design skills to the limit, and learned a lot in the process. Professional product and hardware designers deserve  respect.I deliberately designed this project with lots of possible extension opportunities to keep me occupied for a long time. I worked hard to get to the point where I’m comfortable sharing Game Bub with the world, but I still have a long list of TODOs for the future.In the near term, I’m going to work on finishing the dock, implementing wireless controller support (and maybe wired). I plan to use the Bluepad32 library to do so.I also want to improve the accuracy of my Game Boy Advance emulator: my goal here is to someday pass the entire mGBA test suite. I hope that I can contribute back to the wonderful  community with my emulator, and I plan to write-up some of my research around the GBA cartridge interface and link port.I have a long list of mostly minor changes to make to the MCU firmware: improving UI render performance, bits of polish like low battery notifications, eliminating display glitching when reloading the FPGA, and that sort of thing. I also plan to add more utilities, like a cartridge dumper and save backup/restore feature.Some day, I want to emulate the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter over Wi-Fi, e.g. with ESP-NOW. This won’t be compatible with the original wireless adapter, unfortunately, since that uses raw 2.4 GHz modulation rather than Wi-Fi.I designed Game Bub with extremely low production volumes in mind, using off-the-shelf commodity parts to keep the overall cost down. However, there are a few things I would have liked to be able to do, but are only possible with much higher volumes:A better LCD module (likely custom): native landscape mode to avoid the need for triple-buffering. Ideally a 720x480 resolution display, to allow for 3x GBA scaling and filter effects.High-quality injection molded case and buttons: 3D printing is great for low volume production, but an injection molded case would be great. It would be more precise (allowing for tighter tolerances), stronger, and allow for significantly more color options.Custom battery pack: or at least customizing the length of the connector wire. The current solution is hacky and doesn’t make the best use of internal space, due to limited off-the-shelf battery options.Smaller BGA parts for SRAM and SDRAM to free up board space (and move internal signals to 1.8 volts): this is actually something that would be possible in smaller volumes too, if I were willing to send parts from Mouser or DigiKey to JLCPCB for assembly.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How GitHub uses CodeQL to secure GitHub</title><link>https://github.blog/engineering/how-github-uses-codeql-to-secure-github/</link><author>Brandon Stewart</author><category>official</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://github.blog/">Dev - Github Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GitHub’s Product Security Engineering team writes code and implements tools that help secure the code that powers GitHub. We use GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) to discover, track, and remediate vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding standards at scale. One tool we rely heavily on to analyze our code at scale is CodeQL.CodeQL is GitHub’s static analysis engine that powers automated security analyses. You can use it to query code in much the same way you would query a database. It provides a much more robust way to analyze code and uncover problems than an old-fashioned text search through a codebase.The following post will detail how we use CodeQL to keep GitHub secure and how you can apply these lessons to your own organization. You will learn why and how we use:Custom query packs (and how we create and manage them).  Variant analysis to uncover potentially insecure programming practices.We employ CodeQL in a variety of ways at GitHub. with the default and security-extended query suites
Default setup with the default and security-extended query suites meets the needs of the vast majority of our over 10,000 repositories. With these settings, pull requests automatically get a security review from CodeQL.  
A few repositories, like our large Ruby monolith, need extra special attention, so we use advanced setup with a query pack containing custom queries to really tailor to our needs.  
To conduct variant analysis and quick auditing, we use MRVA. We also write custom CodeQL queries to detect code patterns that are either specific to GitHub’s codebases or patterns we want a security engineer to manually review.The specific custom Actions workflow step we use on our monolith is pretty simple. It looks like this:- name: Initialize CodeQL
    uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
    with:
      languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
      config-file: ./.github/codeql/${{ matrix.language }}/codeql-config.yml
Our Ruby configuration is pretty standard, but advanced setup offers a variety of configuration options using custom configuration files. The interesting part is the  option, which is how we enable our custom query pack as part of the CodeQL analysis. This pack contains a collection of CodeQL queries we have written for Ruby, specifically for the GitHub codebase.So, let’s dive deeper into why we did that—and how!Publishing our CodeQL query packInitially, we published CodeQL query files directly to the GitHub monolith repository, but we moved away from this approach for several reasons:It required going through the production deployment process for each new or updated query.  Queries not included in a query pack were not pre-compiled, which slowed down CodeQL analysis in CI.  Our test suite for CodeQL queries ran as part of the monolith’s CI jobs. When a new version of the CodeQL CLI was released, it sometimes caused the query tests to fail because of changes in the query output, even when there were no changes to the code in the pull request. This often led to confusion and frustration among engineers, as the failure wasn’t related to their pull request changes.By switching to publishing a query pack to GitHub Container Registry (GCR), we’ve simplified our process and eliminated many of these pain points, making it easier to ship and maintain our CodeQL queries. So while it’s  to deploy custom CodeQL query files directly to a repository, we recommend publishing CodeQL queries as a query pack to the GCR for easier deployment and faster iteration.When setting up our custom query pack, we faced several considerations, particularly around managing dependencies like the  package.To ensure our custom queries remain maintainable and concise, we extend classes from the default query suite, such as the  library. This allows us to leverage existing functionality rather than reinventing the wheel, keeping our queries concise and maintainable. However, changes to the CodeQL library API can introduce breaking changes, potentially deprecating our queries or causing errors. Since CodeQL runs as part of our CI, we wanted to minimize the chance of this happening, as this can lead to frustration and loss of trust from developers.We develop our queries against the latest version of the  package, ensuring we’re always working with the most up-to-date functionality. To mitigate the risk of breaking changes affecting CI, we pin the  version when we’re ready to release, locking it in the  file. This guarantees that when our queries are deployed, they will run with the specific version of  we’ve tested, avoiding potential issues from unintentional updates.Here’s how we manage this setup:In our qlpack.yml, we set the dependency to use the latest version of During development, this configuration pulls in the latest version) of  when running , ensuring we’re always up to date.
// Our custom query pack's qlpack.yml

library: false
name: github/internal-ruby-codeql
version: 0.2.3
extractor: 'ruby'
dependencies:
  codeql/ruby-all: "*"
tests: 'test'
description: "Ruby CodeQL queries used internally at GitHub"
Before releasing, we lock the version in the  file, specifying the exact version to ensure stability and prevent issues in CI.
// Our custom query pack's codeql-pack.lock.yml

lockVersion: 1.0.0
dependencies:
 ...
 codeql/ruby-all:
   version: 1.0.6
This approach allows us to balance developing against the latest features of the  package while ensuring stability when we release.We also have a set of CodeQL unit tests that exercise our queries against sample code snippets, which helps us quickly determine if any query will cause errors before we publish our pack. These tests are run as part of the CI process in our query pack repository, providing an early check for issues. We strongly recommend writing unit tests for your custom CodeQL queries to ensure stability and reliability.Altogether, the basic flow for releasing new CodeQL queries via our pack is as follows:Open a pull request with the new query.  Write unit tests for the new query.  Increment the pack version in a new pull request.  Run  to resolve dependencies.  Correct unit tests as needed.  Publish the query pack to the GitHub Container Registry (GCR).  Repositories with the query pack in their config will start using the updated queries.We have found this flow balances our team’s development experience while ensuring stability in our published query pack.Configuring our repository to use our custom query packWe won’t provide a general recommendation on configuration here, given that it ultimately depends on how your organization deploys code. We opted against locking our pack to a particular version in our CodeQL configuration file (see above). Instead, we chose to manage our versioning by publishing the CodeQL package in GCR. This results in the GitHub monolith retrieving the latest published version of the query pack. To roll back changes, we simply have to republish the package. In one instance, we released a query that had a high number of false positives and we were able to publish a new version of the pack that removed that query in less than 15 minutes. This is faster than the time it would have taken us to merge a pull request on the monolith repository to roll back the version in the CodeQL configuration file.One of the problems we encountered with publishing the query pack in GCR was how to easily make the package available to multiple repositories within our enterprise. There are several approaches we explored.Grant access permissions for individual repositories. On the package management page, you can grant permissions for individual repositories to access your package. This was not a good solution for us since we have too many repositories for it to be feasible to do manually, yet there is not currently a way to configure programmatically using an API.   Mint a personal access token for the CodeQL action runner. We could have minted a personal access token (PAT) that has access to read all packages for our organization and added that to the CodeQL action runner. However, this would have required managing a new token, and it seemed a bit more permissive than we wanted because it could read  of our private packages rather than ones we explicitly allow it to have access to.  CodeQL query pack queriesWe write a variety of custom queries to be used in our custom query packs. These cover GitHub-specific patterns that aren’t included in the default CodeQL query pack. This allows us to tailor the analysis to patterns and preferences that are specific to our company and codebase. Some of the types of things we alert on using our custom query pack include:High-risk APIs specific to GitHub’s code that can be dangerous if they receive unsanitized user input.  Use of specific built-in Rails methods for which we have safer, custom methods or functions.    Required authorization methods not being used in our REST API endpoint definitions and GraphQL object/mutation definitions.  REST API endpoints and GraphQL mutations that require engineers to define access control methods to determine which actors can access them. (Specifically, the query detects the absence of this method definition to ensure that the actors’ permissions are being checked for these endpoints.)  Use of signed tokens so we can nudge engineers to include Product Security as a reviewer when using them.Custom queries can be used more for educational purposes rather than being blockers to shipping code. For example, we want to alert engineers when they use the ActiveRecord::decrypt method. This method should generally not be used in production code, as it will cause an encrypted column to become decrypted. We use the recommendation severity in the query metadata so these alerts are treated as more of an informational alert. That means this may trigger an alert in a pull request, but it won’t cause the CodeQL CI job to fail. We use this lower severity level to allow engineers to assess the impact of new queries without immediate blocking. Additionally, this alert level isn’t tracked through our Fundamentals program, meaning it doesn’t require immediate action, reflecting the query’s maturity as we continue to refine its relevance and risk assessment./**

Variant analysis (VA) refers to the process of searching for variants of security vulnerabilities. This is particularly useful when we’re responding to a bug bounty submission or a security incident. We use a combination of tools to do this, including GitHub’s code search functionality, custom scripts, and CodeQL.  We will often start by using code search to find patterns similar to the one that caused a particular vulnerability across numerous repositories. This is sometimes not good enough, as code search is not semantically aware, meaning that it cannot determine whether a given variable is an Active Record object or whether it is being used in an `if` expression. To answer those types of questions we turn to CodeQL.When we write CodeQL queries for variant analysis we are much less concerned about false positives, since the goal is to provide results for security engineers to analyze. The quality of the code is also not quite as important, as these queries will only be used for the duration of the VA effort. Some of the types of things we use CodeQL for during VAs are:Where are we using SHA1 hashes?  One of our internal API endpoints was vulnerable to SQLi according to a recent bug bounty report. Where are we passing user input to that API endpoint?   There is a problem with how some HTTP request libraries in Ruby handle the proxy setting. Can we look at places we are instantiating our HTTP request libraries with a proxy setting?One recent example involved a subtle vulnerability in Rails. We wanted to detect when the following condition was present in our code:A parameter was used to look up an Active Record object.  That parameter is later reused after the Active Record object is looked up.The concern with this condition is that it could lead to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability because Active Record finder methods can accept an array. If the code looks up an Active Record object in one call to determine if a given entity has access to a resource, but later uses a different element from that array to find an object reference, that can lead to an IDOR vulnerability. It would be difficult to write a query to detect  vulnerable instances of this pattern, but we were able to write a query that found potential vulnerabilities that gave us a list of code paths to manually analyze. We ran the query against a large number of our Ruby codebases using CodeQL’s MRVA.The query, which is a bit hacky and not quite production grade, is below:/**
 * @name wip array query
 * @description an array is passed to an AR finder object

CodeQL can be very useful for product security engineering teams to detect and prevent vulnerabilities at scale. We use a combination of queries that run in CI using our query pack and one-off queries run through MRVA to find potential vulnerabilities and communicate them to engineers. CodeQL isn’t only useful for finding security vulnerabilities, though; it is also useful for detecting the presence or absence of security controls that are defined in code. This saves our security team time by surfacing certain security problems automatically, and saves our engineers time by detecting them earlier in the development process.Writing custom CodeQL queriesWe have a large number of articles and resources for writing custom CodeQL queries.

The rest of the webpage, however, is about an imaginary architecture firm called Études, pulled from a sample webpage for a default WordPress theme called Twenty Twenty-Four. This remains the case a day after Elon Musk, in the Oval Office,  that all of DOGE’s supposed waste-cutting actions are transparent and are available on government websites. Musk is currently in charge of finding and eliminating "waste."“We actually are trying to be as transparent as possible. In fact, our actions—we post our actions to the DOGE handle on X, and to the DOGE website. So all of our actions, which are maximally transparent,” Musk said. “In fact, I don’t think there’s been — I don’t know the case that where [sic] an organization has been more transparent than the DOGE organization.”  contains the line “An official website of the United States government,” a single image of a dollar sign, the words “Department of Government Efficiency. The people voted for major reform,” and nothing else. The website for the US Digital Service, which has been renamed the US DOGE Service, has not been meaningfully updated since Trump was inaugurated. Waste.gov, meanwhile, says “Études is a pioneering firm that seamlessly merges creativity and functionality to redefine architectural excellence,” and various default images and text from the “” WordPress theme, which is also billed as “a flexible default theme.” The theme is “suitable for everyone, from casual bloggers to creative photographers or small businesses,” the theme’s page advertises. Seemingly, the inclusive nature of this theme extends its utility to those seeking to gut the federal government. Specifically, Waste.gov is an exact mirror of the “” for that theme.Notably, Waste.gov does not comply with various executive orders issued by Donald Trump because it contains the word “diverse” in the line “Our comprehensive suite of professional services caters to a diverse clientele, ranging from homeowners to commercial developers.” The imaginary architecture firm also offers “a commitment to innovation and sustainability.” Research on climate change and sustainability has been purged by this administration. The White House registered both waste.gov and DEI.gov—which redirects to waste.gov—last week, .Update: After this article was published, Waste.gov was put behind a password wall.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Podcast: AI Is Breaking Our Brains</title><link>https://www.404media.co/podcast-ai-is-breaking-our-brains/</link><author>Jason Koebler</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/ai-atrophy-yt-cover.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:34:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">Dev - 404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week we discuss a new Microsoft study that finds using generative AI is "atrophying" people's cognition and critical thinking skills, the right's war on Wikipedia, and, in the subscriber's section, the idea of posting against fascism.Subscribers-only video and embed below:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Slop of Musk and Trump on TikTok Racks Up 700 Million Views</title><link>https://www.404media.co/ai-slop-of-musk-and-trump-on-tiktok-racks-up-700-million-views/</link><author>Emanuel Maiberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/image6.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:11:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">Dev - 404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Videos that use AI generated voices of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are gaining a massive number of views on TikTok, showing that the platform is also suffering from the onslaught of AI-generated slop that has flooded every corner of the internet. According to Alexios Mantzarlis in his , 400 videos from about two dozen accounts dedicated to posting AI-generated audio of Trump and Musk making quasi-motivational statements have gained more than 700 million views between them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EuroPython Society: Board Report for January 2025</title><link>https://www.europython-society.org/board-report-for-january-2025/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:08:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The top priority for the board in January was finishing the hiring of our event manager.

Surprisingly, that was more than a decade ago. Getting the viewport width is as easy these days as easy as writing , but what does that translate to, say, in ? What about the other properties, like those that take a percentage, an angle, or an integer?Think about changing an element’s opacity, rotating it, or setting an animation progress based on the screen size. We would first need the  — which isn’t currently possible in CSS, right?What I am about to say isn’t a groundbreaking discovery, it was first described amazingly by Jane Ori in 2023. In short, we can use a weird hack (or feature) involving the  and  trigonometric functions to typecast a length (such as the viewport) to an integer. This opens  new layout possibilities, but my first experience was while writing an Almanac entry in which I just wanted to make an image’s opacity responsive.Resize the CodePen and the image will get more transparent as the screen size gets smaller, of course with some boundaries, so it doesn’t become invisible:This is the simplest we can do, but there is a lot more. Take, for example, this demo I did trying to combine many viewport-related effects. Resize the demo and the page feels alive: objects move, the background changes and the text smoothly wraps in place.I think it’s really cool, but I am no designer, so that’s the best my brain could come up with. Still, it may be too much for an introduction to this typecasting hack, so as a middle-ground, I’ll focus only on the title transition to showcase how all of it works:The idea behind this is to convert  to radians (a way to write angles) using , and then back to its original value using , with the perk of coming out as an integer. It should be achieved like this::root {
  --int-width: tan(atan2(100vw, 1px));
}But! Browsers aren’t too keep on this method, so a lot more wrapping is needed to make it work across all browsers. The following may seem like magic (or nonsense), so I recommend reading Jane’s post to better understand it, but this way it will work in all browsers:@property --100vw {
  syntax: "<length>";
  initial-value: 0px;
  inherits: false;
}

:root {
  --100vw: 100vw;
  --int-width: calc(10000 * tan(atan2(var(--100vw), 10000px)));
}Don’t worry too much about it. What’s important is our precious  variable, which holds the viewport size as an integer!Wideness: One number to rule them allRight now we have the viewport as an integer, but that’s just the first step. That integer isn’t super useful by itself. We oughta convert it to something else next since:different properties have different units, andwe want each property to go from a start value to an end value.Think about an image’s  going from  to , an object rotating from  to , or an element’s  going from  to . We want to interpolate between these values as  gets bigger, but right now it’s just an integer that usually ranges between  to , which is inflexible and can’t be easily converted to any of the end values.The best solution is to turn  into a number that goes from  to . So, as the screen gets bigger, we can multiply it by the desired end value. Lacking a better name, I call this “0-to-1” value . If we have , all the last examples become possible:/* If `--wideness is 0.5 */

.element {
  opacity: var(--wideness); /* is 0.5 */
  translate: rotate(calc(wideness(400px, 1200px) * 360deg)); /* is 180deg */
  offset-distance: calc(var(--wideness) * 100%); /* is 50% */
}So  is a value between  to  that represents how wide the screen is:  represents when the screen is narrow, and  represents when it’s wide. But we still have to set what those values mean in the viewport. For example, we may want  to be  and  to be , our viewport transitions will run between these values. Anything below and above is clamped to  and , respectively.In CSS, we can write that as follows::root {
  /* Both bounds are unitless */
  --lower-bound: 400; 
  --upper-bound: 1200;

  --wideness: calc(
    (clamp(var(--lower-bound), var(--int-width), var(--upper-bound)) - var(--lower-bound)) / (var(--upper-bound) - var(--lower-bound))
  );
}Besides easy conversions, the  variable lets us define the lower and upper limits in which the transition should run. And what’s even better, we can set the transition zone at a middle spot so that the user can see it in its full glory. Otherwise, the screen would need to be  so that  reaches  and who knows how wide to reach .We got the . What’s next?For starters, the title’s markup is divided into spans since there is no CSS-way to select specific words in a sentence:<h1><span>Resize</span> and <span>enjoy!</span></h1>And since we will be doing the line wrapping ourselves, it’s important to unset some defaults:h1 {
  position: absolute; /* Keeps the text at the center */
  white-space: nowrap; /* Disables line wrapping */
}The transition should work without the base styling, but it’s just too plain-looking. They are below if you want to copy them onto your stylesheet:And just as a recap, our current hack looks like this:@property --100vw {
  syntax: "<length>";
  initial-value: 0px;
  inherits: false;
}

:root {
  --100vw: 100vw;
  --int-width: calc(10000 * tan(atan2(var(--100vw), 10000px)));
  --lower-bound: 400;
  --upper-bound: 1200;

  --wideness: calc(
    (clamp(var(--lower-bound), var(--int-width), var(--upper-bound)) - var(--lower-bound)) / (var(--upper-bound) - var(--lower-bound))
  );
}OK, enough with the set-up. It’s time to use our new values and make the viewport transition. We first gotta identify  the title should be rearranged for smaller screens: as you saw in the initial demo, the first  goes up and right, while the second  does the opposite and goes down and left. So, the end position for both spans translates to the following values:h1 {
  span:nth-child(1) {
    display: inline-block; /* So transformations work */
    position: relative;
    bottom: 1.2lh;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%);
  }

  span:nth-child(2) {
    display: inline-block; /* So transformations work */
    position: relative;
    bottom: -1.2lh;
    left: -50%;
    transform: translate(50%);
  }
}Before going forward, both formulas are basically the same, but with different signs. We can rewrite them at once bringing one new variable: . It will be either  or  and define which direction to run the transition:h1 {
  span {
    display: inline-block;
    position: relative;
    bottom: calc(1.2lh * var(--direction));
    left: calc(50% * var(--direction));
    transform: translate(calc(-50% * var(--direction)));
    }

  span:nth-child(1) {
    --direction: 1;
  }

  span:nth-child(2) {
    --direction: -1;
  }
}
The next step would be bringing  into the formula so that the values change as the screen resizes. However, we can’t just multiply everything by . Why? Let’s see what happens if we do:span {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  bottom: calc(var(--wideness) * 1.2lh * var(--direction));
  left: calc(var(--wideness) * 50% * var(--direction));
  transform: translate(calc(var(--wideness) * -50% * var(--direction)));
}As you’ll see, everything is backwards! The words wrap when the screen is too wide, and unwrap when the screen is too narrow:Unlike our first examples, in which the transition ends as  increases from  to , we want to complete the transition as  decreases from  to , i.e. while the screen gets smaller the properties need to reach their end value. This isn’t a big deal, as we can rewrite our formula as a subtraction, in which the subtracting number gets bigger as  increases:span {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  bottom: calc((1.2lh - var(--wideness) * 1.2lh) * var(--direction));
  left: calc((50% - var(--wideness) * 50%) * var(--direction));
  transform: translate(calc((-50% - var(--wideness) * -50%) * var(--direction)));
}And now everything moves in the right direction while resizing the screen!However, you will notice how words move in a straight line and some words overlap while resizing. We can’t allow this since a user with a specific screen size may get stuck at that point in the transition. Viewport transitions are cool, but not at the expense of ruining the experience for certain screen sizes.Instead of moving in a straight line, words should move in a curve such that they pass around the central word. Don’t worry, making a curve here is easier than it looks: just move the spans twice as fast in the x-axis as they do in the y-axis. This can be achieved by multiplying  by , although we have to cap it at  so it doesn’t overshoot past the final value.span {
 display: inline-block;
 position: relative;
 bottom: calc((1.2lh - var(--wideness) * 1.2lh) * var(--direction));
 left: calc((50% - min(var(--wideness) * 2, 1) * 50%) * var(--direction));
 transform: translate(calc((-50% - min(var(--wideness) * 2, 1) * -50%) * var(--direction)));
}Look at that beautiful curve, just avoiding the central text:This is just the beginning!It’s surprising how powerful having the viewport as an integer can be, and what’s even crazier, the last example is one of the most basic transitions you could make with this typecasting hack.

Test your knowledge with our interactive “Python Keywords: An Introduction” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:In this quiz, you'll test your understanding of Python keywords and soft keywords. These reserved words have specific functions and restrictions in Python, and understanding how to use them correctly is fundamental for building Python programs.Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can’t be used for anything but those specific purposes. These keywords are always available—you’ll never have to import them into your code.Python keywords are different from Python’s built-in functions and types. The built-in functions and types are also always available, but they aren’t as restrictive as the keywords in their usage. An example of something you  do with Python keywords is assign something to them. If you try, then you’ll get a . You won’t get a  if you try to assign something to a built-in function or type, but it still isn’t a good idea. For a more in-depth explanation of ways keywords can be misused, check out Invalid Syntax in Python: Common Reasons for SyntaxError.There are thirty-five keywords in Python. Here’s a list of them, each linked to its relevant section in this tutorial:Two keywords have additional uses beyond their initial use cases. The  keyword is also used with loops and with  and  in addition to in conditional statements. The  keyword is most commonly used in  statements, but also used with the  keyword.The list of Python keywords and soft keywords has changed over time. For example, the  and  keywords weren’t added until Python 3.7. Also, both  and  were keywords in Python 2.7 but were turned into built-in functions in Python 3 and no longer appear in the keywords list.As mentioned above, you’ll get an error if you try to assign something to a Python keyword. Soft keywords, on the other hand, aren’t that strict. They syntactically act as keywords only in certain conditions.This new capability was made possible thanks to the introduction of the PEG parser in Python 3.9, which changed how the interpreter reads the source code.Leveraging the PEG parser allowed for the introduction of structural pattern matching in Python. In order to use intuitive syntax, the authors picked , , and  for the pattern matching statements. Notably,  and  are widely used for this purpose in many other programming languages.To prevent conflicts with existing Python code that already used , , and  as variable or function names, Python developers decided to introduce the concept of soft keywords.Currently, there are four  in Python:You can use the links above to jump to the soft keywords you’d like to read about, or you can continue reading for a guided tour.Value Keywords: , , There are three Python keywords that are used as values. These values are singleton values that can be used over and over again and always reference the exact same object. You’ll most likely see and use these values a lot.There are a few terms used in the sections below that may be new to you. They’re defined here, and you should be aware of their meaning before proceeding:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EuroPython Society: Changes in the Grants Programme for 2025</title><link>https://www.europython-society.org/changes-in-the-grants-programme-for-2025/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:16:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We are increasing transparency and reducing ambiguity in the guidelines.We would like to support more events with our limited budgetWe’ve introduced caps for events in order to make sure all grants are fairly given and we can support more communities.We’ve set aside 10% of our budget for the local community. The EPS introduced a Grant Programme in 2017. Since then, we have granted almost EUR 350k through the programme, partly via EuroPython Finaid and by directly supporting other Python events and projects across Europe. In the last two years, the Grant Programme has grown to EUR 100k per year, with even more requests coming in.With this growth come new challenges in how to distribute funds fairly so that more events can benefit. Looking at data from the past two years, we’ve often been close to or over our budget. The guidelines haven’t been updated in a while. As grant requests become more complex, we’d like to simplify and clarify the process, and better explain it on our website.We would also like to acknowledge that EuroPython, when traveling around Europe, has an additional impact on the host country, and we’d like to set aside part of the budget for the local community.The Grant Programme is also a primary funding source for EuroPython Finaid. To that end, we aim to allocate 30% of the total Grant Programme budget to Finaid, an increase from the previous 25%.We’ve updated the text on our website, and split it into multiple sub-pages to make it easier to navigate. The website now includes a checklist of what we would like to see in a grant application, and a checklist for the Grants Workgroup – so that when you apply for the Grant you already know the steps that it will go through later and when you can expect an answer from us.We looked at the data from previous years, and size and timing of the grant requests. With the growing number and size of the grants, to make it more accessible to smaller conferences and conferences happening later in the year, we decided to introduce max caps per grant and split the budget equally between the first and second half of the year. We would also explicitly split the total budget into three categories – 30% goes to the EuroPython finaid, 10% is reserved for projects in the host country. The remaining 60% of the budget goes to fund other Python Conferences. This is similar to the split in previous years, but more explicit and transparent.Using 2024 data, and the budget available for Community Grants (60% of total), we’ve simulated different budget caps and found a sweet spot at 6000EUR, where we are able to support all the requests with most of the grants being below that limit. For 2025 we expect to receive a similar or bigger number of requests.We are introducing a special 10% pool of money to be used on projects in the host country (in 2025 that’s again Czech Republic). This pool is set aside at the beginning of the year, with one caveat that we would like to deploy it in the first half of the year. Whatever is left unused goes back to the Community Pool to be used in second half of the year.Fairer Funding: By spreading our grants out during the year, conferences that happen later won’t miss out.Easy to Follow: Clear rules and deadlines cut down on confusion about how much you can get and what it’s for.Better Accountability: We ask for simple post-event reports so we can see where the money went and what impact it made.Stronger Community: Funding more events grows our Python network across Europe, helping everyone learn, connect, and collaborate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apache Kafka Meets Apache Iceberg: Real-Time Data Streaming • Kasun Indrasiri • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzVjBu5nhyM</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bzVjBu5nhyM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:00:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo

ABSTRACT
In this talk, we'll explore how Kafka serves as a powerful platform for capturing real-time streaming data and how organizations are increasingly adopting Apache Iceberg table format to store data in data lakes and data warehouses. We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.

Next, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.

A group of researchers searched for, and then registered, abandoned Amazon S3 buckets for about $400. These buckets contained software libraries that are still used. Presumably the projects don’t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines—and then abandoned.Naturally, we registered them, just to see what would happen—”how many people are really trying to request software updates from S3 buckets that appear to have been abandoned months or even years ago?”, we naively thought to ourselves.Turns out they got eight million requests over two months.Had this been an actual attack, they would have modified the code in those buckets to contain malware and watch as it was incorporated in different software builds around the internet. This is basically the SolarWinds attack, but much more extensive.But there’s a second dimension to this attack. Because these update buckets are abandoned, the developers who are using them also no longer have the power to patch them automatically to protect them. The mechanism they would use to do so is now in the hands of adversaries. Moreover, often—but not always—losing the bucket that they’d use for it also removes the original vendor’s ability to identify the vulnerable software in the first place. That hampers their ability to communicate with vulnerable installations.Software supply-chain security is an absolute mess. And it’s not going to be easy, or cheap, to fix. Which means that it won’t be. Which is an even worse mess.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Python: Quiz: Python Keywords: An Introduction</title><link>https://realpython.com/quizzes/python-keywords/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python keywords are reserved words with specific functions and restrictions in the language.

It’s a proof-of-concept that lets a large language model take charge of debugging. Instead of only looking at the static code, the LLM also gets to see the live runtime state—actual variable values, function calls, branch decisions, and more. The idea is to give it enough context to help diagnose issues faster and even generate synthetic data from running programs.* Active Debugging: It integrates with Node.js debug sessions to gather runtime info (like variable states and stack traces).* Automated Breakpoints: It automatically sets and manages breakpoints based on both code analysis and LLM suggestions.* LLM Guidance: With live debugging context, the LLM can suggest actions like stepping through code or adjusting breakpoints in real time.I built this out of curiosity to see if combining static code with runtime data could help LLMs solve bugs more effectively. It’s rough around the edges and definitely not production-readyI’m not planning on maintaining it further. But I thought it was a fun experiment and wanted to share it with you all.Check out the attached video demo to see it in action.

This patch should be a priority for enterprises, as Microsoft says it is being exploited, has low attack complexity, and no requirements for user interaction. senior staff research engineer  noted that since 2022, there have been nine elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in this same Windows component — three each year — including one in 2024 that was exploited in the wild as a zero day (CVE-2024-38193).“CVE-2024-38193 was exploited by the North Korean APT group known as Lazarus Group to implant a new version of the FudModule rootkit in order to maintain persistence and stealth on compromised systems,” Narang said. “At this time, it is unclear if CVE-2025-21418 was also exploited by Lazarus Group.”The other zero-day, CVE-2025-21391, is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Storage that could be used to delete files on a targeted system. Microsoft’s advisory on this bug references something called “CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access,” says no user interaction is required, and that the attack complexity is low., lead software engineer at , said although the advisory provides scant detail, and even offers some vague reassurance that ‘an attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,’ it would be a mistake to assume that the impact of deleting arbitrary files would be limited to data loss or denial of service.“As long ago as 2022, ZDI researchers set out how a motivated attacker could parlay arbitrary file deletion into full SYSTEM access using techniques which also involve creative misuse of symbolic links,”Barnett wrote.One vulnerability patched today that was publicly disclosed earlier is CVE-2025-21377, another weakness that could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on a vulnerable Windows system. Specifically, this is yet another Windows flaw that can be used to steal NTLMv2 hashes — essentially allowing an attacker to authenticate as the targeted user without having to log in.According to Microsoft, minimal user interaction with a malicious file is needed to exploit CVE-2025-21377, including selecting, inspecting or “performing an action other than opening or executing the file.”“This trademark linguistic ducking and weaving may be Microsoft’s way of saying ‘if we told you any more, we’d give the game away,'” Barnett said. “Accordingly, Microsoft assesses exploitation as more likely.”The SANS Internet Storm Center has a handy list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.It’s getting harder to buy Windows software that isn’t also bundled with Microsoft’s flagship Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) feature. Last month Microsoft started bundling Copilot with , which Redmond has since rebranded as “.” Ostensibly to offset the costs of its substantial AI investments, Microsoft also jacked up prices from 22 percent to 30 percent for upcoming license renewals and new subscribers.Office-watch.com writes that existing Office 365 users who are paying an annual cloud license do have the option of “Microsoft 365 Classic,” an AI-free subscription at a lower price, but that many customers are not offered the option until they attempt to cancel their existing Office subscription.In other security patch news,  has shipped iOS 18.3.1, which fixes a zero day vulnerability (CVE-2025-24200) that is showing up in attacks. has issued security updates that fix a total of 45 vulnerabilities across , , , , ,  and . at  notes that  is shipping an update today which will trigger updates for Chromium based browsers including , so be on the lookout for Chrome and Edge updates as we proceed through the week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Murky Ad-Tech World Powering Surveillance of US Military Personnel</title><link>https://www.404media.co/eskimi-2/</link><author>Joseph Cox</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/eskimi.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 04:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">Dev - 404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year, a revealed that a Florida-based data broker, Datastream Group, was selling highly sensitive location data that tracked United States military and intelligence personnel overseas.

Hopefully, no one has to handle all these roles alone since there is also the continuous learning aspect of getting up to speed with the latest threat vectors, vulnerabilities and exploit techniques. Adversaries only need one attack to succeed to gain actions on objective. In contrast, defenders have to detect and stop every attack to prevent adversaries from being successful. Let’s now extrapolate to an even bigger problem – what if this happens on emerging/future technologies and adversaries can get away with such crimes?Multiple countries are gradually considering the concept of Smart Cities, a key consideration in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As such technologies are implemented, the responsibility of defending this critical infrastructure again falls on the shoulders of blue teams. Smart Cities have yet to be fully implemented, but it does not mean we should not be proactive in preparing defenders to handle future problems. Current issues, even without Smart Cities in the fray, already cause blue team grief (e.g. different technology platforms, different contexts, information sharing, collaboration and tool interoperability). Given these complexities, an ontology would allow a shared understanding of vocabulary, facilitate data sharing, and even enable automated data reasoning.Wanting to pre-emptively solve future issues of attacks and cybercrime on Smart City Infrastructure (SCI), I (along with my co-authors in the SUTD ASSET Group) set out to create the Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE). SCOPE was designed to be an ontology for threats, cybercrime and digital forensic investigation on SCI. We did not create the ontology from scratch but chose to adhere to ontology best practices and extended the venerable Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) [1] and Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) [2]. UCO and CASE have gained some traction, and these ontologies have been experimentally adopted in forensic tools such as Cellebrite, Magnet Forensics, and MSAB XRY [3]. However, UCO and CASE did not have any SCI representation, and expecting overwhelmed blue teams to create them from scratch would most certainly be the straw that broke the camel’s back. Smart City Infrastructure Definition (reproduced with permission from the authors) [4]We deliberated on several design factors. Firstly, we defined smart cities using a technology-agnostic approach while adhering to international standards (with reference to Figure 1) that adopted the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (this was done in a previous work) [4]. By doing so, we ensured that the evolution of technologies or vendors would not affect the fundamental principle of Smart Cities. Secondly, we identified possible threats, cybercrime, and digital forensic evidence sources from the Smart City, which were defined in the first step (also from the same previous work) [4]. Thirdly, we included MITRE ATT&CK techniques and MITRE CAPEC into SCOPE for analysts and investigators to provide additional context to forensic evidence. Finally, we followed the ontological style and design practices when creating SCOPE, an expansion profile from UCO and CASE.We evaluated SCOPE via real-world attack scenarios attributed to publicly reported real-world incidents attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. With reference to Figure 2, the evaluation process workflow is shown. We successfully represented the attack scenarios, cybercrime committed, incident details, evidence and attack patterns (to name a few). SCOPE Evaluation Process (reproduced with permission from the authors) [3]Will SCOPE ever be helpful? Not yet. I hope it will come in handy in future for digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies when cybercrime on SCI becomes prevalent. As mentioned, SCOPE is technology-agnostic while adhering to several ISO standards. Additionally, it contains enough granularity to allow users to pinpoint key information while ensuring it can capture abstract definitions covering emerging technologies. We have made SCOPE publicly available to the digital forensic community to assist future smart city infrastructure investigations. SCOPE’s GitHub project link is https://github.com/scopeProject, and the official ontology website is https://scopeontology.org. If readers want to find out the complete details of SCOPE, you can find the full published paper in Volume 52 of Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation (FSIDI) or at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2025.301883.

Meta SAM 2.1 provides state-of-the-art video and image segmentation capabilities in a single model. This cutting-edge model supports long-context processing, complex segmentation scenarios, and fine-grained analysis, making it ideal for automating processes for various industries such as medical imaging in healthcare, satellite imagery for environment monitoring, and object segmentation for autonomous systems. Meta SAM 2.1 is well suited for zero-shot object segmentation and accurate object detection based on simple prompts such as point coordinates and bounding boxes in a frame for video tracking and image masking.This model was predominantly trained on AWS, and AWS will also be the first cloud provider to make it available to customers. In this post, we walk through how to discover and deploy the Meta SAM 2.1 model using SageMaker JumpStart.Meta SAM 2.1 is a state-of-the-art vision segmentation model designed for high-performance computer vision tasks, enabling advanced object detection and segmentation workflows. Building upon its predecessor, version 2.1 introduces enhanced segmentation accuracy, robust generalization across diverse datasets, and scalability for production-grade applications. These features enable AI researchers and developers in computer vision, image processing, and data-driven research to improve tasks that require detailed analysis segmentation across multiple fields.Meta SAM 2.1 has a streamlined architecture that is optimized for integration with popular model-serving frameworks like TorchServe and can be deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI to power real-time or batch inference pipelines. Meta SAM 2.1 empowers organizations to achieve precise segmentation outcomes in vision-centric workflows with minimal configuration and maximum efficiency.Meta SAM 2.1 offers multiple variants—Tiny, Small, Base Plus, and Large—available now on SageMaker JumpStart, balancing model size, speed, and segmentation performance to cater to diverse application needs.SageMaker JumpStart overviewSageMaker JumpStart offers access to a broad selection of publicly available foundation models (FMs). These pre-trained models serve as powerful starting points that can be deeply customized to address specific use cases. You can now use state-of-the-art model architectures, such as language models, computer vision models, and more, without having to build them from scratch.With SageMaker JumpStart, you can deploy models in a secure environment. Models hosted on JumpStart can be provisioned on dedicated SageMaker Inference instances, including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia based instances, and are isolated within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This enforces data security and compliance, because the models operate under your own VPC controls, rather than in a shared public environment. After deploying an FM, you can further customize and fine-tune it using the extensive capabilities of SageMaker AI, including SageMaker Inference for deploying models and container logs for improved observability. With SageMaker AI, you can streamline the entire model deployment process.Make sure you have the following prerequisites to deploy Meta SAM 2.1 and run inference:Discover Meta SAM 2.1 in SageMaker JumpStartSageMaker JumpStart provides FMs through two primary interfaces: SageMaker Studio and the SageMaker Python SDK. This provides multiple options to discover and use hundreds of models for your specific use case.SageMaker Studio is a comprehensive IDE that offers a unified, web-based interface for performing all aspects of the machine learning (ML) development lifecycle. From preparing data to building, training, and deploying models, SageMaker Studio provides purpose-built tools to streamline the entire process. In SageMaker Studio, you can access SageMaker JumpStart to discover and explore the extensive catalog of FMs available for deployment to inference capabilities on SageMaker Inference.You can access the SageMaker JumpStart UI through either Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio or SageMaker Studio. To deploy Meta SAM 2.1 using the SageMaker JumpStart UI, complete the following steps:In SageMaker Unified Studio, on the menu, choose .If you’re already on the SageMaker Studio console, choose  in the navigation pane.You will be prompted to create a project, after which you can begin deployment.Alternatively, you can use the SageMaker Python SDK to programmatically access and use SageMaker JumpStart models. This approach allows for greater flexibility and integration with existing AI/ML workflows and pipelines. By providing multiple access points, SageMaker JumpStart helps you seamlessly incorporate pre-trained models into your AI/ML development efforts, regardless of your preferred interface or workflow.Deploy Meta SAM 2.1 for inference using SageMaker JumpStartOn the SageMaker JumpStart landing page, you can discover the public pre-trained models offered by SageMaker AI. You can choose the Meta model provider tab to discover the Meta models available.If you’re using SageMaker Studio and don’t see the SAM 2.1 models, update your SageMaker Studio version by shutting down and restarting. For more information about version updates, refer to Shut down and Update Studio Classic Apps.You can choose the model card to view details about the model such as license, data used to train, and how to use. You can also find two buttons,  and , which help you use the model.When you choose , you should be prompted to the next screen to choose an endpoint name and instance type to initiate deployment.Upon defining your endpoint settings, you can proceed to the next step to use the model.Deploy Meta SAM 2.1 vision segmentation model for inference using the Python SDKWhen you choose , model deployment will start. Alternatively, you can deploy through the example notebook by choosing . The notebook provides end-to-end guidance on how to deploy the model for inference and clean up resources.To deploy using a notebook, you start by selecting an appropriate model, specified by the . You can deploy any of the selected models on SageMaker AI.You can deploy a Meta SAM 2.1 vision segmentation model using SageMaker JumpStart with the following SageMaker Python SDK code:from sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel 
model = JumpStartModel(model_id = "meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-tiny") 
predictor = model.deploy()This deploys the model on SageMaker AI with default configurations, including default instance type and default VPC configurations. You can change these configurations by specifying non-default values in JumpStartModel. After it’s deployed, you can run inference against the deployed endpoint through the SageMaker predictor. There are three tasks that are available with this endpoint: automatic mask generator, image predictor, and video predictor. We provide a code snippet for each later in this post. To use the predictor, a certain payload schema needs to be followed. The endpoint has sticky sessions enabled, so to start inference, you need to send a  payload:def start_session(asset_type, asset_path):

    asset_base64 = None
    
     with open(image_path, 'rb') as f:
            asset_base64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode('utf-8')
    
    response = predictor.invoke_endpoint(
        EndpointName=endpoint_name,
        ContentType='application/json',
        Body=json.dumps({
                    "type": "start_session",
                    "input_type": asset_type,
                    "path": asset_base64 
                }),
        SessionId="NEW_SESSION",
    )
    
    session_id = response.headers.get("x-amzn-sagemaker-new-session-id")
    
    return session_id
The  invocation needs an input media type of either image or video and the base64 encoded data of the media. This will launch a session with an instance of the model and load the media to be segmented.To close a session, send a  invocation:def close_session(session_id):
    response = predictor.invoke_endpoint(
        EndpointName=endpoint_name,
        ContentType='application/json',
        Body=json.dumps({
                    "type": "close_session",
                    "session_id": session_id
                }),
        SessionId=session_id,
    )
    
    session_id = response.headers.get("x-amzn-sagemaker-closed-session-id")
    
    return session_id
If x-amzn-sagemaker-closed-session-id exists as a header, then the session has been successfully closed.To continue a session and retrieve the session ID of the existing session, the response header will have the x-amzn-sagemaker-session-id key with the current session ID for any operation that is not  or . Operations that aren’t  or  need to be invoked with a response stream. This is due to the size of the resulting payload being larger than what SageMaker real-time endpoints can return.This is a basic example of interacting with the SAM 2.1 SageMaker JumpStart endpoint with sticky sessions. The following examples for each of the tasks reference these operations without repeating them. The returned data is of mime type JSONL. For more complete examples, refer to the example notebooks for Meta SAM 2.1 on SageMaker Jumpstart.Recommended instances and benchmarksThe following table lists all the Meta SAM 2.1 models available in SageMaker JumpStart along with the , default instance types, and maximum number of total tokens (sum of number of input tokens and number of generated tokens) supported for each of these models. For increased context length, you can modify the default instance type in the SageMaker JumpStart UI.meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-tinyml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size)meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-smallml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size)meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-base-plusml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size)meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-largeml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size)Meta SAM 2.1 use cases: Inference and prompt examplesAfter you deploy the model using SageMaker JumpStart, you should be able to see a reference Jupyter notebook that references the parser and helper functions needed to begin using Meta SAM 2.1. After you follow those cells in the notebook, you should be ready to begin using the model’s vision segmentation capabilities.Meta SAM 2.1 offers support for three different tasks (automatic mask generator, image predictor, video predictor) to generate masks for various objects in images, including object tracking in videos. In the following examples, we demonstrate how to use the automatic mask generator and image predictor on a JPG of a truck. This  file is stored in the  bucket; you can access it with the following code:s3_bucket = f"jumpstart-cache-prod-{region}"
key_prefix = "inference-notebook-assets"

def download_from_s3(key_filenames):
    for key_filename in key_filenames:
        s3.download_file(s3_bucket, f"{key_prefix}/{key_filename}", key_filename)
        
truck_jpg = "truck.jpg"

#Download images.
download_from_s3(key_filenames=[truck_jpg])
display(Image(filename=truck_jpg))
After you have your image and it is encoded, you can create masks for objects in the image. For use cases where you want to generate masks for every object in the image, you can use the automatic mask generator task.The automatic mask generator is great for AI researchers for computer vision tasks and applications such as medical imaging and diagnostics to automatically segment regions of interest like tumors or specific organs to provide more accurate diagnostic support. Additionally, the automatic mask generator can be particularly useful in the autonomous vehicle space, in which it can segment out elements in a camera like pedestrians, vehicles, and other objects. Let’s use the automatic mask generator to generate masks for all the objects in .The following code is the prompt to generate masks for your base64 encoded image:# Start session
session_id = start_session("image", truck_jpg)
    
# Generate and visualize masks with basic parameters
response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream(
        EndpointName=endpoint_name,
        ContentType='application/json',
        Body=json.dumps({
            "type": "generate_automatic_masks",
            "session_id": session_id,
            "points_per_side": 32,
            "min_mask_region_area": 100
        }),
        SessionId=session_id,
        Accept="application/jsonlines"
    )
    
# Parse response stream
parser = StreamParser()
for event in response['Body']:
    parser.write(event)

masks = parser.get_responses()

# End session
end_session(session_id)
We receive the following output (parsed and visualized).Additionally, you can choose which objects in the provided image you want to create a mask for by adding points within that object for Meta SAM 2.1 to create. A use case for the image predictor can be valuable for tasks related to design and modeling by automating processes that typically require manual efforts. For example, the image predictor can automate turning 2D images into 3D models by analyzing 2D images of blueprints, sketches, or floor plans and generating preliminary 3D models. This is one of many examples of how the image predictor can act as a bridge between 2D and 3D construction across many different tasks. We use the following image with the points that we used to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 for masking the object.The following code is used to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 and plot the coordinates:# Start session
session_id = start_session("image", truck_jpg)

points = [
            {"type": "point", "coordinates": [500, 375], "label": 1},
            {"type": "point", "coordinates": [1125, 625], "label": 1}
         ]
    
# Add multiple points
response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream(
        EndpointName=endpoint_name,
        ContentType='application/json',
        Body=json.dumps({
            "type": "add_points",
            "session_id": session_id,
            "points": [p["coordinates"] for p in points],
            "labels": [p["label"] for p in points],
            "clear_old_points": clear_old_point,
        }),
        SessionId=session_id,
        Accept="application/jsonlines"
    )

# Parse response stream
parser = StreamParser()
for event in response['Body']:
    parser.write(event)

# Intermediate Response
masks = parser.get_responses()
    
response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream(
        EndpointName=endpoint_name,
        ContentType='application/json',
        Body=json.dumps({
            "type": "predict",

We receive the following output (parsed and visualized).We now demonstrate how to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 for object tracking on video. One use case would be for ergonomic data collection and training purposes. You can use the video predictor to analyze the movement and posture of humans in real time, serving as a way to reduce injury and improve performance by setting alarms for bad posture or movements. Let’s start by accessing the  file [1] from the  S3 bucket defined in the following code:basketball_mp4 = "basketball-layup.mp4"

#Download video
download_from_s3(key_filenames=[basketball_mp4])
display(Video(filename=basketball_mp4))The following code shows how you can set up the prompt format to track objects in the video. The first object will use coordinates to track and not track, and the second object will track one coordinate.# Start session

Developers of platforms such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT are generally good at plugging these security holes, but hackers keep finding new ways to poke through them again and again.On Monday, researcher Johann Rehberger demonstrated a new way to override prompt injection defenses Google developers have built into Gemini—specifically, defenses that restrict the invocation of Google Workspace or other sensitive tools when processing untrusted data, such as incoming emails or shared documents. The result of Rehberger’s attack is the permanent planting of long-term memories that will be present in all future sessions, opening the potential for the chatbot to act on false information or instructions in perpetuity.More about the attack later. For now, here is a brief review of indirect prompt injections: Prompts in the context of large language models (LLMs) are instructions, provided either by the chatbot developers or by the person using the chatbot, to perform tasks, such as summarizing an email or drafting a reply. But what if this content contains a malicious instruction? It turns out that chatbots are so eager to follow instructions that they often take their orders from such content, even though there was never an intention for it to act as a prompt.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TAKE IT DOWN Act: A Flawed Attempt to Protect Victims That Will Lead to Censorship</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/take-it-down-act-flawed-attempt-protect-victims-will-lead-censorship</link><author>Joe Mullin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/tossed-2_0.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 21:01:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bill Will Lead To Overreach and Censorship Threatens Encrypted Services Victims Of NCII Have Legal Options Under Existing Law]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GenAI Patterns: Query Rewriting</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/#query-rewrite</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:58:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Users often have difficulty writing the most effective queries.

Although weather information is accessible through multiple channels, businesses that heavily rely on meteorological data require robust and scalable solutions to effectively manage and use these critical insights and reduce manual processes. This solution demonstrates how to create an AI-powered virtual meteorologist that can answer complex weather-related queries in natural language. We use various AWS services to deploy a complete solution that you can use to interact with an API providing real-time weather information. In this solution, we use Amazon Bedrock Agents.Amazon Bedrock Agents helps to streamline workflows and automate repetitive tasks. Amazon Bedrock Agents can securely connect to your company’s data sources and augments the user’s request with accurate responses. You can use Amazon Bedrock Agents to architect an action schema tailored to your requirements, granting you control whenever the agent initiates the specified action. This versatile approach equips you to seamlessly integrate and execute business logic within your preferred backend service, fostering a cohesive combination of functionality and flexibility. There is also memory retention across the interaction allowing a more personalized user experience.In this post, we present a streamlined approach to deploying an AI-powered agent by combining Amazon Bedrock Agents and a foundation model (FM). We guide you through the process of configuring the agent and implementing the specific logic required for the virtual meteorologist to provide accurate weather-related responses. Additionally, we use various AWS services, including AWS Amplify for hosting the front end, AWS Lambda functions for handling request logic, Amazon Cognito for user authentication, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for controlling access to the agent.The diagram gives an overview and highlights the key components. The architecture uses Amazon Cognito for user authentication and Amplify as the hosting environment for our front-end application. Amazon Bedrock Agents forwards the details from the user query to the action groups, which further invokes custom Lambda functions. Each action group and Lambda function handles a specific task: – Processes geographic coordinates (geo-coordinates) to get details about a specific location Gathers weather information for the provided location Obtains the current date and timeYou must have the following in place to complete the solution in this post:Deploy solution resources using AWS CloudFormationWhen you run the AWS CloudFormation template, the following resources are deployed (note that costs will be incurred for the AWS resources used):Lambda resources: 
  Function – <Stack name>-geo-coordinates-<auto-generated>Function – <Stack name>-weather-<auto-generated>Function – <Stack name>-date-time-<auto-generated>Amazon Bedrock Agents: virtual-meteorologist 
  Action groups (1) – obtain-latitude-longitude-from-place-nameAction groups (2) – obtain-weather-information-with-coordinatesAction groups (3) – get-current-date-time-from-timezoneAfter you deploy the CloudFormation template, copy the following from the tab on the CloudFormation console to be used during the configuration of your application after it’s deployed in AWS Amplify.Deploy the AWS Amplify applicationYou need to manually deploy the Amplify application using the front-end code found on GitHub. Complete the following steps:Download the front-end code AWS-Amplify-Frontend.zip from GitHub.Use the .zip file to manually deploy the application in Amplify.Return to the Amplify page and use the domain it automatically generated to access the application.Use Amazon Cognito for user authenticationAmazon Cognito is an identity service that you can use to authenticate and authorize users. We use Amazon Cognito in our solution to verify the user before they can use the application. We also use identity pool to provide temporary AWS credentials for the user while they interact with Amazon Bedrock API.Use Amazon Bedrock Agents to automate application tasksWith Amazon Bedrock Agents, you can build and configure autonomous agents in your application. An agent helps your end users complete actions based on organization data and user input. Agents orchestrate interactions between FMs, data sources, software applications, and user conversations.Use action group to define actions that Amazon Bedrock agents performAn action group defines a set of related actions that an Amazon Bedrock agent can perform to assist users. When configuring an action group, you have options for handling user-provided information, including adding user input to the agent’s action group, passing data to a Lambda function for custom business logic, or returning control directly through the InvokeAgent response. In our application, we created three action groups to give the Amazon Bedrock agent these essential functionalities: retrieving coordinates for specific locations, obtaining current date and time information, and fetching weather data for given locations. These action groups enable the agent to access and process crucial information, enhancing its ability to respond accurately and comprehensively to user queries related to location-based services and weather conditions.Use Lambda for Amazon Bedrock action groupAs part of this solution, three Lambda functions are deployed to support the action groups defined for our Amazon Bedrock agent:Location coordinates Lambda function – This function is triggered by the obtain-latitude-longitude-from-place-name action group. It takes a place name as input and returns the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates. The function uses a geocoding service or database to perform this lookup.Date and time Lambda function – Invoked by the get-current-date-time-from-timezone action group, this function provides the current date and time information.Weather information Lambda function – This function is called by the obtain-weather-information-with-coordinates action group. It accepts geo-coordinates from the first Lambda function and returns current weather conditions and forecasts for the specified area. This Lambda function used a weather API to fetch up-to-date meteorological data.Each of these Lambda functions receives an input event containing relevant metadata and populated fields from the Amazon Bedrock agent’s API operation or function parameters. The functions process this input, perform their specific tasks, and return a response with the required information. This response is then used by the Amazon Bedrock agent to formulate its reply to the user’s query. By using these Lambda functions, our Amazon Bedrock agent gains the ability to access external data sources and perform complex computations, significantly enhancing its capabilities in handling user requests related to location, time, and weather information.Use AWS Amplify for front-end codeAmplify offers a development environment for building secure, scalable mobile and web applications. Developers can focus on their code rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Amplify also integrates with many Git providers. For this solution, we manually upload our front-end code using the method outlined earlier in this post.Navigate to the URL provided after you created the application in Amplify. Upon accessing the application URL, you’ll be prompted to provide information related to Amazon Cognito and Amazon Bedrock Agents. This information is required to securely authenticate users and allow the front end to interact with the Amazon Bedrock agent. It enables the application to manage user sessions and make authorized API calls to AWS services on behalf of the user.You can enter information with the values you collected from the CloudFormation stack outputs. You’ll be required to enter the following fields, as shown in the following screenshot:You need to sign in with your username and password. A temporary password was automatically generated during deployment and sent to the email address you provided when launching the CloudFormation template. At first sign-in attempt, you’ll be asked to reset your password, as shown in the following video.Now you can start asking questions in the application, for example, “Can we do barbecue today in Dallas, TX?” In a few seconds, the application will provide you detailed results mentioning if you can do barbecue in Dallas, TX. The following video shows this chat.Here are a few sample queries to demonstrate the capabilities of your virtual meteorologist:“What’s the weather like in New York City today?”“Should I plan an outdoor birthday party in Miami next weekend?”“Will it snow in Denver on Christmas Day?”“Can I go swimming on a beach in Chicago today?These queries showcase the agent’s ability to provide current weather information, offer advice based on weather forecasts, and predict future weather conditions. You can even ask a question related to an activity such as swimming, and it will answer based on the weather conditions if that activity is okay to do.If you decide to discontinue using the virtual meteorologist, you can follow these steps to remove it, its associated resources deployed using AWS CloudFormation, and the Amplify deployment:Delete the CloudFormation stack: 
  On the AWS CloudFormation console, choose  in the navigation pane.Locate the stack you created during the deployment process (you assigned a name to it).Select the stack and choose .Delete the Amplify application and its resources. For instructions, refer to Clean Up Resources.This solution demonstrates the power of combining Amazon Bedrock Agents with other AWS services to create an intelligent, conversational weather assistant. By using AI and cloud technologies, businesses can automate complex queries and provide valuable insights to their users.To learn more about Amazon Bedrock, refer to the following resources:To learn more about the Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, refer to the following resources: is a Senior Technical Account Manager in AWS Enterprise Support.

This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21379, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, classifying it as a non-zero-day threat. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 7.1, indicating a significant risk of remote code execution. The vulnerability requires a high attack complexity, necessitating a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker must intercept the logical network path between the target and the resource. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it is limited to systems on the same network segment, such as those connected to the same network switch or virtual network. This limitation prevents the attack from being executed across multiple networks, such as a WAN.Microsoft High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21198)
is a critical security flaw with a CVSS score of 9.0, rated as Important, and is currently neither exploited in the wild nor publicly disclosed. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, requiring an attacker to have low privileges and access to the network connecting the targeted HPC clusters and nodes. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it relies on intra-net or private network access rather than exposure to the public internet. Exploitation involves sending a specially crafted HTTPS request to the head node or Linux compute node, potentially allowing the attacker to execute code on other clusters or nodes connected to the targeted head node. The scope of the attack is changed, indicating that successful exploitation could lead to broader impacts beyond the initially compromised system.Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21190)
This is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, classified as Important. Although it has not been exploited in the wild or disclosed publicly, this vulnerability poses a risk of remote code execution. An attacker could exploit it by deceiving a user into sending a request to a malicious server, which could then return harmful data leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The attack vector is network-based, requiring user interaction, as the attacker needs a client to connect to the malicious server to execute code on the client system.Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21200)
This is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, rated as Important, though it has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, thus not classified as a zero-day.

3.14Python 3.14 is still in development. This release, 3.14.0a5, is the
fifth of seven planned alpha releases.Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current
state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of
the beta phase (2025-05-06) and, if necessary, may be modified or
deleted up until the release candidate phase (2025-07-22). Please keep
in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
 recommended for production environments.Many new features for Python 3.14 are still being planned and
written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:The next pre-release of Python 3.14 will be the penultimate alpha,
3.14.0a6, currently scheduled for 2025-03-14.2025-01-29 marked the start of a new lunar year, the Year of the
Snake 🐍 (and the Year of Python?).For centuries, π was often approximated as 3 in China. Some time
between the years 1 and 5 CE, astronomer, librarian, mathematician and
politician Liu Xin (劉歆) calculated π as 3.154.Around 130 CE, mathematician, astronomer, and geographer Zhang Heng
(張衡, 78–139) compared the celestial circle with the diameter of the
earth as 736:232 to get 3.1724. He also came up with a formula for the
ratio between a cube and inscribed sphere as 8:5, implying the ratio of
a square’s area to an inscribed circle is √8:√5. From this, he
calculated π as √10 (~3.162).Third century mathematician Liu Hui (刘徽) came up with an algorithm
for calculating π iteratively: calculate the area of a polygon inscribed
in a circle, then as the number of sides of the polygon is increased,
the area becomes closer to that of the circle, from which you can
approximate π.This algorithm is similar to the method used by Archimedes in the 3rd
century BCE and Ludolph van Ceulen in the 16th century CE (see 3.14.0a2
  release notes), but Archimedes only went up to a 96-sided polygon
(96-gon). Liu Hui went up to a 192-gon to approximate π as 157/50 (3.14)
and later a 3072-gon for 3.14159.Liu Hu wrote a commentary on the book The Nine Chapters on the
Mathematical Art which included his π approximations.In the fifth century, astronomer, inventor, mathematician,
politician, and writer Zu Chongzhi (祖沖之, 429–500) used Liu Hui’s
algorithm to inscribe a 12,288-gon to compute π between 3.1415926 and
3.1415927, correct to seven decimal places. This was more accurate than
Hellenistic calculations and wouldn’t be improved upon for 900
years.Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development

There is no word on when they will be made available again.”The judge’s decision is in response to Doctors for America’s motion for a temporary restraining order, as part of the organization’s case against federal agencies for removing information from their websites that healthcare workers need for their work. Doctors for America is suing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), claiming that their removal of datasets and webpages violates the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. “Lack of access to CDC materials on infectious diseases not only harms DFA members’ ability to treat individual patients but also hampers their ability to respond to broader disease outbreaks,” Doctors for America wrote in court documents.“Like many of my colleagues, I am both a doctor who takes care of patients and a researcher. Removing critical clinical information and datasets from the websites of CDC, FDA, and HHS not only puts the health of our patients at risk, but also endangers research that improves the health and health care of the American public,” Reshma Ramachandran, a member of the Doctors for America board of directors, said in a Doctors for America press release.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Healthy Competition With GCC 15 vs. LLVM Clang 20 Performance On AMD Zen 5</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/clang20-gcc15-amd-znver5</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 18:03:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the recent discussion over the GNU Gold linker being deprecated, there was the usual LLVM vs. GCC compiler/toolchain debate.

It also protects your messages from being available for law enforcement should they request it from the platforms you use. In choosing a platform that protects our privacy, we create a space from safety and authenticity away from government and corporate surveillance.  Beyond this, it's important to know the privacy limitations of the platforms you communicate on. For example, while a secure messaging app might prevent government and corporate eavesdroppers from snooping on conversations, that doesn't stop someone you're communicating with from taking screenshots, or the government from attempting to compel you (or your contact) to turn over your messages yourselves. Secure messaging apps also don't protect when someone gets physical access to an unlocked phone with all those messages on it, which is why you may want to consider enabling disappearing message features for certain conversations.Consider The Content You Post On Social Media It’s important to carefully consider the tradeoffs between publicity and privacy when it comes to social media. If you’re promoting something important that needs greater reach, it may be more worth posting to the more popular platforms that undermine user privacy. To do so, it’s vital that you compartmentalize your personal information (registration credentials, post attribution, friends list, etc) away from these accounts.Think About Cloud Servers as Other People’s Computers  Create Incident Response PlansOnly you and your allies can decide what belongs on such a plan, but some strategies might be: ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Privacy Loves Company</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/privacy-loves-company</link><author>Paige Collings</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/communityprivacy-kittens.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:54:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml">Deeplinks</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Using Secure Messaging Services For Every Communication At some point, we all need to send a message that’s safe from prying eyes, so the chances of these apps becoming the default for sensitive communications is much higher if we use these platforms for all communications.

Amazon Q Business, a new generative AI-powered assistant, can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in an enterprise’s systems.Large-scale data ingestion is crucial for applications such as document analysis, summarization, research, and knowledge management. These tasks often involve processing vast amounts of documents, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, ingesting large volumes of enterprise data poses significant challenges, particularly in orchestrating workflows to gather data from diverse sources.In this post, we propose an end-to-end solution using Amazon Q Business to simplify integration of enterprise knowledge bases at scale.Enhancing AWS Support Engineering efficiencyThe AWS Support Engineering team faced the daunting task of manually sifting through numerous tools, internal sources, and AWS public documentation to find solutions for customer inquiries. For complex customer issues, the process was especially time-consuming, laborious, and at times extended the wait time for customers seeking resolutions. To address this, the team implemented a chat assistant using Amazon Q Business. This solution ingests and processes data from hundreds of thousands of support tickets, escalation notices, public AWS documentation, re:Post articles, and AWS blog posts.By using Amazon Q Business, which simplifies the complexity of developing and managing ML infrastructure and models, the team rapidly deployed their chat solution. The Amazon Q Business pre-built connectors like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), document retrievers, and upload capabilities streamlined data ingestion and processing, enabling the team to provide swift, accurate responses to both basic and advanced customer queries.In this post, we propose an end-to-end solution using Amazon Q Business to address similar enterprise data challenges, showcasing how it can streamline operations and enhance customer service across various industries. First we discuss end-to-end large-scale data integration with Amazon Q Business, covering data preprocessing, security guardrail implementation, and Amazon Q Business best practices. Then we introduce the solution deployment using three AWS CloudFormation templates.The following architecture diagram represents the high-level design of a solution proven effective in production environments for AWS Support Engineering. This solution uses the powerful capabilities of Amazon Q Business. We will walk through the implementation of key components, including configuring enterprise data sources to build our knowledge base, document indexing and boosting, and implementing comprehensive security controls. – An end-user who accesses Amazon Q Business applications with permissions granted by their administrator to perform their job duties – A user who manages Amazon Q Business resources and determines feature access for service users within the organization – A user responsible for creating and managing access policies for Amazon Q Business through AWS IAM Identity CenterThe following workflow details how a service user accesses the application:The service user initiates an interaction with the Amazon Q Business application, accessible through the web experience, which is an endpoint URL.The service user’s permissions are authenticated using IAM Identity Center, an AWS solution that connects workforce users to AWS managed applications like Amazon Q Business. It enables end-user authentication and streamlines access management.The authenticated service user submits queries in natural language to the Amazon Q Business application.The Amazon Q Business application generates and returns answers drawing from the enterprise data uploaded to an S3 bucket, which is connected as a data source to Amazon Q Business. This S3 bucket data is continuously refreshed, making sure that Amazon Q Business accesses the most current information for query responses by using a retriever to pull data from the index.Large-scale data ingestionBefore ingesting the data to Amazon Q Business, the data might need transformation into formats supported by Amazon Q Business. Furthermore, it might contain sensitive data or personally identifiable information (PII) requiring redaction. These data ingestion challenges create a need to orchestrate tasks like transformation, redaction, and secure ingestion.To facilitate orchestration, this solution incorporates AWS Step Functions. Step Functions provides a visual workflow service to orchestrate tasks and workloads resiliently and efficiently through built-in AWS integrations and error handling. The solution uses the Step Functions Map state, which allows for parallel processing of multiple items in a dataset, thereby efficiently orchestrating workflows and speeding up overall processing.The following diagram illustrates an example architecture for ingesting data through an endpoint interfacing with a large corpus.Step Functions orchestrates AWS services like AWS Lambda and organization APIs like DataStore to ingest, process, and store data securely. The workflow includes the following steps:The Prepare Map Input Lambda function prepares the required input for the Map state. For example, the Datastore API might require certain input like date periods to query data. This step can be used to define the date periods to be used by the Map state as an input.The Ingest Data Lambda function fetches data from the Datastore API—which can be in or outside of the virtual private cloud (VPC)—based on the inputs from the Map state. To handle large volumes, the data is split into smaller chunks to mitigate Lambda function overload. This enables Step Functions to manage the workload, retry failed chunks, and isolate failures to individual chunks instead of disrupting the entire ingestion process.The fetched data is put into an S3 data store bucket for processing.The Process Data Lambda function redacts sensitive data through Amazon Comprehend. Amazon Comprehend provides real-time APIs, such as DetectPiiEntities and DetectEntities, which use natural language processing (NLP) machine learning (ML) models to identify text portions for redaction. When Amazon Comprehend detects PII, the terms will be redacted and replaced by a character of your choice (such as *). You can also use regular expressions to remove identifiers with predetermined formats.Finally, the Lambda function creates two separate files: 
  A sanitized data document in an Amazon Q Business supported format that will be parsed to generate chat responses.A JSON metadata file for each document containing additional information to customize chat results for end-users and apply boosting techniques to enhance user experience (which we discuss more in the next section).The following is the sample metadata file:{
    "DocumentId": "qbusiness-ug.pdf.txt",
    "Attributes": {
        "_created_at": "2024-10-29T20:27:45+00:00",
        "_last_updated_at": "2024-10-29T20:27:45+00:00",
        "_source_uri": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/qbusiness-ug.pdf",
        "author": "AWS",
        "services": ["Q Business"]
    },
    "Title": "Amazon Q Business - User Guide",
    "ContentType": "plain/text"
}In the preceding JSON file, the  for each data document must be unique. All the other attributes are optional; however, the file has additional attributes like , , and  with values defined.The two files are placed in a new S3 folder for Amazon Q to index. Additionally, the raw unprocessed data is deleted from the S3 bucket. You can further restrict access to documents uploaded to an S3 bucket for specific users or groups using Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs).Using the Amazon Q Business data source connector feature, we integrated the S3 bucket with our application. This connector functionality enables the consolidation of data from multiple sources into a unified index for the Amazon Q Business application. The service offers various integration options, with Amazon S3 being one of the supported data sources.When working with your specific dataset in Amazon Q Business, you can use relevance tuning to enhance the performance and accuracy of search results. This feature allows you to customize how Amazon Q Business prioritizes information within your ingested documents. For example, if your dataset includes product descriptions, customer reviews, and technical specifications, you can use relevance tuning to boost the importance of certain fields. You might choose to prioritize product names in titles, give more weight to recent customer reviews, or emphasize specific technical attributes that are crucial for your business. By adjusting these parameters, you can influence the ranking of search results to better align with your dataset’s unique characteristics and your users’ information needs, ultimately providing more relevant answers to their queries.For the metadata file used in this example, we focus on boosting two key metadata attributes:  and . By assigning higher weights to these attributes, we made sure documents with specific titles or services received greater prominence in the search results, improving their visibility and relevance for the usersThe following code is the sample CloudFormation template snippet to enable higher weights to  and :BoostOverrideConfiguration:
        Fn::Sub: |
          {
            "nativeIndexConfiguration": {
              "indexId": "${QBusinessIndex.IndexId}",
              "boostingOverride": {
                "_document_title": {
                  "stringConfiguration": {
                    "boostingLevel": "MEDIUM"
                  }
                },
                "services": {
                  "stringListConfiguration": {
                    "boostingLevel": "HIGH"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }Amazon Q Business guardrailsImplementing robust security measures is crucial to protect sensitive information. In this regard, Amazon Q Business guardrails or chat controls proved invaluable, offering a powerful solution to maintain data privacy and security.Amazon Q Business guardrails provide configurable rules designed to control the application’s behavior. These guardrails act as a safety net, minimizing access, processing, or revealing of sensitive or inappropriate information. By defining boundaries for the application’s operations, organizations can maintain compliance with internal policies and external regulations. You can enable global- or topic-level controls, which control how Amazon Q Business responds to specific topics in chat.The following is the sample CloudFormation template snippet to enable topic-level controls:TopicConfigurations:
        - name: topic
          rules:
            - ruleType: CONTENT_BLOCKER_RULE
              ruleConfiguration:
                contentBlockerRule:
                  systemMessageOverride: This message is blocked as it contains secure content
          exampleChatMessages:
            - arn:*:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-abcdef123
            - arn:*:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:vpc/bpc-abcdef123
            - arn:*:kms:eu-west-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-12345678-abc12345678

            - arn:*:s3::::bucket-nameThis topic-level control blocks the Amazon Q Business chat conversation that has AWS service Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). When similar chat messages have been detected by the Amazon Q Business application, the system will block the responses and return the message “This message is blocked as it contains secure content.”For information about deploying the Amazon Q Business application with sample boosting and guardrails, refer to the GitHub repo.The following screenshot shows an example of the Amazon Q Business assistant chat landing page.The following screenshot illustrates the assistant’s behavior if a user includes text that matches one of the similarity-based examples specified in the guardrail topic control.To enhance data security, you can deploy Amazon Macie classification jobs to scan for sensitive or PII data stored in S3 buckets. The following diagram illustrates a sample notification architecture to alert users on sensitive information that might be inadvertently stored. Macie uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in AWS. It focuses on identifying PII, intellectual property, and other sensitive data types to help organizations meet compliance requirements and protect their data from unauthorized access or breaches.The workflow includes the following steps:Macie reviews the data store S3 bucket for sensitive information before being ingested.An EventBridge rule invokes the Rectify & Notify Lambda function.The Lambda function processes the alert, remediates it by removing the affected files from the S3 bucket, and sends a notification using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to the subscribed email addresses.This system enables rapid response to potential security alerts, allowing for immediate action to protect sensitive data.The Macie detection and subsequent notification system can be demonstrated by uploading a new file to the S3 bucket, such as sample-file-with-credentials.txt, containing the PII data types monitored by Macie, such as fake temporary AWS credentials. After the file is uploaded to Amazon S3 and the scheduled Macie detection job discovers it, the Lambda function immediately removes the file and sends the following notification email to the SNS topic subscribers:Amazon Macie published a new Finding: "The S3 object contains credentials data"
Description: "The S3 object contains credentials data such as AWS secret access keys or private keys."
Severity: {'score': 3, 'description': 'High'}

}Additionally, the findings are visible on the Macie console, as shown in the following screenshot.Additional recommendationsTo further enhance the security and reliability of the Amazon Q Business application, we recommend implementing the following measures. These additional security and logging implementations make sure the data is protected, alerts are sent in response to potential warnings, and timely actions can be taken for security incidents.Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon Q Business – You can use Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon Q Business to save the logs for the data source connectors and document-level errors, focusing particularly on failed ingestion jobs. This practice is vital from a security perspective because it allows monitoring and quick identification of issues in the data ingestion process. By tracking failed jobs, potential data loss or corruption can be mitigated, maintaining the reliability and completeness of the knowledge base.Unauthorized access monitoring on Amazon S3 – You can implement EventBridge rules to monitor mutating API actions on the S3 buckets. These rules are configured to invoke SNS notifications when such actions are performed by unauthorized users. Enable Amazon S3 server access logging to store detailed access records in a designated bucket, which can be analyzed using Amazon Athena for deeper insights. This approach provides real-time alerts for immediate response to potential security breaches, while also maintaining a detailed audit trail for thorough security analysis, making sure that only authorized entities can modify critical data.In the following sections, we walk through implementing the end-to-end solution. For this solution to work, the following prerequisites are needed:A new or existing AWS account that will be the data collection accountConfigure the data ingestionIn this post, we demonstrate the solution using publicly available documentation as our sample dataset. In your implementation, you can adapt this solution to work with your organization’s specific content sources, such as support tickets, JIRA issues, internal wikis, or other relevant documentation.Ingestion Lambda functionProcessing Lambda functionThe data ingestion workflow in this example fetches and processes public data from the Amazon Q Business and Amazon SageMaker official documentation in PDF format. Specifically, the Ingest Data Lambda function downloads the raw PDF documents, temporarily stores them in Amazon S3, and passes their Amazon S3 URLs to the Process Data Lambda function, which performs the PII redaction (if enabled) and stores the processed documents and their metadata to the S3 path indexed by the Amazon Q Business application.You can adapt the Step Functions Lambda code for ingestion and processing according to your own internal data, making sure that the documents and metadata are in a valid format for Amazon Q Business to index, and are properly redacted for PII data.Configure IAM Identity CenterYou can only have one IAM Identity Center instance per account. If your account already has an Identity Center instance, skip this step and proceed to configuring the Amazon Q Business application.You will need to add details for a user such as user name, email, first name, and surname.After deploying the CloudFormation template, you will receive an email where you will need to accept the invitation and change the password for the user.Before logging in, you will need to deploy the Amazon Q Business application.Configure the Amazon Q Business applicationYou will need to add details such as the IAM Identity Center stack name deployed previously and the S3 bucket name provisioned by the data ingestion stack.After you deploy the CloudFormation template, complete the following steps to manage user access:On the Amazon Q Business console, choose  in the navigation pane.Choose the application you provisioned ().Under , choose .On the  tab, choose the user you specified when deploying the CloudFormation stack.Under , choose  or .Choose  and then Now you can log in using the user you have specified. You can find the URL for the web experience under .If you are unable to log in, make sure that the user has been verified.Before you can use the Amazon Q Business application, the data source needs to be synchronized. The application’s data source is configured to sync hourly. It might take some time to synchronize.When the synchronization is complete, you should now be able to access the application and ask questions.After you’re done testing the solution, you can delete the resources to avoid incurring additional charges. See the Amazon Q Business pricing page for more information. Follow the instructions in the GitHub repository to delete the resources and corresponding CloudFormation templates. Make sure to delete the CloudFormation stacks provisioned as follows:Delete the Amazon Q Business application stack.Delete the IAM Identity Center stack.Delete the data ingestionFor each deleted stack, check for any resources that were skipped in the deletion process, such as S3 buckets.Delete any skipped resources on the console.In this post, we demonstrated how to build a knowledge base solution by integrating enterprise data with Amazon Q Business using Amazon S3. This approach helps organizations improve operational efficiency, reduce response times, and gain valuable insights from their historical data. The solution uses AWS security best practices to promote data protection while enabling teams to create a comprehensive knowledge base from various data sources.Whether you’re managing support tickets, internal documentation, or other business content, this solution can handle multiple data sources and scale according to your needs, making it suitable for organizations of different sizes. By implementing this solution, you can enhance your operations with AI-powered assistance, automated responses, and intelligent routing of complex queries.Try this solution with your own use case, and let us know about your experience in the comments section. is a Senior Cloud Support Engineer at AWS, specializing in Data, Machine Learning, and Generative AI solutions.

Although GraphStorm can run efficiently on single instances for small graphs, it truly shines when scaling to enterprise-level graphs in distributed mode using a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances or Amazon SageMaker.Today, AWS AI released GraphStorm v0.4. This release introduces integration with DGL-GraphBolt, a new graph storage and sampling framework that uses a compact graph representation and pipelined sampling to reduce memory requirements and speed up Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. For the large-scale dataset examined in this post, the inference speedup is 3.6 times faster, and per-epoch training speedup is 1.4 times faster, with even larger speedups possible.To achieve this, GraphStorm v0.4 with DGL-GraphBolt addresses two crucial challenges of graph learning: – GraphStorm v0.4 provides compact and distributed storage of graph structure and features, which may grow in the multi-TB range. For example, a graph with 1 billion nodes with 512 features per node and 10 billion edges will require more than 4 TB of memory to store, which necessitates distributed computation. – In multi-layer GNNs, you need to sample neighbors of each node to propagate their representations. This can lead to exponential growth in the number of nodes sampled, potentially visiting the entire graph for a single node’s representation. GraphStorm v0.4 provides efficient, pipelined graph sampling.In this post, we demonstrate how GraphBolt enhances GraphStorm’s performance in distributed settings. We provide a hands-on example of using GraphStorm with GraphBolt on SageMaker for distributed training. Lastly, we share how to use Amazon SageMaker Pipelines with GraphStorm.GraphBolt: Pipeline-driven graph samplingGraphBolt is a new data loading and graph sampling framework developed by the DGL team. It streamlines the operations needed to sample efficiently from a heterogeneous graph and fetch the corresponding features. GraphBolt introduces a new, more compact graph structure representation for heterogeneous graphs, called fused Compressed Sparse Column (fCSC). This can reduce the memory cost of storing a heterogeneous graph by up to 56%, allowing users to fit larger graphs in memory and potentially use smaller, more cost-efficient instances for GNN model training.GraphStorm v0.4 seamlessly integrates with GraphBolt, allowing users to take advantage of its performance improvements in their GNN workflows. The user just needs to provide the additional argument  when launching graph construction and training jobs.A common model development process is to perform model exploration locally on a subset of your full data, and when you’re satisfied with the results, train the full-scale model. This setup allows for cheaper exploration before training on the full dataset. GraphStorm and SageMaker Pipelines allows you to do that by creating a model pipeline you can run locally to retrieve model metrics, and when you’re ready, run your pipeline on the full data on SageMaker, and produce models, predictions, and graph embeddings to use in downstream tasks. In the next section, we show how to set up such pipelines for GraphStorm.We demonstrate such a setup in the following diagram, where a user can perform model development and initial training on a single EC2 instance, and when they’re ready to train on their full data, hand off the heavy lifting to SageMaker for distributed training. Using SageMaker Pipelines to train models provides several benefits, like reduced costs, auditability, and lineage tracking.Set up the environment for SageMaker distributed trainingSetting up your environment should take around 10 minutes. First, set up your Python environment to run the examples:conda init
eval $SHELL
# Create a new env for the post
conda create --name gsf python=3.10
conda activate gsf

# Install dependencies for local scripts
pip install torch==2.3.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install sagemaker boto3 ogb pyarrow
# Verify installation, might take a few minutes for first run
python -c "import sagemaker; import torch"

# Clone the GraphStorm repository to access the example code
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/graphstorm.git ~/graphstormBuild a GraphStorm SageMaker CPU imageNext, build and push the GraphStorm PyTorch Docker image that you will use to run the graph construction, training, and inference jobs for smaller-scale data. Your role will need to be able to pull images from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery and create Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repositories and push images to your private ECR registry.# Enter you account ID here
ACCOUNT_ID=<aws-account-id>
REGION=us-east-1

cd ~/graphstorm
bash docker/build_graphstorm_image.sh --environment sagemaker --device cpu
bash docker/push_graphstorm_image.sh -e sagemaker -r $REGION -a $ACCOUNT_ID -d cpu
# This will create an ECR repository and push an image to
# ${ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphstorm:sagemaker-cpuDownload and prepare datasetsIn this post, we use two citation datasets to demonstrate the scalability of GraphStorm. The Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) project hosts a number of graph datasets that can be used to benchmark the performance of graph learning systems. For a small-scale demo, we use the ogbn-arxiv dataset, and for a demonstration of GraphStorm’s large-scale learning capabilities, we use the ogbn-papers100M dataset.Prepare the ogbn-arxiv datasetDownload the smaller-scale ogbn-arxiv dataset to run a local test before launching larger-scale SageMaker jobs on AWS. This dataset has approximately 170,000 nodes and 1.2 million edges. Use the following code to download the data and prepare it for GraphStorm:# Provide the S3 bucket to use for output
BUCKET_NAME=<your-s3-bucket>cd ~/graphstorm/examples/sagemaker-pipelines-graphbolt
python convert_arxiv_to_gconstruct.py \
--output-s3-prefix s3://$BUCKET_NAME/ogb-arxiv-inputThis will create the tabular graph data in Amazon S3, which you can verify by running the following code:aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET_NAME/ogb-arxiv-input/

aws s3 cp ~/graphstorm/inference_scripts/np_infer/arxiv_nc.yaml \
s3://$BUCKET_NAME/yaml/arxiv_nc_inference.yamlPrepare the ogbn-papers100M dataset on SageMakerThe papers-100M dataset is a large-scale graph dataset, with 111 million nodes and 3.2 billion edges after adding reverse edges.To download and preprocess the data as an Amazon SageMaker Processing step, use the following code. You can launch and let the job run in the background while proceeding through the rest of the post, and return to this dataset later. The job should take approximately 45 minutes to run.# Navigate to the example code
cd ~/graphstorm/examples/sagemaker-pipelines-graphbolt

# Build and push a Docker image to download and process the papers100M data
bash build_and_push_papers100M_image.sh -a $ACCOUNT_ID -r $REGION

# This creates an ECR repository and pushes an image to

Depending on the dataset, the speedups can be even greater, as shown by the DGL team’s benchmarking.This post showcased how GraphStorm 0.4, integrated with DGL-GraphBolt, significantly speeds up large-scale GNN training and inference, by 1.4 and 3.6 times faster, respectively, as measured on the papers-100M dataset. As shown in the DGL benchmarks, even larger speedups are possible depending on the dataset.We encourage ML practitioners working with large graph data to try GraphStorm.

You  pretend it doesn’t exist, or you could refactor it. Luckily, GitHub Copilot makes the second option less painful.What is code refactoring?Feel free to breeze past this section if you already know what’s involved with refactoring code, but we wanted to take a moment to cover what we’ll be looking at today.Think of refactoring as giving your project some digital spring cleaning—a glow up for your functions, classes, and modules. But instead of just tidying up, you’re making your code more efficient, maintainable, and readable, all without changing its external behavior.Some standard ways of refactoring include:Simplifying complex conditionals (because no one should need a PhD to read your  statements)  Extracting duplicated logic (so you’re not trying to maintain code in ten different places)  Improving variable and function names (because  is a crime against humanity)  Converting monolithic functions into smaller, modular pieces (to prevent the dreaded “function that spans multiple screens” scenario)Refactoring isn’t just about tidiness—it’s about making your codebase more resilient, scalable, and enjoyable to work with. Let’s find out how GitHub Copilot can help you do it faster and with fewer headaches.Know what your code does before you refactor anythingIt might seem obvious to say this, but before you can refactor any code you need to understand how it works. If you don’t know what your code is doing, you won’t know whether or not the “improvements” you’re making are changing the core functionality of the code.Consider the following method:public String getSound(String animal) {
  if (animal == null) {
      System.out.println("Oops! A null animal?");
  } else if (animal.equalsIgnoreCase("Dog")) {
      return "Bark";
  } else if ( animal.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat")) {
      return "Meow";
  } else if ( animal.equalsIgnoreCase("Bird")) {
      return "Tweet";
  }
  return "Unknown";
}
You might look at this and immediately think “they should use a switch statement,” and that would be one example of refactoring the code. But having that knee jerk reaction requires you to know how if-statements and switch-statements work. You can only make that suggestion if you understand this code will continue cycling through if-statements until it finds an appropriate match. Otherwise, it will return the value of .As codebases get more complex and make calls between multiple files, this gets (much) more complicated. And this is one way Copilot can help you.You can ask Copilot Chat to explain how some code works, either by asking in plain language or using the /explain slash command. To limit the scope of what Copilot looks at, select the code in your IDE before asking your query, or specify specific files for it to consider by using . While you’re at it, you can even ask it to add code comments to help you (or anyone else reading the code) in the future.Here are some sample prompts:Explain what this code does.Add comments to this code to make it more understandable.You should use Copilot Chat to analyze and explain your codebase until you fully understand the code you’re looking to refactor.Try some blanket improvements to refactor your codeLike most things in life, it’s usually best to start small. When you’re first getting started with refactoring code, keep it simple: open up Copilot Chat in your project and ask “how would you improve this?” Just like when you are asking GitHub Copilot to explain some code, you can specify what it looks at by highlighting sections of code or identifying specific files by using .Here are some sample prompts:How would you improve this?Improve the variable names in this function.#file:pageInit.js, #file:socketConnector.js Offer suggestions to simplify this code.Copilot will then offer suggestions to improve the code in the way that you specified. This is great for getting started, but Copilot can do much more if you give it some guidance.When working with any generative AI-powered developer tool, it is often useful to include more context in your prompts—ones that are more likely to get you the results you’re looking for. By being specific about what you want the tool to do, it focuses the efforts toward that end.It’s a bit like if someone tells you to code something, and you have so many ideas and questions that you’re not quite sure where to begin. But if someone tells you they specifically want you to code a class that sorts a list, you can focus on the task at hand.The prompts above don’t offer much specificity or context, which leaves Copilot to explore all the possible ways your code could be improved. The upside? You may see options that you might not have considered. The downside is some of the proposed solutions might not address your specific concerns.Make a plan for refactoring your codebaseWhat do you want to do to your code? Do you want to make it more readable? Or do you want to find redundant code and remove it? Coming up with a plan for the improvements you want to make will help you to hit your goals. This comes back to making sure you understand your code. If you know how it works, you can come up with a plan for the type of improvements that you want to make.Maybe your code base has a bunch of different scripts that all perform the same general function. You could strip out the code into a common module to import into each of the different scripts, making the code easier to change and maintain.To do so, you can direct Copilot to look for these common code sections and to pull them into a single module.Inspect all my js files for GitHub API calls and create a new class that will manage all the GitHub API calls.
Now that we have provided some guidance and additional context, Copilot will provide suggestions targeting this specific improvement that we want to make to our code.You can also provide a laundry list of tasks, or ask Copilot to keep things in mind while it is doing the refactoring.In that vein, here’s a sample prompt to consider:Can you refactor the GitHubController class to:
- remove nested logic structures
- make the code more concise
- while doing this, check if the code is safe and add comments if not
The takeaway here is Copilot is very good at taking directions—and the more specific your directions are, the more it will generate outputs in line with your intended end goal.A real-world example: Using GitHub Copilot to refactor codeSometimes the best way to understand something is to see it in use. To help with this, we wanted to share an experience where we needed to use GitHub Copilot to refactor our own code, interspersed with some general guidance and pointers.It started with a couple of organizations independently requesting help with their individual large migration projects, which involved moving from other data centers into tens of thousands of repositories on GitHub. After building a proof of concept, we started creating individual systems, each tailored to the needs of the individual customer and their unique systems. While we were doing this, a third organization made a similar request for help, and we realized this was a common need.At this point in time, we had two systems that were both suited for large-scale migrations, but each of them was heavily customized for the original company making the request. We quickly realized the best solution involved refactoring our code to improve its modularity so we could use it across different organizations. This would not be easy—the codebase was made up of several different scripts and workflows with a lot of moving parts. And that’s when we turned to Copilot for help.First we came up with a plan. We created a set of high-level goals and used these to guide us during the refactoring process. We wanted to make sure the code was:Modular and reusable for different organizations: The code should be organized into small, self-contained modules that could be reused and combined for new functionality.   The code should be easy to maintain and extend as needed. That meant making it well-organized, well-documented, and easy to understand.  Customizable for different organizations: The code should be flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each organization.  Following coding standards and best practices: The code should be consistent, readable, and easy to understand.With this plan in place, it was time to ask Copilot for help.Step 1: Creating the initial moduleOur first step was creating a common module we could import into each of the different scripts. This would allow us to reuse the same code across many different scripts, making it easier to maintain and extend. We created a skeleton of a module called . Then we used Copilot to fill in the details.Here was the prompt we gave Copilot:I am creating a module, gh-migrations, which will hold common functionality to be used through out my project. I have already created an index.js for the module. Please inspect the other js files for GitHub API calls, create a new class for the module which will manage all GitHub API calls. This class should also account for rate limiting and errors. Do not make edits to the javascript files, rather identify the API calls, and add the functionality to the new GitHub API class.
And here was Copilot’s response:I'll help create a GitHub API management class based on the API calls found in the provided files. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. From analyzing the files, I identified these common GitHub API operations: 
  * Issues creation and updates
  * Issue search
  * Rate limit handling (403 errors)
  * Common error handling patterns

2. I'll create a class that encapsulates these operations with proper error handling and rate limiting.

.github/lib/gh-migrations/index.js
Here's the GitHub API management class implementation:

<code>

This implementation:

1. Creates a GitHubApiManager class that handles all GitHub API interactions
2. Implements automatic rate limiting retry logic in withRateLimit
3. Provides methods for common operations: 
  * createIssue: Creates a new issue
  * updateIssue: Updates an existing issue
  * searchIssues: Searches for issues using GitHub's search API
  * findIssueByTitle: Helper method to find issues by title
  * getIssue: Gets a specific issue by number

Usage example:

<code>

The class handles:
  * Automatic retry on rate limits
  * Consistent error handling
  * Repository context management
  * Common GitHub API operations used across the codebase

This centralizes all GitHub API interactions and makes the code more maintainable and consistent.
After reviewing the code (as you should always do!), we made the recommended changes. The next step was putting these changes into a separate file while ensuring the  file could reference it.Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:Rename the class GitHubApiManager to GHApi and put it in a separate file that is referenced in the index.js file.
And here was Copilot’s response:I'll help you split the code into two files. Here's the step by step solution:

1. Create a new file gh-api.js for the GHApi class
2. Update index.js to export the renamed class from the new file

.github/lib/gh-migrations/gh-api.js
Create a new file containing the renamed class:

<code>

.github/lib/gh-migrations/index.js
Update the index file to export the renamed class from the new file:

<code>

The changes:
1. Created a new file gh-api.js with the renamed class
2. Moved all the class implementation to the new file
3. Updated the class name from GitHubApiManager to GHApi
4. Modified index.js to require and export the class from the new file

Now consumers of this module can continue to import it the same way, but the implementation is better organized.
After making these changes, we then had to repeat the process for each of the files that contained GitHub API calls. Be aware, we didn’t want to refactor the code directly at this stage. Instead, we wanted to create a common module we could use for refactoring code later.Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:The gh-api.js file is a new class that will be used to manage all GitHub API calls. Please review the other javascript files for GitHub API calls to be added to gh-api.js. Do not edit the javascript files, only add new functionality to gh-api.js.
And here was Copilot’s response:I'll analyze the JavaScript files and add the missing API functionality to the GHApi class.

.github/lib/gh-migrations/gh-api.js
Add methods for issue operations, searching, and deletion based on the API calls found in migration.js and application.js:

<code>

This implementation adds all the GitHub API functionality found in the other files:

1. From migration.js:
  * createComment for updating issues with comments
  * getIssue and isMigrationIssue for checking migration status
2. From application.js:
  * searchIssues and searchIssuesByTitle for finding issues
  * getIssueNodeId and deleteIssue for issue deletion via GraphQL
  * findJiraIssue helper method to get Jira ticket information

The methods maintain the same rate limiting and error handling patterns while providing a cleaner interface for the API operations.
Step 2: Adding new classesOnce we had the new  class to handle the GitHub API, we want to create some reusable classes for different entities in our application. Since our application is a migration tool managed via GitHub Issues, we wanted to create classes for the following entities: represent repository migrations from various sources. They contain configuration and metadata about the repository and how the migration should be performed.   represent a batch of migrations. They contain more high-level metadata about groups of individual migration issues such as custom application ids and status of the batch.   represent the migration of a group of users, their associated repositories, and the permissions to those repositories.   represent Azure DevOps pipelines rewire operations. They allow for the reconfiguration of Azure DevOps pipelines to point to the new GitHub repositories after a migration has been completed.Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:Review the create-migration-issue.js and develop a new class called MigrationIssue that contains the properties associated with a migration. This shoud be added to the gh-migrations module where index.js is located.
And here was Copilot’s response:I'll help create a new MigrationIssue class based on the migration configuration and status shown in the code. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create a new file migration-issue.js in the gh-migrations directory
2. Update the index.js file to expose the new class
3. Extract configuration and status properties from the create-migration-issues.js file into the new class

migration-issue.js
Create a new class to represent a migration issue with all necessary properties and methods.

<code>

index.js
Update the index.js to expose the new MigrationIssue class.

<code>

The new MigrationIssue class encapsulates all the properties that were previously spread across various objects in the create-migration-issues.js file. It provides a clean interface for creating and managing migration issues, with helper methods for generating issue titles and source types.

You can now use this class in create-migration-issues.js by replacing the manual object creation with the MigrationIssue class. For example, the createMigrationConfig function could be replaced with:

<code>
The process for creating new classes for the other entities was similar to the above. We created new classes for , , and , each with their own properties and methods.After we built out our entity classes, we realized they should manage their own state. This is a common pattern in object-oriented programming, where the class is responsible for managing its state and behavior. Remember our goal about following good coding standards?The class should include methods to get and set the state of the object, as well as methods to perform actions on the object. It should also be responsible for utilizing the GitHub API and manage the state of the object rather than the client code. This will help standardize and protect the state of the object, as well as give the client code a simpler interface to work with.Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:The MigrationIssue class should contain a initializer that uses the gh-api.js to create the resulting GitHub Issue. The initializer should take in an optional parameter called issueNumber, if the issueNumber is omitted the initializer should create a new Migration Issue and return the issue number created, if the issueNumber is passed to the initializer, the gh-api.js should be used to return the title and body of the issue which the class will parse to create the properties of the MigrationIssue.
And here was Copilot’s response:I'll help you modify the code to add initialization logic to the MigrationIssue class. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Add a static method to parse issue body into configuration
2. Add initialization methods to handle both new and existing issues
3. Modify constructor to accept GHApi instance
4. Add method to generate issue body
5. Add method to create or load issue

migration-issue.js
Update the MigrationIssue class to handle initialization from GHApi.

<code>

The main changes include:

1. Constructor now accepts a GHApi instance as first parameter
2. Added parseIssueBody static method to parse configuration from issue body
3. Added generateIssueBody method to create the issue body format
4. Added initialize async method that either creates a new issue or loads an existing one
5. The initialize method returns the issue number in both cases

To use this updated class:

<code>
Remember how we said it’s always important to review suggestions from Copilot? In this case, the  method wasn’t connected to the constructor, like we would expect. We asked Copilot to address this issue with an iterative prompt.Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:The MigrationIssue class has an initialize function that encapsulates functionality that should be included in the constructor. Rewire the constuctor method to include the initialzie function.
And here was Copilot’s response:Let's modify the class to move the initialization logic into the constructor. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Make constructors async
2. Move initialization logic into constructor
3. Remove separate initialize method
4. Keep static parseIssueBody method

migration-issue.js
Move initialization logic into constructor.

<code>

The main changes:

1. Removed initialize method from the class
2. Added static create and load factory methods
3. Added save method to handle issue creation
4. Constructor remains synchronous but now only handles property initialization

Usage example:

<code>

This approach follows better object-oriented principles by:

1. Using factory methods for different creation scenarios
2. Keeping the constructor simple and synchronous
3. Separating issue creation into a distinct operation
4. Making the API more intuitive
In this case, Copilot suggested a different approach than we were thinking of with a factory method (which is a great way to handle different scenarios when creating or loading an issue). Even if it wasn’t what we were thinking, it worked and also kept the constructor clean and focused on just initializing the object. Moreover, the  method is a good way to encapsulate the logic for creating a new issue, and it makes the code more readable.Now we just needed to repeat this process with each of the new classes we added.Step 4: Final refactoringAfter we built a common module, we needed to refactor the client code to make it much cleaner and easier to read and maintain. After that, we’d also be able to identify and add any missing functionality in the common module.This was an iterative process, and we needed to go back and forth between the client code and the common module to make sure everything worked properly. Because of the way this project evolved, it afforded us the opportunity to make sweeping changes to the codebase. It’s much more common to make small, incremental changes to the codebase, especially if it’s code that’s actively in use. In both of these cases, don’t forget to write tests to ensure the code works as expected.Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:Using the gh-migrations module, refactor the create-migration-issues.js
And here was Copilot’s response:I'll help you refactor the create-migration-issues.js file to use the gh-migrations module. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the gh-migrations module
2. Create GHApi instance
3. Use MigrationIssue class for creating and managing migration issues
4. Simplify the main logic using the new classes

create-migration-issues.js
Refactor to use the gh-migrations module for better code organization and reusability.

<code>

The refactoring:

1. Removes redundant code by using the MigrationIssue class
2. Simplifies issue creation and management
3. Uses GHApi for GitHub API calls with built-in rate limiting
4. Removes duplicate code for different source types
5. Improves code organization and maintainability

The main changes:
  * Removed several helper functions as they're now part of the MigrationIssue class
  * Simplified the main logic flow
  * Added better error handling
  * Used structured configuration object
  * Maintained the same functionality while reducing code complexity
Now we needed to refactor the remaining scripts in the same manner. For example, this is how we used Copilot to help with refactoring the  script.Here was the prompt we entered for Copilot:Using the gh-migrations module refactor the create-team-issues.js
And here was Copilot’s response:I'll help you refactor the create-team-issues.js file to use the gh-migrations module. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the gh-migrations module
2. Replace manual issue creation with TeamIssue class
3. Simplify team creation logic using the new class
4. Maintain the same JiraIssue tracking functionality

create-team-issues.js
Refactor to use the gh-migrations module for creating team issues.

<code>

The refactoring:

1. Uses the TeamIssue class to manage team issue creation
2. Simplifies the code by removing redundant config and status objects
3. Uses GHApi for GitHub operations with built-in rate limiting
4. Maintains the same JiraIssue tracking functionality
5. Reduces code duplication by using a loop for team creation

The code is now more maintainable and follows the same pattern as the migration issues implementation.
From there, it was a matter of rinsing and repeating this process with each of our scripts.By first creating the common module, we could guide Copilot  and make sure that the final, refactored codebase was something we could use with multiple organizations. It gave us a foundation we could reuse and customize based on the needs of the system we were migrating.Sometimes refactoring code can be really easy, like our first example with the sequential  statements. But the more you dig into it, the more it grows, and you might find yourself facing down the Herculean task of trying to refactor a codebase that stretches across multiple files from a larger team of developers.Speaking from experience: It can be daunting to even know where to start.Remember to take a step back and start with the basics. Your first step should always be improving your  understanding of the codebase you want to refactor. The more you know about what you’re starting out with, the greater chance that you will be able to think of ways to refactor it effectively. And once you come up with some ideas, you can always ask GitHub Copilot to help turn your vision into reality. It’s got your back and is more than willing to help.Start using GitHub Copilot for free

3.14Python 3.14 is still in development. This release, 3.14.0a5, is the
fifth of seven planned alpha releases.Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current
state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of
the beta phase (2025-05-06) and, if necessary, may be modified or
deleted up until the release candidate phase (2025-07-22). Please keep
in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
 recommended for production environments.Many new features for Python 3.14 are still being planned and
written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:The next pre-release of Python 3.14 will be the penultimate alpha,
3.14.0a6, currently scheduled for 2025-03-14.2025-01-29 marked the start of a new lunar year, the Year of the
Snake 🐍 (and the Year of Python?).For centuries, π was often approximated as 3 in China. Some time
between the years 1 and 5 CE, astronomer, librarian, mathematician and
politician Liu Xin (劉歆) calculated π as 3.154.Around 130 CE, mathematician, astronomer, and geographer Zhang Heng
(張衡, 78–139) compared the celestial circle with the diameter of the
earth as 736:232 to get 3.1724. He also came up with a formula for the
ratio between a cube and inscribed sphere as 8:5, implying the ratio of
a square’s area to an inscribed circle is √8:√5. From this, he
calculated π as √10 (~3.162).Third century mathematician Liu Hui (刘徽) came up with an algorithm
for calculating π iteratively: calculate the area of a polygon inscribed
in a circle, then as the number of sides of the polygon is increased,
the area becomes closer to that of the circle, from which you can
approximate π.This algorithm is similar to the method used by Archimedes in the 3rd
century BCE and Ludolph van Ceulen in the 16th century CE (see 3.14.0a2
  release notes), but Archimedes only went up to a 96-sided polygon
(96-gon). Liu Hui went up to a 192-gon to approximate π as 157/50 (3.14)
and later a 3072-gon for 3.14159.Liu Hu wrote a commentary on the book The Nine Chapters on the
Mathematical Art which included his π approximations.In the fifth century, astronomer, inventor, mathematician,
politician, and writer Zu Chongzhi (祖沖之, 429–500) used Liu Hui’s
algorithm to inscribe a 12,288-gon to compute π between 3.1415926 and
3.1415927, correct to seven decimal places. This was more accurate than
Hellenistic calculations and wouldn’t be improved upon for 900
years.Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development

Some of the tactics have been pioneered by Wikimedia in countries with authoritarian governments and where editing Wikipedia is illegal or extremely dangerous. Last month,  obtained a document created by the Heritage Foundation called “Wikipedia Editor Targeting,” which set a goal to “identify and target Wikipedia editors abusing their position by analyzing text patterns, usernames, and technical data through data breach analysis, fingerprinting, HUMINT (human intelligence), and technical targeting.” The document discusses creating sock puppet accounts to “reveal patterns and provoke reactions,” discusses trying to track users’ geolocation, searching through hacked datasets for username reuse, and using Pimeyes, a facial recognition software, to learn the real identities of Wikipedia editors. Molly White of Citation Needed has an extensive rundown on Elon Musk’s crusade against Wikipedia, and both  and  have written about the right’s war on Wikipedia in recent days. In a series of calls and letters to the Wikimedia community over the last two weeks, Wikimedia executives have told editors that they are trying to figure out how to keep their users safe in an increasingly hostile political environment. “I’m keeping an eye on the rising noise of criticism from Elon Musk and others and I think that’s something we need to grapple with,” Wikimedia founder Jimmy Wales said in a meeting on January 30.“We’re seeing an increase in threats, both regulation and litigation across the world,” Wikimedia Foundation CEO Maryana Iskander told community members during the same January 30 meeting. “We’re all just trying to understand what is happening not only in the United States [but across the world], so the best we can do is monitor, check-in on staff, and try to understand what’s needed … that’s the most honest answer I can give you to an impossible set of questions we’re all grappling with on a daily basis.”Wikimedia lawyers told the community that the project is trying to change how editing Wikipedia for logged-out accounts works. Currently, if a user edits an article while not logged in, their IP address will show publicly, which can provide information to someone looking to file a defamation or libel lawsuit. Wikimedia is launching a “temporary accounts program” which will give editors who are not logged in a temporary username rather than showing an IP address. “It’s a way of ensuring that for logged-out users, their IP address isn’t visible to everyone asunder but rather available only to people who are really engaged in anti-vandalism,” Phil Bradley-Schmieg, a Wikimedia lawyer, said. Bradley-Schmieg also suggested that Wikimedia’s human rights team, which is focused on “helping users stay safe, particularly in countries where freedom of speech and expression is under attack on a regular basis,” may need to play a larger role across the entire project. Jacob Rogers, another Wikimedia lawyer, said during a separate meeting on January 30 that some Wikimedia projects in non-English languages have a feature where users are allowed to create and register a sock-puppet account (a dummy username, basically) to edit controversial articles and to register that account with administrators.“A number of the different language projects have the option to make legitimate sock puppet accounts if you’re going to work on something you know is going to be controversial, you can make a sock puppet and register it with admins on that project so it’s more obscure, kept separate from the rest of your life,” Rogers said. Both Rogers and Bradley-Schmieg said that Wikimedia has worked to limit the amount of data that the foundation has on any given user. IP addresses associated with edits are deleted or anonymized after 90 days, for example.“The foundation has very little data about most users, so if somebody is stepping up their harassment and coming to the foundation, we generally don’t really know anything about users in most cases and there’s not a lot they can get from us,” Rogers said. In the first six months of 2024, the last period for which data is available, Wikimedia received 26 formal requests for information on users; it provided info in two cases. Six of those requests came from the United States, the most of any jurisdiction.Wikimedia has also created a legal defense program that will in some cases fund the defense of Wikipedia editors who are attacked through the legal system as long as that editor or staffer was contributing to a Wikimedia project in good faith, Rogers said. Wikimedia has recently fought cases in both India and Germany.While Musk’s and the Heritage Foundation’s attacks on Wikipedia have escalated in recent days, these general trends are not new, and they were outlined as a threat in the foundation’s 2024 annual plan, which states the following: “Human rights threats are growing. Physical and legal threats against volunteers and staff who fight disinformation continue to grow. Accusations of bias and inaction by those whose preferred narratives do not prevail on Wikipedia may be encouraged and amplified by purveyors of disinformation,” the foundation wrote in an update to users. “Law is weaponized in important jurisdictions. Bad-faith lawsuits, by people who don’t like the verified information appearing on , are succeeding in some European countries. Some incumbent leaders are abusing their powers to silence and intimidate political opponents.”Iskander said in the meeting that the foundation is going to consider the safety of Wikipedians for its in-person events, such as Wikimania, an annual conference and party.“We’re paying very close attention trying to understand what the impacts might be and ensure those might be considered in any decisions we make. I will remind folks part of our processes in any event related to community gatherings is to do a risk assessment for community conferences for Wikimania,” she said. “It’s an imperfect and imprecise exercise but there’s a real intentionality around being thoughtful about the places that we’re selecting to ask people to gather and manage within our control.”It is not clear whether any of these steps will be sufficient, or whether any of them are going to make Wikipedia more resilient to right-wing attacks. What makes Wikipedia so strong is the fact that it has a distributed global base of dedicated volunteer editors, and a governance structure that is not very easy to infiltrate. Wikimedia’s decentralized power base makes it resistant to but not invulnerable from takeover attempts.During one of the meetings, Rogers was asked if Wikimedia would consider moving its headquarters out of the United States because of the political situation here. Rogers said moving “would probably not do very much because the projects would remain accessible in the United States and many things would still be subject to US law even if the foundation moved its headquarters to a different jurisdiction.”“I think a move would be extremely expensive and cost something in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. “I see that as one of the most significant, expensive, and extreme possible options. You would only do that if it was like, the only solution to a major problem where doing that would make sense.” The Wikimedia Foundation did not respond to a request for comment. The Heritage Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rubidium Can Be More Than a Lithium Cast-Off</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium</link><author>Elissa Welle</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjMyMTI2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MjI3MTA3OH0.Ryeo_Q5ykelatJkzIly879sUfQg0LtgR9rSWXhd5QV0/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[New extraction techniques makes the element—essential in high-tech timekeeping—easier to mine]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Python: Building a Python Command-Line To-Do App With Typer</title><link>https://realpython.com/courses/build-command-line-todo-app-typer/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building an application to manage your  can be an interesting project when you’re learning a new programming language or trying to take your skills to the next level.

DESCRIPTION
Kent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development. They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck’s 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).

Kent introduces radical techniques like Test && Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.

Kent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. [...]

The server retains some data from previous requests, making future interactions dependent on past state.In software systems,  refers to any data that persists across requests, such as user sessions, shopping carts, or authentication details.The choice between stateless and stateful architecture can affect scalability, performance, complexity, and cost.In this article, we’ll break down both the approaches, their advantages and trade-offs, and when to use each—with real-world examples.If you’re finding this newsletter valuable and want to deepen your learning, consider becoming a .As a paid subscriber, you'll receive an exclusive deep-dive article every week, access to a structured100+topics and interview questions, and other .In a , the system remembers client or process data () across multiple requests.Once a client connects, the server holds on to certain details—like user preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication sessions—so the client doesn’t need to resend everything with each request.Stateful systems typically store the state data in a database or in-memory storage. During online shopping, when you add items to your cart, the website remembers your selections. If you navigate away to browse more items and then return to your cart, your items are still there, waiting for you to check out.Common Patterns in Stateful ArchitectureIf you use  session storage (i.e., each app server keeps its own sessions locally), you can configure your load balancer for “sticky sessions.” This means: Once a client is assigned to , all subsequent requests from that client are routed to .: If Server A fails, the user’s session data is lost or the user is forced to re-log in. Sticky sessions are also less flexible when scaling because you can’t seamlessly redistribute user traffic to other servers.2. Centralized Session StoreA more robust approach is to store session data in a  or  store (e.g., Redis). : All servers can access and update session data for any user. Any server can handle any request, because the session data is not tied to a specific server’s memory.: You introduce network overhead and rely on an external storage. If the centralized storage fails, you lose session data unless you have a fallback strategy.Personalized Experiences: Stateful systems can deliver highly tailored interactions, as they remember user preferences and past actions. Users can seamlessly resume activities where they left off, even if they disconnect and reconnect. Certain operations can be faster because the server already possesses necessary data. Maintaining state for a large number of users can become resource-intensive and complex, as each server needs to keep track of specific sessions. Managing and synchronizing state across multiple servers (if needed) introduces additional challenges. If a server holding a user's state fails, their session data might be lost.E-commerce Shopping Carts – Stores cart contents and user preferences across multiple interactions, even if the user navigates away and returns.Video Streaming Services (Netflix, YouTube) – Remembers user watch progress, recommendations, and session data for a seamless experience.Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Slack) – Maintains active user sessions and message history for real-time communication.In a  architecture, the server does  preserve client-specific data between individual requests.Each request is treated as , with no memory of previous interactions.Every request must include all necessary information for processing.Once the server responds, it discards any temporary data used for that request.: Most  follow a stateless design. For instance, when you request weather data from a public API, you must provide all required details (e.g., location) in each request. The server processes it, sends a response, and forgets the interaction.Common Patterns in Stateless Architecture1. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)A very popular way to implement statelessness is through tokens, particularly  (JSON Web Tokens):Client Authenticates Once: The user logs in using credentials (username/password) for the first time, and the server issues a signed .: The client includes JWT token in each request (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token> header).: The server validates the token’s signature and any embedded claims (e.g., user ID, expiry time).: The server does  need to store session data; it just verifies the token on each request.Many APIs, including OAuth-based authentication systems, use JWTs to enable stateless, scalable authentication.Stateless architectures benefit from , ensuring that repeated requests produce the same result. This prevents inconsistencies due to network retries or client errors. A  request with the same payload  updates the user’s data but doesn’t create duplicates.Idempotent APIsensures consistency and reliability, especially in distributed systems where requests might be retried automatically. Stateless systems are inherently easier to scale horizontally. New servers can be added effortlessly, as they don't need to maintain any specific user sessions. Since servers don't track state, the architecture is generally simpler and easier to manage. The failure of a single server won't disrupt user sessions, as data isn't tied to specific servers.With no session data stored on the server, you free up memory that would otherwise be reserved for session management.Easier to Cache Responses: Since requests are self-contained, caching layers (like CDNs) can more easily store and serve responses. Stateless systems can't provide the same level of personalization or context awareness as stateful systems without additional effort (like using cookies or tokens).The client must keep track of the authentication token or relevant data. If it loses the token, it must re-authenticate. Every request needs to carry all the required information, potentially leading to larger payloads.Microservices Architecture: Each service handles requests independently, relying on external databases or caches instead of maintaining session data.Public APIs (REST, GraphQL): Clients send tokens with each request, eliminating the need for server-side sessions.Tokens are securely stored on the device and sent with every request to authenticate users.Stateless endpoints make caching easier since responses depend only on request parameters, not stored session data. A CDNcan cache and serve repeated requests, improving performance and reducing backend load.There's no one-size-fits-all answer when choosing between stateful and stateless architectures.The best choice depends on your application’s needs, scalability goals, and user experience expectations.When to Choose Stateful ArchitectureStateful systems are ideal when user context and continuity are critical. Consider a stateful approach if your application:Requires personalization (e.g., user preferences, session history)Needs real-time interactions (e.g., chat applications, multiplayer gaming)Manages multi-step workflows (e.g., online banking transactions, checkout processes)Must retain authentication sessions for security and convenience A shopping cart in an e-commerce app should persist, so users don’t have to re-add items after refreshing the page.When to Choose Stateless ArchitectureStateless systems work best when scalability, simplicity, and resilience are top priorities. Use a stateless approach if your application:Handles a high volume of requests and needs to scale efficientlyDoesn’t require storing client-specific data between requestsNeeds fast, distributed processing without server dependenciesMust ensure reliability and failover readiness A weather API doesn’t need to remember previous requests. Each query includes the location, and the response is processed independently.Hybrid Approaches: The Best of Both WorldsMany modern applications  stateful and stateless components for flexibility.This hybrid approach allows:Stateless APIs for core functionality, ensuring high scalabilityStateful sessions for personalization, improving user experienceExternal session stores (e.g., Redis) to manage state while keeping app servers stateless A video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix) uses a stateless backend for streaming but retains stateful user sessions to track watch history and recommendations.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

She is currently a member of the Django 6.x Steering Council and she has been a DSF member since March 2021. 
You can learn more about Lily by visiting her GitHub profile.Let’s spend some time getting to know Lily better!Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc)My name is Lily Foote and I’ve been contributing to Django for most of my career. I’ve also recently got into Rust and I’m excited about using Rust in Python projects. When I’m not programming, I love hiking, climbing and dancing (Ceilidh)! I also really enjoying playing board games and role playing games (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons).How did you start using Django?I’d taught myself Python in my final year at university by doing Project Euler problems and then decided I wanted to learn how to make a website. Django was the first Python web framework I looked at and it worked really well for me.What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?I’ve done a small amount with Flask and FastAPI. More than any new features, I think the thing that I’d most like to see is more long-term contributors to spread the work of keeping Django awesome.What projects are you working on now?The side project I’m most excited about is Django Rusty Templates, which is a re-implementation of Django’s templating language in Rust.Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?What are the top three things in Django that you like?Django Conferences, the mentorship program Djangonaut Space and the whole community!You have been a mentor multiple times with GSoC and Djangonaut Space program, what is required according to you to be a good mentor?I think being willing to invest time is really important. Checking in with your mentees frequently and being an early reviewer of their work. I think this helps keep their motivation up and allows for small corrections early on.Any advice for future contributors?Start small and as you get more familiar with Django and the process of contributing you can take on bigger issues. Also be patient with reviewers – Django has high standards, but is mostly maintained by volunteers with limited time.Yes! It’s a huge honour! Since January, we’ve been meeting weekly and it feels like we’ve hardly scratched the surface of what we want to achieve. The biggest thing we’re trying to tackle is how to improve the contribution experience – especially evaluating new feature ideas – without draining everyone’s time and energy.You have a lot of knowledge in the Django ORM, how did you start to contribute to this part?I added the Greatest and Least expressions in Django 1.9, with the support of one of the core team at the time. After that, I kept showing up (especially at conference sprints) and finding a new thing to tackle.Is there anything else you’d like to say?Thank you for doing the interview, Lily!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Tuesday, February 11th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9318, (Tue, Feb 11th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31672</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 02:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

connection isn't required for software to elicit feelings of connection between humans.Building on this conclusion: let's explore how Animal Crossing software was able to intercommunicate without requiring
a centralized server and infrastructure and the trade-offs for these design decisions.Distributing digital goods without the internetAnimal Crossing has over 1,000 unique items that need to be collected
for a complete catalog, including furniture, wallpapers, clothing, parasols, and carpets.
Many of these items are quite rare or were only programmed to be accessible
through an official Nintendo-affiliated distribution such as a magazine or online contest.Beyond official distributions, it's clear Animal Crossings' designer, Katsuya Eguchi,
wanted players to  to complete their catalogs.
The game incentivized trading items between towns by assigning
one “native fruit” (Apple, Orange, Cherry, Peach, or Pear) and
randomly making a subset of items harder to find than others depending
on a hidden “item group” variable (either A, B, or C).Items could be exchanged between players when one player visits another town,
but this required physically bringing your memory card to another
players' GameCube. The GameCube might have come with a handle, but the 'cube wasn't exactly a . Sharing a physical space isn't something you can do with everyone or on a regular basis.So what did Katsuya Eguchi design for Animal Crossing? To allow for item distributions from magazines and contests and to make player-to-player item sharing easier Animal Crossing included a feature called “secret codes”.This feature worked by allowing players to exchange 28-character codes with Tom Nook for items. Players could also generate codes for their friends to “send” an item from their own game to a different town. Codes could be shared by writing them on a paper note, instant message, or text message.The forgotten durability of offline software
This Reddit comment thread from the GameCube subreddit was the initial inspiration for this entire series.
The post is about someone's niece who just started playing Animal Crossing for the first time.
The Redditor asked folks to send items to their nieces' town using the secret code system.
This ended up surprising many folks that this system 
 in a game that was over 23 years old!
For reference, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo Network were only available for 8 and 13 years respectively.
Below are a handful of the comments from the thread:“For real does this still work lol?”It's hard not to take these comments as indicators that something is
 with internet-connected software today. What had to go wrong for a 
system continuing to work to ? Many consumers' 
experience with 
software products
today is that they become useless e-waste after some far-away service is 
discontinued a few years after purchase.My intuition from this is that software that requires centralized servers and infrastructure to function
will have shorter lifetimes than software which is offline or only
opportunistically uses online functionality.I don't think this is particularly insightful,
more dependencies always means less resilience. But if we're building software for human connection then the software
should optimally only be limited by the availability of humans to connect.What is centralization good for?Animal Crossings' secret code system is far from perfect. The system is easily abusable, as the same secret codes can be
reused over-and-over by the same user to duplicate items without ever expiring. The only limit was that 3 codes could be used per day.Not long after Animal Crossing's release
the secret code algorithm was reverse-engineered so secret codes 
for any item could be created for any town and recipient name as if they came from an official Nintendo distribution.
This was possible because the secret code system relied on "security through obscurity".Could  be the answer to preventing these abuses?The most interesting property that a centralized authority approach
provides is : forcing everyone to play by the same rules. By storing
the “single source-of-truth” a central authority is able to prevent abuses
like the ones mentioned above.For example, a centralized “secret code issuing server” could generate
new unique codes per-use and check each code's validity
against a database to prevent users from generating their
own illegitimate codes or codes being re-used multiple times.The problem with
centralized consensus is it tends to be  to cover the entire software state.
A centralized server can generate codes perfectly, but how can that same server
 that the items you're exchanging for codes were obtained legitimately? To know this
the server would also need to track item legitimacy, leading to software which requires
an internet connection to operate.This is optimal from a correctness perspective, but as was noted earlier,
I suspect that if such a server was a mandatory part of the secret code system
in Animal Crossing that the system would likely not be usable today.This seems like a trade-off, which future would you rather have?Redesigning Animal Crossing secret codesIf I were designing Animal Crossings' secret code system with modern hardware, what would it look like?
How can we keep the offline fall-back while providing consensus and being less
abusable, especially for official distributions.I would likely use a public-key cryptographic system for official distributions,
embedding a certificate that could be used to “verify” that specific secret codes
originated from the expected centralized entity. Codes that are accepted would be
recorded to prevent reusing the same code multiple times in the same town.
Using public-key cryptography prevents the
system from being reverse-engineered to distribute arbitrary items until the certificate
private key was cracked.For sharing items between players I would implement a system where each town
generated a public and private key and the public key was shared to other towns
whenever the software was able to, such as when a player visited the other town.
Players would only be able to send items to players that they have visited
(which for Animal Crossing required physical presence, more on this later!)Each sender could store a nonce value for
each potential recipient. Embedding that nonce into the secret code would allow
the recipients' software to verify that the specific code hadn't been used yet.
The nonce wouldn't have to be long to avoid simple reusing of codes.Both above systems would require much more data to be embedded into each “secret
code” compared to the 28-character codes from the GameCube. For this I would
use QR codes to embed over 2KB of data into a single QR code. Funnily enough,
Animal Crossing New Leaf and onwards use QR code technology for players to share design patterns.This design is still abusable if users can modify their software or hardware
but doesn't suffer from the trivial-to-exploit flaws of Animal Crossing's secret code system.Decentralized global consensus?What if we could have the best of both worlds: we want consensus
that is both  and . At least today, we are out of luck.Decentralized global consensus is technologically feasible, but the existing solutions
(mostly blockchains)
are expensive (both in energy and capital) and can't handle throughput on any sort of 
meaningful scale.There are many other decentralized consensus systems that 
are able to form “pockets” of useful peer-to-peer consensus using a fraction of
the resources, such as email, BitTorrent, ActivityPub, and Nostr.
These systems are only possible by adding  or by only guaranteeing .When is global consensus needed?Obviously global consensus is important for certain classes of software like 
financial, civics, and infrastructure, but I wonder how the necessity
of consensus in software changes for software with different risk
profiles.For software which has fewer risks associated with misuse is there as much
need for global consensus?
How can  be designed to reduce risk and require
less consensus to be effective? If global consensus and centralized 
servers become unnecessary, can we expect  to be usable 
on much longer timescales, essentially for as long as there are users?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brave Now Lets You Inject Custom JavaScript To Tweak Websites</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/10/2348258/brave-now-lets-you-inject-custom-javascript-to-tweak-websites?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brave Browser version 1.75 introduces "custom scriptlets," a new feature that allows advanced users to inject their own JavaScript into websites for enhanced customization, privacy, and usability. The feature is similar to the TamperMonkey and GreaseMonkey browser extensions, notes BleepingComputer. From the report: "Starting with desktop version 1.75, advanced Brave users will be able to write and inject their own scriptlets into a page, allowing for better control over their browsing experience," explained Brave in the announcement. Brave says that the feature was initially created to debug the browser's adblock feature but felt it was too valuable not to share with users. Brave's custom scriptlets feature can be used to modify webpages for a wide variety of privacy, security, and usability purposes.
 
For privacy-related changes, users write scripts that block JavaScript-based trackers, randomize fingerprinting APIs, and substitute Google Analytics scripts with a dummy version. In terms of customization and accessibility, the scriptlets could be used for hiding sidebars, pop-ups, floating ads, or annoying widgets, force dark mode even on sites that don't support it, expand content areas, force infinite scrolling, adjust text colors and font size, and auto-expand hidden content.
 
For performance and usability, the scriptlets can block video autoplay, lazy-load images, auto-fill forms with predefined data, enable custom keyboard shortcuts, bypass right-click restrictions, and automatically click confirmation dialogs. The possible actions achievable by injected JavaScript snippets are virtually endless. However, caution is advised, as running untrusted custom scriptlets may cause issues or even introduce some risk.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I ♥ Free Software Day 2025: Let&apos;s celebrate the people who make and maintain free software</title><link>http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/i-love-free-software-2025</link><author></author><category>linux</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/recent-blog-posts">Dev - Free Software Foundation</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's celebrate the people behind free software and tell them how much we appreciate their work! ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech is supposed to make our lives easier (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/131</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/131/changelog-news-131.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 21:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bill Maher excoriates the software industry for making our lives more difficult, two professors from the University of Washington put together a curriculum to help us manage life in the ChatGPT world, Daniel Delaney thinks deeply on chat as a dev tool UI, Benedict Evans explores our assumptions that computers be ‘correct’ & the Thoughtbot team writes up six cases when not to refactor.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Its software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution empowers leading banks and lenders with deep customer insights and AI-driven decision-making capabilities.Making credit decisions using AI can be challenging, requiring data science and portfolio teams to synthesize complex subject matter information and collaborate productively. To solve this challenge, RDC used generative AI, enabling teams to use its solution more effectively: – Designed for data science teams, this agent assists teams in developing, building, and deploying AI models within a regulated environment. It aims to boost team efficiency by answering complex technical queries across the machine learning operations (MLOps) lifecycle, drawing from a comprehensive knowledge base that includes environment documentation, AI and data science expertise, and Python code generation. – Designed for portfolio managers and analysts, this agent facilitates natural language inquiries about loan portfolios. It provides critical insights on performance, risk exposures, and credit policy alignment, enabling informed commercial decisions without requiring in-depth analysis skills. The assistant is adept at high-level questions (such as identifying high-risk segments or potential growth opportunities) and one-time queries, allowing the portfolio to be diversified.In this post, we discuss how RDC uses generative AI on Amazon Bedrock to build these assistants and accelerate its overall mission of democratizing access to sustainable credit.Solution overview: Building a multi-agent generative AI solutionWe began with a carefully crafted evaluation set of over 200 prompts, anticipating common user questions. Our initial approach combined prompt engineering and traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, we encountered a challenge: accuracy fell below 90%, especially for more complex questions.To overcome the challenge, we adopted an agentic approach, breaking down the problem into specialized use cases. This strategy equipped us to align each task with the most suitable foundation model (FM) and tools. Our multi-agent framework is orchestrated using LangGraph, and it consisted of: – The orchestrator is responsible for routing user questions to the appropriate agent. In this example, we start with the data science or portfolio agent. However, we envision many more agents in the future. The orchestrator can also use user context, such as the user’s role, to determine routing to the appropriate agent. – The agent is designed for a specialized task. It’s equipped with the appropriate FM for the task and the necessary tools to perform actions and access knowledge. It can also handle multiturn conversations and orchestrate multiple calls to the FM to reach a solution. – Tools extend agent capabilities beyond the FM. They provide access to external data and APIs or enable specific actions and computation. To efficiently use the model’s context window, we construct a tool selector that retrieves only the relevant tools based on the information in the agent state. This helps simplify debugging in the case of errors, ultimately making the agent more effective and cost-efficient.This approach gives us the right tool for the right job. It enhances our ability to handle complex queries efficiently and accurately while providing flexibility for future improvements and agents.The following image is a high-level architecture diagram of the solution.Data science agent: RAG and code generationTo boost productivity of data science teams, we focused on rapid comprehension of advanced knowledge, including industry-specific models from a curated knowledge base. Here, RDC provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python coding, catering to various team roles. One role is model validator, who rigorously assesses whether a model aligns with bank or lender policies. To support the assessment process, we designed an agent with two tools: – Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases powers our intelligent content retrieval through a streamlined RAG implementation. The service automatically converts text documents to their vector representation using Amazon Titan Text Embeddings and stores them in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. Because the knowledge is vast, it performs semantic chunking, making sure that the knowledge is organized by topic and can fit within the FM’s context window. When users interact with the agent, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using OpenSearch Serverless provides fast, in-memory semantic search, enabling the agent to retrieve the most relevant chunks of knowledge for relevant and contextual responses to users. – With code generation, we selected Anthropic’s Claude model on Amazon Bedrock due to its inherent ability to understand and generate code. This tool is grounded to answer queries related to data science and can generate Python code for quick implementation. It’s also adept at troubleshooting coding errors.Portfolio agent: Text-to-SQL and self-correctionTo boost the productivity of credit portfolio teams, we focused on two key areas. For portfolio managers, we prioritized high-level commercial insights. For analysts, we enabled deep-dive data exploration. This approach empowered both roles with rapid understanding and actionable insights, streamlining decision-making processes across teams.Our solution required natural language understanding of structured portfolio data stored in Amazon Aurora. This led us to base our solution on a text-to-SQL model to efficiently bridge the gap between natural language and SQL.To reduce errors and tackle complex queries beyond the model’s capabilities, we developed three tools using Anthropic’s Claude model on Amazon Bedrock for self-correction: – Verifies and corrects SQL queries, addressing common issues such as data type mismatches or incorrect function usage – Validates query results, providing relevance and prompting retries or user clarification when needed – Engages users for additional information when queries are too broad or lack detail, guiding the interaction based on database information and user inputThese tools operate in an agentic system, enabling accurate database interactions and improved query results through iterative refinement and user engagement.To improve accuracy, we tested model fine-tuning, training the model on common queries and context (such as database schemas and their definitions). This approach reduces inference costs and improves response times compared to prompting at each call. Using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, we fine-tuned Meta’s Llama model by providing a set of anticipated prompts, intended answers, and associated context. Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart offers a cost-effective alternative to third-party models, providing a viable pathway for future applications. However, we didn’t end up deploying the fine-tuned model because we experimentally observed that prompting with Anthropic’s Claude model provided better generalization, especially for complex questions. To reduce operational overhead, we will also evaluate structured data retrieval on Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.Conclusion and next steps with RDCTo expedite development, RDC collaborated with AWS Startups and the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center. Through an iterative approach, RDC rapidly enhanced its generative AI capabilities, deploying the initial version to production in just 3 months. The solution successfully met the stringent security standards required in regulated banking environments, providing both innovation and compliance.“The integration of generative AI into our solution marks a pivotal moment in our mission to revolutionize credit decision-making. By empowering both data scientists and portfolio managers with AI assistants, we’re not just improving efficiency—we’re transforming how financial institutions approach lending.”–Gordon Campbell, Co-Founder & Chief Customer Officer at RDCRDC envisions generative AI playing a significant role in boosting the productivity of the banking and credit industry. By using this technology, RDC can provide key insights to customers, improve solution adoption, accelerate the model lifecycle, and reduce the customer support burden. Looking ahead, RDC plans to further refine and expand its AI capabilities, exploring new use cases and integrations as the industry evolves.For more information about how to work with RDC and AWS and to understand how we’re supporting banking customers around the world to use AI in credit decisions, contact your AWS Account Manager or visit Rich Data Co.For more information about generative AI on AWS, refer to the following resources: is a Solutions Architect at AWS, focused on FinTech and SaaS startups.

According to a Capgemini survey of 1,100 executives at large enterprises, 10% of organizations already use AI agents, and more than half plan to use them in the next year. The recent release of the DeepSeek-R1 models brings state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities to the open source community. Organizations can build agentic applications using these reasoning models to execute complex tasks with advanced decision-making capabilities, enhancing efficiency and adaptability.In this post, we dive into how organizations can use Amazon SageMaker AI, a fully managed service that allows you to build, train, and deploy ML models at scale, and can build AI agents using CrewAI, a popular agentic framework and open source models like DeepSeek-R1.Agentic design vs. traditional software designAgentic systems offer a fundamentally different approach compared to traditional software, particularly in their ability to handle complex, dynamic, and domain-specific challenges. Unlike traditional systems, which rely on rule-based automation and structured data, agentic systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), can operate autonomously, learn from their environment, and make nuanced, context-aware decisions. This is achieved through modular components including reasoning, memory, cognitive skills, and tools, which enable them to perform intricate tasks and adapt to changing scenarios.Traditional software platforms, though effective for routine tasks and horizontal scaling, often lack the domain-specific intelligence and flexibility that agentic systems provide. For example, in a manufacturing setting, traditional systems might track inventory but lack the ability to anticipate supply chain disruptions or optimize procurement using real-time market insights. In contrast, an agentic system can process live data such as inventory fluctuations, customer preferences, and environmental factors to proactively adjust strategies and reroute supply chains during disruptions.Enterprises should strategically consider deploying agentic systems in scenarios where adaptability and domain-specific expertise are critical. For instance, consider customer service. Traditional chatbots are limited to preprogrammed responses to expected customer queries, but AI agents can engage with customers using natural language, offer personalized assistance, and resolve queries more efficiently. AI agents can significantly improve productivity by automating repetitive tasks, such as generating reports, emails, and software code. The deployment of agentic systems should focus on well-defined processes with clear success metrics and where there is potential for greater flexibility and less brittleness in process management.Generative AI on SageMaker AISageMaker AI, a fully managed service, provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to deliver high-performance, cost-efficient machine learning (ML) and generative AI solutions for diverse use cases. SageMaker AI empowers you to build, train, deploy, monitor, and govern ML and generative AI models through an extensive range of services, including notebooks, jobs, hosting, experiment tracking, a curated model hub, and MLOps features, all within a unified integrated development environment (IDE).SageMaker AI simplifies the process for generative AI model builders of all skill levels to work with foundation models (FMs):Amazon SageMaker Canvas enables data scientists to seamlessly use their own datasets alongside FMs to create applications and architectural patterns, such as chatbots and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), in a low-code or no-code environment.Amazon SageMaker JumpStart offers a diverse selection of open and proprietary FMs from providers like Hugging Face, Meta, and Stability AI. You can deploy or fine-tune models through an intuitive UI or APIs, providing flexibility for all skill levels.With SageMaker AI, you can build generative AI-powered agentic workflows using a framework of your choice. Some of the key benefits of using SageMaker AI for fine-tuning and hosting LLMs or FMs include: – SageMaker AI offers access to SageMaker JumpStart, a curated model hub where models with open weights are made available for seamless deployment through a few clicks or API calls. Additionally, for Hugging Face Hub models, SageMaker AI provides pre-optimized containers built on popular open source hosting frameworks such as vLLM, NVIDIA Triton, and Hugging Face Text Generation Inference (TGI). You simply need to specify the model ID, and the model can be deployed quickly.Instance-based deterministic pricing – SageMaker AI hosted models are billed based on instance-hours rather than token usage. This pricing model enables you to more accurately predict and manage generative AI inference costs while scaling resources to accommodate incoming request loads.Deployments with quantization – SageMaker AI enables you to optimize models prior to deployment using advanced strategies such as quantized deployments (such as AWQ, GPTQ, float16, int8, or int4). This flexibility allows you to efficiently deploy large models, such as a 32-billion parameter model, onto smaller instance types like ml.g5.2xlarge with 24 GB of GPU memory, significantly reducing resource requirements while maintaining performance.Inference load balancing and optimized routing – SageMaker endpoints support load balancing and optimized routing with various strategies, providing users with enhanced flexibility and adaptability to accommodate diverse use cases effectively.SageMaker fine-tuning recipes – SageMaker offers ready-to-use recipes for quickly training and fine-tuning publicly available FMs such as Meta’s Llama 3, Mistral, and Mixtral. These recipes use Amazon SageMaker HyperPod (a SageMaker AI service that provides resilient, self-healing clusters optimized for large-scale ML workloads), enabling efficient and resilient training on a GPU cluster for scalable and robust performance.CrewAI provides a robust framework for developing multi-agent systems that integrate with AWS services, particularly SageMaker AI. CrewAI’s role-based agent architecture and comprehensive performance monitoring capabilities work in tandem with Amazon CloudWatch.The framework excels in workflow orchestration and maintains enterprise-grade security standards aligned with AWS best practices, making it an effective solution for organizations implementing sophisticated agent-based systems within their AWS infrastructure.In this post, we demonstrate how to use CrewAI to create a multi-agent research workflow. This workflow creates two agents: one that researches on a topic on the internet, and a writer agent takes this research and acts like an editor by formatting it in a readable format. Additionally, we guide you through deploying and integrating one or multiple LLMs into structured workflows, using tools for automated actions, and deploying these workflows on SageMaker AI for a production-ready deployment.The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.To follow along with the code examples in the rest of this post, make sure the following prerequisites are met:Integrated development environment – This includes the following: 
  (Optional) Access to Amazon SageMaker Studio and the JupyterLab IDE – We will use a Python runtime environment to build agentic workflows and deploy LLMs. Having access to a JupyterLab IDE with Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 runtimes is recommended. You can also set up Amazon SageMaker Studio for single users. For more details, see Use quick setup for Amazon SageMaker AI. Create a new SageMaker JupyterLab Space for a quick JupyterLab notebook for experimentation. To learn more, refer to Boost productivity on Amazon SageMaker Studio: Introducing JupyterLab Spaces and generative AI tools. – You can also follow along in your local IDE (such as PyCharm or VSCode), provided that Python runtimes have been configured for site to AWS VPC connectivity (to deploy models on SageMaker AI).Permission to deploy models – Make sure that your user execution role has the necessary permissions to deploy models to a SageMaker real-time endpoint for inference. For more information, refer to Deploy models for inference. – The code used in this post is available in the following GitHub repo.Simplified LLM hosting on SageMaker AIBefore orchestrating agentic workflows with CrewAI powered by an LLM, the first step is to host and query an LLM using SageMaker real-time inference endpoints. There are two primary methods to host LLMs on SageMaker AI:Deploy from SageMaker JumpStartDeploy from Hugging Face HubDeploy DeepSeek from SageMaker JumpStartSageMaker JumpStart offers access to a diverse array of state-of-the-art FMs for a wide range of tasks, including content writing, code generation, question answering, copywriting, summarization, classification, information retrieval, and more. It simplifies the onboarding and maintenance of publicly available FMs, allowing you to access, customize, and seamlessly integrate them into your ML workflows. Additionally, SageMaker JumpStart provides solution templates that configure infrastructure for common use cases, along with executable example notebooks to streamline ML development with SageMaker AI.The following screenshot shows an example of available models on SageMaker JumpStart.To get started, complete the following steps:Run the following command in a Jupyter cell or the SageMaker Studio terminal:List all available LLMs under the Hugging Face or Meta JumpStart hub. The following code is an example of how to do this programmatically using the SageMaker Python SDK:from sagemaker.jumpstart.filters import (And, Or)
from sagemaker.jumpstart.notebook_utils import list_jumpstart_models

# generate a conditional filter to only select LLMs from HF or Meta
filter_value = Or(
    And("task == llm", "framework == huggingface"), 
    "framework == meta", "framework == deekseek"
)

# Retrieve all available JumpStart models
all_models = list_jumpstart_models(filter=filter_value)For example, deploying the  model directly from SageMaker JumpStart requires only a few lines of code:from sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel

model_id = " deepseek-llm-r1" 
model_version = "*"

# instantiate a new JS meta model
model = JumpStartModel(
    model_id=model_id, 
    model_version=model_version
)

# deploy model on a 1 x p5e instance 
predictor = model.deploy(
    accept_eula=True, 
    initial_instance_count=1, 
    # endpoint_name="deepseek-r1-endpoint" # optional endpoint name
)We recommend deploying your SageMaker endpoints within a VPC and a private subnet with no egress, making sure that the models remain accessible only within your VPC for enhanced security.Deploy DeepSeek from Hugging Face HubAlternatively, you can deploy your preferred model directly from the Hugging Face Hub or the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard to a SageMaker endpoint. Hugging Face LLMs can be hosted on SageMaker using a variety of supported frameworks, such as NVIDIA Triton, vLLM, and Hugging Face TGI. For a comprehensive list of supported deep learning container images, refer to the available Amazon SageMaker Deep Learning Containers. In this post, we use a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B SageMaker endpoint using the TGI container for agentic AI inference. We deploy the model from Hugging Face Hub using Amazon’s optimized TGI container, which provides enhanced performance for LLMs. This container is specifically optimized for text generation tasks and automatically selects the most performant parameters for the given hardware configuration. To deploy from Hugging Face Hub, refer to the  or the following code snippet:import json
import sagemaker
import boto3
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel, get_huggingface_llm_image_uri
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Model configuration
hub = {'HF_MODEL_ID':'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B', #Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct
       'SM_NUM_GPUS': json.dumps(number_of_gpu),
       'HF_TOKEN': HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN,
       'SAGEMAKER_CONTAINER_LOG_LEVEL': '20',  # Set to INFO level
       'PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF': 'expandable_segments:True'  # configure CUDA memory to use expandable memory segments
}
# Create and deploy model
huggingface_model =   HuggingFaceModel(image_uri=get_huggingface_llm_image_uri("huggingface", 
version="2.3.1"),
env=hub,
role=role,sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session)
predictor = huggingface_model.deploy(
               initial_instance_count=1,
               instance_type="ml.p4d.24xlarge"
               endpoint_name=custom_endpoint_name,
               container_startup_health_check_timeout=900)A new DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70Bendpoint should be  in under 10 minutes. If you want to change the model from DeepSeek to another model from the hub, simply replace the following parameter or refer to the DeepSeek deploy example in the following GitHub repo. To learn more about deployment parameters that can be reconfigured inside TGI containers at runtime, refer to the following GitHub repo on TGI arguments....
"HF_MODEL_ID": "deepseek-ai/...", # replace with any HF hub models
# "HF_TOKEN": "hf_..." # add your token id for gated models
...For open-weight models deployed directly from hubs, we strongly recommend placing your SageMaker endpoints within a VPC and a private subnet with no egress, making sure that the models remain accessible only within your VPC for a secure deployment.Build a simple agent with CrewAICrewAI offers the ability to create multi-agent and very complex agentic orchestrations using LLMs from several LLM providers, including SageMaker AI and Amazon Bedrock. In the following steps, we create a simple blocks counting agent to serve as an example.Create a blocks counting agentThe following code sets up a simple blocks counter workflow using CrewAI with two main components:Agent creation (blocks_counter_agent) – The agent is configured with a specific role, goal, and capabilities. This agent is equipped with a tool called .Task definition (count_task) – This is a task that we want this agent to execute. The task includes a template for counting how many of each color of blocks are present, where  will be replaced with actual color of the block. The task is assigned to .from crewai import Agent, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# 1. Configure agent
blocks_counter_agent = Agent(
    role="Blocks Inventory Manager",
    goal="Maintain accurate block counts",
    tools=[BlocksCounterTool],
    verbose=True
)

# 2. Create counting task
count_task = Task(
    description="Count {color} play blocks in storage",
    expected_output="Exact inventory count for specified color",
    agent=blocks_counter_agent
)As you can see in the preceding code, each agent begins with two essential components: an agent definition that establishes the agent’s core characteristics (including its role, goal, backstory, available tools, LLM model endpoint, and so on), and a task definition that specifies what the agent needs to accomplish, including the detailed description of work, expected outputs, and the tools it can use during execution.This structured approach makes sure that agents have both a clear identity and purpose (through the agent definition) and a well-defined scope of work (through the task definition), enabling them to operate effectively within their designated responsibilities.Tools are special functions that give AI agents the ability to perform specific actions, like searching the internet or analyzing data. Think of them as apps on a smartphone—each tool serves a specific purpose and extends what the agent can do. In our example,  helps the agent count the number of blocks organized by color.Tools are essential because they let agents do real-world tasks instead of just thinking about them. Without tools, agents would be like smart speakers that can only talk—they could process information but couldn’t take actual actions. By adding tools, we transform agents from simple chat programs into practical assistants that can accomplish real tasks.Out-of-the-box tools with CrewAICrew AI offers a range of tools out of the box for you to use along with your agents and tasks. The following table lists some of the available tools.For reading various file formatsFor web content extractionFor searching YouTube channelsFor searching PDF documentsFor Python code interpretationBuild custom tools with CrewAIYou can build custom tools in CrewAI in two ways: by subclassing BaseTool or using the @tool decorator. Let’s look at the following BaseTool subclassing option to create the BlocksCounterTool we used earlier:from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class BlocksCounterTool(BaseTool):
    name = "blocks_counter" 
    description = "Simple tool to count play blocks"

    def _run(self, color: str) -> str:
        return f"There are 10 {color} play blocks available"Build a multi-agent workflow with CrewAI, DeepSeek-R1, and SageMaker AIMulti-agent AI systems represent a powerful approach to complex problem-solving, where specialized AI agents work together under coordinated supervision. By combining CrewAI’s workflow orchestration capabilities with SageMaker AI based LLMs, developers can create sophisticated systems where multiple agents collaborate efficiently toward a specific goal. The code used in this post is available in the following GitHub repo.Let’s build a research agent and writer agent that work together to create a PDF about a topic. We will use a DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Llama 3.3 70B model as a SageMaker endpoint for the LLM inference.Define your own DeepSeek SageMaker LLM (using LLM base class) The following code integrates SageMaker hosted LLMs with CrewAI by creating a custom inference tool that formats prompts with system instructions for factual responses, uses Boto3, an AWS core library, to call SageMaker endpoints, and processes responses by separating reasoning (before </think>) from final answers. This enables CrewAI agents to use deployed models while maintaining structured output patterns.# Calls SageMaker endpoint for DeepSeek inference
def deepseek_llama_inference(prompt: dict, endpoint_name: str, region: str = "us-east-2") -> dict:
    try:
        # ... Response parsing Code...

    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error while calling SageMaker endpoint: {e}")

# CrewAI-compatible LLM implementation for DeepSeek models on SageMaker.
class DeepSeekSageMakerLLM(LLM):
    def __init__(self, endpoint: str):
        # <... Initialize LLM with SageMaker endpoint ...>

    def call(self, prompt: Union[List[Dict[str, str]], str], **kwargs) -> str:
        # <... Format and return the final response ...>Name the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled endpoint Set the endpoint name as defined earlier when you deployed DeepSeek from the Hugging Face Hub:deepseek_endpoint = "deepseek-r1-dist-v3-llama70b-2025-01-22"Create a DeepSeek inference tool Just like how we created the BlocksCounterTool earlier, let’s create a tool that uses the DeepSeek endpoint for our agents to use. We use the same BaseTool subclass here, but we hide it in the CustomTool class implementation in sage_tools.py in the tools folder. For more information, refer to the GitHub repo.from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process 

# Create the Tool for LLaMA inference
deepseek_tool = CustomTool(
    name="deepseek_llama_3.3_70B",
    func=lambda inputs: deepseek_llama_inference(
        prompt=inputs,
        endpoint_name=deepseek_endpoint
    ),
    description="A tool to generate text using the DeepSeek LLaMA model deployed on SageMaker."
)
 Just like the simple blocks agent we defined earlier, we follow the same template here to define the research agent. The difference here is that we give more capabilities to this agent. We attach a SageMaker AI based DeepSeek-R1 model as an endpoint for the LLM.This helps the research agent think critically about information processing by combining the scalable infrastructure of SageMaker with DeepSeek-R1’s advanced reasoning capabilities.The agent uses the SageMaker hosted LLM to analyze patterns in research data, evaluate source credibility, and synthesize insights from multiple inputs. By using the deepseek_tool, the agent can dynamically adjust its research strategy based on intermediate findings, validate hypotheses through iterative questioning, and maintain context awareness across complex information it gathers.# Research Agent

research_agent = Agent(
    role="Research Bot",
    goal="Scan sources, extract relevant information, and compile a research summary.",
    backstory="An AI agent skilled in finding relevant information from a variety of sources.",
    tools=[deepseek_tool],
    allow_delegation=True,
    llm=DeepSeekSageMakerLLM(endpoint=deepseek_endpoint),
    verbose=False
)
 The writer agent is configured as a specialized content editor that takes research data and transforms it into polished content. This agent works as part of a workflow where it takes research from a research agent and acts like an editor by formatting the content into a readable format. The agent is used for writing and formatting, and unlike the research agent, it doesn’t delegate tasks to other agents.writer_agent = Agent(
    role="Writer Bot",
    goal="Receive research summaries and transform them into structured content.",
    backstory="A talented writer bot capable of producing high-quality, structured content based on research.",
    tools=[deepseek_tool],
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=DeepSeekSageMakerLLM(endpoint=deepseek_endpoint),
    verbose=False
)Define tasks for the agents Tasks in CrewAI define specific operations that agents need to perform. In this example, we have two tasks: a research task that processes queries and gathers information, and a writing task that transforms research data into polished content.Each task includes a clear description of what needs to be done, the expected output format, and specifies which agent will perform the work. This structured approach makes sure that agents have well-defined responsibilities and clear deliverables.Together, these tasks create a workflow where one agent researches a topic on the internet, and another agent takes this research and formats it into readable content. The tasks are integrated with the DeepSeek tool for advanced language processing capabilities, enabling a production-ready deployment on SageMaker AI.research_task = Task(
    description=(
        "Your task is to conduct research based on the following query: {prompt}.\n"
    ),
    expected_output="A comprehensive research summary based on the provided query.",
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[deepseek_tool]
)

writing_task = Task(
    description=(
              "Your task is to create structured content based on the research provided.\n""),
    expected_output="A well-structured article based on the research summary.",
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[deepseek_tool]
)
 A crew in CrewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow. In this specific example, the sequential process makes sure tasks are executed one after the other, following a linear progression. There are other more complex orchestrations of agents working together, which we will discuss in future blog posts.This approach is ideal for projects requiring tasks to be completed in a specific order. The workflow creates two agents: a research agent and a writer agent. The research agent researches a topic on the internet, then the writer agent takes this research and acts like an editor by formatting it into a readable format.Let’s call the crew scribble_bots:# Define the Crew for Sequential Workflow # 

scribble_bots = Crew( agents=[research_agent, writer_agent], 
       tasks=[research_task, writing_task], 
       process=Process.sequential # Ensure tasks execute in sequence)
Use the crew to run a task We have our endpoint deployed, agents created, and crew defined. Now we’re ready to use the crew to get some work done. Let’s use the following prompt:result = scribble_bots.kickoff(inputs={"prompt": "What is DeepSeek?"})Our result is as follows:**DeepSeek: Pioneering AI Solutions for a Smarter Tomorrow**

This was informed by many incredible colleagues at Cohere, C4AI, and the open source and open science ML community. But to have an opportunity to collaborate with the legendary Andrew Ng and the team at DeepLearning.ai we took them to the next level with animations and a concise narrative meant to enable technical learners to pick up an ML paper and understand the architecture description. In this course, you'll learn how a transformer network architecture that powers LLMs works. You'll build the intuition of how LLMs process text and work with code examples that illustrate the key components of the transformer architecture. Key topics covered in this course include: The evolution of how language has been represented numerically, from the Bag-of-Words model through Word2Vec embeddings to the transformer architecture that captures word meanings in full context. How LLM inputs are broken down into tokens, which represent words or pieces before they are sent to the language model. The details of a transformer and the three main stages, consisting of tokenization and embedding, the stack of transformer blocks, and the language model head. The details of the transformer block, including attention, which calculates relevance scores followed by the feedforward layer, which incorporates stored information learned in training. How cached calculations make transformers faster, how the transformer block has evolved over the years since the original paper was released, and how they continue to be widely used.

By automating repetitive editing tasks, Crop.photo enables enterprises to reduce image processing time from hours to minutes, allowing creative teams to focus on higher-value activities.Challenges in the ecommerce industryThe ecommerce industry often encounters the following challenges:Inefficiencies and delays in manual image editing – Ecommerce companies rely on manual editing for tasks like resizing, alignment, and background removal. This process can be time-consuming and prone to delays and inconsistencies. A more efficient solution is needed to streamline the editing process, especially during platform migrations or large updates.Maintaining uniformity across diverse image types – Companies work with a variety of image types, from lifestyle shots to product close-ups, across different categories. Maintaining uniformity and professionalism in all image types is essential to meet the diverse needs of marketing, product cataloging, and overall brand presentation.Large-scale migration and platform transition – Transitioning to a new ecommerce platform involves migrating thousands of images, which presents significant logistical challenges. Providing consistency and quality across a diverse range of images during such a large-scale migration is crucial for maintaining brand standards and a seamless user experience.For a US top retailer, wholesale distribution channels posed a unique challenge. Thousands of fashion images need to be made for the marketplace with less than a day’s notice for flash sales. Their director of creative operations said,“Crop.photo is an essential part of our ecommerce fashion marketplace workflow. With over 3,000 on-model product images to bulk crop each month, we rely on Crop.photo to enable our wholesale team to quickly publish new products on popular online marketplaces such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Bloomingdales. By increasing our retouching team’s productivity by over 70%, Crop.photo has been a game changer for us. Bulk crop images used to take days can now be done in a matter of seconds!”Challenges in the sports industryThe sports industry often contends with the following challenges:Bulk player headshot volume and consistency – Sports organizations face the challenge of bulk cropping and resizing hundreds of player headshots for numerous teams, frequently on short notice. Maintaining consistency and quality across a large volume of images can be difficult without AI.Diverse player facial features – Players have varying facial features, such as different hair lengths, forehead sizes, and face dimensions. Adapting cropping processes to accommodate these differences traditionally requires manual adjustments for each image, which leads to inconsistencies and significant time investment.Editorial time constraints – Tight editorial schedules and resource limitations are common in sports organizations. The time-consuming nature of manual cropping tasks strains editorial teams, particularly during high-volume periods like tournaments, where delays and rushed work can impact quality and timing.An Imaging Manager at Europe’s Premier Football Organization expressed,“We recently found ourselves with 40 images from a top flight English premier league club needing to be edited just 2 hours before kick-off. Using the Bulk AI headshot cropping for sports feature from Crop.photo, we had perfectly cropped headshots of the squad in just 5 minutes, making them ready for publishing in our website CMS just in time.

The book is titled  , and here is how it turned out:My wife is delighted with it, so it was worth all the effort.This post will take you through the process. It will be a long one, but please stick around - I promise there will be a lot of pretty pictures.Here is the outline of the post:I had this idea for a while after seeing something similar somewhere on the internet.. Since then, I always wanted to make one for my wife - a physically small book with a bunch of small drawings of our memories together, inside jokes, and little things she likes.I wanted the illustrations to be hand-drawn, and I had a plan to ask my friend to do them. But I knew he would refuse any kind of payment, so I felt bad adding more work to his plate. So I shelved the idea, but every now and then, it would pop up in my head.Fast forward a few years - we got a kid, and our routine completely changed. We are enjoying it a lot, but it can be very exhausting, and every day seems identical to the last. That's why I decided I needed to do something for her to break the routine. The book idea seemed perfect - personal and handcrafted - so I gave it a try.To be able to do everything myself, I went to create digital drawings and then draw them on paper using my trusty pen plotter.With the idea in place, I moved on to creating the drawings - which turned out to be a challenge of its own.For pen plotting, one needs vector files, so I started drawing in Figma. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that my drawing skills would not get me the result I had envisioned. Determined to do it this time, I decided to try using AI to generate images.I got myself a Midjourney subscription and started playing with it. It took a lot of failed attempts to figure out how to get drawings that were simple and had a strong hand-drawn feel to them. Even then, I ended up editing every one of them, but more on that later.One of the first images I was satisfied with (it didn't end up in the book, though):It took a lot of time, but it was fun. Failed attempts were often quirky and funny, and I was learning how to use the tool. And it made me feel like a secret agent, doing it next to my wife, who had no idea what I was up to.I may be wrong, but I think Midjourney wasn't built for the kind of illustrations I had in mind. I was after simple, hand-drawn illustrations that felt personal. Luckily, I found a style reference () that worked well for my case. I used it to generate almost all of the drawings that ended up in the book. For those who haven't used Midjourney - you can use images as style references to influence the style of images you want to generate.Most of my images were generated using that  code and a  between 150 and 400 (it can go from 0 to 1000).As for the prompts, these are the key terms I combined with the description and the style reference:isolated on white backgroundIt took me a lot of tries - between 10 and 30 attempts for each image you see in the book.Once I solved the image generation part, I had to figure out how to turn them into vector files for plotting. The first thing I tried was something similar to halftone. As you can see below, in this process, the images completely lost the hand-drawn feel.Then I remembered this plot of Marble Machine X I did a while ago, for which I used AutoTrace to convert the original image to a vector file. The great thing about AutoTrace is that it supports "centerline tracing". And this time, I learned that Inkscape has a great AutoTrace plugin, which made it even easier to convert.What makes centerline tracing differentMost of the tools that convert raster to vector images do it by outlining shapes. This is not suitable for plotting, as each line in the original image becomes a sausage-like shape. Centerline tracing, on the other hand, tries to draw a single line following the middle path through shapes. Don't worry if it sounds confusing; the example below should make things clearer.Here is the image of Link from  generated by Midjourney:After applying a common vectorization technique, we get this. As you can see, each line in the original drawing is now outlined, creating this messy-looking image.But if we use centerline tracing, it suddenly looks a lot more like a drawing. It is not perfect, but don't worry - we are going to clean it up in the next step.In the points where lines touch or cross, AutoTrace is not sure which line to follow and creates these funky-looking joints. Here is an exaggerated example to show you what I'm talking about. Input is the raster image at the top and the vectorized result is at the bottom:But I found out that if I roughly separate these lines, I get a much better result.Let's now apply this technique to the image of Link we've seen above. After separating lines (and some cleaning up) this is the image I ended up with. It is rough, but it is only used as an input for the tracing process, so it doesn't really matter. This was manual and somewhat tedious process, but I enjoyed it overall. It was a sort of meditation for me.And finally, when we trace this image, we get a really nice and clean vector file perfect for plotting. Here is another example. We start with the image I generated using Midjourney:After editing, removing details and separating lines, we get this one:And the traced vector result:You'll notice that in both examples I did  . I did that for pretty much all of the images, to fix things I wasn't able to polish using prompts. I also removed a lot of details to make sure images are crisp and readable at the small size.All of this took a lot of experimentation, but it gave me a pretty solid workflow which I used to generate all of the images. The complete flow looks like this:Generate images using Midjourney.Upscale them two times, because upscaled images were easier to edit and tracing was more precise.Clean up, redraw and separate lines by hand using Gimp.Use Inkscape plugin to run AutoTrace centerline tracing.It took me a while to generate all the images, and the fact that I was trying to keep it a secret from my wife didn't help. I think I did it over the span of two weeks, mostly in the evening after she would go to bed. never stood a chance!Before we continue I just want to show you two funky images of Link that really made me laugh:With the drawings ready, I turned to the next crucial part - the text. I first wanted to write everything by hand, photograph it and then vectorize it in the same way I did with the images. But it was a hassle - I had to do a lot of editing for text to look as my handwriting.Evil Mad Scientist, the maker of my pen plotter, has a fantastic tool called Hershey Text. It contains a bunch of single-line fonts ideal for plotting. I chose the EMS Elfin font as it looked playful and hand-drawn. I used it to write all of the text in the book and I think it turned out great.The tricky part with bookbinding is that pages are not printed in order, but in a way that when you fold the sheets in half, you get the right order. I used Figma to design the layout, with a great care to make sure pages are in order after double-sided plotting.Here is the layout laid out on A4 sized paper. Sorry for blurring the text, but a lot of it is very personal and I want to keep it for our eyes only.Plotting is the part that went the smoothest, but not without hiccups. I usually use Pigma Micron blackliner markers. They use archival quality ink and they are literally indestructible. But this time, even the thinnest one I had was too thick for the book this small.Here you can see the first  using markers of 0.2mm and 0.1mm thickness respectively. Lines got a bit smudged and looked much thicker than I expected. This was also the moment I realized I need to remove  from the images to make them readable at this size.I needed to find a thinner pen.Technical pen to the rescueBlackliner markers were made as a more practical replacement for technical pens. But from what I've read, an old-school technical pen was the only thing capable of achieving super-fine lines I wanted. I went online and ordered Rotring Isograph 0.2mm. As soon as it arrived I sneaked out to my study and did another test plot using it. Oh boy, was I happy when I saw the result:Lines were thin and crisp and at this point I was convinced the project will be a success!All of the first plots were done on 120gsm printer paper. It is somewhat thick paper and drawings looked fantastic. Unfortunately, when I bound the pages together, the drawings and letters would get transferred on the opposite pages. I could probably get away with it, considering the whole hand made feel of the book. But I wanted it to be perfect.A friend advised me to leave ink to dry for a few hours. I left each side to dry for 24 hours, but it smudged again. Next time I tried putting the plot (before cutting the pages) between two sheets of papers and pressing it with heavy books. I did that for more than 24 hours, but still after cutting and bounding the pages, they got smudged again. At this point I was becoming somewhat desperate. As the last resort I ordered different, 100gsm paper and to my relief it worked! Crisis averted!In the final version you can still see tiny traces on a few pages, but these are barely visible and don't really bother me.After plotting and cutting I was left with a stack of somewhat delicate pages. Now, it was finally time to turn them into a book.As you can imagine, I had zero bookbinding experience. There are a lot of resources online, but two of them were crucial for my project as they were on how to bind tiny books:After reading and watching these and a few generic articles on bookbinding, I gathered enough info to try doing it myself. I thought I was super clever because I 3D printed sides and spine of the book. I designed sewing holes in the spine so I can connect the pages directly to it without using glue. It was a decent idea, but it left a gap between two  . Still, I went with it for the first try.I laid everything down on the canvas that the book would be wrapped in and started assembling it. But I made a crucial mistake - I used super glue. It dries quickly, it is stiff, and doesn't glue 3D printed plastic well and it dissolved the paper I used. Long story short, I made a mess. But I didn't stress too much, I just proclaimed that version is a prototype and used it as a learning experience.I ordered proper bookbinding glue (PVA). While I was waiting for it, I focused on properly sewing the pages together.The first time I sewed the pages together, I poked the holes by hand and they were somewhat uneven. Again, it was nothing major, but I didn't like it. So I designed and 3D printed a simple tool to help me drill the holes evenly.The tool has two parts, and the pages fit snugly between them. Both top and bottom parts have holes, so I was able to put the needle through and poke perfectly even holes in the pages. I'm very proud of this silly contraption.Here you can see all of the eight sheets with sewing holes.Fun fact, I designed all 3D parts using JavaScript and Replicad library. Here is a link if you want to play with the model in your browser.But I ditched the 3D printed spine and used the technique called , which works great when you have only two signatures. It made signatures way more tight than when I connected them separately to the 3D printed spine.When the glue arrived, I plotted everything again and took it from the top. I swapped 3D printed sides for cardboard. Using proper glue was a game changer. I had enough time to apply it before it hardened, and when it dried it stayed flexible. And when it got onto my fingers, it was easy to remove. Everything was much cleaner, and I finally managed to put it all together.Unfortunately, I was rushing to finish the book, so I didn't take any photos of the process. But here are a few I do have:If you are an experienced bookbinder and reading this, I'm sorry for the bookbinding crimes I probably committed. I promise I won't use super glue again.It looked great! It was not perfect (more on that below), but I was super happy with how it turned out. It had a distinct handcrafted feel to it, the images turned out fantastic, and I think I really managed to bring out a personal touch with it.On the day I finished the book and gave it to my wife, we were both exhausted (our kid was teething, and we had a very rough night), so I thought she would appreciate a little pick-me-up.When I gave it to her, the first thing she asked was, "Will I cry?". She was brave, but it definitely got her all mushy and made her day. After reading, she carefully put it on the shelf, out of the reach of the little one.Then I asked her if she ever suspected I was preparing a surprise for her, and she said that she had no idea. But she also said that she thought it was weird that I would often plot something and not brag about it to her afterwards. It was true, I love showing her my work, but luckily she didn't give it too much thought, and I was able to finish my secret project.One thing I would like to fixLike I mentioned, the book isn't perfect. The sides are a bit too large, so the pages seem too deep inside when the book is closed. For the same reason, the end pages turned out to be a bit short, which gives it a weird, uneven look. It is purely aesthetic, but I think it is the only thing keeping it from being perfect.Lesson learned if I ever end up doing something similar.It took way longer than it should have—it took me a month and a half to finish it. It took so long because I did it in secrecy, which meant working late in the evenings when my wife and kid were asleep. A bunch of little failures... ehm, I mean  also prolonged the project. And finally, I had to order multiple things, so I was blocked a few times while I was waiting for four different deliveries.But the final assembly took me around two and a half hours from start to finish - plotting, cutting, sewing, and bookbinding. Mostly because I had already practiced all of them and defined the exact process.It was so much fun. I love projects that span across multiple disciplines. This one touched AI, drawing, plotting, modeling, 3D printing, sewing, and bookbinding. I encountered a lot of little hiccups, but I also learned about all of them. Some of the errors I made could have been avoided if I had been more patient. But I hope you'll cut me some slack - I was super excited and eager to see how it would turn out, and I had limited time windows when I could do it in secrecy. Still, I need to take it as a lesson - being patient will help me save time when doing projects like this one.The highlight for me was that I could do it without an illustrator. Love it or hate it, AI ended up being a fantastic tool that filled the gap in my skill set, which was crucial for making the book.I hope you enjoyed this write-up as much as I enjoyed making the book and writing the post. And I do hope I inspired you to try making something of your own.

To enable such teams to provide new features efficiently, it is desirable to minimize the need for coordination between them. This calls for a modularization that verticalizes the system into low-coupled areas individual teams can take care of.There are several possibilities for implementing such high-level modules (also called verticals). For instance, they can be implemented using a respective folder structure or in the form of several libraries in a Monorepo. Micro Frontends go one step further and designate a separate application for each vertical. This architectural style promises several advantages, such as a high amount of team autonomy, but it also comes with numerous challenges.The first part of this article provides a critical overview of the benefits and drawbacks of Micro Frontends in the space of single-page applications. The second part discusses how such an architecture can be implemented with Native Federation, a community project built upon web standards that provide close integration with the Angular CLI.Motivation Behind Micro FrontendsLike Micro Services, Micro Frontends promise several advantages, both technically and with respect to the organization. As applying Micro Frontend architectures results in several smaller applications, testing, performance tuning, and isolating faults in one part of the overarching system becomes more effortless, according to several sources.However, the increased team autonomy was the main reason for applying this architectural style in the numerous cases I was involved in as a consultant. Individual teams are not blocked by waiting for other teams and can deploy separately anytime. This might not be a significant concern in a vast number of projects. Still, as soon as we talk about multi-team projects in a corporate environment with long communication paths and decision times, this aspect quickly becomes vital for the project’s success.Teams can also make their own decisions that best fit their goals — architecturally and technology-wise. Mixing multiple client-side frameworks in the same application is considered an anti-pattern and should be avoided. However, it can help to create a migration path over to a new stack in the long run. The concern in corporate environments is that we find software solutions that usually outlive the average technology stackSince Micro Frontends result in separate build processes, combining them with incremental builds, where only changed applications need to be rebuilt, has a massive potential for build-time improvements. For instance, the well-known Nx build system provides this option. Interestingly, this feature can also be used without applying other aspects such as aligning teams with individual applications or separate deployments. There is debate about whether leveraging this tempting option automatically leads to micro frontend architectures.A system consisting of several smaller applications can provide further organizational advantages: It’s easier to onboard new members and scale the development by adding further micro frontends. Team autonomy also leads to faster release cycles.Challenges to keep in mindEvery architectural decision has consequences that need to be evaluated, and Micro Frontends are no exception. Besides the positive consequences outlined above, there are also several negative ones to consider.For instance, individually developed Micro Frontends can diverge in UI/UX, leading to an inconsistent appearance. Also, loading several applications increases the number of bundles that need to be downloaded, adversely affecting loading times and increasing the memory pressure.Splitting an application into low-coupled parts might be a best practice in general. However, it is often hard to define the boundaries between verticals clearly enough to implement them as individual applications. Also, while having several small applications at first glance simplifies the implementation, integrating them into an overarching solution brings additional complexity.This leads to one of the biggest challenges I have seen in practice: we are moving away from a compile-time integration towards a runtime integration. This has severe consequences because we cannot easily foresee problems that might arise when individually developed and deployed applications start interacting at runtime. Besides the chance of technical conflicts, we also have to see that the current generation of SPA frameworks has not been built with such an operation mode in mind.Instead, modern SPA frameworks, especially Angular, have been developed to focus on compile time optimizations. A powerful compiler leverages type checks to identify technical conflicts and emits efficient source code optimized for tree-shaking. Furthermore, the CLI in the Angular space provides a highly optimized build process. An off-label usage necessary for implementing Micro Frontends undermines some of these achievements.Angular Does Not Officially Support Micro FrontendsFor all the outlined reasons, the Angular team recommends checking if alternatives, like implementing the individual verticals in Monorepos, which can be compiled together, are suitable. For instance, Google adopted this approach years ago and manages all its products and libraries in a single Monorepo.Of course, there are also ways to compensate for the disadvantages outlined here, and some of them, like establishing a design system to help with a consistent UI/UX or lazy loading individual system parts, might be needed in general. More details on such compensation strategies can be found in this survey of more than 150 Micro Frontend practitioners.All architectural decisions have benefits and drawbacks and should be evaluated with those considerations if you are going to implement a solution. If such an evaluation reveals that Micro Frontends provide more advantages than alternatives for achieving your very goals, the following sections provide you a well-lit path for implementing this architectural pattern with Angular.Micro Frontends with FederationModule Federation is a popular technology for implementing Micro Frontends and sharing dependencies. Shipped initially with webpack 5, it comes with a tooling-agnostic runtime and provides compile-time integration into  and . Besides the usage of the vite dev server, these technologies are currently not supported by the Angular CLI. However, promising community solutions like and AnalogJS allow them to be used with Angular. Nx and my CLI-plugin provide an effortless integration.Module Federation enables an application to load parts of other separately built and deployed applications lazily. The loading application is referred to as the host; the integrated ones are called remotes:Federation, if permitted by the library version, can share dependencies like Angular or RxJS between the host and remotes. There are several configuration options for preventing version mismatches. Since MF can only decide which dependencies to share at runtime, tree-shaking for shared parts is not possible.To inform the host about the remotes and their shared dependencies, Module Federation creates a metadata file, the so-called remote entry, during the build. This file needs to be loaded into the host.To fully decouple the idea of Federation from specific bundlers, I started the project Native Federation several years ago. Its API surface is very similar to that of Module Federation. The focus is on portability and standards like ECMAScript modules and Import Maps. Its compile time acts as a wrapper around existing bundlers. For the communication with the bundler, it uses an exchangeable adapter:The integration into the Angular CLI directly delegates to Angular’s  that leverages the fast bundler esbuild, and is the foundation for several current features like partial hydration. Because of its architecture, Native Federation can also be ported to further builders or other innovations the CLI might provide in the long run.For integrating Micro Frontends built with Angular’s webpack-based builder, there is a bridging solution allowing the loading of such remotes into a Native Federation host. This solution enables the gradual adoption of the CLI’s new  and permits the sharing of dependencies between the two kinds of Federation. One of the features added recently is support for SSR and Hydration, which is vital for performance-critical applications like public portals and web shops.Native Federation for Angular is close to the CLI’s , but its compilation mode is for shared dependencies differs. While it works well for packages that align with Angular’s Package Format, which is the case for all libraries built with the CLI, other libraries might provide some challenges, especially older ones that still use CommonJS or older conventions for providing metadata.Using Native Federation in AngularFor the setup Native Federation provides a schematic:ng add @angular-architects/native-federation --project mfe1 --port 4201 --type remoteThe switch  defines the kind of the application. Possible options are , , and . The latter is a host configured with a configuration file (federation manifest) during application start. This manifest informs the application of the locations of the remotes and can be switched out by another manifest during deployment:{    "mfe1" : "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.json"The key, in this case, is a short name the host uses to refer to the Micro Frontend. The value is the location of the remote entry with the metadata mentioned above. Alternatively, the manifest can be replaced by a service that informs the host of the current location of all deployed remotes and acts as a Micro Frontend registry.The schematic configures the Native Federation builder delegation to the  and creates a configuration file :const { withNativeFederation, shareAll }     = require('@angular-architects/native-federation/config');module.exports = withNativeFederation({    './Component': './projects/mfe1/src/app/app.component.ts',    ...shareAll({}),    'rxjs/ajax',    'rxjs/testing',    // Add further packages you don't need at runtimeThe configuration assigns a unique name to the remote or host and defines which dependencies to share. Instead of providing an exhaustive list of all the dependencies to share, the configuration uses the helper function , which adds all dependencies found in the project’s . The skip list is used to opt out of sharing some of them or their secondary entry points.Remotes also define exposed EcmaScript modules that can be loaded into the shell. For this, the  node maps the paths of the modules to short names such as  in the example shown.The schematic also adds code to initialize Native Federation to the . For the host, this code points to the federation manifest:import { initFederation } from '@angular-architects/native-federation';initFederation('federation.manifest.json')  .catch(err => console.error(err))  .then(_ => import('./bootstrap'))  .catch(err => console.error(err));After initializing federation, the file , also created by the schematic, is loaded. It contains the usual code for bootstrapping Angular, e.g., via  when the application uses Standalone Components.To load a component or routing configuration exposed by a remote, traditional lazy loading is combined with Native Federation’s  function:import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/native-federation';export const APP_ROUTES: Routes = [  [...]    path: 'flights',      loadRemoteModule('mfe1', './Component').then((m) => m.AppComponent),];Here,  is the key defined in the manifest, and  points to the respective exposed module in the remote’s federation configuration.More information on Native Federation can be found in this blog article and in the project’s readme, which also links to a tutorial.Micro Frontends promise significant advantages for enterprise-scale applications, such as enhanced team autonomy and independent deployment. These benefits make this architectural style particularly appealing in multi-team corporate environments where streamlined communication and rapid development cycles are critical. Additionally, they support gradual migration to new technologies and optimize build times by leveraging incremental builds.However, these advantages come with trade-offs. Micro Frontends can lead to inconsistent UI/UX, increased load times, and complex runtime integrations. Defining clear vertical boundaries and managing inter-application communication add to the challenge. Furthermore, frameworks like Angular, designed for compile-time optimization, face limitations in runtime integration scenarios. The Angular team, therefore, recommends alternatives such as splitting an application into libraries managed within a Monorepo, which aligns better with Angular’s strengths in type safety and efficient compilation.Module Federation has emerged as a popular solution to address some challenges by enabling lazy loading and dependency sharing. Native Federation builds on these concepts with a focus on standards and portability. It provides a seamless integration into the Angular CLI and its performant esbuild-based , which is also the foundation for advanced features like SSR and hydration.Together with this team at , Manfred Steyer helps companies around the globe establish maintainable Angular-based Architectures.

It is so called generative art: I write the software, and the software creates art autonomously. 
            A nice introduction into generative art is this talk by Tim Holman.
          
          In a gallery in London, I came across gorgeaus screenprints by Ricky Byrne. I loved their use of color and hand-produced feel. Attention for color, layout, tension.
          So I started experimenting with maze generation algorithms in Rust, with Nannou.
          In the process, I decided to make it a web app, for valentine, so everyone can create their own maze. And ported the Rust code to TypeScript in a tiny web app. The Coding Train has a great tutorial set on maze generation. I used the same common recursive backtracking algorithm, because the aesthetics are what I was looking for. 
          The names you provide are used to generate unique randomnes. 
          This is used in a maze generation algorithm to create a maze. 
          I deliberately chose to animate the maze generation, to show the process. It is a slow process, but I think it is interesting to watch it carve out your maze. 
          Saving, copying and sharing the maze is disabled until the maze is generated. Once the maze is generated, you can save, copy and share the maze. 
          Sharing, copying won't work on all browsers and is affected by some browser plugins or settings. The best result is on Chrome on Android. 
          , the only parameter you can provide is the names. The maze is generated based on these names, and the algorithm is fixed. This is by design. Only the two names determine the artwork. 
            However, you can change the source code, see below.
          
            The code is available on GitHub. Feel free to fork, change and improve it, or just have fun with it.

The neat part is, that as much as it helps with “top-level” organization, cascade layers can be nested, which allows us to author more precise styles based on the cascade.The only downside here is your imagination, nothing stops us from over-engineering CSS. And to be clear, you may very well consider what I’m about to show you as a form of over-engineering. I think I’ve found a balance though, keeping things simple yet organized, and I’d like to share my findings.Let’s explore a pattern for writing components in CSS using a button as an example. Buttons are one of the more popular components found in just about every component library. There’s good reason for that popularity because buttons can be used for a variety of use cases, including:performing actions, like opening a drawer,navigating to different sections of the UI, andholding some form of state, such as  or .And buttons come in several different flavors of markup, like , , and . There are even more ways to make buttons than that, if you can believe it.On top of that, different buttons perform different functions and are often styled accordingly so that a button for one type of action is distinguished from another. Buttons also respond to state changes, such as when they are hovered, active, and focused. If you have ever written CSS with the BEM syntax, we can sort of think  within the context of cascade layers..button {}
.button-primary {}
.button-secondary {}
.button-warning {}
/* etc. */Okay, now, let’s write some code. Specifically, let’s create a few different types of buttons. We’ll start with a  class that we can set on any element that we want to be styled as, well, a button! We already know that buttons come in different flavors of markup, so a generic  class is the most reusable and extensible way to select one or all of them..button {
  /* Styles common to all buttons */
}This is where we can insert our very first cascade layer! Remember, the reason we want a cascade layer in the first place is that it allows us to set the CSS Cascade’s reading order when evaluating our styles. We can tell CSS to evaluate one layer first, followed by another layer, then another — all according to the order we want. This is an incredible feature that grants us superpower control over which styles “win” when applied by the browser.We’ll call this layer  because, well, buttons are a type of component. What I like about this naming is that it is generic enough to support other components in the future as we decide to expand our design system. It scales with us while maintaining a nice separation of concerns with other styles we write down the road that maybe aren’t specific to components./* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {
  .button {
    /* Styles common to all buttons */
  }
}Here is where things get a little weird. Did you know you can  cascade layers  classes? That’s totally a thing. So, check this out, we can introduce a new layer inside the  class that’s already inside its own layer. Here’s what I mean:/* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {

  .button {
    /* Component elements layer */
    @layer elements {
      /* Styles */
    }
  }
}This is how the browser interprets that layer within a layer at the end of the day:@layer components {
  @layer elements {
    .button {
      /* button styles... */
    }
  }
}So far, we’ve established a  class inside of a cascade layer that’s designed to hold any type of  in our design system. Inside that  is another cascade layer, this one for selecting the different types of buttons we might encounter in the markup. We talked earlier about buttons being , , or  and this is how we can individually select style each type.We can use the  pseudo-selector function as that is akin to saying, “If this  an  element, then apply these styles.”/* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {
  .button {
    /* Component elements layer */
    @layer elements {
      /* styles common to all buttons */

      &:is(a) {
        /* <a> specific styles */
      }

      &:is(button) {
        /* <button> specific styles */
      }

      /* etc. */
    }
  }
}Defining default button stylesI’m going to fill in our code with the common styles that apply to all buttons. These styles sit at the top of the  layer so that they are applied to any and all buttons, regardless of the markup. Consider them default button styles, so to speak./* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {
  .button {
    /* Component elements layer */
    @layer elements {
      background-color: darkslateblue;
      border: 0;
      color: white;
      cursor: pointer;
      display: grid;
      font-size: 1rem;
      font-family: inherit;
      line-height: 1;
      margin: 0;
      padding-block: 0.65rem;
      padding-inline: 1rem;
      place-content: center;
      width: fit-content;
    }
  }
}Defining button state stylesWhat should our default buttons do when they are hovered, clicked, or in focus? These are the different  that the button might take when the user interacts with them, and we need to style those accordingly.I’m going to create a new cascade sub-layer directly under the  sub-layer called, creatively, :/* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {
  .button {
    /* Component elements layer */
    @layer elements {
      /* Styles common to all buttons */
    }

    /* Component states layer */
    @layer states {
      /* Styles for specific button states */
    }
  }
}Pause and reflect here. What states should we target? What do we want to change for each of these states?Some states may share similar property changes, such as  and  having the same background color. Luckily, CSS gives us the tools we need to tackle such problems, using the  function to group property changes based on the state. Why  instead of ?  comes with zero specificity, meaning it’s a lot easier to override than , which takes the specificity of the element with the highest specificity score in its arguments. Maintaining low specificity is a virtue when it comes to writing scalable, maintainable CSS./* Component states layer */
@layer states {
  &:where(:hover, :focus-visible) {
    /* button hover and focus state styles */
  }
}But how do we update the button’s styles in a  way? What I mean by that is how do we make sure that the button  like it’s hovered or in focus? We could just slap a new background color on it, but ideally, the color should be related to the  set in the  layer.So, let’s refactor things a bit. Earlier, I set the  element’s  to . I want to reuse that color, so it behooves us to make that into a CSS variable so we can update it once and have it apply everywhere. Relying on variables is yet another virtue of writing scalable and maintainable CSS.I’ll create a new variable called --button-background-color that is initially set to  and then set it on the default button styles:/* Component elements layer */
@layer elements {
  --button-background-color: darkslateblue;

  background-color: var(--button-background-color);
  border: 0;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: grid;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-family: inherit;
  line-height: 1;
  margin: 0;
  padding-block: 0.65rem;
  padding-inline: 1rem;
  place-content: center;
  width: fit-content;
}Now that we have a color stored in a variable, we can set that same variable on the button’s hovered and focused states in our other layer, using the relatively new  function to convert  to a lighter color when the button is hovered or in focus.Back to our  layer! We’ll first mix the color in a new CSS variable called :/* Component states layer */
@layer states {
  &:where(:hover, :focus-visible) {
    /* custom property only used in state */
    --state-background-color: color-mix(
      in srgb, 
      var(--button-background-color), 
      white 10%
    );
  }
}We can then apply that color as the background color by updating the  property./* Component states layer */
@layer states {
  &:where(:hover, :focus-visible) {
    /* custom property only used in state */
    --state-background-color: color-mix(
      in srgb, 
      var(--button-background-color), 
      white 10%
    );

    /* applying the state background-color */
    background-color: var(--state-background-color);
  }
}Defining modified button stylesAlong with  and  layers, you may be looking for some sort of variation in your components, such as . That’s because not all buttons are going to look like your default button. You might want one with a green background color for the user to confirm a decision. Or perhaps you want a red one to indicate danger when clicked. So, we can take our existing default button styles and modify them for those specific use cases If we think about the order of the cascade — always flowing from top to bottom — we don’t want the modified styles to affect the styles in the states layer we just made. So, let’s add a new  layer in between  and :/* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {

  .button {
  /* Component elements layer */
  @layer elements {
    /* etc. */
  }

  /* Component modifiers layer */
  @layer modifiers {
    /* new layer! */
  }

  /* Component states layer */
  @layer states {
    /* etc. */
  }
}Similar to how we handled , we can now update the --button-background-color variable for each button modifier. We could modify the styles further, of course, but we’re keeping things fairly straightforward to demonstrate how this system works.We’ll create a new class that modifies the  of the default button from  to . Again, we can rely on the  selector because we want the added specificity in this case. That way, we override the default button style with the modifier class. We’ll call this class  (green is a “successful” color) and feed it to :/* Component modifiers layer */
@layer modifiers {
  &:is(.success) {
    --button-background-color: darkgreen;
  }
}If we add the  class to one of our buttons, it becomes  instead  which is exactly what we want. And since we already do some -ing in the  layer, we’ll automatically inherit those hover and focus styles, meaning  is lightened in those states./* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {
  .button {
    /* Component elements layer */
    @layer elements {
      --button-background-color: darkslateblue;

      background-color: var(--button-background-color);
      /* etc. */

    /* Component modifiers layer */
    @layer modifiers {
      &:is(.success) {
        --button-background-color: darkgreen;
      }
    }

    /* Component states layer */
    @layer states {
      &:where(:hover, :focus) {
        --state-background-color: color-mix(
          in srgb,
          var(--button-background-color),
          white 10%
        );

        background-color: var(--state-background-color);
      }
    }
  }
}We can refactor any CSS property we need to modify into a CSS custom property, which gives us a lot of room for customization./* Components top-level layer */
@layer components {
  .button {
    /* Component elements layer */
    @layer elements {
      --button-background-color: darkslateblue;

      --button-border-width: 1px;
      --button-border-style: solid;
      --button-border-color: transparent;
      --button-border-radius: 0.65rem;

      --button-text-color: white;

      --button-padding-inline: 1rem;
      --button-padding-block: 0.65rem;

      background-color: var(--button-background-color);
      border: 
        var(--button-border-width) 
        var(--button-border-style) 
        var(--button-border-color);
      border-radius: var(--button-border-radius);
      color: var(--button-text-color);
      cursor: pointer;
      display: grid;
      font-size: 1rem;
      font-family: inherit;
      line-height: 1;
      margin: 0;
      padding-block: var(--button-padding-block);
      padding-inline: var(--button-padding-inline);
      place-content: center;
      width: fit-content;
    }

    /* Component modifiers layer */
    @layer modifiers {
      &:is(.success) {
        --button-background-color: darkgreen;
      }

      &:is(.ghost) {
        --button-background-color: transparent;
        --button-text-color: black;
        --button-border-color: darkslategray;
        --button-border-width: 3px;
      }
    }

    /* Component states layer */
    @layer states {
      &:where(:hover, :focus) {
        --state-background-color: color-mix(
          in srgb,
          var(--button-background-color),
          white 10%
        );

        background-color: var(--state-background-color);
      }
    }
  }
}P.S. Look closer at that demo and check out how I’m adjusting the button’s background using  — then go read Sara Joy’s “Come to the  Side” for a thorough rundown of how that works!What do you think? Is this something you would use to organize your styles? I can see how creating a system of cascade layers could be overkill for a small project with few components. But even a little toe-dipping into things like we just did illustrates how much power we have when it comes to managing — and even taming — the CSS Cascade. Buttons are deceptively complex but we saw how few styles it takes to handle everything from the default styles to writing the styles for their states and modified versions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It’s Time To Rethink 6G</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bandwidth</link><author>William Webb</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEzMDA0MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDEyMzk5Mn0.jPunQzFQ_dBRCyydxSdaI9lAn88q3l2GB9hsCIKa5BM/image.png?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s not more bandwidth that users need]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Join Strings in Python</title><link>https://realpython.com/python-join-string/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>Real Python Blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python’s built-in string method  lets you combine string elements from an iterable into a single string, using a separator that you specify. You call  on the separator, passing the iterable of strings to join.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:You use  in Python to  with a .A  is the piece of text you want inserted between each substring.To join list elements, you call  on a separator string, passing the list as the argument.inserts the separator between each list element to form a single string.The  method  that is the concatenation of the elements in the iterable, separated by the specified string.For smaller string concatenation tasks, you can use the concatenation operator () or  instead of .Python’s built-in  method gives you a quick and reliable way to combine multiple strings into a single string. Whether you need to format output or assemble data for storage,  provides a clean and efficient approach for joining strings from an iterable.In the upcoming sections, you’ll learn the basic usage of  to concatenate strings effectively. You’ll then apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios, from building CSV files to constructing custom log outputs. You’ll also discover some surprising pitfalls and learn how to avoid them. Test your knowledge with our interactive “How to Join Strings in Python” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Test your understanding of Python's .join() string method for combining strings, handling edge cases, and optimizing performance.How to Join Strings in Python Using To use the string method , you call  on a separator string and pass an iterable of other strings as the argument. The method returns a single string, where it has inserted the separator string between each element of the iterable:In this example, you joined a list of words into one sentence, separated by spaces.At first glance, this usage might look a little backward. In many other string operations, you call the method on the main string that you want to manipulate. However, with , you call the method on the separator string, then pass the iterable of strings that you want to combine:This example achieves the same result as the earlier one but splits the process into two steps. Defining  separately makes the code more readable and avoids the potentially odd-looking syntax of calling  directly on a short string literal. Remember that  is a  method, which means that you’ll need to call it on a  string object. Keeping that in mind may help you remember why you need to call it on the separator string.You rarely see code that’s written in multiple steps where you assign the separator string to a variable, like you did in the example above.In typical usage, you call  directly on the separator string, all in one line. This approach is more concise and highlights that any valid string can be your separator, whether it’s whitespace, a dash, or a multicharacter substring.Join With an Empty StringWhat if you don’t want any separator at all, but just want to concatenate the items? One valid approach is to use an empty string () as the separator:This code snippet concatenates the letters in the list, forming a single string . Using an empty string as the separator is a great way to assemble strings without a delimiter between them.Since  can take any iterable of strings—not just lists—you can even pass a string as an argument. Because strings are iterable, Python iterates over each character in that string, considering each character as a separate element:By calling  on  and passing the string , you effectively place a comma between every single character in . This might not always be what you intend, but it’s a neat trick to keep in mind if you ever need to treat each character as a separate element.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make Any File a Template Using This Hidden macOS Tool</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/make-any-file-a-template-using-this-hidden-macos-tool/</link><author>Geoff Graham</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:54:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Stationery Pad is a handy way to nix a step in your workflow if you regularly use document templates on your Mac.

But now long-time Slashdot reader theodp brings some news about the course's fate over at Yale. From Yale's student newspaper:


After a decade of partnership with Harvard, Yale's CS50 course will no longer be offered starting in fall 2025.... One of Yale's largest computer science courses, jointly taught with Harvard University, was canceled during a monthly faculty meeting after facing budgetary challenges. [Yale's endowment is $40+ billion]... Since Yale started offering the course in 2015, CS50 has consistently seen enrollment numbers in the hundreds and was often the department's largest class.... According to [Yale instructor Ozan] Erat, the original [anonymous] donation that made CS50 possible ended in June 2024, and the cost of employing so many undergraduate learning assistants for the course had become unsustainable.

Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. 
The reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: 

- "2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers..." — Daniel Almedia 

- "I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time." — Andrea Righi

 - "[T]he project faces unique challenges. Rust's biggest weakness, as a language, is that relatively few people speak it. Indeed, Rust is not a language for beginners, and systems-level development complicates things even more. That said, the Linux kernel project has historically attracted developers who love challenging software — if there's an open source group willing to put the extra effort for a better OS, it's the kernel devs." — Carlos Bilbao 

- "I played a little with [Rust] in user space, and I just absolutely hate the cargo concept... I hate having to pull down other code that I do not trust. At least with shared libraries, I can trust a third party to have done the build and all that... [While Rust should continue to grow in the kernel], if a subset of C becomes as safe as Rust, it may make Rust obsolete..." Steven Rostedt 

Rostedt wasn't sure if Rust would attract more kernel contributors, but did venture this opinion. "I feel Rust is more of a language that younger developers want to learn, and C is their dad's language." 

But still "contention exists within the kernel development community between those pro-Rust and -C camps," argues The New Stack, citing the latest remarks from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig (who had earlier likened the mixing of Rust and C to cancer). Three days later Hellwig reiterated his position again on the Linux kernel mailing list:

"Every additional bit that another language creeps in drastically reduces the maintainability of the kernel as an integrated project. The only reason Linux managed to survive so long is by not having internal boundaries, and adding another language completely breaks this. You might not like my answer, but I will do everything I can do to stop this. This is NOT because I hate Rust. While not my favourite language it's definitively one of the best new ones and I encourage people to use it for new projects where it fits. I do not want it anywhere near a huge C code base that I need to maintain." 

But the article also notes that Google "has been a staunch supporter of adding Rust to the kernel for Linux running in its Android phones."
The use of Rust in the kernel is seen as a way to avoid memory vulnerabilities associated with C and C++ code and to add more stability to the Android OS. "Google's wanting to replace C code with Rust represents a small piece of the kernel but it would have a huge impact since we are talking about billions of phones," Ojeda told me after his talk. 

In addition to Google, Rust adoption and enthusiasm for it is increasing as Rust gets more architectural support and as "maintainers become more comfortable with it," Ojeda told me. "Maintainers have already told me that if they could, then they would start writing Rust now," Ojeda said. "If they could drop C, they would do it...." 

Amid the controversy, there has been a steady stream of vocal support for Ojeda. Much of his discussion also covered statements given by advocates for Rust in the kernel, ranging from lead developers of the kernel and including Linux creator Linus Torvalds himself to technology leads from Red Hat, Samsung, Google, Microsoft and others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flipper Culture Is Wilder Than You Think</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFB8IuWXK68</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>Darknet diaries</category><category>infosec</category><category>video</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GFB8IuWXK68?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 17:00:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Jack Rhysider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Flipper Culture Is Wilder Than You Think

But he complains that many developers "use C++ as if it was still the previous millennium," in an article titled 21st Century C++ that promises "the key concepts on which performant, type safe, and flexible C++ software can be built: resource management, life-time management, error-handling, modularity, and generic programming... 

"At the end, I present ways to ensure that code is contemporary, rather than relying on outdated, unsafe, and hard-to-maintain techniques: guidelines and profiles."

To help developers focus on effective use of contemporary C++ and avoid outdated "dark corners" of the language, sets of guidelines have been developed. Here I focus on the C++ Core guidelines that I consider the most ambitious... My principal aim is a type-safe and resource-safe use of ISO standard C++. That is: 

- Every object is exclusively used according to its definition
- No resource is leaked 
This encompasses what people refer to as memory safety and much more. It is not a new goal for C++. Obviously, it cannot be achieved for every use of C++, but by now we have years of experience showing that it can be done for modern code, though so far enforcement has been incomplete... When thinking about C++, it is important to remember that C++ is not just a language but part of an ecosystem consisting of implementations, libraries, tools, teaching, and more. 
WG21 (and others) are working on "profiles" to enforce guidelines (though they're "not yet available, except for experimental and partial versions"). But Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines "use a strategy known as subset-of-superset."

 First: extend the language with a few library abstractions: use parts of the standard library and add a tiny library to make use of the guidelines convenient and efficient (the Guidelines Support Library, GSL).
 Next: subset: ban the use of low-level, inefficient, and error-prone features. 
What we get is "C++ on steroids": Something simple, safe, flexible, and fast; rather than an impoverished subset or something relying on massive run-time checking. Nor do we create a language with novel and/or incompatible features. The result is 100% ISO standard C++. Messy, dangerous, low-level features can still be enabled and used when needed. 
Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines focus on rules "we hope that everyone eventually could benefit from."

No uninitialized variables
No range or nullptr violations
No resource leaks
No dangling pointers
No type violations
No invalidation
