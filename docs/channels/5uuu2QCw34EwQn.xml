The stadium’s latest $560M renovation–from the concession stands to the seating bowl–helped save it from demolition after Hurricane Katrina. NFL games have increasingly become more expensive with the addition of amenities like luxury field suites and club lounges, but all of these redesigns are done in order to increase revenue and efficiency. WSJ spoke with the architect behind the Superdome’s plan, who explains how stadium design is evolving to create more revenue streams.

Last year, the ICC issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the nation's former defense minister over the military campaign in Gaza. Earlier this week, Trump said more than 2 million residents of Gaza should move abroad so US companies could clear the landscape and rebuild it after the Israel-Hamas war.

Former UK Ambassador to the UK, Nigel Sheinwald, says President Trump's vision for the future of Gaza remains unclear, as many doubt the immediate ramification of the conflict and ceasefire. "The idea that extending the McKinley doctrine of a century and a quarter ago, to taking scraps of land around the world, that does not make sense today," Sheinwald says.

Sheinwald joined "The Pulse with Francine Lacqua" on Bloomberg TV on Feb. 7, 2025.

Allegations include providing false financial information and receiving inflated sponsorship revenue from firms linked to the club’s owners. The case sparked concerns in the UK government about its potential impact on Abu Dhabi's broader investment in Britain, amid already strained relations between the UK and the UAE. Bloomberg's Abeer Abu Omar breaks down the situation.

"Both Estonia and the other Baltic countries have left Russia's frequency area."All three countries have successfully disconnected from the Russian-controlled and BRELL agreement-managed IPS/UPS system, and Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian transmission system operators (TSOs) Elering, Augstsprieguma tīkls (AST) and Litgrid are currently operating independently in island mode, Elering said in a press release Saturday morning.The Baltic TSOs will conduct isolated operation testing before synchronizing with the Continental European Synchronous Area (CESA) on Sunday, Elering said in a press release on Saturday."We managed just fine," Köster confirmed."The whole process lasted nearly three hours," he explained. "Our southern neighbors began operations at 6 a.m. The lines between Lithuania and the Königsberg [Kaliningrad] area went offline at around 6:40,the Lithuania-Belarus lines at 7:30. The Latvia-Russia connection at 8, and now ours around 9 a.m."Asked why the disconnection in Estonia occurred at 9:09 a.m., not precisely at 9 o'clock, Köster explained that such switchovers never happen at a precise minute.The disconnection had no impact on consumers, and all systems are stable and secure, Elering said."Right now, everything seems to be in tip-top shape," the spokesperson said, adding that there is no need to worry.Elering also confirmed that the Baltic states have the necessary frequency reserves for Saturday, and that the system's frequency is being managed in coordination between the three TSOs at their respective control centers.The BRELL agreement formally expired at 11:59 p.m. on Friday.Island mode operation testing to beginThe synchronization of the Baltic states with CESA is slated to take place on Sunday afternoon, before which the three TSOs will conduct island or isolated operation testing.At this time, the Baltic power grid will function independently, without being part of any other frequency area. Electricity demand during this period will be met via local power plants and direct current Estonian-Finnish and Lithuanian-Swedish connections.During the island operation test, the three Baltic TSOs will independently monitor the system's frequency, testing its resilience to various disturbances and readiness for isolated operation as well as performing frequency and voltage stability tests. This testing is expected to continue through Sunday afternoon."For a few hours, we'll simply be in this island state — the Baltic countries will be completely separate, and we'll be managing our system ourselves," Köster explained."We will start testing around midday," he continued. "We'll test how the system responds if the frequency is adjusted slightly, and whether it can properly restore the [right] frequency. But this is a miniscule fluctuation that certainly won't reach consumers; we're simply testing our systems."Everything is calm and everything is fine at the moment, the spokesperson added.Baltics to connect to Europe on SundayThe connection of the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian power grids to Continental Europe via Poland is scheduled to begin around 2 p.m. on Sunday, Köster noted."These switchovers can't be planned ahead down to the exact minute," he said. "Nothing has changed. Tomorrow morning we'll be testing voltage fluctuations, and then, starting around midday, we'll start activities for connecting to Continental Europe. And these should be finished by around 2 p.m."The synchronization process with Continental Europe is scheduled to be completed on Sunday, February 9.Once synchronized, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will join the world's largest synchronous grid, serving more than 400 million consumers across 26 countries.Synchronization with CESA will allow for the independent, stable and reliable frequency control of the Baltics' energy grids, and will boost energy security in the region.The Baltic TSOs have been preparing for this transition by investing in the development of transmission infrastructure and equipment necessary for the safe operation of their electricity systems, Elering said.Elering CEO Kalle Kilk has also previously emphasized that synchronization with the European grid is a security matter as well.The Baltic power grids' synchronization process has been supported by the EU and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), including via co-funding for infrastructure investments as well as technical and operational support, which facilitated the process.The synchronization of the three Baltic countries with CESA via Poland has cost €1.6 billion to date, 75 percent of which has been co-financed by the European Union and the rest of which has been covered by congestion revenue funds.Approximately €350 million in investments have been made in Estonia alone.Investments have included the construction or reconstruction of 1,400 kilometers of high-voltage power lines across the Baltics, construction of new substations as well as upgrades of nearly 40 existing substations.Six synchronous condensers have also already been built across the three countries, with three more still under construction.While Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania hadn't purchased electricity from Russia or Belarus for several years, until Saturday morning they had remained operating within the Russian IPS/UPS system, whose frequency is centrally regulated in Moscow.Baltic TSOs Elering, AST and Litgrid first submitted their application to join the Continental European grid to the then-existing Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) in 2007.Plans to disconnect the Baltics from the electricity system that tied them to the former Soviet Union had been discussed for decades, but gained momentum after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, strong supporters of Kyiv, stopped purchasing electricity from Russia.The BRELL agreement-managed electricity grid was the last remaining link between the three countries and Russia, after they regained independence in the collapse of the Soviet Union and joined the EU and NATO in 2004, Reuters noted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Gold In Bank Of England&apos;s Vault Is Trading At A Discount</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbcMUXg0H7E</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UbcMUXg0H7E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 08:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gold in the Bank of England vault is trading at a discount as fears of Trump tariffs spark a scramble for bullion.

Powered by Mistral’s cutting-edge models and inference engines, it processes up to 1000 words per second. This makes it one of the fastest AI tools available, enabling users to complete tasks like drafting emails, summarising articles, or solving complex problems in record time. This high-speed performance does not compromise quality. Le Chat excels in reasoning and reflection, ensuring that its responses are both quick and accurate. For professionals and everyday users alike, this efficiency translates into significant time savings.Le Chat’s natural language processing capabilities set it apart from many competitors. It handles a wide range of tasks, from technical challenges like coding and data analysis to creative endeavours such as content creation. Its ability to understand context ensures that responses are relevant and precise. What makes Le Chat even more powerful is its integration with real-time data sources. By pulling information from web searches, journalism outlets, and social media platforms, it delivers up-to-date and evidence-based answers tailored to user needs.Le Chat also stands out for its ability to provide real-time information with credibility. Through partnerships such as the one with Agence France-Presse (AFP), it delivers reliable news coverage alongside other real-time updates from trusted sources. This ensures that users receive accurate information when they need it most.Personalisation, micro-apps and AI agentsA key feature that enhances Le Chat’s usability is its upcoming “Memories” functionality. This opt-in feature allows the assistant to remember user preferences over time, making interactions more personalised. Users can track goals, revisit past conversations, and receive tailored suggestions based on their unique requirements. This personalisation ensures that Le Chat evolves alongside its users, adapting to their habits and preferences for a more customised experience.Le Chat goes beyond being a simple conversational assistant by supporting micro-apps and AI agents. These tools are designed for specific tasks such as managing personal finances, automating schedules, or streamlining workflows. Le Chat’s Le Chat also excels in multimodal capabilities, offering features like image generation through the Flux Ultra model by Black Forest Labs. This technology produces vivid and photorealistic images that surpass many competitors in quality. Additionally, its built-in code interpreter allows users to perform data analysis, create visualisations, run simulations, and execute Python code directly within the platform. These advanced functionalities make Le Chat a powerful tool for technical users as well as creative professionals.If we talk about the accessibility part, it is being available on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and web interfaces. Users can select from different models such as Mistral Small for fast responses, Mistral Large for detailed reasoning, or Mistral Next for concise solutions, depending on their specific needs. While most of Le Chat’s features are free to use, it also offers a Pro subscription at $14.99 per month. The Pro tier includes benefits like unlimited messages, higher token limits, advanced tools such as Flash Answers, and the ability to opt out of data sharing with Mistral AI. This cost-effective pricing structure ensures that both casual users and professionals can access its advanced features without breaking the bank.For businesses, Le Chat offers enterprise-specific features such as private deployment options and secure integration with organisational tools.A European alternative? For the most part, YES!Developed by French startup Mistral AI, Le Chat positions itself as a strong European alternative to US-based platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude. By leveraging proprietary large language models (LLMs), Mistral demonstrates a commitment to innovation while maintaining independence from American tech giants.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ramaphosa responds to Trump broadside: We won’t be bullied #politics #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8pOzxU3wJg</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/A8pOzxU3wJg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 07:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[South Africa won’t be bullied, President Cyril Ramaphosa said after his government came under fire from his US counterpart Donald Trump’s administration.

It also seemed to put Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the middle of a delicate standoff between bureaucrats at the agency he is charged with leading and President Donald Trump’s loudest adviser.

With Trump’s blessing, Musk, the world’s richest man and chief executive of automaker Tesla Inc., has been leading a tornadic campaign to remake the federal bureaucracy that some critics have called illegal.

Wendy Schiller, professor of political science at Brown University, examines how public sentiment could impact the president's willingness to allow Musk to continue with his cost-cutting mandate. Professor Schiller speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

One employee named Melanie Kambadur expressed her refusal to participate in this kind of data collection in October 2022.“Torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right,” Nikolay Bashlykov, a Meta engineer responsible for this data collection, said in an April 2023 message. He added that the company needed to be cautious about the IP address from which they downloaded the materials. In September 2023, Bashlykov cautioned that torrenting could lead to “seeding,” which “could be legally not OK.” These internal discussions suggest that Meta recognized this type of activity as unlawful, according to authors who have sued the company. In an internal message, Meta researcher Frank Zhang said that the company took measures to avoid using its servers when downloading the data set. This was to prevent anyone from being able to trace the seeding and the entity downloading the content.According to , new evidence indicates that Meta downloaded at least 81.7 TB of data from several libraries that offered copyrighted books via torrents. A recent document from the ongoing legal process revealed that at least 35.7 TB were downloaded from sites like Z-Library or LibGen (which was shut down in the summer).Meta seeks to dismiss the allegations. The company has filed a motion to dismiss these charges. Meta claims there’s no evidence that any of its employees downloaded books via torrents or that they were distributed by Meta.  has contacted the company for comments on the case and will update this post if we receive a response.This issue highlights the questionable practices that AI companies employ to train their models. It happened with Google, which updated its privacy policy in 2023 to say that it’ll “use publicly available information to help train Google’s AI models.” It’s also evident with OpenAI, which used millions of texts, many of them copyrighted, to train ChatGPT. Perplexity recently came under scrutiny for bypassing the “rules of the Internet” to feed its AI model.Internet theft is being normalized. What’s remarkable is that as companies increasingly skirt the rules and violate copyright, this behavior is starting to be seen as normal. There seems to be little time for outrage, and people often treat it as an accepted practice so they can continue with their business.Is this really “fair use”? Many companies rely on the concept of “fair use,” which allows for limited use of protected material without requiring permission. While copyright infringement lawsuits are emerging in the world of generative AI, they often seem to take a backseat as these large companies continue to thrive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tariffs could have &quot;the wrong effect on jobs,&quot; says expert #shorts #tariffs #wallstreetweek</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6xrTb9Jpns</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/f6xrTb9Jpns?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 21:57:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tariffs could have "the wrong effect on jobs," says the Council on Foreign Relations' Shannon O'Neil.

            Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a business gathering on Friday that US President Donald Trump’s threat to annex Canada “is a real thing,” two Canadian business leaders who were at the meeting confirmed to CNN.
    
            Trudeau’s comments, first reported by the Toronto Star, were picked up on an open microphone when Trudeau believed the media had been escorted out.
    
            “Mr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country and it is a real thing. In my conversations with him on…,” Trudeau said, according to audio from the Canada-US Economic Summit in Toronto shared by CBC News, before the microphone cut out.
    
            Trudeau made the comments after delivering an opening address at the summit, and after journalists had left the room, CBC reported.
    
            In an interview with CNN before Trump’s inauguration, Trudeau said that Trump’s comments about turning Canada into the United States’ 51st state are just a distraction from the consequences of Trump’s tariff threats.
    
            He added that Canada becoming another US state was “not going to happen.”
    
            “Canadians are incredibly proud of being Canadian. One of the ways we define ourselves most easily is, well, we’re not American,” he told CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” in the interview in early January.
    
            “President Trump, who is a very skillful negotiator, is getting people to be somewhat distracted by that, by that conversation, to take away from the conversation around 25% tariffs on oil and gas and electricity and steel and aluminum and lumber and concrete,” Trudeau said in the CNN interview.
    
            Trump followed through with his threats to impose tariffs on Canada last week, announcing a new 25% duty on most Canadian goods imported into the US. However, after Trudeau made commitments to bolster security at Canada’s border, Trump announced Monday a pause on the proposed tariffs for at least a month.
    
            After a call with Trump, Trudeau said Canada would be implementing its previously announced $1.3 billion border plan, as well as committing to appointing a “fentanyl czar” and listing cartels as terrorists.

One group reportedly advanced from Makhnovka toward Cherkasskaya Konopelka, Fanaseyevka, and Ulanok, while another attempted an assault from Dmitriukov toward Russkaya Konopelka – the latter attack was reportedly repelled.There is disagreement among Russian sources over Ukrainian gains. A Kremlin-affiliated milblogger claimed that Ukraine had seized Cherkasskaya Konopelka, but others denied this. Some reports suggested Ukrainian forces broke through to or even seized Ulanok, though this claim is also disputed. ISW has not yet verified geolocated evidence of Ukrainian forces operating in Ulanok.The Russian Telegram channel “Zapiski Veterana” [Veteran’s Notes] reported after 9 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 6 that Ukrainian troops had engaged in intense battles for the settlements of Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Fanaseyevka.According to the channel, fierce fighting was ongoing in the area, with Ukrainian forces launching six attacks in this sector on Thursday. Later, “Zapiski Veterana” warned that the situation on the Kursk front could deteriorate significantly by Friday morning, alleging that the AFU were moving significant reinforcements toward Sudzha.In a subsequent update, the channel claimed that Ukrainian troops had encircled Cherkasskaya Konopelka.On Thursday evening, Stanislav Bunyatov, a junior sergeant in the 24th Aidar Assault Battalion, wrote on Telegram: “We are really making progress in Kursk Oblast.”Bunyatov emphasized the strategic importance of these assaults, stating: “If we withdraw, the enemy is seriously intent on entering the Sumy region.”He acknowledged that Russian drones pose a significant challenge, though saying it was expected. Meanwhile, Russian sources reported that poor weather conditions on Feb. 6 had hindered their drone operations.By Friday, several Russian Telegram channels reported that the commander of the 11th Airborne Brigade had been removed from his post. The alleged reason was his failure to react in time to both the pontoon deployment and the sudden Ukrainian advance toward Ulanok the previous day. However, there are no official confirmations of his dismissal.In its Friday morning report, posted after 11 a.m., the Zapiski Veterana channel claimed that Ukrainian troops had been spotted on the dam in Cherkasskaya Konopelka. According to the post, Ukrainian military sources allegedly marked this settlement as under AFU control.“There is information that Fanaseyevka has also been occupied by the enemy,” the report added.Meanwhile, the “War Correspondents of the Russian Spring” Telegram channel published a summary, stating that after the Thursday offensive on Ulanok, Ukrainian forces had suffered heavy losses in armored vehicles but had still managed to land a significant force.According to their report, between half a battalion and a full battalion of Ukrainian infantry remains engaged in the forests and the areas around Fanaseyevka and Cherkasskaya Konopelka.“Reports from the field indicate that fighting has continued since last night and into the morning in the areas around Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Fanaseyevka, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces have managed to secure several positions,” the channel wrote.The Telegram post further suggested that the Ukrainian command might deploy additional reinforcements to support its units.In its Feb. 7 briefing on the situation in Kursk Oblast, the Ukrainian General Staff reported at 8:44 a.m.:“In the operational zone in Kursk Oblast, units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine have repelled five Russian attacks over the past 24 hours.”According to the summary, Russian forces launched 47 airstrikes, deploying 76 guided bombs, and conducted 612 artillery attacks on Ukrainian positions and settlements in the region, including 11 strikes from multiple launch rocket systems.Despite this being the second day of Ukraine’s new offensive in Kursk, the General Staff has not explicitly confirmed the operation. Instead, its report only mentions the repelling of Russian attacks.In its midday report, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that “the Russian Armed Forces continue to defeat AFU formations in Kursk Oblast.”According to the report, units from the “North” group of troops thwarted a Ukrainian counteroffensive near Cherkasskaya Konopelka and Ulanok.“All enemy attacks have been repelled,” the ministry claimed.However, according to an ISW report, some Russian milbloggers voiced concerns that continued Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast could threaten Russian supply lines and rear positions south of Sudzha, particularly around Guyevo, where Russian forces are currently engaged.Putin acknowledges strain on Russian troops in Kursk OblastOn Feb. 5, Russian leader Vladimir Putin praised elite Airborne Forces (VDV) and naval infantry units defending in Kursk Oblast, highlighting that the Ukrainian incursion has tied up a full combined-arms army’s worth of Russian troops in the region for over six months.During a meeting with acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein, Putin listed key Russian formations still engaged in Kursk:155th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet)810th Naval Infantry BrigadeHe promised future rewards for these forces. However, ISW outlines that this prolonged deployment has prevented Russia from redeploying these elite units to high-priority fronts, such as the Donetsk region.According to ISW, Russia has amassed around 78,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, including 11,000 North Korean personnel and elements of nearly all elite Russian Airborne Forces and naval infantry units, to expel Ukrainian forces from the region.Despite this, Putin has yet to prioritize fully reclaiming Kursk Oblast, instead focusing on slow advances in Donetsk. ISW suggests that this delayed response is fueling domestic discontent as Ukrainian forces continue to hold ground in Russian border areas.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump says Gaza will be given to US by Israel</title><link>https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133161-donald-trump-gaza-proposal-israel-takeover/</link><author>/u/insertwittynamethere</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 19:03:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hegseth: &apos;Diversity is our strength&apos; is dumbest phrase in military history</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfEi72hPHZY</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GfEi72hPHZY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 19:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 7 chided past celebrations of the U.S. military's diversity in an address to Pentagon staff in which he also promised a tough approach to NATO and accountability over the war in Afghanistan.

The Globe is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.His comments represent the most frank acknowledgment that what the federal government once dismissed as a joke – Mr. Trump’s talk of making Canada the 51s state – is now regarded by the Prime Minister’s Office as a genuine interest on the part of the U.S. President.Mr. Trudeau made his assessment to an audience of about 200 business leaders, trade experts and union executives in Toronto who had gathered to map out ways to boost economic growth and attract new capital investment in the face of the looming threat of U.S. protectionism. He talked about two phone conversations he had with Mr. Trump on Monday before the President agreed to delay steep tariffs on Canadian goods for 30 days.The Canada-U.S. tariff war is on pause, but not over. Here are the latest updates and what they mean for your financesDuring the calls, the Prime Minister recalled, Mr. Trump referred to a four-page memo that included a list of grievances he had with Canadian trade and commercial rules including the President’s false claim that U.S. banks are unable to operate in Canada. Other complaints included Canada’s sheltered dairy industry which is protected from foreign competition by a wall of tariffs, as well as the federal goods and services tax.In the second conversation with Mr. Trump on Monday, the Prime Minister told the summit, the President asked him whether he was familiar with the Treaty of 1908, a pact between the United States and Britain that defined the border between the United States and Canada. He told Mr. Trudeau he should look it up.Mr. Trudeau told the summit he thought this treaty had been superseded by other developments such as the repatriation of the Canadian Constitution – in other words, that the border cannot be dissolved by repealing that treaty. He told the audience that international law would prevent the dissolution of the 1908 Treaty from leading to the erasure of the border. For example, various international laws define sovereign borders, including the United Nations Charter of which both countries are signatories and which has protections for territorial integrity.A source familiar with the calls said Mr. Trump’s reference to the 1908 Treaty was taken an as implied threat. Soon after winning the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump began talking about making Canada the 51st state and suggesting Canadians could avoid his tariff threats by agreeing to a political union. The Trudeau cabinet at the time shrugged off the comments. In early January, however, Mr. Trump expanded on his proposal, publicly referred to the U.S.-Canada border as “an artificially drawn line” and said he would be willing to use “economic force” to coerce Canada into being annexed.Trump tariffs are inspiring Canada to tackle trade war from withinCanadian officials have been unable to determine the architect of the memo, the Prime Minister told the summit. Mr. Trudeau said that his team spoke with U.S. commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and two other officials that should have been involved in crafting the four-page memo Mr. Trump read from, but they were unaware of the document or its contents.Asked at the summit about Mr. Trudeau’s interpretation of Mr. Trump’s motives, Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon said the sense he got from the gathering and those assembled is that “Canada is free, Canada is sovereign and Canada will choose its own destiny, thank you very much.”Transport Minister Anita Anand said Canadians are united in rejecting annexation. “There will be no messing with the 49th parallel,” she said, a reference to the Canada-U.S. border.Beth Burke, CEO of the Canadian American Business Council, said Americans do not take seriously Mr. Trump’s talk of taking over Canada. She said people in the United States view the President’s persistent mention of annexation as a “position of negotiation and posturing and using it as leverage in the conversation.”She said Canada can use access to its abundant critical minerals as leverage in coming renegotiations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is due for renewal in 2026.Earlier at the gathering, Mr. Trudeau had pleaded with provinces and territories to dismantle internal barriers that discourage greater east-west trade inside Canada.Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Mr. Trump’s decision to levy steep tariffs on Canada – now delayed after a last-minute deal Monday – is a “wake-up call” for the country.The prospect of much more difficult relations with the United States must drive Canada to find other means of attracting business investment, of generating economic growth and diversifying trade beyond American customers, he said.Tariff threats already affecting Canada’s economy, BoC’s Macklem saysMr. Trudeau said a good start would be looking at interprovincial trade barriers put in place by provincial governments that make it easier for Canadians to trade with the United States rather than other provinces and territories.“It’s about time we had genuine free trade within Canada,” Mr. Trudeau told the summit.He said many of these barriers, which hinder the movement of goods and workers within the country, make no sense. The Prime Minister cited recognizing teaching certifications and tire requirements for trucks as two examples. This will make it easier for Canadians to do business “across Canada, east-west and not just north-south.”A 2019 paper published by the International Monetary Fund found that Canada’s internal trade barriers – excluding those related to geography, such as challenges with transporting goods across a country this large – were equivalent to an average tariff of 21 per cent in 2015. The study found that lifting all internal barriers would result in 4-per-cent growth in Canada’s real gross domestic product per capita.Mr. Champagne said the most important task right now for Canada is restoring business confidence.This meeting of business and labour leaders at Toronto’s Evergreen Brick Works takes place just days after a potential shock to the Canadian economy was averted – one that threatened to shutter businesses and cost jobs. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump held off imposing steep tariffs on Canadian imports – a potentially devastating shock that drew fresh attention to Canada’s reliance on the U.S. market. More than 75 per cent of this country’s merchandise exports go to the United States.Mr. Champagne said the Trump tariff threat must force Canada to act quickly to safeguard its economic fortunes and standard of living.“The rules have changed, and so Canadians understand that we need to bring our resources to market. We need to diversify our economy. This is our moment as Canada,” Mr. Champagne said. “We make sure that we build what needs to be done here in this country to succeed and to prosper.”Rising U.S. protectionism is damaging business investment in Canada, business leaders say.One of Mr. Trump’s goals in threatening tariffs on allies, Canadian officials have repeatedly said, is to force investors to relocate manufacturing to the United States – at the expense of America’s trading partners. In addition, Mr. Trump has vowed to cut taxes and regulations, measures that could make the U.S. a more attractive market for businesses.Other protectionist threats from the Republican White House include talk of more tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper. And by April 1, U.S. government departments and agencies are supposed to report to the White House on the country’s trade deficits with major trading partners and recommend measures to rebalance.On Monday, Mr. Trump delayed tariffs of 10 per cent on Canadian energy and critical minerals and 25 per cent on the rest of Canadian goods for 30 days after Ottawa agreed to more measures to fight organized crime and the illegal production and distribution of fentanyl.Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford, who is campaigning for re-election as Ontario Premier, criticized the federal economic summit as a waste of time on Friday and urged Ottawa to tighten up the border to stop the flow of drugs on both sides. He suggested former chief of the defence staff Rick Hillier as an option for border czar. His office later clarified that Mr. Ford meant fentanyl czar, a position Mr. Trudeau said would soon be created.“A message to the federal government: enough’s enough. I don’t need to be in a room looking at the people I’ve talked to a thousand times and coming up with this idea. You know what the Trump administration wants? They’ve been very very clear. They’ve been clear to me, they’ve been clear to everywhere in North America. They need to tighten up the border,” Mr. Ford said at a campaign stop in Scarborough.Plenty of items are marked product of Canada or made in Canada, but what do these terms really mean?
