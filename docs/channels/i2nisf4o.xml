I would say I’m pretty good at picking up new stuff and already have lots of knowledge and hands on experience (mostly from doing stuff on my own and reading lots of Oreilly books) for someone like me (age 23). Have a CS background. Doing an internship. I was put into a position where I had to use K8s for everyday work and don’t get me wrong I’m ecstatic about being an intern but already having the opportunity to work with deployments etc. What I did was read The kubernetes book by Nigel Poulton and got myself 3 cheap PCs and bootstrapped myself a K3s cluster and installed Longorn as the storage and Nginx as the ingress controller.Right now I can pretty much do most stuff and have some cool projects running on my cluster.I’m also learning new stuff every day. But where I find myself lacking is Networking. Not just in Kubernetes but also generally. There are two examples of me getting frustrated because of my lacking networking knowledge:I wanted to let a GitHub actions step access my cluster through the tailscale K8s operator which runs on my cluster but failedWas wondering why I can’t see the real IPs of people that are accessing my api which is on a pod on my cluster and got intimidated by stuff like Layer 2 Networking and why you need a load balancer for that etc.Do I really have to be as competent as a network engineer to be a good dev ops engineer / data engineer / cloud engineer or anything in ops?I don’t mind it but I’m struggling to learn Networking and it’s not that I don’t have the basics but I don’t have the advanced knowledge needed yet, so how do I actually get there?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How are you monitoring your cluster?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iq94yg/how_are_you_monitoring_your_cluster/</link><author>/u/psavva</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 19:28:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a 3 node bare metal cluster and installed Kube Prometheus Stack helm chart.I'm having a very hard time getting the service monitors working correctly.

In this article I want to correct a popular misconception that's been making the rounds in computer graphics aficionado circles for a long time now. It has to do with conditionals when selecting between two results in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation, and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up a little:
So, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);
     x>?(s.x,):
           x>?s*():
                      (,s.y);
}
The exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations deciding what's the final value this function should return. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return one of three results, which are simple to compute. I could also have implemented this function with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say in this article stays true.
Now, here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will step up and invariably propose the following "optimization", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are "conditional branches" in the code, by arithmetic operations. They will suggest something like this: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);

     w0 = (,x);
     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);
     w2 = -w0-w1;

     res0 = (s.x,);
     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();
     res2 = (,s.y);

     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;
}
There are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. "select"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. I'll repeat it again - there is no branching, the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no prediction involved, no pipe to flush, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.
For the record, of course GPUs can do real branching, and those are fine and fast and totally worth it when big chunks of code and computation are to be skipped given a condition. As with all things computing, always check the generated machine code to know what is happening exactly and when. But one thing you can safely assume without having to check any generated code - when moving simple values or computations like in my original example, you are guaranteed to not branch. This has been true for decades at this point, with GPUs. And while I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.
The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimized version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. You can measure it in a variety of hardware. I can only assume that's because the  function is probably implemented with some sort of conditional move or subtract + bit propagation + AND. step(  x,  y )
{
     x < y ?  : ;
}
Either way, using the step() "optimization" are either using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to mask in and out the different potential outputs with a series of arithmetic multiplications and additions. Which is wasteful, the values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.
But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the original code I published:
GLSL x>?(s.x,):
       x>?s*():
                  (,s.y);
AMD Compiler     s0,      v3, , v1
     v4, , v0
     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0
 v3, 0, v3, vcc
 v0, v0, v4, vcc
 vcc, (v2), s1
 v1, v1, v3, vcc
 v0, 0, v0, vcc
Microsoft Compiler   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy
   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )
 r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz
 r0.xy, r0.xyxx
  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()
   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()
 r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy
 o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw
Here we can confirm that the GPU is not branching, as I explained. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).
The Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison ( - "lt"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).
There are no jump/branch instructions in these listings.
Something not related to the discussion but interesting, is that some of the  GLSL calls I had in my shader before the ternary operator we are discussing, didn't become GPU instructions but rather instruction modifiers, which is the reason you see them in the listing. This means you can think of abs() calls as being free.
So, if you ever see somebody proposing this a = ( b, c, ( y, x ) );
as an optimization to
then please correct them for me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GitHub - yaitoo/xun: Xun is an HTTP web framework built on Go&apos;s built-in html/template and net/http package’s router (1.22).</title><link>https://github.com/yaitoo/xun</link><author>/u/imlangzi</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:15:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Event Sourcing?</title><link>https://newsletter.scalablethread.com/p/what-is-event-sourcing</link><author>/u/scalablethread</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:05:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Traditional data storage typically focuses on the current state of an entity. For example, in an e-commerce system, you might store the current state of a customer's order: items, quantities, shipping address, etc. Event sourcing takes a different approach. Instead of storing the current state directly, it stores the events that led to that state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the past. Think of it as a detailed log of transactions on your bank statement. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store. The core idea is that an application's state can be derived by replaying events in the order they occurred, just like you can get your current bank balance by replaying all the transactions from the beginning. This makes Event Sourcing particularly useful for applications that require a high degree of audibility and traceability.Every change to the application state is captured as an event object in an Event Sourcing system. These events are then stored in an event store, a database optimized for handling event data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how Event Sourcing works:Reconstructing the state from events involves reading all the events related to an entity from the event store and applying them in sequence to reconstruct the current state. It's like simulating all the changes that have occurred to construct the current state. For example, consider an e-commerce application where an order goes through various states like "Created," "Paid," and "Shipped." To determine the current state of an order, you would:Retrieve all events related to the order from the event store.Initialize an empty order object.Apply each event to the order object in the order in which they were stored.By the end of this process, the order object will reflect the current state of the order.As the number of events grows, replaying the entire event stream to reconstruct the state can become slow and inefficient. This is where snapshots come in. A snapshot is a saved state of an entity at a specific point in time. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, the application can load the latest snapshot and then replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken.

I had WiFi, sound, usb, webcam, memory card reader, correct screen resolution. I even got battery status and management! It even came with a nice litte 'app center' making installation of a bunch of software as simple as a click!And I remember thinking any Windows user could  install Linux and would get comfortable using it in an afternoon.I'm pretty 'comfortable' in anything PC and have changed boot orders and created bootable things since the early 90's and considered that part of the installation the easiest part.However, most people have never heard about any of them, and that makes the two steps seem 'impossible'.I recently convinced a friend of mine, who also couldn't stand Window11, to install Linux instead as it would easily cover all his PC needs. And while he is definitely in the upper half of people in terms of 'tech savvyness', both those "two easy first steps" made it virtually impossible for him to install it. He easily managed downloading the .iso, but turning that iso into a bootable USB-stick turned out to be too difficult. But after guiding him over the phone he was able to create it.But he wasn't able to get into bios despite all my attempts explaining what button to push and whenNext day he came over with his laptop. And just out of reflex I just started smashing the F2 key (or whatever it was) repeatingly and got right into bios where I enabled USB boot and put it at the top at the sequence.After that he managed to install Linux just fine without my supervision.But it made me realise that the two first steps in installing Linux, that are second nature to me and probably everyone involved with Linux from people just using it to people working on huge distributions, makes them virtually impossible for most people to install it.I don't know enough about programming to know of this is possible:Instead of an .iso file for download some sort of .exe file can be downloaded that is able to create a bootable USB-stick and change the boot order?That would 'open up' Linux to  more people, probably orders of magnitude..]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lessons from David Lynch: A Software Developer&apos;s Perspective</title><link>https://lackofimagination.org/2025/02/lessons-from-david-lynch-a-software-developers-perspective/</link><author>/u/aijan1</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 09:40:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[David Lynch passed away in January 2025, shortly after being evacuated from his Los Angeles home due to the Southern California wildfires. He’s perhaps best known for the groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks, which inspired countless shows, including The X-Files, The Sopranos, and Lost.Lynch was genuinely a good human being who cared deeply for his actors and crew. He discovered extraordinary talent like Naomi Watts, who had struggled to land a major role in a Hollywood movie after 10 years of auditioning. From the interviews he gave, it quickly becomes apparent that he respected people of all kinds and never put anyone down – even those who truly deserved it.Lynch is famous for refusing to explain his movies. Although not a fan of his previous work, the great film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that Mulholland Drive remained compulsively watchable while refusing to yield to interpretation.While Lynch offered very little in terms of what his movies meant, he was generous in sharing his views on creativity, work, and life in general. As a tribute to Lynch, I’d like to share my perspective on his life lessons from a software developer’s viewpoint.Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.We’ve all got hundreds or even thousands of ideas floating around in our brains. But the really big ones are few and far between. Once you catch a good one –because they’re so rare– write it down immediately, says Lynch. From there, ideas attract other ideas and start to grow from their initial seed state. The final job is to translate those ideas into a medium, whether it’s a film, a painting, or software.The idea is the whole thing. If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really. You just keep working to make it look like that idea looked, feel like it felt, sound like it sounded, and be the way it was.Software development is part art, part engineering. We don’t build the same software over and over again – virtually all software is crafted by hand, sometimes with help from AI. If you ask two developers to create a non-trivial program, it’s very likely that the programs they produce will be different, even if the functionality is the same. Under the hood, the programming language, data structures, and overall architecture may be completely different. And on the surface, the user interfaces may look nothing alike.It’s a good habit to listen to what users have to say, but they often can only describe their problems – they rarely come up with good ideas to solve them. And that’s OK. It’s our job to find the right ideas, implement them well, and solve tricky problems in a way we, and hopefully the users, will love.My friend Bushnell Keeler, who was really responsible for me wanting to be a painter, said you need four hours of uninterrupted time to get one hour of good painting in, and that is really true.Like other creative fields, writing code requires deep concentration. We need to hold complex structures in our minds while working through problems. Switching between coding and other tasks disrupts  – that magical state of mind where we lose track of time and produce code effortlessly. That’s why many developers hate meetings – they are toxic to our productivity.I believe you need technical knowledge. And also, it’s really, really great to learn by doing. So, you should make a film.Software development is one of those rare fields where a college degree isn’t required to succeed. Yes, we should all know the basics, but in my experience, new college graduates often lack the practical knowledge to be effective developers.The real learning happens through hands-on experience: building real projects, debugging tricky problems, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code over time. It’s crucial to never stop learning, experimenting, and iterating on our craft.Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn’t even exist.Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Originally conceived to meet the demand for information sharing between scientists around the world, the web went mainstream within just a few years.Linus Torvalds created Git due to a licensing dispute over BitKeeper, the original version control system used for Linux development. The need for a new tool led to Git becoming the most widely used version control system today.I feel that a set should be like a happy family. Almost like Thanksgiving every day, happily going down the road together.Be kind to your teammates, don’t embarrass them. They may not be perfect, but accept them for who they are. The most important trait of an effective software development team is psychological safety –that is, team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other, as corroborated by Google’s research on the subject.It’s OK to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them. Knowing that your team has your back when things go south is a wonderful feeling.Most of Hollywood is about making money - and I love money, but I don’t make the films thinking about money.Just like Lynch prioritizes creativity over financial gain, some of the most impactful software projects started with an open source model, and they literally changed the world, such as Linux, PostgreSQL, and Node.js, just to name a few.What makes these projects remarkable is that they didn’t emerge from corporate boardrooms – they were built by communities of passionate developers, collaborating across the world.Money is just a means to an end. Unfortunately, many get this confused.David, thank you for making the world a better place!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Container Networking - Kubernetes with Calico</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ipw9bu/container_networking_kubernetes_with_calico/</link><author>/u/tkr_2020</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:25:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: VLAN 10: VLAN 20When traffic flows from VLAN 10 to VLAN 20, the outer IP header shows:The inner IP header reflects:The firewall administrator notices that both the source and destination ports appear as , indicating they are set to .

The researchers developed a comprehensive test suite covering mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism using both quantitative and qualitative questions.Key technical aspects: - Multi-level assessment hierarchy ranging from fact recall to conceptual transfer - Controlled vocabulary to minimize linguistic pattern matching - Cross-context validation using parallel problems - Integration of numerical computation and conceptual explanation tasks - Standardized scoring rubrics based on educational assessment methodsMain results: - GPT-4 achieved 76% accuracy on basic physics calculations - Performance dropped to 43% on cross-context transfer problems - Significant variance in performance across physics domains - Models showed strong correlation between mathematical ability and physics problem-solving - Systematic errors emerged when combining multiple physics conceptsI think this methodology provides a more rigorous approach to understanding LLM capabilities than previous work. The educational testing framework helps distinguish between surface-level pattern matching and deeper conceptual understanding. This could lead to better benchmarks for measuring AI progress in scientific reasoning.I think the results highlight current limitations in LLMs' ability to transfer physics knowledge across contexts - something that's crucial for real scientific work. The systematic evaluation approach could be extended to other scientific domains.TLDR: New assessment framework based on educational testing principles reveals LLMs have decent physics calculation abilities but struggle with deeper conceptual understanding and knowledge transfer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] What&apos;s the most promising successor to the Transformer?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ipvau4/d_whats_the_most_promising_successor_to_the/</link><author>/u/jsonathan</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:17:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[All I know about is MAMBA, which looks promising from an efficiency perspective (inference is linear instead of quadratic), but AFAIK nobody's trained a big model yet.
