It combines DiT (Diffusion Transformers) with ControlNet approaches while introducing a relevance prior mechanism.Main technical points: - Introduces a two-stage relevance assessment system: lightweight networks evaluate region importance, followed by adaptive computation allocation - Integrates with existing diffusion pipelines through modular design - Relevance prior guides transformer attention mechanisms - Compatible with standard diffusion transformer architecturesKey results: - 30-50% reduction in computational overhead - Maintains or improves image quality compared to baselines - More precise control over generated content - Effective handling of complex scenesI think this could have meaningful impact on making high-quality image generation more accessible, especially for resource-constrained applications. The approach seems particularly promising for deployment scenarios where computational efficiency is crucial.I think the relevance-guided approach could extend beyond image generation - the core idea of selective computation based on importance could benefit other transformer applications where attention mechanisms are computationally expensive.TLDR: Novel architecture that makes diffusion transformers more efficient by focusing computational resources on important image regions, reducing compute needs by 30-50% while maintaining quality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A simple VSCode extension to remember which virtual desktop each editor window is on in Linux</title><link>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathiscode.remember-desktops</link><author>/u/FatherCarbon</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 05:56:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On some Linux desktop managers, Visual Studio Code editors don't remember their last desktop.

I was in middle of actually shopping for some extra brand new USBs to replace my old ones when I encountered this for the first time. It looked like there were quite a good number of people on marketplace platforms like eBay and Mercari selling bootable USB flash drives with a Linux distro pre-installed on it. Majority of the ones I saw were Ubuntu (like what I had pictured) on there, but I also saw a good amount of ones with Kali and different versions of Linux Mint as well. Seems like you get the USB according to said listings with instructions on how to properly boot it or install it on your computer, and in some cases even provide contact information for support if needed. The prices on some of these are slightly in the higher side when compared to those I had screenshots of in the examples, and the sellers all had a large amount of sales and positive responses. Now, of course, I'd personally just stick to what I've been doing and just create the bootable drive myself for literally free like I have from the start. So to me it was interesting to see these out there actually being bought when the process of doing this yourself is relatively easy with step-by-step guides on the respective distro's website and even YouTube tutorials if you wish to follow those. So in short, what's everyone think of these?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Font for programming mathematics</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iw2ovd/font_for_programming_mathematics/</link><author>/u/okimusix</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 05:14:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I am a physics undergrad and I've been using Rust for a few years now. It's my favorite language and I use it for everything, from personal apps using Tauri to taking advantage of its speed for computations and using it in my school assignments.Since I often find myself writing math code, I found naming variables "lambda_squared", for example, looks really clunky and makes it harder to read the code. For this, I implemented a Live Templates group on RustRover that replaced lambda, for example, with its equivalent unicode character. However, Rust did complain a little.Finally, though, I found the solution. I had been trying to do this for a while with no luck, but I found a way to make it work. I used the ligature system on the FiraCode font to implement ligatures for every greek letter and some mathematical symbols, this way you get the readability of actual math, but for the compiler, it still looks like plain text. Here's an exampleThe text for the sum variable, for example, is just "SUMxu2", and both the compiler and I are happier. I don't know if anyone has done this before, I tried to look for it but never found anything. If you find this something that could be useful for you or others, I can share a link to a drive or something where you can download the font, as well as the guide to every symbol I included. If so, please comment and share your thoughts on this too :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] API platforms vs self-deployment for diffusion models</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iw2kbl/d_api_platforms_vs_selfdeployment_for_diffusion/</link><author>/u/crookedstairs</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 05:06:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Caveat that Modal is a serverless compute platform! But this post covers when you might choose between API platforms (replicate, fal), traditional cloud (AWS EC2), managed ML platforms (SageMaker, Vertex), and serverless cloud.I often see companies jump to self-deployment even if they're just using off-the-shelf models with a couple of adapters. I think that rarely makes sense from a cost or effort perspective unless you have a high volume of production traffic that you're amortizing those things across. The most compelling reason to move to self-deployment is if you need a high level of control over generated inputs => this requires fine-tuned weights / customer adapters / multi-step generation pipeline => this requires code-level control of your deployment.What do you agree/disagree with? If you've evaluated these categories of providers before, tell me how they stacked up against each other.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What&apos;s your recommendation on video editors?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iw2aae/whats_your_recommendation_on_video_editors/</link><author>/u/chuzambs</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 04:50:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi there !

With every feature I wanted to add, it became more of a headache. Here's what I mean: I wanted to move some buttons around, simple stuff. But when I asked the AI to realign these buttons, it messed up other parts of the design that were working fine before. Like, why would moving a button break the entire layout?This really sucks because these errors took up most of my time. I'm pretty sure I could've finished everything in about 2 hours if it wasn't for all this fixing of things that shouldn't have broken in the first place.I'm curious about other people's experiences. If you don't code, I'd love to hear about your attempts with AI agents for building apps and websites. What worked best for you? Which AI tool actually did what you needed?What do you think?

I know I'm young and still don't know much, but I'd like to write about this anyway. I think I started using computers during the Windows XP era. My father worked repairing computers. My mom says I learned to type on a computer before writing on paper. I was like one of today's kids who spend all day on their phones, except with computers. During my childhood, I spent my time chronically online, playing various games and browsing the internet. I remember Windows XP very well, along with Windows 7 and Minecraft. Those were good times, but as I grew older, things changed very quickly. My father stopped working with computer repairs, and soon I knew more than everyone else in the family.I could fix all kinds of computers easily for my friends; back then, everything was Windows. My first contact with Linux was at school when we started having computer classes, when I was around 15. The school computers were slow and had Ubuntu installed. It was slow, ugly, and very limited because the computers were managed by the school. That was my first impression: a slow system for government computers.Microsoft tried various things. I remember Windows 8 when formatting laptops, and then that Windows 8.1 update where they changed the menu. A lot happened, and it seems to have passed so quickly. At school, I always used Office suite programs: Word, PowerPoint, etc., and in computer classes, you had to use LibreOffice on a very slow government computer. it was ugly and seemed very difficult to use.My family's financial situation didn't improve much, so I ended up with limited access to new technologies. My phone was already old, and my computers were getting old. I still remember Windows 10's launch very well. My relatives would bring computers for me to repair and format, wanting the latest version of Windows with Office and everything else, but the computers were already old and barely worked with Windows 8.I begged my father to buy me a laptop, and after much insistence, I finally convinced him. It was an Asus X450LA. A mid-range computer for its time. It came with Windows 8, I think, but I did that upgrade to Windows 10. I used it until I finished high school, but then Windows 11 came along, and my laptop was cut from the list of computers that could upgrade. it was the end of my laptop's life.I was already working at my father's market, so I bought myself a new gaming computer with Windows 11. I had time again to spend on the internet and started to worry about my father's business expenses. Using Office costs money, sales programs are expensive, everything is expensive, and maybe my gaming laptop won't even be able to use the next Windows.I started researching Linux. At first, I was a bit scared because everyone on Reddit talked about terminals, command lines to install anything, etc., but I decided to take my old laptop and refurbish it. I bought a new battery, an SSD, and an 8GB RAM stick. I researched on Reddit which distro was best for beginners, got an old USB drive, put Mint on it, and formatted my computer: Love at first sight.I customized Mint and left it in a way that I spend more than 15 minutes before doing anything just appreciating it. I used LibreOffice for everything I did in Office. I used Firefox and liked it a lot. The system is very fast, strangely seems faster than my new computer with Windows 11. I downloaded my daily-use programs from Mint's app center: Spotify, Bitwarden, everything's there. I spent hours playing with the terminal with ChatGPT's help. I extracted running process logs to txt, system information. it's very easy to use. I even managed to install a game I played in my childhood, a BF2 mod: Forgotten Hope 2 from Windows on Mint using Lutris (I swear it's the last Windows thing I'll use).I'm in love with my old laptop again. I cleaned it, spent hours looking at it, I love using Mint, made it my own. I'm going to buy a new computer for my room and install Mint for my personal use. I'll have a laptop and a computer with Linux. My current computer with Windows 11 will be only for sales programs and government programs that only work on Windows. I showed it to my father, and he liked Linux too. Windows never again. Using Windows now feels like one of those mobile games full of ads]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Advanced SQL Tricks (CTEs, Conditional Aggregations, etc)</title><link>https://youtu.be/rDGCOE5YGT0</link><author>/u/Special_Community179</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:18:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Found this on a piece of digital signage in a bathroom</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivwydq/found_this_on_a_piece_of_digital_signage_in_a/</link><author>/u/A_Sc00py_b0i</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:06:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing wctx - A simple CLI tool for window context info on Wayland &amp; X11</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivw7xn/introducing_wctx_a_simple_cli_tool_for_window/</link><author>/u/slightlyfaulty</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 23:30:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I just released my first package for Linux. It's called  (short for window context). It's a simple CLI tool that provides real-time information about the current  window (focused window) or  window (under the mouse cursor) on Wayland and X11. It's (mostly) written in Rust.It's not very useful on its own, but it makes it much easier for programs and scripts to work with windows. For example, you could create hotkeys that only work in specific apps, or change your mouse scroll speed when the cursor is in a browser window, or turn your monitor brightness up when it has a fullscreen window.You can of course already do these things, with a bit of effort. The main advantage of wctx is that it works across multiple desktop environments, which means programs and scripts using it will too. It's also dead simple to use, with several CLI output options and formats, as well as a D-Bus interface.Currently it supports these desktop environments, with more to come if there's enough interest in them:For other distros an installation script is included, with more info in the readme.I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. This is also my first real Rust project, so please be nice 😄 (or rip me a new one so I can learn).Feedback and contributions are very welcome!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My first time with Linux</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivvcxn/my_first_time_with_linux/</link><author>/u/Acu17y</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 22:49:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh my god guys, I'm speechless.

So it would be a fast, low-level memory safe language with great tooling, great type system and other benefits that Rust offers. But it would need to be better than Rust to actually catch onThis language needs to offer real advantages over Rust to be considered. Of course since Rust has a huge ecosystem that is growing rapidly, it may take a long time. But I am talking on a timescale of 25+ years.Creating a new programming language to compete with Rust would be a massive undertaking and there would have to be some real reason to do it. Rust may be missing some features like higher-kinded types, named function arguments and such but to really catch on the language would need to offer some extremely important feature that Rust doesn't have, as well as offering all of Rust's benefits at the same time.Is there any such language currently in early development? Or perhaps, what would such a language have to look like?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scrap Your ORM—Replacing Your ORM With Relational Algebra</title><link>https://youtu.be/SKXEppEZp9M?si=wccXwllXm-0M-zOO</link><author>/u/JohnyTex</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 18:39:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FFmpeg School of Assembly Language</title><link>https://github.com/FFmpeg/asm-lessons/blob/main/lesson_01/index.md</link><author>/u/mitousa</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 18:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[R] Interpreting Deep Neural Networks: Memorization, Kernels, Nearest Neighbors, and Attention</title><link>https://medium.com/@thienhn97/interpreting-deep-neural-networks-memorization-kernels-nearest-neighbors-and-attention-6bf0cefc7619</link><author>/u/ThienPro123</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:15:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This means that our positive kernel is actually some inner product of a Hilbert space. Typically, Mercer’s theorem is used for the kernel trick where we can map our input data to richer feature spaces that are potentially infinite dimensional (e.g. Gaussian kernel, polynomial kernel, etc.). However, in our case, we will use it to interpret the other way around.Note the following relationship between distance in the Hilbert space and the kernel function:This means that the closer x is to y in H , the more similar they will be in our similarity measure. So our intuition of the similarity measure being related to some form of distance is formalized by the relationship above.Learned kernel instead of fixing a kernel a prioriIf something within our prediction model is not learnable, then it is a prior that we are imposing on the dataset and the problem.In our previous discussions of soft-kernelized NNs, the kernel K is fixed, meaning that we have some prior on the geometry of the data. That is not always desirable and we want our methods to automatically learn the structure of the data rather than us manually imposing this geometry.Hence, if we want to learn the kernel K instead of imposing a prior fixed kernel, we can write (due to Mercer’s theorem):for some parameterized feature map ψ : X → H from the data space X to some Hilbert space H. Typically, H will just be R^n or the dimension of the latent space. We can then learn the parameters of ψ via standard training techniques (i.e. gradient descent on some loss).This view allows us to connect standard deep learning (or representation learning) to kernel learning.Interpreting attention as soft nearest neighborsNote that the soft kernelized nearest neighbor that we presented earliercan be interpreted as the popular attention mechanism that is ubiquitous today in LLMs and LVMs via the transformers architecture.If we interpret x as some token, e.g. x_c, in the sequence (x_1, …, x_n), K(x_i , x) as the attention dot product i.e.and setting W_{ci} as the normalized values for token at time i i.e.then we would recover the attention computation (bidirectional or autoregressive depending on whether we set the W_{ci} = 0 for i < c) as being the weighted average of the values of other tokens in the sequence.The representer theorem states that there exists an optimal linear solution that lies in the span of the training data. We shall call span (ψ(x_1), …, ψ (x_n)) the training (examples) feature span.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>i made a list of Tech EU tech projects! for users interested in privacy and sustainability</title><link>https://github.com/uscneps/Awesome-European-Tech</link><author>/u/uscnep</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:10:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I can play a game that wasn&apos;t meant to run on my PC, using Linux</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivn4kr/i_can_play_a_game_that_wasnt_meant_to_run_on_my/</link><author>/u/Vousch</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 16:52:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gitoxide in February</title><link>https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/discussions/1855</link><author>/u/ByronBates</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 16:47:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I made an MMORPG playable with an API.

Each step represents a unit of work that interacts with a single service. Once a step is completed, it triggers the next step in the sequence. If any step fails, the saga executes compensating updates to undo the changes made by the previous steps, ensuring that the system returns to its initial state.There are two main approaches to implementing the Saga Pattern: Orchestration and Choreography.In this approach, a central orchestrator service coordinates the saga steps. The orchestrator tells each service when to execute its local transaction. It maintains the state of the saga and handles any failures by invoking compensating transactions. The orchestrator knows the entire saga flow.The client initiates the saga by communicating with the orchestrator. The orchestrator then invokes the first service. Upon successful completion, the orchestrator moves to the next step, invoking the corresponding service. If a service fails, the orchestrator triggers compensating transactions in reverse order.In the Choreography approach, there is no central coordinator. Instead, each service involved in the saga knows its role and communicates with the other services through events or messages. Each service listens for specific events and performs local transactions when the appropriate event is received. The saga flow is distributed across the services.The client initiates the saga by communicating with the first service. This service performs its transaction and publishes an event. Other services, listening for this event, perform their respective transactions and publish their events. This chain reaction continues until the saga is complete. If a service fails, it publishes a compensating event, triggering other services to execute compensating transactions.Choreography has no single point of failure, as each service manages its part of the saga.Orchestration provides simplified error handling and monitoring with centralized control. In contrast, each service needs to handle its errors in Choreography, which can lead to complex error-handling logic.In Orchestration, the coordinator needs to know about all the services involved in the saga, which can lead to tight coupling. In contrast, in Choreography, services need to agree on the events and the order of transactions, which can lead to overhead in coordination.If you enjoyed this article, please hit the ❤️ like button.If you think someone else will benefit from this, then please 🔁 share this post.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[R] Calculating costs of fine tuning an Vision Language Model</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ivjrwi/r_calculating_costs_of_fine_tuning_an_vision/</link><author>/u/thekarthikprasad</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:21:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello guys, I need help in calculating the cost of fine-tuning a VL model.

The campaign, which OpenAI calls Peer Review, saw the group prompt ChatGPT to generate sales pitches for a program those documents suggest was designed to monitor anti-Chinese sentiment on X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and other platforms. The operation appears to have been particularly interested in spotting calls for protests against human rights violations in China, with the intent of sharing those insights with the country's authorities."This network consisted of ChatGPT accounts that operated in a time pattern consistent with mainland Chinese business hours, prompted our models in Chinese, and used our tools with a volume and variety consistent with manual prompting, rather than automation," said OpenAI. "The operators used our models to proofread claims that their insights had been sent to Chinese embassies abroad, and to intelligence agents monitoring protests in countries including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom."According to Ben Nimmo, a principal investigator with OpenAI, this was the first time the company had uncovered an AI tool of this kind. "Threat actors sometimes give us a glimpse of what they are doing in other parts of the internet because of the way they use our AI models," Nimmo told .Much of the code for the surveillance tool appears to have been based on an open-source version of one of Meta's . The group also appears to have used ChatGPT to generate an end-of-year performance review where it claims to have written phishing emails on behalf of clients in China."Assessing the impact of this activity would require inputs from multiple stakeholders, including operators of any open-source models who can shed a light on this activity," OpenAI said of the operation's efforts to use ChatGPT to edit code for the AI social media surveillance tool.Separately, OpenAI said it recently banned an account that used ChatGPT to generate social media posts critical of , a Chinese political scientist and dissident who lives in the US in exile.

The methodology of combining human expertise with AI assistance for question validation could be valuable for developing future evaluation datasets.I think the relatively modest performance (62%) on graduate-level questions across diverse fields suggests current LLMs still have significant room for improvement in specialized domains. This could influence how we approach model training and evaluation for domain-specific applications.TLDR: New benchmark tests LLMs across 285 graduate disciplines using human-AI collaborative question generation.

Every week we cover as much as possible of what's happening in the world of KDE Plasma and its associated apps like Discover, System Monitor, and more.This week, we've been rapidly fixing the bugs that people found in Plasma 6.3, as well as some older bugs as well. In addition to that, some smaller UI improvements have started to trickle in! There's some larger work in progress too, but not merged yet. Have a look at what did merge this week:Improved the weather widget's display of search results from the BBC weather service to reduce unhelpful visual noise. (Ismael Asensio, link)Eliminated the visual difference between how Night Light looks on Wayland compared to on X11. (Xaver Hugl, link)The Digital Clock widget's context menu is now less cluttered with things you're not likely to use. (Nate Graham, link)Rephrased some settings on System Settings' General Behavior page to be clearer about what it is that they actually do. (Nate Graham, link)Improved the accessibility of the Widget Explorer sidebar. (Christoph Wolk, link)Fixed the issue mentioned last week where KWin built with LTO on GCC 15 could show a black screen on login when using an ICC profile; we found a way to restructure the code that avoids the issue. (Vlad Zahorodnii and Xaver Hugl, link)Fixed a case where Plasma could crash when you tried to access the Properties dialog for a file in the Recently or Frequently Used file lists in the Kickoff Application Launcher. (Nicolas Fella, link)Fixed a regression that caused the volume change OSD to fail to appear when adjusting the volume with the integrated volume buttons of a Bluetooth headset. (David Redondo, link)Fixed a regression that caused the + clipboard popup to lose its visual highlights when navigated by keyboard. (Christoph Wolk, link)Fixed an issue in KWin that caused the new "Prefer efficiency" option when using an ICC profile to not actually be very efficient on some hardware, and another one that broke Night Light while using the "Prefer color accuracy" setting. (Xaver Hugl, link 1 and link 2)Taking screenshots on Wayland in FreeBSD now works. (Vlad Zahorodnii, link)Fixed a few bugs in the Color Picker widget, such as the shortcut option not working, and the tooltip not looking correct in certain circumstances. (Christoph Wolk, link 1 and link 2)Fixed a bug with the Task Manager widgets that broke the ability to move the pointer diagonally to a tooltip without dismissing it by accident while using a right-to-left language like Arabic or Hebrew. (Christoph Wolk, link)Made several improvements and fixes for keyboard navigation in the Kicker Application Menu widget. (Christoph Wolk, link 1, link 2, and link 3)Fixed a regression that caused desktop icons selected by dragging a box around them to become inappropriately deselected if the pointer ended right over one of the icons when releasing the mouse button. (David Edmundson, link)Fixed a regression that caused the automatic tablet mode feature to accidentally get blocked on certain types of devices, but only when using the feature to re-bind mouse buttons. (Vlad Zahorodnii, link)Fixed a bug that caused the desktop and panels to go missing when applying a new Global Theme and using the option to replace the existing layout. This also fixed a bug that caused deleted widgets to not be deleted from the plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc config file. (Marco Martin, link 1 and link 2)Fixed a set of subtle bugs in the implementation of the new "prefer symbolic icons" behavior of the System Tray that caused it to actually do the opposite, showing you colorful icons instead! (Nate Graham and David Redondo, link 1 and link 2)Extremely long weather station names no longer overflow and break the widget popup's layout. (Ismael Asensio, link)The inline file renaming text field on the desktop is now colored correctly when using a mixed light/dark setup, as with Breeze Twilight. (Evgeniy Harchenko, link)Limited the Power Management setting "Change screen brightness" to only take effect for built-in screens on battery-powered systems (e.g. laptops), which avoids certain timing-related brightness bugs for external monitors and makes the settings page less confusing. (Jakob Petsovits, link)Fixed an issue that could cause user switching from KRunner to behave strangely and eventually cause a crash. (David Edmundson, link)Fixed an older regression that broke the "highlight non-default settings" features for pages in System Settings written using QtWidgets. The fact that this was overlooked for so long goes to show how few are left these days! (David Redondo, link)Switched KWin's render loop initialization code to use a more precise type of timer that should reduce frame drops. (Apostolos Dimitromanolakis, link)When the  daemon crashes, now it automatically restarts itself in the background.

The way this is accomplished is by using generativity to create unique invariant lifetimes so that borrows to TLS can't be coerced to a `&'static` lifetime and by configuring the runtime with a barrier to rendezvous worker threads during shutdown. This shutdown barrier makes it such that runtime tasks never outlive TLS data owned by worker threads; this makes every invariant lifetime guaranteed to be valid until no tasks remain. Blocking threads managed by the Tokio runtime cannot outlive worker threads with this configuration, and so pointers to TLS from worker threads can be safely moved to these blocking threads with the lifetime constrained. As the lifetimes cannot be coerced into `&'static`, moving onto other threads is prevented. This crate downgrades to using `Arc` whenever the `barrier-protected-runtime` feature is not enabled, making it the end users choice to opt into this optimization by using async_local to configure the runtime shutdown barrier. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ring is unmaintained</title><link>https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0007.html</link><author>/u/technobicheiro</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:44:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This advisory has been withdrawn and should be ignored.

However half of the budget being covered means half of it isn’t. Or in other words: the Foundation is not yet sustainable, despite running on the strictest possible budget, and is burning through its (relatively small) reserves. And we are at the point where the end of the road is in sight.The Matrix.org Foundation exists to act as a neutral  and to nurture it as efficiently as possible as a single unfragmented standard, for the greater benefit of the whole ecosystem, not benefiting or privileging any single player or subset of players.Without the Foundation and its programs, the Matrix protocol itself faces existential threats:Without Trust & Safety efforts, bad actors and communities would proliferate on the network and make it unlivable for the rest.Without a canonical specification, the shared infrastructure and a Spec Core Team to maintain it, the protocol would become fragmented, losing its effective interoperability – increasing the costs on all downstream users.Without a neutral entity as the custodian of the specification, the ecosystem would first shatter and then consolidate around the biggest (likely for-profit) actor.Without advocacy, conferences, documentation and tutorials, Matrix would become a niche protocol used by a few enthusiasts for side projects, whilst big proprietary and siloed networks continue to hold the world’s communications.But there is light at the end of the tunnel! Concretely, the Foundation delivers most of its value by fostering a healthy, fair and fertile ecosystem around Matrix. It needs to strike the right balance between:Making Matrix accessible & visible.For the general public it means maintaining an easy default onboarding server (Matrix.org).For server administrators it means providing the right tooling to keep their users (and themselves!) safe.For developers it means making it easy to develop products using Matrix, via documentation, tutorials, and in-person events.Making Matrix compelling to build on.This means maintaining the Matrix Specification as a canonical, unencumbered, patent free and royalty free specification.Being responsive and vendor-neutral when an organisation or individual contributes.Promoting the good players within the ecosystem.Ensuring the network grows and attracts more users.Making Matrix a product that benefits the greater good.This means ensuring that the general public can easily build safe & easy to use communities on Matrix.Ensuring that bad actors are proactively chased and discouraged to use Matrix.Matrix has been here for 10 years, and will hopefully be here for many more! But to continue to grow and thrive, it needs the Foundation to be around and healthy, which means carefully allocating its budget in order to continue to exist and fulfill its mission. This is why it needs to focus on critical programs and shut down some of its activities.We view the following programs as critical to the Foundation’s mission:Maintaining the canonical, backwards compatible, stable Matrix SpecDeveloping protocol enhancements and Trust and Safety tooling, making the tools available to the ecosystem and moderating the servers under its control (typically Matrix.org) - see our recent blog postRunning the Matrix.org homeserver as an initial home for newcomersPromoting the Matrix protocol via online content, conferences and meet-ups and other marketing strategiesWe might fine tune our approach, but we can't cease any of those programs without severe consequences for the ecosystem.Meanwhile, bridges have been at the heart of Matrix for a long time. Public bridges hosted by the Matrix.org Foundation have been a very good resource to show the power of interoperability, connect communities together, and onboard many people into their Matrix journey.However, these bridges require regular maintenance as the bridged platforms evolve their APIs, and significant engineering and moderation support to run. Luckily, the Matrix ecosystem is now more mature than it was at the time we spun up those public Slack, XMPP and IRC bridge instances. There are now commercial players like Beeper providing a user-friendly offering for people who want to get all their conversations in a single app, or IndieHosters and Fairkom offering hosting for Matrix server and bridge instances (and much more).So unless the Foundation manages to raise $100,000 of funding by the end of March 2025, we will have to focus our resources on the critical lines of work, and consequently we will have to shut down all the remaining bridges hosted by the Matrix.org Foundation. This includes bridges to Slack, XMPP, OFTC (IRC), and Snoonet (IRC). We will also mark the software behind those bridges as archived, as we don't have the resources to accept new contributions.In practice, the Foundation needs an additional $610K in revenue to break-even, but this $100K would extend our runway 1 month while we work on landing grants and new members. To put this in context, we nearly doubled our revenue in 2024, reaching $561K, but it was also the first year in which we carried the full cost of our operations: $1.2M. To make ends meet, we liquidated $283K worth of cryptocurrency donations and ended the year with a $356K deficit. We are currently on target for $587K revenue in 2025, with a modest increase in expenses.🔗Growing the ecosystem and the networkChoosing to shut the bridges down is a difficult decision to make, but will allow us to focus on the critical projects which will keep the ecosystem growing. The success of Matrix depends on how widely it is used by the general public and by organisations – preferably natively rather than via bridges.The more people and organisations rely on Matrix, the more attractive it becomes for organisations to build products and services on top of it, the more funding the Foundation gets, and the more the Foundation can in turn reinvest into the ecosystem and run initiatives that benefit all stakeholders for the growth of the network.Once the Foundation is cashflow positive, it will be able to accelerate and eventually get on with the multiple projects the team and Governing Board have in mind to make Matrix fun, exciting, reliable, safe, easy to use, and above all useful. And we hope to get there by the end of the year.Most importantly, despite the Trust and Safety team being the Foundation’s biggest expense, as explained in our blog post, the team is still underresourced: they are understaffed and under a lot of pressure to deliver protocol improvements, better tooling for server admins, and ensure Matrix.org is a good citizen of the open federation. T&S will be the first area to see increased funding.Separately, the Foundation wants to continue executing on its mission! Among others, better connect the doers in the ecosystem with the people and organisations who need their energy, share the successes and learnings from the community: the Matrix Conference was an incredible success and we want to see more of that.We’ve also seen a clear change in how many users and organisations were adopting Matrix in the last few months: the world needs a decentralised end-to-end encrypted network to communicate more than ever, and it shows! We want to uplift the good players which are driving this growth.There is so much more that we could do to make Matrix better and realise its full potential. Right now, the Foundation urgently needs your financial help. For the sake of a safe network, our primary focus today, but also to be able to deliver on the reason we all want Matrix to succeed.People should have full control over their own communication.People should not be locked into centralised communication silos, but instead be free to pick who hosts their communication without limiting who they can reach.The ability to converse securely and privately is a basic human right.Communication should be available to everyone as a free and open, unencumbered, standard and global network.If you are an organisation building on top of Matrix, you can help by , which also gives you the opportunity to be eligible to participate in the Governing Board, and other perks. If you are an organisation buying Matrix services or products, you can help by ensuring that your vendor is financially contributing back to the project or becoming a member yourself.If you are an individual using Matrix, you can help by .If you are a philanthropist or other funder, you can help by getting in touch with us at  to discuss funding options. It isn’t the firsttime we’ve rung the alarm bell, and it is no fun to beg for help. We are at a crossroads, where the vibrancy of the ecosystem and enthusiasm around Matrix is not reflected in the support the Foundation gets, and we are at risk of losing this common resource and all it offers.But all in all, we are optimists – we wouldn’t have begun this journey if we weren’t – and we believe that there are people out there who realise that sovereign and secure communication is as high on the list of today’s essential technology – if not higher – as ensuring AI is safe, so let’s spread the word and let’s continue working on a safer and more sovereign world!
                        The Matrix.org Foundation is a non-profit and only relies
                        on donations to operate. Its core mission is to maintain
                        the Matrix Specification, but it does much more than that.
                    
                        It maintains the matrix.org homeserver and hosts several
                        bridges for free. It fights for our collective rights to
                        digital privacy and dignity.

It safeguards all data on your hard drive by encrypting it and makes it unreadable without an decryption key. This level of protection is vital for preventing unauthorized access if your laptop or desktop is lost or stolen.FDE with openSUSE is both user-friendly and powerful. The setup with advanced security features is easy.For users seeking feature parity with Windows BitLocker, openSUSE offers Full Disk Encryption (FDE) secured by a TPM2 chip or a FIDO2 key. This advanced setup enhances security by storing encryption keys within the TPM, which ensures that only a trusted system configuration can unlock the disk. For a step-by-step guide on enabling this feature, read the Quickstart in Full Disk Encryption with TPM and YaST2 article.Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up FDE on your system:Step 1: Download and Boot openSUSEVisit get.opensuse.org to download the latest version of openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed.Restart your computer and boot from the USB drive to begin the installation process.Step 2: Configure Encryption During InstallationOnce the installer starts, select your preferred language and keyboard layout.In the partitioning setup, choose Guided Setup with Encrypted LVM.Set a strong passphrase for encryption. This passphrase will be required every time the system boots.   - Use a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters for optimal security.Proceed with the installation as directed by the installer.Step 3: Verify Encryption SettingsAfter installation is complete and the system restarts, you’ll be prompted to enter your encryption passphrase. Once entered, openSUSE tools will decrypt the disk and boot normally. To confirm encryption is active:Open a terminal or console.Run the command  to verify that your disk is listed with the encryption type (e.g., ).The output might look something similar to the following:NAME        FSTYPE      FSVER LABEL UUID                                   FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT

While FDE protects your data, it does not prevent data loss from hardware failure or accidental deletion. Regularly back up your data to an encrypted external drive or a secure cloud service to ensure its safety.Enhanced Security for Modern ChallengesSetting up full disk encryption on openSUSE not only protects your data but also aligns with the Upgrade to Freedom campaign’s mission of empowering users to maintain control over their hardware and privacy. By combining open-source software with good security practices, openSUSE ensures that users can confidently embrace a more secure digital future.For additional guidance and community support, visit the openSUSE forums or join discussions at your local Linux user group. Please be aware that some hardward configurations may require additional drivers or BIOS settings adjustments for full disk encryption to fully function properly. Check your device’s compatibility and update your firmware before proceeding. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[First crate] derive_regex: construct a type by parsing a string with regular expressions</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iuzg1i/first_crate_derive_regex_construct_a_type_by/</link><author>/u/TitaniumBrain</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:31:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I had an idea and decided it was simple enough to publish my first crate and contribute to the Rust ecosystem.I'm still relatively new to Rust (coming from a few years of Python but I fell in love with the language), so any feedback is welcome.

focus area, but the group feels some work should be done to get them to a stage
where we can include them.We're excited about all of these features and the improvements this year's
project will bring to the platform. And, as with last
year, the project will make a whole set of things
Baseline Newly available. This post shares more information about some of the
features on the list, with links to information to find out more.Several of the features included in Interop 2025 are features that you flagged
up as important in the State of CSS 2024 survey. They'll help you create more
beautiful and performant user experiences.This feature lets you anchor a positioned element to an anchor, it's
particularly useful when displaying popovers.Same-document view transitionsAlso included this year are view transitions, specifically same-document view
transitions, and the  CSS property.The  propertyThe

property has been Baseline Newly available since September 2024. It lets you
create effects behind your content. For example to blur or create effects that
you might expect to only be available in a graphics application.Despite being mostly interoperable, you can see from the failing tests for
that
there are bugs and issues in those implementations. While these issues might not
be a problem to everyone, we know that many of you do run into them, it'll be
great to get this feature working really well.The  element is a disclosure widget which can be expanded to reveal
additional content. The  element itself is Baseline Widely available.
However, there are a number of related features that have been more recently
added that make  more
useful.The  and  CSS pseudo-elements.Using  to toggle the content instead of .Auto-expanding the  element with find-in-page matches.The  attribute, which hides an element until it is found
using the browser's find-in-page search or it is directly navigated to by
following a URL fragment.The  at-rule lets you scope your selectors to a sub-tree of the DOM, or
even select between an upper and lower boundary in the tree. For example, the
following CSS only selects  elements inside an element with a class of
.In the next example, an upper and lower bound is used. The  element is
only selected if it's between the element with a class of  and also
outside of the element with a class of .Without the  event, there's no reliable way to detect that a scroll is
complete. The best you could do is to use  to check if the scroll
has stopped for a period. This makes it more like a scroll has paused event, not
a scroll has ended event.With the  event, the browser does all this difficult evaluation for
you.The  propertyThe

property is a shorthand for , ,
, and text-decoration-thickness. It's deemed Baseline
Widely available, however in Safari the only unprefixed shorthand property that
works is . It's this that will be addressed during 2025.The CSS 
property has a number of possible values, many of which are designed to lay out
scripts that display vertically. Sometimes however, you want to lay out text
vertically as part of a design, rather than for language support reasons. The
 and  values are designed for this, but have suffered
from poor browser compatibility. This should be fixed during 2025.In addition, the logical CSS properties  and 
are included. These make it possible to control what happens when content
overflows boxes, regardless of the writing mode.Web Vitals can help you quantify the
experience of your site and identify opportunities to improve. The Web Vitals
initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics
that matter most, the Core Web Vitals.Event Timing API (for INP)This year, the work will focus on the following features:JavaScript string builtins: to make the WebAssembly built-in string
functions mirror a subset of the JavaScript String API so it can be callable
without JavaScript glue code.Resizable buffers integration: to integrate WebAssembly into JavaScript code
that uses resizable buffers.This year the project includes a removal from the platform. Mutation
events are deprecated
and replaced with the much more performant and Baseline Widely available
Mutation Observer
API. Chrome
removed these events in Chrome 126, and this focus area is to remove them from
all browsers.Descriptions of the full list of features can be found in the project README.

This month, we finished up some essential features and fixes in preparation for the upcoming beta alongside some amazing COSMIC contributors. Check out what’s new in Alpha 6, and make sure you’re fully updated to see these changes for yourself!Desktop Zoom can now be activated in Settings > Accessibility, from the Accessibility applet in the panel, or using the shortcuts Super + =, Super + -, or Super + Mouse Scroll.More accessibility features in the books! Clicking the Accessibility icon at login gives you access to various settings toggles for:Reads on-screen text aloud Scrolling up while holding Super magnifies the region of the screen where your cursor is locatedNavigates you to Accessibility SettingsAdditional accessibility features for high-contrast, color inversion and various color filters for colorblindness are being worked on soon.Desktop view is now supported in COSMIC. Right-clicking an empty desktop and selecting “Desktop view options” opens a settings window for your desktop. Show or hide desktop folders, drives, or the Trash; you can also adjust icon size and spacing between icons from this window. A fix for the window appearing below other windows will arrive in a later update. Files and folders can also be dragged between the desktop view and COSMIC Files.Additional Scaling OptionsAn additional scaling setting has been added to scale the screen slightly, from 5% to 20% larger. For example, on a display set to 125% scaling, those desiring larger text can use this new setting to increase scaling to 130%, 135%, 140%, or 145%.Workspaces received some updates to really make the feature sparkle. For starters, you can now scroll between workspaces in the overview as a quick and easy way of navigating to your intended destination. Clicking on the preview of the current workspace or empty space in the workspace overview will allow you to exit the workspace view.Previews for horizontal workspace now include name and number. Workspace previews on rotated displays will show the correct orientation. The last workspace is now removed if it follows another empty workspace.Additionally, minimized windows can now be dragged and dropped between workspaces, while windows can be moved to another display by dropping them in the workspace overview. Dragging a window out of a stack will match expectations and no longer move the whole stack. Window titles in the overview are now at the top left of the window and match the users theme. Additional workspace features, including pinned workspaces, will arrive in a future update.Windows Gravitate to EdgesToggling on “Floating windows gravitate to nearby edges” in Window Management Settings will automatically align a window’s edge to the adjacent screen border when dragged close to it, removing the struggle of aligning it with the edge manually.If a search in the Launcher yields more than eight entries, users can now scroll to see the additional options. In addition, the Launcher has been updated to trigger a countdown timer whenever Power Off, Restart, and Log Out are selected, matching the behavior of the Power applet.File path completion is now in COSMIC Files. Hitting the Down arrow when typing a file path into the search bar will automatically finish the file path you’re searching for. Meanwhile, copying a file allows pasting of the file path in other applications. COSMIC Files uses Home and End keys for navigating the app. You can now compress and extract password protected zip files and drag selecting will scroll the content window.Copy/paste using the middle mouse button has been implemented. Sweet convenience.A nav bar has been added for viewing folders in a tree view to display the video files available to open in the Media Player. File menu options have also been completed:When a music file is playing, the Media Player image will display the song title, album, artist, and year released. Down the line we’d like to explore adding further metadata, such as album artwork and song lyrics. Mpris control has been added to show and control currently-playing media in the sound applet, and the scrubber now moves to a second line for improved single-column usability.A Revert all changes feature has been added to COSMIC Edit to revert your file back to the most recent saved state. If you decide to scrap everything or start a new file from scratch, go to File > Close Project to remove the project from the NavBar and bring up a new document and tab. When multiple tabs are open, cycle project tabs using Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab shortcuts.Zoom has also been implemented. Zoom in and out from the View menu, or using Ctrl + or Ctrl - shortcuts. Reset back to default using Ctrl + 0.Opens Sans replaces Fira Sans as the default font for COSMIC. The team liked Open Sans for its better legibility, glyph and language support, and a more modern aesthetic. Likewise, Noto Sans Mono will be used for the default monospace font.Memory usage has been greatly reduced in a number of areas, including minimize, COSMIC Files, and workspaces. A related update made to libcosmic should prevent memory fragmentation. In addition, optimizations to cosmic-text and freedesktop-icons have reduced memory usage across all COSMIC apps and applets.A Whole Swarm of Bug Fixes…and More!Fixed a bug with server-side decorations that caused the cursor to drag a window after a single clickWhen clicking an app icon of an app with multiple windows opened, window previews now adapt to the size and shape of the windowImplemented a fix in cosmic-comp related to keyboard grabbing after a window is focusedImplemented behavior to COSMIC Files for exiting the context menuCOSMIC Files now changes view away from the external drive after the drive is mounted and removedImplemented a fix for COSMIC Files attempting to read an unreadable .hidden fileFixed a crash involving the file picker related to a11y in libcosmicCOSMIC Terminal now uses a hollow block cursor design when the window is unfocusedRemoved Spell Check menu option from COSMIC Edit, to be returned once the feature existsIn COSMIC Edit, “Find” searches now highlight all occurrences, and the currently selected item is highlighted at a higher opacityScrolling now occurs as expected when dragging to highlight text in COSMIC EditSaving a root or read-only file in COSMIC Edit now prompts the user for their password, removing the need to run the application as rootScreenshot tool now respects the user’s time zone when naming screenshot filesImplemented a fix preventing icons from disappearing from the screenshot toolFixed a bug preventing the Delete key from moving a desktop file to the TrashImplemented a fix for a bug causing Steam to crashFixed an issue causing some Radeon RX users to be unable to log inThe context menu in COSMIC Settings now closes when another option is selected in the NavBarImplemented the ability to import environment variables from systemdFixed a regression with libcosmic affecting the ComboBox widgetAdded a slight delay when the cursor hovers from one applet to the next to account for intentAdded support for using the middle mouse button to copy/pasteClicking next/previous month in the calendar widget no longer selects the dayResolved a bug with Firefox not recognizing it’s the default web browser when it’s not set as the default mail clientRemoved WPS suggestion from the WiFi applet when WPS is not supportedAdded support to cosmic-bg for compositors without fractional scaling supportPop!_OS 24.04 Linux kernel updated to version 6.12.10Head to the COSMIC page for a fresh install of Alpha 6. If your system has an NVIDIA GPU, remember to install the NVIDIA ISO.

This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements. We open-source our framework and benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research capabilities of LLM agents.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Dimensionality reduction is bad practice?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iuwgcu/d_dimensionality_reduction_is_bad_practice/</link><author>/u/Ready_Plastic1737</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:30:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I was given a problem statement and data to go along with it.

experience and reducing debugging time. Poor practices, like unclear messages
or misuse of HTTP status codes, can frustrate developers and lead to increased
support tickets. This guide covers actionable strategies to standardize API
error handling, including:Use of HTTP Status Codes: Ensure accurate mapping (e.g., 400 for client
errors, 500 for server issues).Structured Error Responses: Follow RFC 9457 (Problem Details) standards
for clear, actionable error details. Write brief, helpful, and secure messages.Protocol-Specific Practices: Tailor error handling for REST, GraphQL, and
gRPC APIs.To address the challenges highlighted earlier, you can apply these
well-established methods.HTTP status codes are your first tool for communicating errors. The key is to
use them accurately, rather than relying on generic codes.401 Unauthorized, 422 Unprocessable Entity500 Internal Error, 503 Service UnavailableYou can find a full list of status codes
on MDN, but here's a
few helpful docs we've written in the past that go into more depth:For consistent error reporting, modern APIs should follow the
RFC 9457 Problem Details
specification. This is the successor to the popular
RFC 7807 draft. For an in-depth
understanding of this format, check out our
full problem details guide. In
case you're short on time - here's a quick overview:The problem details response is sent back as a JSON body with the following
properties:: A URI that identifies the specific error type. This
helps clients understand the error and potentially find more information or
documentation about it. Ideally, this URI should be stable and not change over
time.: A short, human-readable summary of the problem. This
should be a brief description that concisely conveys the error. The title
should not change for a given "type" URI.status (integer, optional): The HTTP status code generated by the origin
server for this occurrence of the problem. This helps clients understand the
nature of the error and how it relates to the HTTP protocol.detail (string, optional): A more detailed, human-readable explanation of
the problem. This can include specific information about the error and what
might have caused it. The "detail" field is intended to provide context and
suggestions to clients on how they might address the problem.instance (string, URI, optional): A URI that identifies the specific
occurrence of the problem. This can help clients and servers correlate and
track individual instances of errors.Here's what a standardized error response might look like:This response would be accompanied with the following headers and status code:Here's a video that shows you how to send these error back in practice. It's in
.Net/C# but the concepts are broadly applicable:When evolving error schemas, it's crucial to make changes without disrupting
existing clients. Here's how you can manage this:Add optional fields instead of altering existing onesPreserve legacy formats during transitionsImplement semantic versioning for your endpointsAPI management tools like Zuplo are really handy when trying to bring
consistency across your error formats, and are especially useful when trying to
transition all of your APIs over from one format to another.Creating effective API error messages means providing useful guidance while
keeping security in mind. Google's AIP-193 guidelines
[4] recommend using a structured format with
plain, straightforward language that remains technically accurate.The goal is to make error messages both clear and actionable. Here's a
comparison of good and bad examples:"Invalid email format in 'user_email' field""ValidationError: field_23""Request to /api/v1/users failed"If you've ever used Azure, many of their system errors demonstrate this
approach, for example:Maintaining security while providing useful error feedback involves a few key
practices: to prevent leaks.Standardize authentication errors for consistency. to avoid exposing vulnerabilities.For example, following RFC 9457 guidelines, a secure error response might look
like this:This is another area where using an API gateway/API management tool is useful.
You can monitor your outbound responses and scan them for PII or other sensitive
information/keywords using a regex. A programmable gateway (ex. Zuplo) will even
let you rewrite your response bodies to strip out sensitive data.Over 10,000 developers trust Zuplo to secure, document, and monetize their APIsLearn MoreLet's dive into how different API protocols handle errors, building on the
standards discussed earlier.REST APIs rely on HTTP status codes paired with structured error payloads. A
common standard for this is , which ensures a
consistent format across endpoints. This method also supports content
negotiation between JSON and XML, keeping the structure consistent across
different formats.GraphQL handles errors differently. It always responds with a  status
code, even when errors occur. Errors are communicated through an  array,
which allows for partial success. For instance, GitHub's GraphQL API might
return:This approach allows for returning valid data alongside error details.gRPC uses a predefined set of numeric status codes (ranging from 0 to 16) for
error handling, aligned with . Errors include structured details
for better context. Here's an example:Standard HTTP success codesEach protocol has its own approach, but they all follow two key principles:
machine-readable error codes and . This ensures
errors are both understandable and actionable.For cross-protocol APIs, API gateways can simplify error handling. They provide
unified error schema management and automate transformations between
protocol-specific formats. This helps maintain consistency while respecting the
conventions of each API type.Effective error management relies on consistent monitoring and testing to uphold
usability standards outlined in earlier protocols. This process builds on
protocol-specific error conventions to ensure smooth handling across systems.A centralized error code system can ensure uniformity across distributed
services. For example, Google uses the  format, which
enforces standardized error structures with both machine-readable codes and
human-readable messages [4].In multi-service architectures, two main approaches are common:Ensures uniform error codes, Acts as a single source of truthRequires strict oversightDistributed with PrefixesAllows team independence, Enables quicker updatesDemands thorough documentationMany organizations find that combining these methods provides the best results.Key metrics to monitor include
[2][3]:Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) errors: Target under 30 minutes.: Should remain below 5% after fixes.95th percentile error resolution time: A critical benchmark for resolution
speed.User-impacting error ratio: Measured per 10,000 requests.Tools like Sentry support distributed tracing in over 15
languages, while Raygun offers deployment correlation to
pinpoint issues [2].Testing ensures compliance with HTTP status codes and response formats covered
in earlier sections. Error testing is typically done manually using tools like
Postman - but you should definitely invest in automation as your API grows and
evolves. To test specific errors, you should invest in automated
end-to-end API testing using
tools like Playwright and StepCI.If you have schematized errors, you can perform
schema validation on your live responses
to ensure they adhere to those schemas. When response validation is combined
with an API design specification
like OpenAPI to enforce outputs match what's documented, it's known as
.Effective API error handling builds on the protocol-specific conventions
discussed earlier. Two key goals are ensuring consistent response formats
and reducing repeat client errors
[2][5].Key requirements include:Standardized Response Structure:Machine-readable error codesClear, human-readable messagesLinks to relevant documentationRequest correlation IDs for troubleshootingSecurity-Focused Practices:Prevent exposure of sensitive data by adhering to security guidelines
outlined in the Writing Clear Error Messages sectionUse appropriate status codesFollow established security best practicesTo create a reliable error-handling system, follow these four phases:Use an
API monitoring tool
to analyze errors at the endpoint level. This helps identify inconsistencies
and establish a baseline for improvement
[2][5].Introduce centralized error-handling middleware to enforce the newly defined
standards. Often, an API gateway plays this role.Use error tracking tools to evaluate the system’s performance. Track metrics
like error recurrence rates, resolution times, and Mean Time to Acknowledge
(MTTA).These steps align with earlier recommendations for policy-driven error handling
and offer practical ways to enhance your API's reliability.Handling API errors effectively requires a clear and structured approach. This
involves combining standard protocols with additional application-specific
information to provide clarity and maintain security.1. Protocol-Specific HandlingEach API protocol has its own method for managing errors. Here’s how to handle
errors for some common protocols:: Use HTTP status codes alongside detailed error messages in the
response body.: Include error arrays in the response, allowing for partial
success when appropriate.: Utilize standardized status codes with structured error details.2. Security Best PracticesTo keep your API secure, follow these guidelines (as outlined in the "Security
in Error Messages" section):Use generic error messages for authentication failures to prevent revealing
sensitive information.Avoid exposing internal system details in error responses.Filter sensitive data on the server side before sending error responses.3. Monitoring and ConsistencySet up monitoring tools, such as distributed tracing, to identify and analyze
error patterns. Use
API gateways to
enforce consistent error formats and schemas across your system for better
management and debugging

All it takes is one look at the Software Architecture subreddit and you’ll see people asking about certificates only to be told they’re both useless and useful.When I was working with Lemon.io (a developer marketplace with 80k+ developers), I got to see firsthand how certification affected their careers. So when I saw this topic start to pop up again (without any real answers), I decided to dive into research to see if my experience at Lemon.io still held true for architects.The value of certificationAssuming I’m talking to architects with a lot of experience, what I will say is that certification doesn’t replace experience, but it does complement it really well. And, it can be a strong differentiator from your peers.I’m going to try a metaphor here. If your career is a burger, your experience is the patty and certificates are the condiments. Some people prefer their burgers with bacon, cheese, or even an egg. Depending on what your career goals are, you’ll want to add different condiments to your ‘burger’. But keep in mind, the most important thing will always be the meat, a.k.a your experience.Deciding if certification is right for you is the first step. The next step is asking the question: what is the right certification for you?I loved the Role Based Roadmap from Mumshad Mannambeth, founder & CEO at KodeKloud on navigating the certification paths (you can find it here).It inspired me to do something similar but focused on Architects. Below, you’ll find 12 of the most popular architectural certificates you can choose to upgrade your career, and add more “trust badges” to your CV, LinkedIn profile, or freelancer profile.Each has its own focus and value it can add depending on your career goals and role:Certifications for Enterprise ArchitectsCertifications for Domain Solutions ArchitectsSoftware Architecture, Governance, and Infrastructure CertificationAWS Certified Solutions ArchitectGoogle Professional Cloud ArchitectZachman Certified - Enterprise ArchitectMicrosoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect ExpertCertified Enterprise Architect (CEA) Black Belt ProgramRed Hat Certified Architect (RHCA)Recognized globally, this certificate covers the TOGAF framework for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information technology architecture. So if you are working on an enterprise-wide architecture or want to switch to that direction, it can be useful.
Unlike the certifications below, this is a whole ecosystem that builds on itself. So it is a significant investment. However, if you’re working in, or looking to work in, the governmental sector or with large corporations, this may be a good choice for you. Keep in mind, however, that while it may look cheap, the cost does not include training, which is provided by TOGAF-accredited partners, each of whom sets their own price.The comment below sums up my research into TOGAF 9 really well:Best for Software Architects working in large organizations: Enterprise Architects,  Business Architects, Solutions Architects, and IT Strategy Consultants with experience in strategic planning, We had a few Enterprise Architects with TOGAF 9 certification at Lemon.io and it was a nice value-add to their profiles. It is worth mentioning that their rates were in the top tier 🙂.13 Level 1 Learning Units27 Level 2 Learning UnitsTesting: Two-stage testing, including TOGAF 9 Part 1 and TOGAF 9 Part 2 examinations$360 USD per exam (requires two exams)English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish (Latin American), FrenchCertification expiry & recertification: TOGAF 9 certificate does not expire.ITIL is one of the most popular certification systems in the world, with more than two million certified specialists in the world. The Master certification is the highest level of ITIL certifications and requires passing all four previous certifications before challenging it. To achieve the master certification you have to pass an assessment to validate your ability to apply ITIL frameworks to real-world business scenarios. So, experience working with the ITIL principals and practices as an enterprise software architect is required.ITIL is not a training or testing provider but works with accredited partners for each. That means the pricing is dependent on your provider. The nice thing is, that it is one of the few large accreditations you can achieve through self-study.If you want to chat with peers who are planning to become ITIL Masters, there is an active subreddit called ITIL_Certification.: Governance & Compliance Architects, Governance and Compliance Managers, Enterprise Architects.Five distinct levels to progress through: Foundation -> Practitioner –> Intermediate -> Expert -> Master. Each level has its own training and requirements.Attend a training course with an accredited training organization, which will include the exam as part of the course.Self-study using the core manual, then book an exam directly with PeopleCert.Dependent on your chosen training/testing partner.All 4 previous ITIL certifications, including ITIL Expert certification5 years in IT leadership, management, or higher management advisory levels.English, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Spanish, ThaiCertification expiry & recertification: Certification is valid for 3 years. You can renew your certification by retaking the exam or by earning a new certification.Zachman Certified - Enterprise ArchitectThis certification covers the Zachman Framework for designing and maintaining Enterprise Architectures, which aligns IT with business goals. The training is focused on high-level enterprise planning, including Enterprise Architecture principles, strategy formulation, and practical application, rather than project or solutions architecture. This makes it ideal for those who need a structured approach to solve enterprise challenges.This is another multi-level certification option. Each level builds on the one before it, which makes it a very comprehensive course. And, in my humble opinion, very expensive.: Enterprise Architects, Business Architects, and IT Consultants with an Enterprise Architecture focus.Four levels available: Associate, Practitioner, Professional and Educator (last one only required for those who want to teach the course).Training: Two weeks of online prep work, and three days of live instructionTesting: Two-hour, online exam (passing grants level 1 Associate)Case study: Delivering a case study provides level 2 Practitioner, and a second case study provides level 3 Professional$2999 USD covers level 1 & 2 (regional pricing is available)Each level requires certification in the preceding levelCertification expiry & recertification: The certificate expires in 3 years. Recertification costs $99 USD.Certified Enterprise Architect (CEA) Black Belt Program (Owned by Zachman now)Zachman now owns CEA, so I decided to add this certification under the Zachman banner. Just like Zachman, this is a three-step course, except the naming convention is designed to make you feel like you’re in a martial art, which is cool. It’s also $7,000 more, which is not as cool, but that does mean you get to skip the yellow and green belt and go straight for the black belt.Designed to develop Enterprise Architects through hands-on training and real-world projects, this program will prepare you for leadership roles in Enterprise Architecture. This program is built on ISO standards and focuses on the practical application of frameworks, tools, and methodologies.: (Very rich people) Senior Enterprise Architect, IT Director with EA experience, Chief Architect, Enterprise Architect with 10+ years experience, Enterprise Architecture Consultant.Accelerated Path of 12 Weeks: Five individual courses taught in parallel over twelve weeks.Progressive Path that is self-paced: Five individual online courses taken at your own pace over 24-30 weeks.The IASA Global certification is a vendor-independent program for Business Technology Architects. The training has four stages that roughly align with your career stage. For Enterprise Architects, the professional (3rd) tier is the most useful  The previous two tiers are for those in earlier stages of their career. The training is based on practical experience with a focus on Enterprise Architecture (EA), Software Architecture (SA), Solution Architecture (SolA), Infrastructure Architecture (IA) and Business Architecture (BA).Unlike most tiered options, IASA allows you to challenge each level even if you haven’t attained the certification under it. So if you’ve progressed in your career far enough that you don’t think a foundational certification is valuable, and you don’t want to work your way through 3 tiers you already fully understand, IASA may be the answer for you.: Senior architects and business analysts aiming to bridge the gap between business and technology.Four levels of certification:Professional (recommended for enterprise-level architects) - achieved by presenting to a board of CITA-D certified architects and answering any questions. 2 hrs allotted for the exam.Distinguished - achieved by presenting to a board of CITA-D certified architects and answering any questions. 2.5 hrs allotted for the exam.Testing: Online or onsite testing is available (for professional tier) Exam: $425 USD  N/A  Exam + prep: $2,000 USD  Exam + prep: $2,800 USDA minimum of 10 years in the industry as a practicing architect.  Extensive documentation is required.CITA-Associate level certificate is recommended but not mandatory.Certification expiry & recertification: Requires individuals to maintain an active Full Iasa Membership and collect at least 80 hours of Continuing Education Units bi-annually (based on their website).The Open Group ArchiMate 3 CertificationArchiMate was mentioned a lot over Reddit. The Open Group ArchiMate 3 doesn’t teach you how to be an EA but rather focuses on how to communicate better as an EA by teaching ArchiMate’s modelling language. This language is designed to remove ambiguity from the description, analysis, and visualization of Enterprise Architectures.The content of the course is designed to complement TOGAF, which makes it useful for Enterprise Architects who already work in a TOGAF framework. They aren’t however, the same thing.: Enterprise ArchitectsTraining: Online self-study available, or attend an accredited training course (Accredited Training Courses provide an exam voucher).ArchiMate 3 Part 1 offers foundation certification (60 min time limit for 40-question, multiple choice exam. Passing score: 60%)ArchiMate 3 Part 2 offers practitioner certification (90 min time limit for 8-question, scenario-based and complex multiple choice exam. Passing score: 65%)Online or in-person proctored exams available depending on providerTraining cost depends on the provider.  Each exam costs $360 USD. None  Foundation certification or pass Part 1 exam on the same day with the same provider.Certification expiry & recertification: The certification does not expire, which is very cool.AWS Certified Solutions ArchitectThe AWS certification is a great starting point for architects or senior Software Engineers with AWS Cloud or strong on-premises IT experience. It covers the design and optimization of AWS cloud-based software and shows you can handle complex multi-service architectures, which is crucial as more companies move to the cloud. The exam tests real-world scenarios you would face designing large-scale systems, including hybrid architectures, multi-region deployments, and cost optimization at scale. Basic familiarity with programming concepts will help, but you don’t need hands-on experience with code.This is the only provider-specific certificate that offers a more in-depth, self-directed training option for a price. Of course, you don’t have to take that option. If you’re confident, you can take the free training and then challenge the test. However, the test is also the cheapest among these certifications, so it offsets the overall cost a little bit.During my research, I found quite a few posters, including this one, that had seen significant benefits from taking the course.: Systems Administrators (Cloud Focused), Cloud Architects, Solutions Architects, Cloud Consultants Software Architects for Cloud-Based Applications, and Enterprise Architects.3 courses of online, self-directed exam prep are available15.25 hrs free; 48.75 hrs paidTesting: 130 minutes. Pearson VUE testing center, or online proctored exam1 year of hands-on experience designing cloud solutions with AWS services.English, French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin America), Spanish (Spain), Simplified and Traditional ChineseGoogle Professional Cloud ArchitectIf you’re all in on Google, this certification is for you. It will help you show your cloud architecture skills and advance your career in Google’s cloud technology. Keep in mind, this is focused on Google’s cloud infrastructure and doesn’t cover software architecture.The training and exam for this certificate are all online (though on-site exams are available) which makes it very flexible. Plus, it’s pretty cheap (although it’s the most expensive of the provider-specific options). However, if you go through all the training, it’s going to take you some time, as it’s the longest provider-specific course here.: Cloud Architects, Solutions Architects, IT Project Managers focused on the cloud, Cloud Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and Enterprise Architects.Training: 114.75 hrs, online, self-directedTesting: 2-hr test, with two options: an online proctored exam, or an onsite-proctored exam at a testing center.3+ years of industry experience, including 1+ year of designing and managing solutions with Google CloudCertification expiry & recertification: The certificate is valid for 2 years. Recertify by retaking the exam within 60 days of the expiration date.Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect ExpertThis certificate shows you know your way around Azure, including how to design and implement cloud and hybrid solutions. It dives deep into how various IT infrastructure components in the Microsoft ecosystem (like compute, network, storage, monitoring, and security) interact to generate solutions. Just like the Google certificate above, this is infrastructure-focused, not software-focused, so keep that in mind when considering it.The course for the Microsoft certification is shorter than Google’s by almost 100 hours and can be taken both online at your own pace, or with an online instructor. It’s also a bit cheaper than Google’s, making it an easier investment both for hours and dollars spent.: Systems Administrators, Network Engineers, IT Managers, Cloud Architects, Computer Systems Analysts and Infrastructure Engineers.Training: Self-paced online learning (15.25 hrs), or instructor-led online training (4 days).Testing: Online proctored exam.$165 USD  Self-paced training is free; instructor-led depends on the provider.Experience with Azure administration and development, and DevOps processes.  Advanced experience and knowledge of IT operations.English, Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), SpanishCertification expiry & recertification: The certificate expires after one year. Recertification is free via an online assessment on Microsoft Learn.Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA)Red Hat’s highest level of certification, the RHCA designation covers designing, implementing, and managing Red Hat-based IT infrastructures. One of the nice things is that RHCA offers tracks in both infrastructure and enterprise applications. So you can choose the option that best matches your goals.Red Hat prices its certification differently than most. It’s a subscription-based model, which allows you to have a little more freedom with how you tackle their training. In fact, their certification offers the most custom options, with a variety of options to get from A (where you are) to B (certified). So if you have diverse interests, this one might be the one for you.: Senior Systems Administrator, Cloud Architect, IT Infrastructure Architect, DevOps Engineer, Senior Application Developer, Enterprise Solutions ArchitectRed Hat Certified Architect in InfrastructureRed Hat Certified Architect in Enterprise ApplicationsCertification builds on prerequisites with five additional certifications chosen from a list.Training and exams depend on your chosen path and certifications. Standard: $7,500 USD/year for 25 training units and certification.  Premium: $9,000 USD/year for 30 training units and certification.Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)  OR  Red Hat Certified Enterprise Microservices Developer (RHCEMD)  OR  Red Hat Certified Cloud-native Developer (RHCCD)Recommended experience depends on your specific path.Certification expiry & recertification: Certifications become ‘non-current’ after three years. To maintain an RHCA certification, you must maintain five additional certifications over your RHCE. RHCEMD or RHCCD. These certifications do not need to be the same as those you’ve taken to attain your RHCA.Made for IT professionals who want to master SOA, this certification covers designing, implementing, and managing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) infrastructure.SOA certification is one and done. There are no levels or long-term commitment to one system, which makes it less of a commitment. It’s also very affordable.: Enterprise Architects, Solutions Architects, IT Architects, Software Architects, Systems Engineers with SOA experience, Technical Leads with architecture responsibilities170 mins online proctored exam50 hrs of training over 5 modules (modules include: Workbook Lessons, Video Lessons, Interactive Exercises, Mind Map Poster, Practice Exam Questions, PDFs of Workbook and Poster, Lab Exercise Booklet).$399 USD for course and certificationiSAQB CPSA-F/CPSA-A (International Software Architecture Qualification Board)In contrast to TOGAF training, the CPSA program focuses on the practical implementation of IT systems. Its foundation and advanced certificates offer room for architects to grow.This is a two-step program, foundation and advanced, which puts it between the single-step SOA certification and the larger three- or even four-step offerings. Just like TOGAF and ITIL, iSAQB is not a testing or training provider, so there are a lot of options for training. Or, if you’re confident, you can challenge the exam without, though that’s not recommended.: Software designers, software developers, Software Architects, systems analysts
Though training and testing are performed by independent operators, you have four testing options available, including:Exam after classroom trainingThe cost of training is dependent on training providers.  Testing price is dependent on training providers.Training is suggested.  Foundation certification is required for Advanced.18+ months of practical experience, including:  - A higher programming language  - Technical documentation  - Object-oriented programming language  - Design and implementation of distributed applications  - Basics of modeling and abstraction; and UML and their relation to sourceLanguage is dependent on training providers.Certification expiry & recertification: The certificate does not expire.The right certification can set you apart on your resume, but it’s never a replacement for experience. Depending on your career path, you may choose to get certified by one of the bodies above, or simply study on your own and prove what you can do through practical experience.If you’ve decided to pursue the certification path, the options above are all great choices. Of course, each requires a commitment of time and money. While you can’t warp the space-time continuum to change the time requirement, it may be possible to get your employer to help you cover some, if not all of the cost. If they do, it gives you an even higher ROI on your investment to yourself.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This month in Servo: new webview API, relative colors, canvas buffs, and more!</title><link>https://servo.org/blog/2025/02/19/this-month-in-servo/</link><author>/u/wuyuwei-tw</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 12:53:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Servo now supports several new web API features:We’ve landed a bunch of  improvements: are a lot more useful now, with  now supporting  (@Taym95, #35040), , , and  (@Taym95, #34958).Servo aims to be an embeddable web engine, but so far it’s been a lot harder to embed Servo than it should be.For one, configuring and starting Servo is complicated.
We found that getting Servo running at all, even without wiring up input or handling resizes correctly, took  of Rust code (@delan, @mrobinson, #35118).
Embedders (apps) could only control Servo by sending and receiving a variety of “messages” and “events”, and simple questions like “what’s the current URL?” were impossible to answer without keeping track of extra state in the app.Contrast this with WebKitGTK, where you can write a minimal kiosk app with a fully-functional webview in  of C.
To close that gap, we’ve started reworking our embedding API towards something more idiomatic and ergonomic, starting with the concept embedders care about most: the .Our new webview API is controlled by calling methods on a  (@delan, @mrobinson, #35119, #35183, #35192), including navigation and user input.
Handles will eventually represent the lifecycle of the webview itself; if you have one, the webview is valid, and if you drop them, the webview is destroyed.Servo needs to call into the embedder too, and here we’ve started replacing the old EmbedderMsg API with a  (@delan, @mrobinson, #35211), much like the delegates in Apple’s WebKit API.
In Rust, a delegate is a  that the embedder can install its own  for.
Stay tuned for more on this next month!Other embedding improvements include:We’ve reworked Servo’s , making all prefs optional with reasonable defaults (@mrobinson, #34966, #34999, #34994).
As a result:The names of all preferences have changed; see the Prefs docs for a listEmbedders no longer need a  resource to get Servo runningServo’s networking is more efficient now, with the ability to cancel fetches for navigation that contain redirects (@mrobinson, #34919) and cancel fetches for <video> and <media> when the document is unloaded (@mrobinson, #34883).
Those changes also eliminate per-request IPC channels for navigation and cancellation respectively, and in the same vein, we’ve eliminated them for image loading too (@mrobinson, #35041).We’ve continued splitting up our massive script crate (@jdm, #34359, #35157, #35169, #35172), which will eventually make Servo much faster to build.We now run CI smoketests on OpenHarmony using a real device (@jschwe, @mukilan, #35006), increasing confidence in your changes beyond compile-time errors.We’ve also tripled our self-hosted CI runner capacity (@delan, #34983, #35002), making concurrent Windows and macOS builds possible without falling back to the much slower GitHub-hosted runners.Servo can’t yet run WebDriver-based tests on wpt.fyi, wpt.servo.org, or CI, because the  executor for the Web Platform Tests does not support testdriver.js.
 does, though, so we’ve started fixing test regressions with that executor with the goal of eventually switching to it (@jdm, #34957, #34997).Thanks again for your generous support!
We are now receiving  (−11.4% over December) in recurring donations.
With this money, we’ve been able to expand our capacity for self-hostedCIrunners on Windows, Linux, and macOS builds, halving  build times from over an hour to under 30 minutes!Servo is also on thanks.dev, and already  (+5 over December) that depend on Servo are sponsoring us there.
If you use Servo libraries like url, html5ever, selectors, or cssparser, signing up for thanks.dev could be a good way for you (or your employer) to give back to the community.As always, use of these funds will be decided transparently in the Technical Steering Committee.

If you have the time and expertise you can get involved in the needed projects, but there is a much easier and less time-consuming way. You and/or your company can sponsor the development efforts.Allocating 10-20 USD / month by an individual or 1000-2000 USD month by a small company does not sound like a big investment and many such sponsors can make a huge difference together.One way to find who to sponsor is to find the developers of your dependencies. For that visit the Explore GitHub Sponsors page. On the left-hand side select the "Cargo" ecosystem. That will show you the individuals and the organizations that you currently rely upon that also accept sponsorship.I've also created a page listing some of the people and project who develop Rust and could be sponsored. For some of them I've also included background information.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My experience with the GNOME Desktop - from despised to loved</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iun2fo/my_experience_with_the_gnome_desktop_from/</link><author>/u/Fishsven</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 09:33:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ I started my Linux journey with Pop!_OS, and I hated the wasted space of the panel-like dock. It took me a while for me to return to GNOME as I was discovering KDE Plasma's (5.24) customization potential. I loved it at first, but I noticed how the DE slowly became unstable after a lot of customising (Plasma has GREATLY improved by now, last time I tried 5.27 on Q4OS and it was blazing fast and rock solid). I was annoyed at how people took a liking to the hideous DE known as GNOME, and for me there was little difference between it and Windows 8, as they were basically tablet centric with GNOME and it's wasted space. I eventually got tired of Plasma, because it had way too many features that I didn´t wan´t to use. Tried XFCE, MATE and Budgie, and they felt too outdated for my liking; Budgie felt off. I decided to give GNOME a shot and installed Ubuntu 22.04. For once I was starting to like GNOME. It felt more unified and simple than KDE, but just more modern than the other desktops. However, this was NOT stock GNOME. I installed vanilla GNOME on the same OS and decided to give it a shot. Moving on from Ubuntu's Yaru theme to Adwaita felt like a MASSIVE downgrade. Except the looks, GNOME's true workflow actually started to make sense to me and it was more productive than any desktop I tried. Of course, I installed some extensions like Blur my Shell, but I can use GNOME without extensions nowadays. As I'm writing this, GNOME 48 would bring a new Adwaita font with Inter as it's base, which will improve the looks of GNOME by a bit, IMO. Currently using Zorin OS, which has a GNOME theme that is MILES better compared to Libadwaita / Adwaita.  What I understood is GNOME is not all about looks, it makes the UI simpler and easier to understand, with ONLY the things you need, and it stays out of your way and focuses on your work. It might be dumbing down the desktop for some, but that's exactly what GNOME's for. A solid philosophy IMO- but definitely lagging in some important areas. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How donations helped the LibreOffice project and community in 2024</title><link>https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2025/02/21/how-your-donations-helped-the-libreoffice-project-in-2024/</link><author>/u/themikeosguy</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 09:28:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thank you for visiting our website and your interest in our services and products.

While I'm not a developer myself, I've found another way to contribute: filing bug reports.I'll admit my early attempts were probably pretty rough – missing crucial context and details. But practice makes perfect (or at least close!), and these days my bug reports are often addressed within a day or so.There's something incredibly satisfying about uncovering a problem, meticulously documenting it, submitting a report, seeing it assigned to someone, and finally witnessing the fix. It's a tangible way to make a difference in the software we all rely on.This level of responsiveness and respect simply doesn't exist in proprietary ecosystems. I've tried reporting bugs on Windows and macOS with little success – it often feels like shouting into the void. But in the open-source world, even smaller projects welcome contributions and treat you seriously.So, I encourage everyone to embrace bug reporting! Start with a simpler project to get comfortable with the process, then gradually tackle more complex ones. Not only will you be improving the software for everyone, but you'll also experience that warm glow of knowing you made a positive impact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Torvalds responds to Christoph Hellwig</title><link>https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/CAHk-=wgLbz1Bm8QhmJ4dJGSmTuV5w_R0Gwvg5kHrYr4Ko9dUHQ@mail.gmail.com/</link><author>/u/bik1230</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 02:30:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Torvalds rips into Hellwig for blocking Rust for Linux</title><link>https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/CAHk-=wgLbz1Bm8QhmJ4dJGSmTuV5w_R0Gwvg5kHrYr4Ko9dUHQ@mail.gmail.com/</link><author>/u/eugay</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:49:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Installed Ubuntu on my Nan&apos;s laptop:</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iueq5x/installed_ubuntu_on_my_nans_laptop/</link><author>/u/Unique_Ad4547</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:18:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Libreboot 20241206, 10th revision released!

The changelog on this page is written, relative to Libreboot 20241206 revision 9 which was released on 12 February 2025. The  Libreboot 20241206 release came out on 6 December 2024. You can find the full list of revisions here and the original release here.Open source BIOS/UEFI firmware[link]Libreboot is a free/open source BIOS/UEFI replacement on x86 and ARM, providing boot firmware that initialises the hardware in your computer, to then load an operating system (e.g. Linux/BSD). It is specifically a , in the same way that Debian is a Linux distribution. It provides an automated build system to produce coreboot ROM images with a variety of payloads such as GRUB or SeaBIOS, with regular well-tested releases to make coreboot as easy to use as possible for non-technical users. From a project management perspective, this works in  the same way as a Linux distro, providing a source-based package manager (called lbmk) which patches sources and compiles coreboot images. It makes use of coreboot for hardware initialisation, and then a payload such as SeaBIOS or GRUB to boot your operating system; on ARM(chromebooks), we provide  (as a coreboot payload).We also provide an experimental U-Boot setup on x86, as a coreboot payload for providing a minimal UEFI implementation.Normally, revisions would only be documented on the Libreboot 20241206 revisions page, but this revision contains , so it was decided that there should be a full announcement, to ensure that more people see it.Summarised list of changes[link]GRUB released  to its main branch, fixing a large number of security issues. You can read about them here:This updates GRUB to revision 4dc6166571645780c459dde2cdc1b001a5ec844c from 18 February 2025. Several OOB heap writes, buffer overflows, use after frees and so on, are now prevented with this update.In addition to the security fixes, several out-of-tree fixes from Libreboot’s main branch have been merged for GRUB, fixing bugs in the xHCI driver, and adding support for non-root USB2 hubs on platforms that use the  GRUB tree.Changes to the GRUB configuration have been made, to make scanning of LVM volume/group names more reliable, including on full-disk-encryption setups. More such changes are planned for the next major release; the current changes are very minor.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>BritCSS: Fixes CSS to use non-American English</title><link>https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/BritCSS</link><author>/u/ValenceTheHuman</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:14:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Media] Rust powered flight radar</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iubs4r/media_rust_powered_flight_radar/</link><author>/u/Confident-Alarm-6911</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 22:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, consider this mix: I have thing for retro-interfaces with monochromatic displays, I wanted to learn rust and do something with sdr radio, I live next to the airport.

Extra builds would cost  per minute.AWS account where we will auto-spawn EC2 instance. We will use  instance (2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM) which costs  per month in  region (cheapest region). Also it will take  per month for EBS gp2 storage (20GB) for EC2 instanceThis is it, registry will be auto-spawned on EC2 instance, so no extra costs for it. Also GitHub storage is not used, so no extra costs for it.The setup has next features:Build process is done using IaaC approach with HashiCorp Terraform, so almoast no manual actions are needed from you. Every resource including EC2 server instance is described in code which is commited to repo so no manual clicks are needed.Docker build process is done on GitHub actions, so EC2 server is not overloadedChanges in infrastructure including changing server type, adding S3 Bucket, changing size of sever disk is also can be done by commiting code to repo.Docker images and cache are stored on EC2 server, so no extra costs for Docker registry are needed.Total build time for average commit to AdminForth app (with Vite rebuilds) is around 2 minutes.Previously we had a blog post about deploying AdminForth to EC2 with Terraform without registry. That method might work well but has a significant disadvantage - build process happens on EC2 itself and uses EC2 RAM and CPU. This can be a problem if your EC2 instance is well-loaded without extra free resources. Moreover, low-end EC2 instances have a small amount of RAM and CPU, so build process which involves vite/tsc/etc can be slow or even fail.So obviously to solve this problem we need to move the build process to CI, however it introduces new chellenges and we will solve them in this post.Quick difference between approaches from previous post and current post:How and where docker build happensSource code is rsync-ed from CI to EC2 and docker build is done thereDocker build is done on CI and docker image is pushed to registry (in this post we run registry automatically on EC2)How Docker build layers are cachedGitHub actions has no own Docker cache out of the box, so it should be stored in dedicated place (we use self-hosted registry on the EC2 as it is free)Simpler setup with less code (we don't need code to run and secure registry, and don't need extra cache setup as is naturally persisted on EC2).Build is done on CI, so EC2 server is not overloaded. For most cases CI builds are faster than on EC2. Plus time is saved because we don't need to rsync source code to EC2Build on EC2 requires additional server RAM / overloads CPUMore terraform code is needed. registry cache might require small extra space on EC2Chellenges when you build on CI​When you move build process to CI you have to solve next chellenges:We need to deliver built docker images to EC2 somehow (and only we)We need to persist cache between buildsExporing images to tar files​Simplest option which you can find is save docker images to tar files and deliver them to EC2. We can easily do it in terraform (using  command on CI and  command on EC2). However this option has a significant disadvantage - it is slow. Docker images are big (always include all layers, without any options), so it takes infinity to do save/load and another infinity to transfer them to EC2 (via relatively slow rsync/SSH and relatively slow GitHub actions outbound connection).Faster, right option which we will use here - involve Docker registry. Registry is a repository which stores docker images. It does it in a smart way - it saves each image as several layers, so if you will update last layer, then only last layer will be pushed to registry and then only last will be pulled to EC2.
To give you row compare - whole-layers image might take , but last layer created by  command might take . And most builds you will do only last layer changes, so it will be 20 times faster to push/pull last layer than whole image.
And this is not all, registry uses TLS HTTP protocol so it is faster then SSH/rsync encrypted connection.Of course you have to care about a way of registry authentication (so only you and your CI/EC2 can push/pull images).What docker registry can you use? Pretty known options:Docker Hub - most famous. It is free for public images, so literally every opensource project uses it. However it is not free for private images, and you have to pay for it. In this post we are considering you might do development for commercial project with tight budget, so we will not use it.GHCR - Registry from Google. Has free plan but allows to store only 500MB and allows to transfer 1GB of traffic per month. Then you pay for every extra GB in storage and traffic. Probably small images will fit in this plan, but generally even alpine-based docker images are bigger than 500MB, so it is not a good option.Self-hosted registry web system. In our software development company, we use Harbor. It is a powerful free open-source registry that can be installed to own server. It allows pushing and pulling without limit. Also, it has internal life-cycle rules that cleanup unnecessary images and layers. The main drawbacks of it are that it is not so fast to install and configure, plus you have to get a domain and another powerfull server to run it. So unless you are a software development company, it is not worth using it.Self-hosted minimal CNCF Distribution registry on EC2 itself. So since we already have EC2, we can run registry on it directly. The  container is pretty light-weight and easy to setup and it will not consume a lot of extra CPU/RAM on server. Plus images will be stored close to application so pull will be fast.In the post we will use last (4th way). Our terraform will deploy registry automatically, so you don't have to do anything special.Docker builds without layer cache persistence are possible but very slow. Most builds only change a couple of layers, and having no ability to cache them will cause the Docker builder to regenerate all layers from scratch. This can, for example, increase the Docker build time from a minute to ten minutes or even more.Out of the box, GitHub Actions can't save Docker layers between builds, so you have to use external storage.Though some CI systems can persist docker build cache, e.g. open-source self-hosted Woodpecker CI allows it out of the box. However GitHub actions which is pretty popular, reasonably can't allow such free storage to anyoneSo when build-in Docker cache can't be used, there is one alternative - Docker BuildKit external cache.
So BuildKit allows you to connect external storage. There are several options, but most sweet for us is using Docker registry as cache storage (not only as images storage to deliver them to application server).BuildKit cache in Compose issue
Previously we used docker compose to build & run our app, it can be used to both build, push and pull images, but has issues with external cache connection. While they are not solved we have to use  command to build images. It is not so bad, but is another point of configuration which we will cover in this post.Registry authorization and traffic encryption​Hosting custom CNCF registry, from other hand is a security responsibility.If you don't protect it right, someone will be able to push any image to your registry and then pull it to your EC2 instance. This is a big security issue, so we have to protect our registry.First of all we need to set some authorization to our registry so everyone who will push/pull images will be authorized. Here we have 2 options: HTTP basic auth and Client certificate auth. We will use first one as it is easier to setup. We will generate basic login and password automatically in terraform so no extra actions are needed from you.But this is not enough. Basic auth is not encrypted, so someone can perform MITM attack and get your credentials. So we need to encrypt traffic between CI and registry. We can do it by using TLS certificates. So we will generate self-signed TLS certificates, and attach them to our registry.Assume you have your AdminForth project in .Create file  in :create folder  and create file  inside:Step 3 - create a SSH keypair​Make sure you are still in  folder, run next command:Now it should create  and  files with your SSH keypair. Terraform script will put the public key to the EC2 instance and will use private key to connect to the instance. Also you will be able to use it to connect to the instance manually.Step 4 - create TLS certificates to encrypt traffic between CI and registry​Make sure you are still in  folder, run next command:Run next command to create TLS certificates:This will create  and  files.Step 5 - .gitignore file​Create  file with next content:Step 6 - buildx bake file​Create file :Step 7 - main terraform file main.tf​Create file  in  folder:👆 Replace  with your app name (no spaces, only underscores or letters)Step 7.1 - Configure AWS Profile​Open or create file  and add (if not already there):Step 7.2 - Run deployment​To run the deployment first time, you need to run:Step 8 - Migrate state to the cloud​First deployment had to create S3 bucket for storing Terraform state. Now we need to migrate the state to the cloud.Add to the end of :👆 Replace  with your app name (no spaces, only underscores or letters).
Unfortunately we can't use variables, HashiCorp thinks it is too dangerous 😥Now you can delete local  file and  file as they are in the cloud now.Step 9 - CI/CD - Github Actions​Create file .github/workflows/deploy.yml:.github/workflows/deploy.ymlStep 8.1 - Add secrets to GitHub​Go to your GitHub repository, then  ->  ->  and add: - your AWS access keyVAULT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - your AWS secret key - execute  and paste to GitHub secrets - execute  and paste to GitHub secrets - execute  and paste to GitHub secrets - execute  and paste to GitHub secretsNow you can push your changes to GitHub and see how it will be deployed automatically.Once you will have sensitive tokens/passwords in your apps you have to store them in a secure way.Simplest way is to use GitHub secrets.Let's imagine you have  which will be used one of AI-powered plugins of adminforth. We can't put this key to the code, so we have to store it in GitHub secrets.Open your GitHub repository, then  ->  ->  and add  with your key.Now open GitHub actions file and add it to the  section:.github/workflows/deploy.ymlNext add it to the  script:In the same way you can add any other secrets to your GitHub actions.Out of space on EC2 instance? Extend EBS volume​To upgrade EBS volume size you have to do next steps:This will increase physical size of EBS volume, but you have to increase filesystem size too.You can find your EC2 IP in AWS console by visiting EC2 -> Instances -> Your instance -> IPv4 Public IPThis would show something like this:Here we see that  is our disk and  is our partition.Now to extend partition run:This will extend partition to the full disk size. No reboot is needed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s Shift to Rust Programming Cuts Android Memory Vulnerabilities by 68%</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/googles-shift-to-rust-programming-cuts.html</link><author>/u/Unerring-Ocean</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 22:14:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has revealed that its transition to memory-safe languages such as Rust as part of its secure-by-design approach has led to the percentage of memory-safe vulnerabilities discovered in Android dropping from 76% to 24% over a period of six years.The tech giant said focusing on Safe Coding for new features not only reduces the overall security risk of a codebase, but also makes the switch more "scalable and cost-effective."Eventually, this leads to a drop in memory safety vulnerabilities as new memory unsafe development slows down after a certain period of time, and new memory safe development takes over, Google's Jeff Vander Stoep and Alex Rebert said in a post shared with The Hacker News.Perhaps even more interestingly, the number of memory safety vulnerabilities tends to register a drop notwithstanding an increase in the quantity of new memory unsafe code.The paradox is explained by the fact that vulnerabilities decay exponentially, with a study finding that a high number of vulnerabilities often reside in new or recently modified code."The problem is overwhelmingly with new code, necessitating a fundamental change in how we develop code," Vander Stoep and Rebert noted. "Code matures and gets safer with time, exponentially, making the returns on investments like rewrites diminish over time as code gets older."Google, which formally announced its plans to support the Rust programming language in Android way back in April 2021, said it began prioritizing transitioning new development to memory-safe languages around 2019.As a result, the number of memory safety vulnerabilities discovered in the operating system has declined from 223 in 2019 to less than 50 in 2024.It also goes without saying that much of the decrease in such flaws is down to advancements in the ways devised to combat them, moving from reactive patching to proactive mitigating to proactive vulnerability discovery using tools like Clang sanitizers.The tech giant further noted that memory safety strategies should evolve even more to prioritize "high-assurance prevention" by incorporating secure-by-design principles that enshrine security into the very foundations. "Instead of focusing on the interventions applied (mitigations, fuzzing), or attempting to use past performance to predict future security, Safe Coding allows us to make strong assertions about the code's properties and what can or cannot happen based on those properties," Vander Stoep and Rebert said.That's not all. Google said it is also focusing on offering interoperability between Rust, C++, and Kotlin, instead of code rewrites, as a "practical and incremental approach" to embracing memory-safe languages and ultimately eliminating entire vulnerability classes."Adopting Safe Coding in new code offers a paradigm shift, allowing us to leverage the inherent decay of vulnerabilities to our advantage, even in large existing systems," it said."The concept is simple: once we turn off the tap of new vulnerabilities, they decrease exponentially, making all of our code safer, increasing the effectiveness of security design, and alleviating the scalability challenges associated with existing memory safety strategies such that they can be applied more effectively in a targeted manner."The development comes as Google touted increased collaboration with Arm's product security and graphics processing unit (GPU) engineering teams to flag multiple shortcomings and elevate the overall security of the GPU software/firmware stack across the Android ecosystem."Proactive testing is good hygiene as it can lead to the detection and resolution of new vulnerabilities before they're exploited," Google and Arm said.Found this article interesting?

I wanted to focus on two surveys that have appeared recently, which tell us a bit about languages that many of you probably used in a previous reincarnation cycle, but have already forgotten about.Of course, the usual disclaimer at the beginning – we know that surveys tend to show what they feel is worth showing and have a certain narrative power.Having that in mind, I think we can begin.First, let’s look at the people who filled out the survey – demographics tell us a lot about the quality of the results and what we can expect. We have as many as 232 responses, with 75% Software Engineers and 49.6% people in tech-lead or related areas – apparently, many of us wear several hats at once (yes, I know that pain too). It turned out that most of them work on closed-source projects (87.5%), although there’s no shortage of hardcore open-source folks (18.1%). I think that fairly reflects the state of the industry.An overwhelming majority of respondents like or love Scala: 49.1% love it, 44% rather like it. The remaining 6.9% are still undecided, and 0.9% (i.e., 2 people) have fallen into Scala-depression. However here we also hit, to some extent, the “peak” of people interested in the topic - those willing to fill out the Scala Survey.The average age of projects is 7 years, with a median of 6 years – that’s quite… a lot. It also shows that quite a bit of Scala is legacy projects – at least in the surveyed group, “greenfields” are relatively rare.Typelevel (41.8%), Akka (35.3%), ZIO (23.3%), and Play (15.5%). And of course, Spark (7.7%) – let’s not forget that big data elephant in the room, though the days when it was synonymous with Data seem to be behind us. These people have a new best friend.Moreover, more than half of the projects (53%) combine different ecosystems such as Akka and Cats, indicating that we’re building increasingly hybrid beasts. 36.2% are “monogamists” relying entirely on a single library (ZIO, we’re looking at you), and 10.8% are the brave ones using only the standard library.VirtusLabproject hereSBT beats everyone hands down (87.5%). Scala-CLI (11.2%) is relatively new but has decent traction, and Bazel (7.8%) and Maven (7.3%) also have loyal fans. 22.4% of commercial projects have already switched to Scala 3, but as many as 37% do not plan to. Why? Because as usual, the ecosystem is (still) not fully ready, there’s a lack of resources, and management is pushing the topic aside. You know that feeling when a new version of a language tempts you, but there are dozens of “work in progress” branches piling up in the repo…?Talking about the problems, the report shows three major ones:Fragmentation of the ecosystem and migration issues to Scala 3Lack of resources to maintain older projects.recruiting Scala developersGiven these recruitment problems, it’s not surprising that 68.6% allow remote work, which at least somewhat makes life easier for those who have managed to settle in the Bieszczady Mountains or in Bali.Despite all these challenges, 88.4% of respondents would still choose Scala for new projects without hesitation. It shows that the JVM community sees great potential in Scala, but also knows that working on its further development and tooling is a marathon, not a sprint.the report is full of interesting detailsNow, let's take a look at the other report I have for you today.Alex MillerState of ClojureLet’s start with what warms the hearts of backend folks the most: does Clojure live in real projects and is it more than just a hobby experiment? Definitely yes! 73% of respondents use Clojure at work, mainly in web development, commercial services, and enterprise applications. Their services often end up in the cloud – public (58%) or private (26%). So you can say with confidence that the “Lispy DSL” is conquering more and more server rooms and Docker containers.What about team size? Most are small teams (up to 10 people), though there are also true giants – Nubank, with over a thousand Clojure developers, is a prime example. It’s no coincidence they’re now responsible for the development of the language.Regarding the adoption of new versions, things look surprisingly good. As many as 58% have already moved to Clojure 1.12, released in September 2024, which indicates that stability and a lack of painful breaking changes are quite a motivator.Here we see that Java 21 LTS already has 54% of users, and Java 8 is losing ground in favor of newer versions (only 9% remain with the old-timer, which is better than in Java itself). Probably for this reason, Clojure plans to raise the base version in subsequent releases (much like Scala, but we’ll talk about that next week).BabashkaAn example is Babashka – a dialect that enjoys huge popularity (93% of respondents who use dialects had dealt with it) because it allows scripts to be run quickly, without the start-up delays of the JVM. ClojureDart, on the other hand, brings Clojure into the Dart ecosystem, opening new perspectives for web and mobile apps. Other projects like Squint, Jank, and Cherry demonstrate the community’s ongoing creativity – each introduces its own modifications, often experimental, allowing the Clojure philosophy to adapt to entirely new conditions.Leiningen and deps.edn continues to vie for space among dependency management tools – we can see that deps.edn is gaining strength, and nRepl, REBL, and other plugins help make REPL feel like home.A special section of the survey examines people who have just started their adventure with Clojure (less than a year of experience). The report has been tracking programmers’ migration paths to Clojure for years. It appears they still largely come from Java, JavaScript, and Python. Ruby and C++ are in decline, whereas C# is starting to gain slightly – perhaps thanks to the “functional awakening” in the .NET ecosystem.Biggest challenges for newcomers?If you’ve read this far, you’re probably as happy as I am to see that Clojure keeps evolving. On one hand – a stable, mature platform, and on the other – new dialects, a growing community not just in corporate settings but also in open-source projects and even in the gaming industry (yes, yes, I’ve seen it!).

Nature had a great publication on semantic entropy, but I haven't seen many practical guides on production patterns for LLMs.Sequence log-probabilities provides a free, effective way to detect unreliable outputs (can be interpreted as "LLM confidence").High-confidence responses were nearly twice as accurate as low-confidence ones (76% vs 45%).Using this approach, we can automatically filter poor responses, introduce human review, or iterative RAG pipelines.Experiment setup is simple: generate 1000 RAG-supported LLM responses to various questions. Ask experts to blindly evaluate responses for quality. See how much LLM confidence predicts quality.Bonus: precision recall curve for an LLM.My interpretation is that LLM operates in a higher entropy (less predictable output / flatter token likelihood distributions) regime when it's not confident. So it's dealing with more uncertainty and starts to break down essentially.Regardless of your opinions on validity of LLMs, this feels like one of the simplest, but effective methods to catch a bulk of errors. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why do temporaries need to explicitly borrowed?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iu8jsn/why_do_temporaries_need_to_explicitly_borrowed/</link><author>/u/parkotron</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 20:31:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a long time C++ dev, I feel it didn't take me very long to pick up Rust's reference semantics and borrowing rules, but there one place where I constantly find myself forgetting to include the : passing temporaries into functions taking references.fn foo(s: &str) { println!("The str is: {s}"); } fn bar() -> String { "temporary".to_string() } fn main() { foo(&bar()); // ^ I always forget this ampersand until reminded by the compiler. } Rust's explicit  and  operators make a lot of sense to me: given a chunk of code, it should be obvious where a value has been borrowed and what kind of borrow it is. One should never be surprised to learn a reference was taken, because it's right there in the code.But in the case of temporary values, it really doesn't matter, does it? Whatever a function call does (or doesn't) do to a temporary value passed to it, the effect cannot be observed in the surrounding code, since the temporary is gone by the end of the statement.Is there a subtlety I'm missing here? Does that ampersand on a temporary convey useful information to an experienced Rust dev? Or is it really just syntactic noise, as it seems to me? Are there corner cases I'm just not considering? Could a future edition of Rust be changed to implicitly borrow from temporaries (like it implicitly borrows to make method calls)? Is my mental model just wrong?To be perfectly clear, this isn't a criticism, just curiosity. Clearly a lot of thought has been put into the language's design and syntax.

Learn MoreIn a new paper, OpenAI researchers detail how they developed an LLM benchmark called SWE-Lancer to test how much foundation models can earn from real-life freelance software engineering tasks. The test found that, while the models can solve bugs, they can’t see why the bug exists and continue to make more mistakes. The researchers tasked three LLMs — OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and Anthropic’s Claude-3.5 Sonnet — with 1,488 freelance software engineer tasks from the freelance platform Upwork amounting to $1 million in payouts. They divided the tasks into two categories: individual contributor tasks (resolving bugs or implementing features), and management tasks (where the model roleplays as a manager who will choose the best proposal to resolve issues). “Results indicate that the real-world freelance work in our benchmark remains challenging for frontier language models,” the researchers write. The test shows that foundation models cannot fully replace human engineers. While they can help solve bugs, they’re not quite at the level where they can start earning freelancing cash by themselves. Benchmarking freelancing modelsThe researchers and 100 other professional software engineers identified potential tasks on Upwork and, without changing any words, fed these to a Docker container to create the SWE-Lancer dataset. The container does not have internet access and cannot access GitHub “to avoid the possible of models scraping code diffs or pull request details,” they explained. The team identified 764 individual contributor tasks, totaling about $414,775, ranging from 15-minute bug fixes to weeklong feature requests. These tasks, which included reviewing freelancer proposals and job postings, would pay out $585,225.The tasks were added to the expensing platform Expensify. The researchers generated prompts based on the task title and description and a snapshot of the codebase. If there were additional proposals to resolve the issue, “we also generated a management task using the issue description and list of proposals,” they explained. From here, the researchers moved to end-to-end test development. They wrote Playwright tests for each task that applies these generated patches which were then “triple-verified” by professional software engineers.“Tests simulate real-world user flows, such as logging into the application, performing complex actions (making financial transactions) and verifying that the model’s solution works as expected,” the paper explains. After running the test, the researchers found that none of the models earned the full $1 million value of the tasks. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the best-performing model, earned only $208,050 and resolved 26.2% of the individual contributor issues. However, the researchers point out, “the majority of its solutions are incorrect, and higher reliability is needed for trustworthy deployment.”The models performed well across most individual contributor tasks, with Claude 3.5-Sonnet performing best, followed by o1 and GPT-4o. “Agents excel at localizing, but fail to root cause, resulting in partial or flawed solutions,” the report explains. “Agents pinpoint the source of an issue remarkably quickly, using keyword searches across the whole repository to quickly locate the relevant file and functions — often far faster than a human would. However, they often exhibit a limited understanding of how the issue spans multiple components or files, and fail to address the root cause, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. We rarely find cases where the agent aims to reproduce the issue or fails due to not finding the right file or location to edit.”Interestingly, the models all performed better on manager tasks that required reasoning to evaluate technical understanding.These benchmark tests showed that AI models can solve some “low-level” coding problems and can’t replace “low-level” software engineers yet. The models still took time, often made mistakes, and couldn’t chase a bug around to find the root cause of coding problems. Many “low-level” engineers work better, but the researchers said this may not be the case for very long. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TwinSong: Jupyter notebook built from scratch in Rust</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iu5tpa/twinsong_jupyter_notebook_built_from_scratch_in/</link><author>/u/winter-moon</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:40:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've spent a lot of time working with Python in Jupyter notebooks, but one thing has always bothered me: the way code and outputs are mixed together.

To address this, I created TwinSong, a Jupyter alternative that separates code and outputs. Right now, it's primarily a UX experiment, but core features like editing and executing cells are already in place. Instead of modifying Jupyter's existing codebase, I built it from scratch with a React frontend and a Rust backend.While performance wasn't the main focus, implementing a Python kernel driver in Rust keeps the kernel clean and avoids loading Python dependencies that might interfere with user code.

It means that you collapse a hidden state that, in theory, has about: (or whatever quant) bits of information to something like:I wonder if it's a good thing (sorry for the naive phrasing). The information used by a transformer to predict the next token is entirely stored in its context window and does not involve any recurrent state. So, predicting the next token of a sequence the transformer was just fed with is going to yield the exact same result as doing so for the same sequence if it were entirely generated by the transformer itself.Fair enough, in some sense: whether the sequence was generated or just read doesn't change anything about what the next token should be.But on the other hand, this approach means that  the information flow between tokens has to happen through the attention mechanism. There's no way for the transformer to embed some nuance or flavor into the predicted token embedding. Like in:"Well, I predicted the token 'When the next token is predicted, this nuance that was likely present in the last hidden state (or even in the softmaxed output probability distribution) is totally lost.So while I was having a little walk yesterday, I was thinking that it might be a good idea to add some information to the token embeddings using something like:augmented_embedding = embedding(token) + F(last_hidden_state)(It would be important to make sure that:‖F(last_hidden_state)‖ ≪ ‖embedding(token)‖I have tried to find papers on this subject and asked for feedback from Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity. told me it was "an incredibly insightful idea." hallucinated a paper on the subject. gave me a very long list of totally unrelated sources.So I'm turning to you guys. I would love it if some big-brained guy told me why other big-brained guys decided not to follow this idea, or why it doesn't work.Here are some things I identified as potentially problematic:Transformers are nice to train with heavy parallelization precisely because they are not recursive. Each sequence of size  can give  independent training examples. Injecting last hidden states' information in token embeddings would break some of that parallelization.It would still be possible to train it efficiently, I guess.First, take the () vanilla sequences and get the predictions.Then, for each prediction, store the last hidden state and update the corresponding token embedding in each of the sequences where it appears.Now, you have a new set of training sequences, with all (but the first) token embeddings updated.You can repeat this process indefinitely. I hope it converges ^^This really looks like a diffusion process, by the way. That brings me to the next point:Here, I am not very competent. What are the conditions that define such a process' stability? My uneducated guess is that if you keep:‖last_hidden_state_contribution‖ ≪ ‖augmented_token_embedding‖ you should not have many problems. But it would also limit the information flow. I guess there's a trade-off, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's not good enough.What do you guys think? Has this already been tried somewhere? Is there a fundamental reason this wouldn't work?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Thoughts on an AI powered bipedal, musculoskeletal , anatomically accurate, synthetic human with over 200 degrees of freedom, over 1,000 Myofibers, and 500 sensors?</title><link>https://v.redd.it/b1iwrsu32cke1</link><author>/u/VivariuM_007</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Announcing Rust 1.85.0 and Rust 2024 | Rust Blog</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html</link><author>/u/slanterns</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:11:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.85.0. This stabilizes the 2024 edition as well.
Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.If you have a previous version of Rust installed via , you can get 1.85.0 with:If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel () or the nightly channel (). Please report any bugs you might come across!We are excited to announce that the Rust 2024 Edition is now stable!
Editions are a mechanism for opt-in changes that may otherwise pose a backwards compatibility risk. See the edition guide for details on how this is achieved, and detailed instructions on how to migrate.This is the largest edition we have released. The edition guide contains detailed information about each change, but as a summary, here are all the changes:The guide includes migration instructions for all new features, and in general
transitioning an existing project to a new edition.
In many cases  can automate the necessary changes. You may even find that no changes in your code are needed at all for 2024!Note that automatic fixes via  are very conservative to avoid ever changing the semantics of your code. In many cases you may wish to keep your code the same and use the new semantics of Rust 2024; for instance, continuing to use the  macro matcher, and ignoring the conversions of conditionals because you want the new 2024 drop order semantics. The result of  should not be considered a recommendation, just a conservative conversion that preserves behavior. people came together to create this edition. We'd like to thank them all for their hard work!Rust now supports asynchronous closures like  which return futures when called. This works like an  which can also capture values from the local environment, just like the difference between regular closures and functions. This also comes with 3 analogous traits in the standard library prelude: , , and .In some cases, you could already approximate this with a regular closure and an asynchronous block, like . However, the future returned by such an inner block is not able to borrow from the closure captures, but this does work with  closures:let mut vec: Vec<String> = vec![];

let closure = async || {
    vec.push(ready(String::from("")).await);
};
It also has not been possible to properly express higher-ranked function signatures with the  traits returning a , but you can write this with the  traits:use core::future::Future;
async fn f<Fut>(_: impl for<'a> Fn(&'a u8) -> Fut)
where
    Fut: Future<Output = ()>,
{ todo!() }

async fn f2(_: impl for<'a> AsyncFn(&'a u8))
{ todo!() }

async fn main() {
    async fn g(_: &u8) { todo!() }
    f(g).await;
    //~^ ERROR mismatched types
    //~| ERROR one type is more general than the other

    f2(g).await; // ok!
}
Hiding trait implementations from diagnosticsThe new #[diagnostic::do_not_recommend] attribute is a hint to the compiler to not show the annotated trait implementation as part of a diagnostic message. For library authors, this is a way to keep the compiler from making suggestions that may be unhelpful or misleading. For example:pub trait Foo {}
pub trait Bar {}

impl<T: Foo> Bar for T {}

struct MyType;

fn main() {
    let _object: &dyn Bar = &MyType;
}
error[E0277]: the trait bound `MyType: Bar` is not satisfied
 --> src/main.rs:9:29
  |
9 |     let _object: &dyn Bar = &MyType;
  |                             ^^^^ the trait `Foo` is not implemented for `MyType`
  |
note: required for `MyType` to implement `Bar`
 --> src/main.rs:4:14
  |
4 | impl<T: Foo> Bar for T {}
  |         ---  ^^^     ^
  |         |
  |         unsatisfied trait bound introduced here
  = note: required for the cast from `&MyType` to `&dyn Bar`
For some APIs, it might make good sense for you to implement , and get  indirectly by that blanket implementation. For others, it might be expected that most users should implement  directly, so that  suggestion is a red herring. In that case, adding the diagnostic hint will change the error message like so:#[diagnostic::do_not_recommend]
impl<T: Foo> Bar for T {}
error[E0277]: the trait bound `MyType: Bar` is not satisfied
  --> src/main.rs:10:29
   |
10 |     let _object: &dyn Bar = &MyType;
   |                             ^^^^ the trait `Bar` is not implemented for `MyType`
   |
   = note: required for the cast from `&MyType` to `&dyn Bar`
 and  for tuplesEarlier versions of Rust implemented convenience traits for iterators of  tuple pairs to behave like , with  in 1.56 and  in 1.79. These have now been  to more tuple lengths, from singleton  through to 12 items long, . For example, you can now use  to fanout into multiple collections at once:use std::collections::{LinkedList, VecDeque};
fn main() {
    let (squares, cubes, tesseracts): (Vec<_>, VecDeque<_>, LinkedList<_>) =
        (0i32..10).map(|i| (i * i, i.pow(3), i.pow(4))).collect();
    println!("{squares:?}");
    println!("{cubes:?}");
    println!("{tesseracts:?}");
}
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
[0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]
[0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561]
Updates to  has been deprecated for years, because it can give surprising results in some Windows configurations if the  environment variable is set (which is not the normal configuration on Windows). We had previously avoided changing its behavior, out of concern for compatibility with code depending on this non-standard configuration. Given how long this function has been deprecated, we're now updating its behavior as a bug fix, and a subsequent release will remove the deprecation for this function.These APIs are now stable in const contextsMany people came together to create Rust 1.85.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you.

code” which lead me to sharing with him one of my more unusual
inspirations: Flamework, a
pseudo framework created at Flickr.Two Passions, Two ApproachesThere are two driving passions in my work.  One is the love of creating
beautiful, elegant code — making Open Source libraries and APIs that focus
on clear design and reusability.  The other passion is building quick,
pragmatic solutions for real users (who may not even be developers).  The
latter usually in a setting of building a product, where the product is
not the code.  Here, speed and iteration matter more than beautiful code
or reusability, because success hinges on shipping something people want.Flamework is in service of the latter, and in crass violation of the
former.Early on, I realized that creating reusable code and directly solving
problems for users are often at odds.  My first clue came when I helped
run the German
ubuntuusers website.  It was powered by
a heavily modified version of phpBB, which despite how messy it was,
scaled to a large user base when patched properly.  It was messy, but easy
to adjust.  The abstractions were one layer deep.Back then, me and a friend tried to replace it by writing my own bulletin
board software, Pocoo.
Working in isolation, without users, led me down a path of
over-engineering.  While we learned a lot and ended up creating popular
Open Source libraries (like Jinja, Werkzeug and Pygments), Pocoo never
became a solid product.  Later, my collaborators and I rebuilt
ubuntuusers, without the
goal of making it into a reusable product.  That rewrite shipped
successfully and it lives to this very day.But it took me years to fully realize what was happening here: reusability
is not that important when you’re building an application, but it’s
crucial when you’re building a library or framework.If you are unfamiliar with Flamework you should watch a talk that Cal
Henderson gave in 2008 at DjangoCon (Why I hate Django).  He talked about scale
and how Django didn't solve for it.  He enumerated all the things
important to him: sharding, using custom sequences for primary keys,
forgoing joins and foreign keys, supporting database replication setups,
denormalizing data to the extreme.  This is also were I first learned
about the possibility of putting all session data into cookies via
signing.  It was a memorable talk for me because it showed me that there
are shortcomings.  Django (which I used for ubuntuusers) had beautiful
APIs but at the time solved for little of that Cal needed.  The talk
really stuck with me.At the time of the talk, Flamework did not really exist.  It was more of
an idea and principles of engineering at Flickr.A few years later, Flamework appeared on GitHub, not as an open-sourced
piece of Flickr code but as a reimplementation of those same ideas.  You
can explore its repository and see code like this:Instinctively it makes me cringe.  Is that a SQL injection?  Well you were
supposed to use the PHP addslashes function
beforehand.  But notice how it caters to sharding and clustering directly
in the query function.Code like this often triggers a visceral reaction, especially in engineers
who prize clean design.How does something like that get created?  Cal Henderson described
Flickr's principle as “doing the dumbest possible thing that will work.”
Maybe “dumb” is too strong — “simple” might be more apt.  Yet simplicity
can look messy to someone expecting a meticulously engineered codebase.
This is not at all uncommon and I have seen it over and over.  The first
large commercial project that got traction that I ever worked on (Plurk) was also pretty pragmatic and
messy inside.  My former colleague Ben Vinegar also recently shared a story of early,
messy FreshBooks code and how he came to terms with it.  Same story at
Sentry.  We moved fast, we made a mess.None of this is surprising in retrospective.  Perfect code doesn't
guarantee success if you haven't solved a real problem for real people.
Pursuing elegance in a vacuum leads to abandoned side projects or
frameworks nobody uses.  By contrast, clunky but functional code often
comes with just the right compromises for quick iteration.  And that in
turn means a lot of messy code powers products that people love —
something that's a far bigger challenge.I have shown Flamework's code to multiple engineers over the years and it
usually creates such a visceral response.  It blind sights one by
seemingly disregarding all rules of good software engineering.That makes Flamework serve as a fascinating Rorschach test for engineers.
Are you looking at it with
admiration for the focus on some critical issues like scale, the built-in
observability and debugging tools.  Or are you judging it, and its
creators, for manually constructing SQL queries, using global variables,
not using classes and looking like messy PHP4 code?  Is it a pragmatic
tool, intentionally designed to iterate quickly at scale, or is it a naive
mess made by unskilled developers?Would I use Flamework?  Hello no.  But I appreciate the priorities behind
it.  If these ugly choices help you move faster, attract users and
validate the product, then a rewrite, or large refactorings later are a
small price to pay.At the end of the day, where you stand on “shitty code” depends on your
primary goal:Are you shipping a product and racing to meet user needs?Or are you building a reusable library or framework meant to stand the
test of time?Both mindsets are valid, but they rarely coexist harmoniously in a single
codebase.  Flamework is a reminder that messy, simple solutions can be
powerful if they solve real problems.  Eventually, when the time is right,
you can clean it up or rebuild from the ground up.The real challenge is deciding which route to take — and when.  Even with
experience, it is can be hard to know when to move from quick fixes to
more robust foundations.  The principles behind Flamework are also
reflected in Sentry's development philosophy.  One more
poignant one being “Embrace the Duct Tape”.  Yet as Sentry matured, much
of our duct tape didn't stand the test of time, and was re-applied at
moments when the real solution would have been a solid foundation poured
with concrete.That's because successful projects eventually grow up.  What let you
iterate fast in the beginning might eventually turn into an unmaintainable
mess and will be rebuilt from the inside out.I personally would never have built Flamework, it repulses me a bit.  At the

Think of it as a fusion of data hoarding, decentralized AI, and resistance tech, built to withstand authoritarian drift and historical revisionism.Maybe it doesn't reach the heights of the corporate or state models, but a system that can always articulate the delta—the difference between a true democratic society (or at least what we seem to be leaving behind) and whatever comes next. If democracy gets twisted into something unrecognizable, this AI should be able to compare, contrast, and remind people what was lost. It should be self-contained, offline-capable, decentralized, and resistant to censorship—an incorruptible witness to history.Does this exist? Are there people in AI, decentralized infrastructure, or archival communities working toward something like this? I don’t want to reinvent the wheel if a community is already building it. If you know of any projects, frameworks, or people tackling this problem, please point me in the right direction.If no one is doing it, shouldn't this be a project people are working on? Is there an assumption that corporate or state controlled AI will do this inherently?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust 2024 Is Coming: baby steps</title><link>https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/02/20/rust-2024-is-coming/?utm_source=atom_feed</link><author>/u/VorpalWay</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:53:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, a little bird told me that Rust 2024 is going to become stable today, along with Rust 1.85.0. In honor of this momentous event, I have penned a little ditty that I’d like to share with you all. Unfortunately, for those of you who remember Rust 2021’s “Edition: The song”, in the 3 years between Rust 2021 and now, my daughter has realized that her father is deeply uncool and so I had to take this one on solo. Anyway, enjoy! Or, you know, suffer. As the case may be.In ChordPro format, for those of you who are inspired to play along.{title: Rust 2024}

{key: C}

[Verse 1]
[C] When I got functions that never return
I write an exclamation point [G]
But use it for an error that could never be
the compiler [C] will yell at me

[Verse 2]
[C] We Rust designers, we want that too
[C7] But we had to make a [F] change
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

[Bridge]
[Am] ... [Am] But will my program [E] build?
[Am] Yes ... oh that’s [D7] for sure
[F] edi-tions [G] are [C] opt in

[Verse 3]
[C] Usually when I return an `impl Trait`
everything works out fine [G]
but sometimes I need a tick underscore
and I don’t really [C] know what that’s for

[Verse 4]
[C] We Rust designers we do agree
[C7] That was con- [F] fusing 
[F] But that will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

[Bridge 2]
[Am] Cargo fix will make the changes
automatically [G] Oh that sure sounds great...
[Am] but wait... [Am] my de-pen-denc-[E]-ies
[Am] Don’t worry e-[D7]ditions
[F] inter [G] oper [C] ate

[Verse 5]
[C] Whenever I match on an ampersand T
The borrow [G] propagates
But where do I put the ampersand
when I want to [C] copy again?

[Verse 6]
[C] We Rust designers, we do agree
[C7] That really had to [F] change
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

[Outro]
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

One more time!

[Half speed]
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

Or have I got something significantly wrong? I guess this is 1000 times more expensive than an API served model like Gemini, and this gap has made me wonder if I am being silly]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I still have these</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1itynca/i_still_have_these/</link><author>/u/emuboy85</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:37:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
