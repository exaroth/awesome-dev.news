I know, I know. They want Kubernetes but they want to keep costs as low as possible, so we've ended up with a single cluster that has all three environments on it - Dev, Staging, Production. The environments have their own namespaces with all their micro-services within that namespace. So far, things seem to be working fine. But the company has started to put a lot more into the pipeline for what they want in this cluster, and I can quickly see this becoming trouble. I've made the plea previously to have different clusters for each environment, and it was shot down. However, now that complexity has increased, I'm tempted to make the argument again. We currently have about 40 pods per environment under average load.

A reiserfs comparison... Not sure how I feel about that one :)
First: any project can look like chaos from afar. You have to dig deeper, understand the project priorities and if they're executing on those priorities.
With reiserfs, reiserfs3 wasn't exactly known for robustness (speed yes, but there were known issues with repair) and I never got the impression reiserfs4 was focused on fixing those - I did hear about a lot of cool ambitious features they wanted to do, though!
In contrast, bcachefs was started after the core - btree, IO paths were done, deployed and stable. And while it does have an ambitious featureset, the scope of that featureset was frozen years ago.
It's also had users since before it went upstream; I did not submit it until it was looking stable for the userbase it had at the time. But of course that was not the end of stabilization and hardening; filesystems (especially today) are massive, so we need to do a gradual rollout, at every step learning more about what can go wrong, fixing the issues the current userbase is finding, and making sure that stabilization is keeping up with growing deployment.
If we look back at the past two years of development, we also see that there hasn't exactly been a ton in the way of feature work: what feature work has happened has been limited in scope based on user feedback, things that were already planned and in the works, or scalability work. (There are now many bcachefs users with 100+ TB filesystems, and I think I can confidently say that we're good on scalability for now).
The majority of the development time has gone to debugging, hardening, new debugging tools and better logging (you can't debug what you can't see and understand), and a lot of work on repair as we discover and learn how to cope with new failure modes.
- 6.7 (immediately prior to merge): upgrade/downgrade mechanisms, modern versioning (we don't do really do feature bits like other filesystems, we version everything, our forwards/backwards compatibility mechanisms are really nice; that made everything that came after much smoother (or even possible))
- 6.8: per-device vector clocks, for split brain detection
- 6.9: repair by btree node scan, per-device superblock bitmaps of "ranges with btree nodes" to make btree node scan practical on large filesystems. (This one was motivated by reiserfs, but with a lot of lessons learned so that it works reliably - even if you've got a bcachefs image file on your filesystem).
- 6.11: disk accounting rewrite - this was a multi year project started before bcachefs was merged, which made our accounting extensible and scalable (it was fast before, but not extensible); this enabled e.g. per-snapshot accounting (not yet exposed).
- 6.12 or .13? - reflink improvements (the ability to put indirect extents in an error state), to ensure that transient errors don't cause data loss
- 6.14: major scalability work for backpointers check/repair, in response to larger and large filesystems becoming commonplace - this required an expensive and disruptive on disk format upgrade, but now we're good to 10+ PB, tested.
- 6.15: scalability work for device removal, snapshots removal: again done in response to actual usage
- 6.15: more hardening against actual IO/checksum errors, in the data move path (extent poisoning; this generated a kerfuffle among the block layer people - "you want to do WHAT with FUA?" "it says it right here in the spec" (and we've since determined that yes, read fua does work as advertised on scsi hard drives, anyone's guess what nvme devices are doing).
- 6.16: major logging improvements for data read errors, btree node read errors, and errors that trigger repair: grouping all errors and repair actions into a single error message, so we can follow the sequence of events
Through it all, lots of lots of end user support and bug fixing. I am perpetually telling users: "I don't care what broke or why, if you think it was the hardware's fault or pebcak - get me a metadata dump, get me the info I need, we'll get it working again and make it more robust for everyone."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hi guys I am getting timeout issue whenever I run exec or logs or top but when I run get it is working. fine.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lqiz9t/hi_guys_i_am_getting_timeout_issue_whenever_i_run/</link><author>/u/Chameleon_The</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 06:57:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have like eks cluster there is 1 worker node when I try to use exec intothiss pod that is present in this pod it is throwing timeout, I am able to get pods only no exec no logs I checked TCP dump I am able to see the req from the apiserver buyt no response from the kubelet I.want to know it is an issue with kubelet ornetworks issue.   submitted by    /u/Chameleon_The ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JavaScript™ Trademark Update</title><link>https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle4</link><author>/u/LawfulKitten98</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 04:59:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On June 18, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB)

I'm genuinely surprised to be even more optimistic now than before. The coding part was much easier than I imagined, thanks to the use of reference counting in the kernel.And the promised benefits of Rust over C? They're absolutely real. The Rust version of the driver feels way more robust than the C code, not just regarding memory safety. It didn't have a single bug: Once it compiled, it worked. That's not a huge deal considering it was a direct rewrite, but it counts for something.Despite a lamentable lack of suggestions, llogiq is reasonably pleased with his choice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Looking for shared auth solution for personal projects</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lqdbdq/looking_for_shared_auth_solution_for_personal/</link><author>/u/belak51</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 01:39:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The short version is that I've got a bunch of small personal projects I'd like to build but they all need some sort of login system. I'm very familiar with the concepts and I could definitely build a simple version for one project, but I'm a bit at a loss for how to share it with other projects.Specifically, there's not a great way to have separate components which integrate with a migration system because most systems are designed around having a linear set of migrations, not multiple which get merged together. Before Go my background was in Python/Django where it was expected that you'd have multiple packages integrated in your app and they'd all provide certain routes and potentially migrations scoped to that package.Even most recommended solutions like scs are only half of the solution, and dealing with the complete end to end flow gets to be a fairly large solution, especially if you end up integrating with OIDC.Am I missing something obvious? Is there a better way other than copying the whole thing between projects and merging all the migrations with your project's migrations? That doesn't seem very maintainable because making a bug fix with one would require copying it to all of your separate projects.If anyone has library recomendations, framework recommendations, or even just good ways for sharing the implementation between separate projects that would be amazing. Bonus points if you can share the user database between projects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Year of the Linux Desktop?

I haven't received any job offerings yet, so for the past month I've been focusing my time on building this project to get more practical experience and have something solid to talk about in interviews.As I've been interested in distributed systems recently, I decided to build a simple Distributed File System from scratch using Go.The architecture is split into three services that talk to each other over gRPC:Coordinator: This is the controller node. It manages all the file metadata (like filenames and chunk lists), tracks which datanodes are alive via heartbeats, and tells the client which nodes to talk to for file operations.Datanodes: These are simple storage nodes. Their main job is to store file chunks and serve them to clients via streams.Client: The interface for interacting with the system. The main features are file upload, download, and replication. Here's the basic flow:When you want to upload a file, the client first contacts the coordinator. The coordinator then determines where each chunk of the file should be stored given some selection algorithm (right now it just picks nodes with status: healthy) and returns this list of locations to the client. The client then streams the chunks directly to the assigned datanodes in parallel. Once a datanode receives a chunk, it runs a checksum and sends an acknowledgment back to the client, if it is a primary node (meaning it was the first to receive the chunk), it replicates the chunk to other datanodes, only after all replicates are stored the system returns a confirmation to the client. After all chunks are successfully stored and replicated, the client sends a confirmation back to the coordinator so that it can commit all the chunk storage locations in metadata tracker.Downloads work in reverse: the client asks the coordinator for a file's locations, and then reaches out to the datanodes, who stream each chunk to the client. The client assembles the file in place by using a temp file and seeking to the correct offset by using the chunksize and index.To make sure everything works together, I also built out a full end-to-end test environment using Docker that spins up the coordinator and multiple datanodes to simulate a small cluster. In the latest PR, I also added unit tests to most of the core components. This is all automated with Github Actions on every PR or commit to main.I'd really appreciate any feedback, since I am still trying to get a position, I would like to know what you think my current level is, I am applying for both Jr and mid-level positions but it has been really difficult to get anything, I have reviewed my CV too many times for that to be an issue, I've also asked for the help of other engineers I know for their input and they thought it was fine. I think that it is the lack of work experience that is making it very hard, so I also have a personal projects section in there, where I list out these kinds of projects to prove that I actually know some stuff. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It finally came!!</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lq7j7l/it_finally_came/</link><author>/u/Agitatedndustry916</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 21:13:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Any professional rust folks get leetcoded in rust when interviewing?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lq7h2b/any_professional_rust_folks_get_leetcoded_in_rust/</link><author>/u/Willing_Sentence_858</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 21:10:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[any professional rust folks get leetcoded in rust when interviewing -- rust is rather difficult here but not impossible ... i wouldn't be surprised cognitively is 4x as much effort leetcoding then say python.i need a new job and i don't know if i should just be leetcoding in python ...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>git-go: Git written in Go (sort of)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lq72go/gitgo_git_written_in_go_sort_of/</link><author>/u/unknown_r00t</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 20:54:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just finished a little side project:  - a basic Git implementation in Go.Got the essentials working: , , , , , and .

Single Sign-On (SSO) plays a crucial role in achieving this, allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. Keycloak, a powerful open-source Identity and Access Management solution, makes it easy to integrate various identity providers.This article will walk you through the process of setting up Google as an identity provider in Keycloak, enabling your users to log in using their existing Google accounts. We’ll be using Keycloak version 26.2.0 for this demonstration.Before we begin, ensure you have:A running Keycloak instance (version 26.2.0 or compatible).Administrative access to your Keycloak realm.A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.The first step is to configure a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID in your Google Cloud Project. This will allow Keycloak to communicate with Google for authentication.Navigate to Google Cloud Console: Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com). If you don’t have a project, create a new one. In the left-hand navigation pane, search for “APIs & Services” and then click on “Credentials.” Click on “Create credentials” at the top of the page. From the dropdown, choose “OAuth client ID.”Configure Consent Screen (if not already done): If this is your first time creating an OAuth client ID in this project, you might be prompted to configure the OAuth consent screen. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your application’s name, user support email, and developer contact information. Select “Web application” as the application type. Give your OAuth 2.0 client a descriptive name, e.g., “.”Add Authorized Redirect URIs: This is a crucial step. You need to tell Google where to redirect users after they successfully authenticate. The Redirect URI for Keycloak’s Google Identity Provider will typically be in the format: http://localhost:8080/realms/<your-realm-name>/broker/google/endpoint This endpoint can be fetched from the keycloak page which we will cover in the later part of the article. Click the “Create” button.Note Down Client ID and Client Secret: After creation, a pop-up will display your  and . Copy these values immediately and store them securely. You will need them in Keycloak.Now, let’s configure Keycloak to use the Google OAuth client you just created. In the top-left corner, ensure you have selected the realm where you want to enable Google SSO.Navigate to Identity Providers: In the left-hand menu, under “Configure,” click on “Identity providers.”4 . Copy the Redirect URI: On the “Add Google provider” page, locate the “Redirect URI” field. This is the exact URL you need to ensure is present and correct in your Google OAuth client settings. Copy it now if you need to update it in Google.5. Paste Client ID and Client Secret: Paste the  you obtained from Google Cloud Platform. Paste the  you obtained from Google Cloud Platform. (e.g., ) and  (e.g., ) will usually be pre-filled appropriately. Do not click “Add” yet if you plan to immediately configure the flow. You can save it now and come back, or proceed to flow creation if you’re comfortable. For now, let’s assume you’ve just pasted the credentials.Keycloak uses “flows” to define the authentication process. Creating a custom flow for your social logins is highly recommended, as it allows you to control how new users are handled and attributes are mapped.Navigate to Authentication: In the left-hand menu, under “Configure,” click on “Authentication.” Go to the “Flows” tab and click the “Create flow” button. Give your new flow a descriptive name, for example, .You can add an optional description.Keep the “Flow type” as “Basic flow.”Add Executions to the Flow: Click on your newly created  to configure its steps. These executions ensure a seamless user experience by detecting and automatically linking existing users.Select “Detect existing broker user” and set its “Requirement” to “Required.” This step checks if the user already exists in Keycloak based on the email provided by Google.Click “Add execution” again.Select “Automatically set existing user” and set its “Requirement” to “Required.” If an existing user is detected, this step automatically links the social login to that Keycloak user.Now, you need to tell Keycloak to use your newly created flow for Google logins.Navigate back to Identity Providers: In the left-hand menu, under “Configure,” click on “Identity providers.” Click on the “Google” provider you configured earlier. Toggle the “Trust Email” parameter to “On.” This tells Keycloak to trust the email address provided by Google as verified.Set “First login flow override”: Scroll down to the “First login flow override” dropdown and select your custom flow (e.g., ). This ensures that when a new user logs in via Google for the first time, Keycloak uses your defined flow.6.  and your google login is ready to be used.Let’s verify that your Google Single Sign-On integration is working as expected.Locate the Google Login Option: You should now see a “Google” button or link on the login screen, typically below the standard username/password fields. Click on the “Google” button.Google Authentication Prompt: You will be redirected to Google’s authentication page. If you’re already signed into a Google account, it might prompt you to confirm the sign-in for the application you’ve configured (Keycloak). If not, you’ll be asked to enter your Google credentials.Successful Login and Redirection: After successful authentication with Google, you will be redirected back to your Keycloak application. You should now be logged into the system, and your Keycloak account will be connected to your Google identity provider profile.nd there you have it! You’ve successfully enabled Google Single Sign-On with Keycloak.

Having organized conferences for over seven years with a primary focus on cloud-native and Kubernetes topics, I’ve often found that most sessions are highly technical. This made me especially happy to learn more about the importance of this technology and how it all started.These are my key takeaways from the session:Today, Kubernetes is a cornerstone of cloud-native applications. It has become an essential tool for developers and companies worldwide.But… How did it start gaining traction?Kelsey Hightower played a crucial role in driving Kubernetes adoption and community growth from the early days.When questioned about the beginning of his journey with Kubernetes, Kelsey attributes it to a stroke of luck.While working at CoreOS, Kelsey was contacted by Google for their announcement of the release of Kubernetes. Recognizing the potential of this project, Kelsey quickly made Kubernetes run on CoreOS and prepared a detailed tutorial on how to do it. The next day, this tutorial became even more popular than Google’s announcement on Hacker News. This was an early indication that simple guides could be a powerful tool to drive Kubernetes’ adoption.Kelsey realized early on that Kubernetes solved a challenge that companies and system architects had been struggling with for a long time. This realization motivated him to start contributing independently to the project, even before CoreOS officially supported it. Like other passionate community members, Kelsey started contributing on nights and weekends, driven by his genuine interest in building a useful tool for the whole community.The turning point for KubernetesFor Kelsey, the moment when it became clear that Kubernetes was going to be the future was when Microsoft announced its support. Soon after, all the big vendors followed, solidifying the project’s status as the future of cloud infrastructure.Despite his conviction about Kubernetes’ potential from the start, Kelsey couldn’t have predicted it would become such a cornerstone for the cloud-native community. In fact, Kelsey initially approached Kubernetes as a fun, interesting project, which he wanted to share with the community.In his early talks, Kelsey would simply (and enthusiastically) explain how Kubernetes worked, breaking down the difficult components into easy-to-grasp concepts. Eventually, his enthusiasm and approachable style ignited a spark that encouraged the community to not just adopt Kubernetes, but to actively contribute to its development.While some players focused on building up credibility through white papers and highly technical content, Kelsey chose an educational path. By breaking down complex concepts into accessible information, and meeting people where they were in terms of knowledge, Kelsey gradually managed to build momentum and encourage more community involvement. This approach not only allowed the community to truly understand the technology, but it also inspired many to become contributors themselves.Kelsey’s educational approach, combined with his previous contributions to the open-source community, allowed him to lend some of his own credibility to Kubernetes, which further fueled the project’s growth.As it turns out - there was no master plan to grow Kubernetes. Instead, it was Kelsey’s accessible, educational approach that inspired a whole community to collectively build what is now a cornerstone of cloud computing.In essence, from my personal perspective after watching this talk, the secret to Kubernetes’ success can be summarized in three elements: demystifying complex concepts, an engaged community, and, as always, a dash of luck.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to handle pre-merge testing without spinning up a full Kubernetes environment</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lq4op5/how_to_handle_premerge_testing_without_spinning/</link><author>/u/krazykarpenter</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 19:17:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to share a pattern our team has been refining and get your thoughts, because I know the pain of testing microservices on Kubernetes is real.For the longest time, the default was either a perpetually broken, shared "staging" or trying to spin up an entire environment replica for every PR. The first creates bottlenecks, and the second is slow and gets expensive fast, especially as your app grows.We've been exploring a different approach: using a service mesh (Istio, linkerd etc) to create lightweight,  ephemeral environments within a single, shared cluster.You deploy  the one or two services they've changed into the shared dev/staging cluster.When you (or a CI job) run a test, a unique HTTP header (e.g., x-sandbox-id: my-feature-test) is injected into the initial request.The service mesh's routing rules are configured to inspect this header. If it sees the header, it routes the request to the new version of the service.As that service makes downstream calls, the header is propagated, so the entire request path for that specific test is correctly routed through any other modified services that are part of that test. If a service in the chain wasn't modified, the request simply falls back to the stable baseline version.This gives an isolated test context that only exists for the life of that request, without duplicating the whole stack. I'm a co-founder at Signadot, and we've built our product around this concept. We actually just hit a 1.0 release with our Kubernetes Operator, which now supports Istio's new Ambient Mesh. It’s pretty cool to see this pattern work in a sidecar-less world, which makes the whole setup even more lightweight on the cluster.Whether you're trying to build something similar in-house with Istio, Linkerd, or even just advanced Ingress rules, I'd be happy to share our learnings and exchange notes.

Maven projects could inherit  repositories from dependencies without the developer even realizing it. It meant you could write a perfectly secure POM — and still get compromised.My colleague at Gradle, Cédric Champeau, authored a proof-of-concept, and I submitted it while engaging in the back-and-forth disclosure process with the Apache Security Team and the Maven PMC. The back-and-forth stretched across . Emails went unanswered. Conversations stalled. Multiple reminders were sent. At one point, I had to loop in CERT/CC to escalate.Meanwhile, I wrote code to scan the entire Maven Central index — parsing  to identify real-world usage and generate a list of affected coordinates. The results were staggering. Over  libraries were affected. Mend later published a public write-up summarizing the issue and its implications, which you can read here: Maven Security Vulnerability: CVE-2021–26291.Eventually, after significant pressure — and after weeks of unanswered emails, stalled conversations, and repeated follow-ups — I wrote to the ASF security team:“What fundamentally disturbs me here is that all of us as individuals, and the companies we work for… all play a critical role in protecting the supply chain of the JVM ecosystem. To that end, we’ve all failed in some way here… This game of ‘not my problem, it’s yours’ does nothing to protect users.”I believed this issue was real. And someone had to push to get it fixed.CERT/CC eventually threatened to go over the Apache Security Team’s head and issue a CVE for the unpatched vulnerability. This threat finally spurred the Apache Maven team into action. Apache Maven issued  and shipped a fix in version 3.8.1, changing the default behavior to block HTTP repository resolution.This was a hard-fought win — and one that highlighted just how difficult it can be to drive coordinated change even when the risk is well-documented and easily fixed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ZLUDA update Q2 2025 - bigger team, more groundwork, less bugs</title><link>https://vosen.github.io/ZLUDA/blog/zluda-update-q2-2025/</link><author>/u/vosen_l</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 17:39:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>k3s in dual-stack no ipv6</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lq2365/k3s_in_dualstack_no_ipv6/</link><author>/u/G4rp</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 17:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm trying to building an on-prem dual-stack cluster with my RPi 5 for learning new stuff.I'm currently working with ULA address space, to all my node is assigned an ipv6 address:2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER\_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo\_fast state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether d8:3a:XX:XX:65:XX brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.14.3/26 brd 192.168.14.63 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0 valid\_lft 909sec preferred\_lft 909sec inet6 fd12:3456:789a:14:3161:c474:a553:4ea1/64 scope global noprefixroute valid\_lft forever preferred\_lft forever inet6 fe80::98e6:ad86:53e5:ad64/64 scope link noprefixroute valid\_lft forever preferred\_lft forever There's no way that K3s will recognise it:kubectl get node cow -o json | jq '.status.addresses' [ { "address": "192.168.14.3", "type": "InternalIP" }, { "address": "XXX", "type": "Hostname" } ] And conseguence also Cilium:time=2025-07-02T17:20:25.905770868Z level=info msg="Received own node information from API server" module=agent.controlplane.daemon nodeName=XXX labels="map[beta.kubernetes.io/arch:arm64 beta.kubernetes.io/os:linux kubernetes.io/arch:arm64 kubernetes.io/hostname:XXX kubernetes.io/os:linux node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:true node-role.kubernetes.io/master:true]" ipv4=192.168.14.3 ipv6="" v4Prefix=10.42.1.0/24 v6Prefix=fd22:2025:6a6a:42::100/120 k8sNodeIP=192.168.14.3 I'm installing my cluster with those switches: --cluster-cidr=10.42.0.0/16,fd22:2025:6a6a:42::/104 --service-cidr=10.43.0.0/16,fd22:2025:6a6a:43::/112 --kube-controller-manager-arg=node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6=120 also tried with  but no way :(]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Code Your Own Desktop GUI App With Rust Iced Crate</title><link>https://youtu.be/2CQ4hLB2IMw</link><author>/u/JonkeroTV</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 17:25:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to write Rust in the Linux kernel: part 1</title><link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1024202/16bb2f1e0d67bb32/</link><author>/u/CrankyBear</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 17:12:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The Linux kernel is seeing a steady accumulation of Rust code. As it becomes
more prevalent, maintainers may want to know how to read, review, and test the
Rust code that relates to their areas of expertise. Just as kernel C code is
different from user-space C code, so too is kernel Rust code somewhat different
from user-space Rust code. That fact makes Rust's

extensive documentation of
less use than it otherwise would be, and means that potential contributors with
user-space experience will need some additional instruction.
This article is the first in a multi-part series aimed at helping existing
kernel contributors become familiar with Rust, and helping existing Rust
programmers become familiar with what the kernel does differently from the
typical Rust project.

In order to
lay the groundwork for the rest of the articles in this series, this
first article gives a high-level overview of installing and configuring Rust
tooling, as well as an explanation of how Rust fits into the kernel's existing
build system. Future articles will cover how Rust fits into the kernel's
maintainership model, what goes into writing a driver in Rust, the design of the
Rust interfaces to the rest of the kernel, and hints about specific things to
look for when reviewing Rust code.

While support for Rust on GCC is

catching up, and the  code generation backend is
now capable of compiling the Rust components of the kernel,
the Rust for Linux project currently only supports building with plain .
Since  uses LLVM, the project also recommends building the kernel
as a whole with Clang while working on Rust code (although mixing GCC on the C
side and LLVM on the Rust side does work).
The build also requires

bindgen to build the C/Rust API bindings, and
a copy of the Rust standard library so that it can be built with the flags that
the kernel requires. Building the kernel in the recommended way therefore requires Clang,
lld, LLVM, the Rust compiler, the source form of the Rust standard library, and
bindgen, at a minimum.

Many Linux distributions package
sufficiently current versions of all of these; the
Rust quick start documentation
gives distribution-specific installation instructions. The minimum version of
 required is 1.78.0, released in May 2024. The Rust for Linux
project has committed to not raising the minimum required version unnecessarily.
According to Miguel Ojeda,
the current informal plan is to stick with the version included in Debian
stable, once that catches up with the current minimum (likely later this year).

Developers working on Rust should probably also install

Clippy (Rust's linter),

rustdoc (Rust's documentation building tool),
and

rust-analyzer (the Rust

language server), but these are not strictly required. The Rust for Linux
project tries to keep the code free of linter warnings, so patches that
introduce new warnings may be frowned upon by maintainers.
Invoking  in the root of the kernel source
will check that the necessary tools have compatible versions installed.
Indeed, all the commands discussed here should be run from the root of the
repository.
The  command will set
up configuration files for rust-analyzer that should allow it to work seamlessly
with an editor that has language server support, such as Emacs or Vim.

Rust code is controlled by two separate kernel configuration values.
 is automatically set when compatible tooling
is available;  (available under "General Setup → Rust
support") controls whether any Rust code is actually built, and depends on the
first option. Unlike the vast majority of user-space Rust projects, the kernel
does not use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool. Instead, the kernel's
makefiles directly invoke the Rust compiler in the same way they would a C
compiler. So adding an
object to the correct make target is all that is needed to build a Rust module:
    obj-$(CONFIG_RUST) += object_name.o

The code directly enabled by  is largely the support code
and bindings between C and Rust, and is therefore not a representative sample of
what most Rust driver code actually looks like. Enabling the Rust sample code
(under "Kernel hacking → Sample kernel code → Rust samples") may provide a more
representative sample.

Rust's testing and linting tools have also been integrated into the kernel's

existing build system. To run Clippy, add  to the
 invocation; this performs a special build of the kernel with
debugging options enabled that make it unsuitable for production use,
and so should be done with care.
 will build a local copy of the Rust documentation, which
also checks for some documentation warnings, such as missing documentation
comments or malformed intra-documentation links.
The tests can be run with
, the kernel's white-box unit-testing tool. The tool does
need additional arguments to set the necessary configuration variables for a
Rust build:
    ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --make_options LLVM=1 \
        --kconfig_add CONFIG_RUST=y --arch=<host architecture>

Actually locating a failing test case could trip up people familiar with KUnit
tests, though.
Unlike the kernel's C code, which typically has KUnit tests written in separate files,
Rust code tends to have tests in the same file as the code that it is testing.
The convention is to use a separate

Rust module to keep the test code out of
the main namespace (and enable conditional compilation, so it's not included in
release kernels). This module is often (imaginatively) called "test", and must
be annotated with the  macro.
That macro is implemented in
; it looks through the
annotated module for functions marked with  and sets up the
needed C declarations for KUnit to automatically recognize the test cases.

Rust does have another kind of test that doesn't correspond directly to a C unit
test, however. A "doctest" is a test embedded in the documentation of a
function, typically showing how the function can be used. Because it is a real
test, a doctest can be relied upon to
remain current in a way that a mere example may not. Additionally, doctests are
rendered as part of the automatically generated

Rust API documentation.
Doctests run as part of the KUnit test suite as well, but must be specifically
enabled (under "Kernel hacking → Rust hacking → Doctests for the `kernel` crate").

An example of a function with a doctest (lightly reformatted from the Rust

string helper functions) looks like this:
    /// Strip a prefix from `self`. Delegates to [`slice::strip_prefix`].
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use kernel::b_str;
    /// assert_eq!(
    ///     Some(b_str!("bar")),
    ///     b_str!("foobar").strip_prefix(b_str!("foo"))
    /// );
    /// assert_eq!(
    ///     None,
    ///     b_str!("foobar").strip_prefix(b_str!("bar"))
    /// );
    /// assert_eq!(
    ///     Some(b_str!("foobar")),
    ///     b_str!("foobar").strip_prefix(b_str!(""))
    /// );
    /// assert_eq!(
    ///     Some(b_str!("")),
    ///     b_str!("foobar").strip_prefix(b_str!("foobar"))
    /// );
    /// ```
    pub fn strip_prefix(&self, pattern: impl AsRef<Self>) -> Option<&BStr> {
        self.deref()
            .strip_prefix(pattern.as_ref().deref())
            .map(Self::from_bytes)
    }

Normal

comments in Rust code begin with . Documentation
comments, which are processed by various tools, start with  (to
comment on the following item) or  (to comment on the containing
item). These are equivalent:
    /// Documentation
    struct Name {
        ...
    }

    struct Name {
        //! Documentation
        ...
    }

Documentation comments are analogous to the specially formatted
 comments used in the kernel's C code. In this doctest, the
 macro (an example of the
other kind of macro invocation in Rust) is used
to compare the return value of the  method to what it
should be.
# Check Rust tools are installed
make rustavailable
# Build kernel with Rust enabled
# (After customizing .config)
make LLVM=1
# Run tests
./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py \
  run \
  --make_options LLVM=1 \
  --kconfig_add CONFIG_RUST=y \
  --arch=<host architecture>
# Run linter
make LLVM=1 CLIPPY=1
# Check documentation
make rustdoc
# Format code
make rustfmt

Finally, Rust code can also include

kernel selftests, the kernel's third way to
write tests. These need to be configured on an individual basis, using the
kernel-configuration snippets in the  directory.
Kselftests are intended to be run on a machine booted with the corresponding
kernel, and can be run with .

Rust's syntax is complex. This has been one of several sticking points in
adoption of the language, since people often feel that it makes the language
difficult to read. That problem cannot wholly be solved with formatting tools,
but they do help. Rust's canonical formatting tool is called ,
and if it is installed, it can be run with  to reformat all
the Rust code in the kernel.

Building and testing Rust code is necessary, but not
sufficient, to review Rust code. It may be enough to get one started
experimenting with the existing Rust code in the kernel, however.
Next up, we will
will do an in-depth comparison between a simple driver module and its Rust
equivalent, as an introduction to the kernel's Rust driver abstractions.

I had a really basic misunderstanding of how the UI works. I was under the impression that the UI pod served static assets, and then the browser talked to the backend through an ingress.This isn’t the case. The UI pod serves the assets and proxies the requests to the cluster, so the backend pod does not need to be exposed. While it would help if the backend pod could be secured, it doesn’t need to be exposed anywhere but cluster local. I really want to like longhorn! I’ve used for a bit and it’s so nice. Unfortunately, this issue: https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/discussions/3031 is just totally unaddressed. You literally can’t add basic auth to the service or pod. You CAN add auth to the UI, but if my longhorn API is exposed to my home network (and you have to, for an out of cluster device like my iPad web browser to talk to the API), an attacker who’s compromised my home network can just raw http call the backend and delete volumes.Am I missing something? Is this not a totally blocking security issue? I could just be totally misunderstanding - in fact, I hope I am!Does anyone know any software that does similar things to longhorn? I really like how you can backup to s3, that’s my primary usecase. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Feel Like a Full Member Now</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lpx8mx/feel_like_a_full_member_now/</link><author>/u/Terrible-Mobile2211</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 14:26:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A little context, I started to use linux VM's starting in 2021 for various things.

We first connected with Sharon after his widely shared write-up, How I Made 64k From Deleted Files, where he used TruffleHog to uncover high-value secrets in public GitHub repositories. In this follow-up, Sharon expanded his research to access 100% of deleted commits on GitHub. He takes a deeper dive into one of our favorite areas: secrets hidden in deleted GitHub commits.What Does it Mean to Delete a Commit?Finding all Deleted CommitsHunting for Impactful SecretsCase Study - Preventing a Massive Supply-Chain CompromiseMy name is Sharon Brizinov, and while I usually focus on low-level vulnerability and exploitation research in OT/IoT devices, I occasionally dive into bug bounty hunting.I recently published a blog post about uncovering secrets hidden in dangling blobs within GitHub repositories, which sparked quite a lively discussion. After the post, I had several conversations with various people including Dylan, the CEO of Truffle Security, who gave me some intriguing ideas for continuing to explore new methods for large-scale secret hunting. I decided to create a mind map with everything I know related to this topic and try to come up with a new idea. I’ll spare you my messy sketch, but here’s a roundup of the projects, blogs, ideas, and resources I zeroed in on (highly recommended):Hidden GitHub Commits and How to Reveal Them by Neodyme.ioAnyone can Access Deleted and Private Repository Data on GitHub by TruffleHogTruffleHog now finds all Deleted & Private Commits on GitHub by TruffleHogTruffleHog Scans Deleted Git Branches by TruffleHogPhantom Secrets: Undetected Secrets Expose Major Corporations by Aqua SecurityEventually, I came up with a simple idea - I will use the Github Event API alongside the GitHub Archive project to scan all Zero-Commit Push-Events (deleted commits) for secrets. Everything was known, I just glued it together and built automation at scale that hunted for secrets.In this blog, I will describe my journey from understanding why you can never really delete a commit in GitHub to how to find all of them and build automation around it.What Does it Mean to Delete a Commit?In my previous blog post, I discussed how I discovered supposedly deleted files within GitHub repositories. Specifically, I was able to reconstruct dangling blobs - objects that had been deleted and were no longer referenced by any commit or tree… Or so I thought. After chatting with the Truffle folks, it turns out these orphaned blobs actually had orphaned commits that went along with them. And with a little research, I was able to uncover 100% of those orphaned commits at scale, across all of GitHub. Suppose you’ve accidentally committed and pushed a secret to your repository. What’s the next step? Typically, you’d want to reset the HEAD to the previous commit and force-push the changes, effectively removing the current commit and making it unreferenced - essentially deleting it. Here’s how you do it:But as neodyme and TruffleHog discovered, even when a commit is deleted from a repository, GitHub never forgets. If you know the full commit hash, you can access the supposedly deleted content. Moreover, you don't even need the full commit has, as TruffleHog discovered - it's enough to brute-force just the first four hex-digits.Force Pushing: A TutorialLet’s see this in action using my own repository: test-oops-commit. Try to locate the deleted commit - 9eedfa00983b7269a75d76ec5e008565c2eff2ef. To help visualize our commits, I prepared a simple bash script that shows the commit-tree-blob objects, :- -- | - - | - -We start by creating a simple repository with a single commit (a  file):Next, we create a new file named  containing our secret . We accidentally commit and push our secret to GitHub.We look at the commit tree to see that we have a new commit … which is associated with a new tree and a new blob for the file . We see the same when we run , , or when we access it from the web on GitHub.Oops! We discover our mistake and delete the commit by moving the HEAD of the branch to the previous commit and force-push it using:Let's remove our local version of the repo, clone the repository again, and check the commit tree. Phew, no secrets; the commit was really deleted!But we remember the commit hash, we we check online on GitHub and the commit can still be accessed - 9eedfa00983b7269a75d76ec5e008565c2eff (even accessing using four hex digits is enough 9eef). However, this time we get a message saying that the commit is deleted or doesn't belong to any branch on this repository. When you force-push after resetting (aka  followed by ), you remove Git’s reference to that commit from your branch, effectively making it unreachable through normal Git navigation (like ). However, the commit is still accessible on GitHub because GitHub stores these reflogs. Why? I don’t know for sure, but GitHub does give some hints. As I see it, GitHub is a much more complex beast than just a git server. It has many layers, including pull-requests, forks, private-public settings, and more. My guess is that to support all of these features, GitHub stores all commits and never deletes them. Here are some cases to consider:What are pull requests? These are just temporary branches, as Aqua Security wrote about, and can be retrieved by fetching all refs using -git -c "remote.origin.fetch=+refs/*:refs/remotes/origin/*" fetch originHow does the GitHub fork network work? What happens when you “fork” a repository? All the data is replicated, including commits you might delete.For these cases, and probably many others too (auditing? monitoring?) Github stores all the commits and won’t delete them, even if you force-push the head and “delete” the commit.OK, so commits are not really deleted. Fine. But you’d still need to know the full commit hash, or at least the first four hex-digits ignoring collisions (). As it turns out, TruffleHog has a tool to do just that, but it’s very slow, as you can imagine, going through all those. It doesn’t scale well beyond taking a day or two on a single repo.But there’s another way. A faster way, I’m now happy to share with you. The GitHub Event API is part of GitHub's REST API, which allows users to retrieve information about events that occur within GitHub. Events represent various activities in GitHub, such as:Opening or closing issues or pull requestsNo API token or auth is needed!You can see all the events that GitHub supports here.Events are recorded in near-real-time, but may be delayed by a few seconds.It’s only for public repositories.So, we could monitor commit data for all GitHub public repositories and store all the hashes. No more guessing commit hashes! Yeah, but it’s way too much. We are talking about millions of events per hour, and what about past events? Are they lost?Luckily for us a great developer named Ilya Grigorik decided many years ago to start a project that listens to GitHub’s event stream and systematically archives it. The project is open-source and called GH Archive and the website is gharchive.org. So, if we want, for example, to get the entire GitHub public activity around Jan 1st at 3pm UTC we just download this from here: https://data.gharchive.org/2015-01-01-15.json.gz.Here is a random sample of a  from that  archive:Finding Force Push Deleted CommitsTo identify only the deleted commits from force push events, we can look for push events that contain zero commits. Why would a Git push event have no commits? It indicates a force push that resets the branch - essentially just moving the HEAD without adding any new commits! I call this an  or a .Let’s see a quick example. We will download a random archive and search for such an event.If we randomly select one of the target event types, we will see that the  array is empty (zero commits). And if we look at the  commit - the one that was “deleted” (the HEAD before moving to HEAD^1, which is the “after”) - we see that Github still holds a record of it 10 years later!Here it is - https://github.com/grapefruit623/gcloud-python/commit/e9c3d31212847723aec86ef96aba0a77f9387493And it’s not necessarily just the  commit that was deleted. Sometimes a force push overwrites many commits at once. Given a Github organization (or user), repo name, and commit hash, it’s quite easy to scan the content of the “deleted” commit(s) for secrets using Git access:Clones a repo in a minimal way.: Omits file contents (blobs), only history/trees/commits.: Doesn't check out the working directory (no files appear yet).Fetches a specific commit ().Scans for secrets using TruffleHog.TruffleHog will automatically pull down the file contents (blobs) that need to be scanned. This command will search for secrets in all commits, starting with the  commit and working backward until the start of that branch. This ensures that all data from a force push overwriting more than one commit gets scanned; however, it will scan some non-dangling commits. The open-source tool we’ve released is a bit more efficient and only scans the actual dangling (dereferenced) commits.GitHub doesn't specify an exact rate limit for Git operations, but excessive cloning or fetching of repositories may trigger delaying or rate limiting (see here).In addition, we can use other methods to query a specific deleted/dangling commit with the GitHub API or simply with the Github web UI.Query for the commit patch using  GitHub’s REST API: https://api.github.com/repos/<ORG>/<REPO-NAME>/commits/<HASH>https://api.github.com/repos/github/gitignore/commits/e9552d855c356b062ed82b83fcaacd230821a6ebNote: There’s a strict rate-limit of 5,000 queries per hour for registered users and merely 60 for unregistered users. The server response header  indicates how many API calls users have left.Direct Web Access via Github.comYou can also access the commit details directly from GitHub.com.                                             Here are three different examples of how to access any commit via the GitHub website:https://github.com/<ORG>/<REPO-NAME>/commit/<HASH>https://github.com/github/gitignore/commit/e9552d855c356b062ed82b83fcaacd230821a6ebhttps://github.com/<ORG>/<REPO-NAME>/commit/<HASH>.patchhttps://github.com/github/gitignore/commit/e9552d855c356b062ed82b83fcaacd230821a6eb.patchhttps://github.com/<ORG>/<REPO-NAME>/commit/<HASH>.diffhttps://github.com/github/gitignore/commit/e9552d855c356b062ed82b83fcaacd230821a6eb.diffAlthough there is no documented rate limit, access is not guaranteed under heavy usage, and their WAF may block requests at any time without notice.So we have all the ingredients - we can get all GitHub event data, search for all events, fetch the “deleted” commit (the  hash), and then scan for active secrets using TruffleHog. Let’s do this. You know what? No need to build it, because together with Truffle Security’s Research team, we’re open-sourcing a new tool to search the entire GH Archive for “Oops Commits” made by your GitHub organization or user account. Since the entire GH Archive is available as a Google Big Query public dataset, this tool scans GHArchive PushEvent data for zero-commit events, fetches the corresponding commits, and scans them for secrets using TruffleHog. : We are releasing this tool to help blue teamers assess their potential exposure. Please use it responsibly.Here’s a command to get started:. --- ///. -- </For this research, I used a custom version of our open-source tool to scan all of GitHub's  since 2020. And wow. There were lots of secrets!Hunting for Impactful SecretsAfter running the automation, I found thousands of active secrets. But how can I identify the most interesting secrets tied to the most impactful organizations? My three-step formula for success: manual search, a vibe-coded triage tool, and AI.First, I manually explored and manipulated the data - essentially, got my hands dirty. The automation I built stores each newly discovered secret in a well-structured JSON file. Here's an example of what one of those files looks like:During this stage, I manually looked over the files for interesting secrets. For example, I filtered out all commits made by authors with generic email addresses (e.g. gmail.com, outlook.com, mail.ru, etc)  and focused on commits pushed by authors with a corporate email. While not perfect, it was a good start, and I found some really impactful keys.To understand the impact of specific tokens, I tried to figure out who owns the key and what access it has using open-source tools (e.g. secrets-ninja) and a few custom scripts. During my research, I learned that the Truffle Security team launched an open-source tool to do just that - TruffleHog Analyze. It’s built into TruffleHog; you just have to run . Note: I only did this additional secret enumeration when it was in-scope for specific Bug Bounty or Vulnerability Disclosure programs.Once I found something relevant or interesting, I reported it via a bug-bounty program or directly via email.Vibe Coding for Secret TriageAfter a couple hundred manual checks, I had enough and decided to scale-up my secrets review. I used vercel v0 to vibe-code a whole platform for triaging these “Oops Commit” secrets. The platform was very simple. It was a front-end-only interface (no backend at all) that received a .zip file with JSON files created by the scanner. It then presented them in a very easy-to-use table so I could quickly review them and mark what I had already reviewed. This method proved very efficient, and I used a combination of filters to quickly find the hidden gems!I also added some graphs and pie charts because why not? Looking at these graphs immediately revealed a few insights.First, if you look at the time-series graph below, there’s clearly a direct correlation between the year and amount of  secrets - most likely because older secrets have already been revoked or expired - as they should! Second, MongoDB secrets leaked the most. Based on my review of the data, this is because a lot of junior developers and CS students leaked mostly non-interesting side-project MongoDB credentials. The most interesting leaked secrets were GitHub PAT tokens and AWS credentials. These also generated the highest bounties!Finally, I plotted the frequency of files leaking valid credentials, ahd the results are clear - your file needs extra protection!Besides .env the most leaking filenames are: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , I was quite satisfied with my vibe-coded secrets review platform. However, reviewing secrets is still a manual task. Ideally, the process should automatically resolve all secrets to extract basic information about the associated accounts wherever possible. This data could then be passed to a LLAMA-based agent that analyzes and identifies potentially valuable secrets. In essence, the goal is to build an offline agent capable of determining which secrets hold significance from a bug bounty or impact-driven perspective.With the help of my friend Moti Harmats, I started working on it, but there’s still a lot more work to do, so I won’t release it at this time. But here’s a preview of what I started building:Case Study - Preventing a Massive Supply-Chain CompromiseOne of the secrets I found in a deleted commit was a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) belonging to a developer. The developer accidentally leaked this secret when they committed their hidden configuration files (dot files). I analyzed this token and found it had admin access to ALL of Istio repositories.Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a transparent and language-independent way to flexibly and easily automate application network functions. It is designed to manage the communication between microservices in a distributed application, offering features such as traffic management, security, and observability without requiring changes to the application code.The main Istio project has  stars and  forks. Istio is used by a wide range of organizations and teams that run complex, distributed applications, especially those adopting microservices architectures. This includes giant corporations like Google, IBM, Red Hat and many others.And I had ADMIN level access to ALL of Itsio repositories (there are many of them). I could have read environment variables, changed pipelines, pushed code, created new releases, or even deleted the entire project. The potential for a mass supply-chain attack here was scary. Fortunately, Istio has a well-maintained report page, and the team acted quickly to revoke the GitHub PATs as soon as the issue was reported. Thank you!This was a really fun project. I glued together some known discoveries and was able to create a reliable automation that scanned and found thousands of active secrets, even some that were buried for years. I also got the chance to vibe code a secret hunting platform with some nice features that allowed me to find needles in a haystack and earn approximately $25k of bounties and deep-thanks through the process.The common assumption that deleting a commit is secure must change - once a secret is committed it should be considered compromised and must be revoked ASAP. It’s true for git blobs, git commits, and anything else that goes online.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>10 features of D that I love</title><link>https://bradley.chatha.dev/blog/dlang-propaganda/features-of-d-that-i-love/</link><author>/u/BradleyChatha</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 11:33:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a beginner-friendly post exploring some of my favourite parts of the D programming language, ranging from smaller quality of life stuff, to more major features.I  talk much about D’s metaprogramming in this post as that topic basically requires its own dedicated feature list, but I still want to mention that D’s metaprogramming is world class - allowing a level of flexibility & modelling power that few statically compiled languages are able to rival.I’ll be providing some minimal code snippets to demonstrate each feature, but this is by no means an in depth technical post, but more of an easy to read “huh, that’s neat/absolutely abhorrent!” sort of deal.Feature - Automatic constructorsIf you define a struct (by-value object) without an explicit constructor, the compiler will automatically generate one for you based on the lexical order of the struct’s fields.Very handy for Plain Old Data types, especially with the semi-recent support for named parameters.Feature - Design by contract“in” assertions to confirm that the function’s parameters are valid.“out” assertions to confirm that the function’s return value is in a valid state.Additionally you can attach “invariants” onto structs and classes. Invariants are functions that run at the start and end of every  member function, and can be used to ensure that the type is always in a valid state.Let’s start off with a contrived example of invariants:Now let’s rewrite the above type to use “in” contracts instead, with an extra function to show off “out” contracts:This can allow for an easy self-descriptive validation pattern for consumers/readers of your code, as well as an easy to implement self-checking mechanism for types that have complex internals.Anecdotally I find this to be an underutilised feature of D, and it’s one I like to make use of a lot in my own code.Syntax - The dollar operatorA lot of languages do not provide a shorthand syntax for referencing the length of an array, which can sometimes lead to awkward looking code when e.g. slicing arrays (any Go enjoyers here?).D provides the dollar operator, which is a shorthand syntax for referencing the length of something.Structs and classes can even overload this operator.D compilers provide an interpreter for the language which allows a very large amount of D code to be ran at compile time, as-is, without any special marking or other weirdness to go with it.Generally, anywhere where the language requires a compile-time constant is a place where CTFE will transparently come into play.This feature has a lot of different practical applications, and can allow for much cleaner, robust code than hardcoding precomputed values.Since a lot of use cases relate to metaprogramming I’ll leave the topic here, but CTFE is an extremely instant example of D’s unusual feature set.Feature - Built-in unittestsD has direct support for defining unittests, and even allows you to override the built-in test runner for something more robust (such as with the unit-threaded library).D code usually bundles unittests and normal code within the same file, rather than splitting them out into separate files as with most other languages:This extremely low-friction barrier for writing tests is a godsend for motivating people to write even the most minimal of tests.Of course if you have more complex needs then the option to have a proper testing framework + structure is still available to you, but the vast majority of D code I’ve seen simply uses  blocks, optionally with a library that provides a better test runner.Feature - Exhaustive switch statementsD provides a  statement which has an autogenerated  case that will immediately crash the program if its taken.This allows you to define a switch that will always alert you if a new value needs to be added, or if an invalid value was somehow passed into it.Additionally, if you use a  with an  value, then a compile-time check is triggered to ensure that every value within the  type has been declared, making it impossible to forget to add a new case when the enum is modified.Syntax - Parenthesis omissionD allows you to omit parentheses when calling functions in multiple contexts.When calling a function with no parameters, you can omit them:(Marginally related) When calling a function with 1 parameter, you may use assignment syntax instead:When passing a single template parameter which consists of only 1 lexical token, you may omit the parenthesis:This can do wonders for readability.UFCS allows call chains to be “inverted” by allowing freestanding functions to be used as if they were a member of their first parameter.In other words:  can be rewritten as .The two following snippets are completely equivalent in function, except the second snippet uses UFCS to provide a more clean look.Feature - Scoped & Selective ImportsD supports limiting imports to a specific scope, whether that be a singular if-statement, an entire function, an entire struct/class, etc.D will also allow you to selectively import symbols from other modules, instead of polluting your lookup scope with a ton of unrelated stuff - also helps increase comprehension of the codebase.While it may seem like clutter and extra effort, in the long run this allows for:Making it easy for newcomers to understand where certain functions are coming from.Allows for code to become “portable” between files since the code can carry most of its external dependencies inside of itself, making refactoring a bit easier.Feature - Built-in documentation generatorFinally, D has a built-in documentation generator with a relative standard, easy to read format.There’s also a handful of documentation tools that are detached from the built-in one since the default generated output is a bit lacklustre ( I’m plugging my custom tool here).Here’s a relatively extreme example from one of my personal projects, to get an idea of the basic format:Here’s an example from the standard library, which has minor usage of documentation macros:I tried to focus more on the more simpler day-to-day features, with only a splattering of the bigger more complicated stuff.Hopefully this provides some insight on the wacky-yet-wonderful feature set that D provides.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI girlfriends is really becoming a thing</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1lpsts5/ai_girlfriends_is_really_becoming_a_thing/</link><author>/u/Just-Grocery-2229</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 10:58:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit -

This device seems to be also popular on TikTok. My suspicions were confirmed, this runs android. So of course i went ahead and bought them.245 euros later... and they finally arrived!Before we dive further into this, unlike with rabbit, this issue has been properly reported and patched. This is also my first real blog post/disclosure so feedback is appreciated.I like how they strapped a USB-c cable to the outside of the box while there is also a smaller one inside the box. They ran out of box space it seems...I also wonder if they are legally allowed to use this OpenAI logo (probably not lol)Anyways, we aren't here for fancy boxes, lets get to the main point. The device itself boots up to a screen with the time and ChatGPT front and center.There are some other AI features available too like translations. But this isn't a review of the device, you can watch other YouTube videos about that. The ChatGPT animation looks way too similar to the actual app and OpenAI could probably get them in legal trouble for stealing their brand identity. I will also mention that the audio quality is absolute shit if you use their EQ profiles but can be upped to a usable level by tweaking the EQ curves yourself.There are also some apps available in the IKKO store, the reason that there is no google play store available is because these apps are modified specifically for the screen on the ActiveBuds, at least, that is what the CEO says about them. We will check that out in a bit. These apps include some music apps like Spotify, but also some gaming apps like, oh god, SUBWAY SURFERS BAYBEEEEEOf course all of them unbearable to navigate due to the small screen. However we can now confirm that it most definitely runs android.There is sadly no browser available to directly download other apps. And while you can open the native android settings app, clicking the build number 7 times does not enable developer mode. So i couldn't enable adb it seems. Is it locked that well? heh nope.Let's just plug it into a pc and see what happens....What the fuck, they left ADB enabled. Well, this makes it a lot easier. After sideloading the obligatory DOOM, i began checking out how the ChatGPT integration works on the backend. I first started HTTP inspecting the device, however since i couldn't enable the proper system certificates without rooting the device, i couldn't see exactly to what URL it communicated. Fortunately that wasn't really needed.Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, it communicates DIRECTLY TO OPENAI. This means that a ChatGPT key must be present on the device!I know that this device can be rooted to get the proper certificates installed because a tool exists on all Spreadtrum/Unisoc devices which can be used to unlock the bootloader as long as companies use the default signing keys. This was indeed the case here too. However, i couldn't get past the confirmation screen as the device does not have a volume up key to confirm the unlock. I think you are able to sign your own partitions to make it flash them without an unlocked bootloader but that's a bit too advanced for my own liking.So, i went back to the drawing board and just dumped all of the apps from it with an APK extractor tool. After popping the launcher app into JADX, things immediately became concerning.The device can communicate to either of these domains.api.openai.com
Obvious, the OpenAI APIchat1.chat.iamjoy.cn
Seems to be the API for the entire device, including features not related to ChatGPT like the app store. Loading it up in a browser gives a login page.chat2.chat.iamjoy.cn
Same thing as chat1, possibly a backup server?openspeech.bytedance.com
No idea, might be a speech recogniser backup instead of whisper, haven't seen communication to this from the device.www.airdimple.cn
Seems like an OpenAI API mirror or proxy?Knowing this i went hunting for api endpoints and keys. I found a file called SecurityStringsAPI which contained encrypted endpoints and authentication keys. You might think, hey that's just base64 idiot, the most basic encoding known to mankind. And well, yeah, it is.However, there is a second stage which is handled by a native library which is obfuscated to hell. I am not going to even try to read that. Fortunately i didn't have to. I just sideloaded the app on a different device which was rooted, and well, just like the rabbit apk, it just works!Yup, that's an OpenAI key.Now, while having this access, we can also expose their (pretty funny) system prompt.The device also has another few modes, which are Angry Dan and In-Love Dan. For the angry one you need to confirm you are 18+ because it actually swears a lot.The system prompts for these are a bit more boring.I also noticed that it logs the chat to another endpoint on the chat1 domain. This is probably just to keep a log of messages since the ChatGPT API does not allow that. Possibly for some Chinese espionage? Well, possibly but not entirely, we will get to that.The headers for this request include the message, model, response and the device IMEI as the device id.I also sideloaded the store app and found out that the apps seem to be mostly ripped straight from apkpure.comAfter discovering this information, i sent an email to the security department of IKKObuds.While waiting for their response i started to investigate their companion app. Wait i forgot to tell you about that? Yeah, these earbuds have a companion app with which you can also directly interface with ChatGPT and see your previous chats from the device. So that's what the logging endpoint is used for! You bind the app by scanning a QR code from the device in the "Membership" menu.So, let's HTTP inspect this app and check out where it gets this information from.Alright so it queries this API with your account token and your device id and returns all the chats you have ever had with the device. However, after removing the account token, the request still worked? So this api has no authentication apart from the device id. I feared the worst.I found a frame in the tutorial video in which the device id wasn't properly blurred and plugged that into the api.YUP, i now had their entire demo device chat history. And as the IMEI has a certain range, you would be able to figure out the chat history of all customers, which may include sensitive details.I also added this new discovery to the email chain.While that email was waiting for a reply i checked if i could fabricate a linking QR code from a known IMEI to bind the device. (The QR code is not the IMEI itself but something encrypted) I found the API endpoint by looking at the same SecurityStringsAPI, which was less secure than i initially thought because the variable names literally expose the encrypted api endpoints (lol)Plugging in the getBindDevQrCode api in postman, i could fabricate a base64 image of the QR code with any IMEI.However, using this QR code to try and bind the device to my app resulted in an error, saying that the device has already been bound to someone else. So that has been the only good security implementation up until now.However, i lied, this is still a security/privacy issue. Why, you may ask? This exposes the username you set when creating the account for the app. However, there is no username field when creating your account. Only first and last name.I created an account with the first name as "Cheese2" and the second name as "Delight2". Turns out that the username is equal to First name + Last name. When trying to bind that device to an app after it has already been bound to another app, the response includes the name "Cheese2Delight2". Great. Doxed.So what we can do now is guess IMEI -> generate QR code -> Bind the device if not bound already, or get your full name when the device is already bound. -> Get all your chat history either way if the device is bound or not.There is an unbind_dev endpoint????Unfortunately that one actually checks account token and does not allow to unbind a random device IMEI. Phew.Hey, do you remember that logging endpoint that actually sent your chats you made with ChatGPT to their servers? This one?Yeah, that also only used the device id as authentication, so we can send arbitrary text to the companion app of anyone....I tried to send some HTML and JS through it to try and exploit the companion app, fortunately they use vue for their app and that has default HTML and JS injection security built in. But we can still send scams or something to any user.Oh hey a reply to my email!First of all, from a gmail address? Come on, actually try to have at least some professionalism. Second, OK they are actually doing something about it. (The YouTube channel mentioned is because i said that i will be making a video about this. I have all the footage for it but i hate my voice with a passion so here we are on this blog post :))Shortly after this email, they locked down the app and put out an announcement stating that the app will be in maintenance for a week.They also wanted to become a sponsor of my empty YouTube channel? What? I don't think that they understood that i would be talking about their horrible security. Anyways.The API was now non functional and displayed a maintenance message. After the service period they put out both an app update and a device update. What changed? The endpoint to get the chat history now needs a "signature" header. Which is composed of your account token, your device id, language and the current time encoded with a public/private key + a password. Anyways, it is now impossible to fetch the chats without having a valid account token. Still doesn't fix the fact that i can generate a QR code with the guessable IMEI and bind the device to an app if it hasn't been bound already. That circumvents this all. The device update broke the ChatGPT functionality from functioning on a device which is not the IkkoBuds itself. The keys remain on device and have not been rotated. So if anyone is able to figure out the broken app on another device or the key encryption system, you can still get your very own free OpenAI API key.However i just gave up at this moment, also because they never replied with anything after my last email criticizing them for leaving the keys on device. This is now a month and a half ago.So, that is it. You can still inject messages into apps of others, link devices that are not already bound to another companion app, thus leaking chat history. And leak first and last names of devices which are bound.I am giving up, but if anyone else wants this company to fix this, be my guest.Also if you liked this deep dive, consider supporting me so i will be able to convince myself that buying more strange android devices is worth it lolhttps://ko-fi.com/mgdproductionsI got this device rooted with help from @haro7zThey are now checking the device's imei before it is able to use the chatgpt integration and are now using a proxy api instead of calling directly to openai. However this proxy api doesn't require any auth and only requires the User-Agent to be set to okhttp/4.9.0 LOLThey have also FINALLY rotated their old chatgpt api key!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] How to become fluent at modifying/designing/improving models?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lppyht/d_how_to_become_fluent_at/</link><author>/u/total-expectation</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 07:50:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Read a paper and and without much problem implement the techniques mentioned, whether it's building something from scratch using the paper as guidance (even in the absence of code), or modifying existing models.Having an idea and being able to translate that into designing new architectures or modifying existing models.Think of people like Phil Wang who is very prolific at reproducing papers and or improving them.

Website owners can choose to opt out if they wish by charging AI companies for scraping their websites ("pay per crawl").The era where AI companies simply recursively crawled websites with simple GET requests to extract data is over. Previously, AI companies simply disrespected robots.txt - but now that's not enough anymore.Cloudflare's protections against crawler bots are now pretty sophisticated. They use generative AI to produce scientifically correct, but unrelated content to the website, in order to waste time and compute for the crawlers ("AI Labyrinth"). This content is in pages that humans are not supposed to reach, but AI crawler bots should reach - invisible links with special CSS techniques (more sophisticated than ), for instance. These nonsense pages then contain links to other nonsense pages, many of them, to keep the crawler bots wasting time reading completely unrelated pages to the site itself and ingesting content they don't need.Every possible way to overcome this, as I see it, would significantly increase costs compared to the simple HTTP GET request recursive crawling before. It seems like AI companies would need to employ a small LLM to check if the content is related to the site or not, which could be extremely expensive if we're talking about thousands of pages or more - would they need to feed every single one of them to the small LLM to make sure if it fits and isn't nonsense?How will this arms race progress? Will it lead to a world where only the biggest AI players can afford to gather data, or will it force the industry towards more standardized "pay-per-crawl" agreements?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kubernetes RKE Cluster Recovery</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lppqq0/kubernetes_rke_cluster_recovery/</link><author>/u/Always_smile_student</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 07:35:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There is an RKE cluster with 6 nodes: 3 master nodes and 3 worker nodes.Docker containers with RKE components were removed from one of the worker nodes.How can they be restored?kubectl get nodes -o widedaf5a99691bf rancher/hyperkube:v1.26.6-rancher1 kube-proxydaf3eb9dbc00 rancher/rke-tools:v0.1.89 nginx-proxy2e99fa30d31b rancher/mirrored-pause:3.7 k8s_POD_coredns5f63df24b87e rancher/mirrored-pause:3.7 k8s_POD_metrics-server9825bada1a0b rancher/mirrored-pause:3.7 k8s_POD_rancher93121bfde17d rancher/mirrored-pause:3.7 k8s_POD_fleet-controller2834a48cd9d5 rancher/mirrored-pause:3.7 k8s_POD_fleet-agentc8f0e21b3b6f rancher/nginx-ingress-controller k8s_controller_nginx-ingress-controller-wpwnk_ingress-nginxa5161e1e39bd rancher/mirrored-flannel-flannel k8s_kube-flannel_canal-f586q_kube-system36c4bfe8eb0e rancher/mirrored-pause:3.7 k8s_POD_nginx-ingress-controller-wpwnk_ingress-nginxcdb2863fcb95 08616d26b8e7 k8s_calico-node_canal-f586q_kube-system90c914dc9438 rancher/mirrored-pause:3.7 k8s_POD_canal-f586q_kube-systemc65b5ebc5771 rancher/hyperkube:v1.26.6-rancher1 kube-proxyf8607c05b5ef rancher/hyperkube:v1.26.6-rancher1 kubelet28f19464c733 rancher/rke-tools:v0.1.89 nginx-proxy]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>K3s or full Kubernetes</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lposyz/k3s_or_full_kubernetes/</link><author>/u/ReticularTen82</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 06:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I just build a system on a supermicro x10dri.

You can look at someone and realize you don’t have nearly as much stamina, and even if you did, it still  demanding.Research  difficult. You’re tasked with thinking about something no one else has considered yet. That rarely happens even outside of science – try to tell a unique joke.But non-algorithmic programming? You’re telling a machine that precisely follows instructions what you want it to do. At best, you’re a technical translator. You’re not working towards a PhD degree. You’re just wiring things together without creating anything intrinsically . It looks , and so it  easy.Experience shows that it’s anything but easy, but it’s always been hard for me to pinpoint exactly why that is the case. And I think I’ve finally found a good answer.I’ve recently started caring about Lithium again and did some work on rough edges.At the API level, all Lithium does is provide  and  functions to simulate typed exceptions with panics or a more low-level mechanism. It’s not a good high-level construct, but it’s a useful tool nevertheless.As a prototype, it could be implemented in 50 lines max. Obviously, optimizing for performance increases the LoC count significantly, but it still seems like it ought to be manageable.But there’s 200 commits in this repo. There’s a ton of breakage and various small issues that crop up and suddenly I can’t just say this project is finished, forget about it, and use it as foundation for the next one.Lithium relies on some low-level rustc mechanisms and nightly features, so it needs a CI to let me quickly react to things changing. I automatically run a CI job every week, but I’m thinking about increasing the rate because I’m uncomfortable with breakage being found a bit later than I’d like.You might think that breakage mostly happens due to changes to nightly features, but that isn’t the case. Lithium has quite a bit of platform-specific code, so I run CI on many targets. And oh boy, do they work .Windows arm64ec oscillates between working and breaking spectacularly. That’s surprising for a Tier 2 target. When I added CI, I stumbled upon a certain issue that was fixed just a week ago, and less than a week later it broke again.Wasm exception handling support is… spotty. I’ll need to see if things have changed, but there have been several different issues, which I’ve worked on for a bit, but then I realized quite a few UI tests fail on Emscripten and it’s all a bit too overwhelming for me to resolve in a structured manner.Even on x86_64, LLVM miscompiles unwinding from a function that uses a foreign ABI (e.g. when an MS ABI function is invoked from a GNU ABI function).Oh, and if that wasn’t enough, there’s also a bug in Wine that causes code compiled for  to have unaligned thread locals. There’s an unmerged fix. Also, just hangs on  under Wine, but I can’t even tell if it’s a Rust bug or a Wine bug.So ultimately, the main reason Lithium is so unstable is external design deficiencies and bugs. It’s logically simple, but the lack of a reliable foundation forces me to use hacks or abandon otherwise good approaches.Or I can desperately try to fix upstream. I can patch rustc, I can maybe touch unwinders and Cranelift. LLVM is where I draw the line, and it looks like that’s just not enough.This fragility shows up anywhere you look. A significant chunk of complexity comes from setting up CI. You’d think people had perfected this by now, but apparently not:rustc does not support the  target.  and aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm are both supported. I don’t know why.Wine doesn’t support the arm64ec target out of the box yet, which means I can’t test it on CI and have to trust that running code on real Windows will catch all the bugs.Cross, the Cargo wrapper for cross-platform building and testing via emulators like qemu, has odd bugs I don’t even know how to describe.There don’t seem to be existing tools for automatically running tests under WASI or cross-compiling tests (which is necessary because I don’t want to run the whole compiler suite under Wine, just the tests themselves), so I had to make my own.cargo test --target <target> has skipped over doctests without me knowing, and then started running them after an update, and that’s revealed problems like having to add rustc flags to both  and .In fact, I think that nightly-only and internal compiler features are  of my worries. They  just work, yet they absolutely do. Yes, there’s some code smell like having to special-case Miri, and I’m not  about relying on std or rustc internals, but them being less of a problem than anything else is telling.It’s infuriating that the tools that are supposed to help us lead us to our demise. And I think this is a common trope in software development.If you need to solve a complex algorithmic problem, or if you need to optimize a program, you can usually do that. It might be tricky, you might need to research something or write ugly  code, but then you implement it and it . You write a clever pile of code and it’s , until the requirements change significantly.But reliable products are more than code snippets. They always make assumptions, like a frontend developer assuming the JavaScript runtime works correctly, a Rust programmer trusting LLVM, or the Docker runtime trusting Linux not to be stupid. And if this trust fails, you start to lose your sanity. Nothing you can do is  to solve the issue. It’s a vibes thing, it’s a “just ship it and hotfix if something breaks” world, it’s pure madness.And it’s . Only for societal reasons, only because someone didn’t consider an edge case somewhere and now fixing that requires more effort than anyone wants to invest, but that doesn’t make it any less real. It sucks, and it shouldn’t have happened, and it wouldn’t if we didn’t subscribe to the bollocks “worse is better” ideology, but now we have to live with the consequences.Computing is now obscure, unreliable sorcery. To program is to harness this inscrutable magic. And when you reframe it this way, it finally feels difficult.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust&apos;s C Dynamic Libs and static deallocation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lpj6t8/rusts_c_dynamic_libs_and_static_deallocation/</link><author>/u/Sylbeth04</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 01:23:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It is about my first time having to make dynamic libraries in Rust, and I have some questions about this subject.So, let's say I have a static as follows: rust static MY_STATIC: Mutex<String> = Mutex::new(String::new()); Afaik, this static is never dropped in a pure rust binary, since it must outlive the program and it's deallocated by the system when the program terminates, so no memory leaks.But what happens in a dynamic library?

I'm currently using templ, htmx, alpine and tailwind. Building the app was a breeze once I got used to the go sytanx and it's been fun.After completing the app I decided to make a docker container for it, So it can run anywhere without hassle. Now the problem starts. I made a container as folows:FROM golang:1.24.4 WORKDIR /app COPY go.mod go.sum ./ RUN go mod download COPY . . # Install tools RUN curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/tailwindcss https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tailwindcss RUN go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest RUN go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest # Produce Binary RUN tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/css/style.min.css RUN templ generate RUN sqlc --file ./internal/db/config/sqlc.yaml generate RUN go build -o /usr/local/bin/app ./cmd CMD [ "app" ] The problem I see here is that the build times are a lot longer none of the intall tool commands are cached (There is probably a way but I don't know yet). The produced go binary comes out to be just about 15 mb but we can see here that the containers are too big for such a small task$ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE todo-app latest 92322069832a 2 minutes ago 2.42GB postgres 16-alpine d60bd50d7e2d 3 weeks ago 276MB I was considering shipping just the binary but that requires postgres so I bundle both postgres and my app to run using docker compose. There has to be a way to build and ship faster. Hence why I'm here. I know go-alpine has a smaller size that still wouldn't justify a binary as small as 15 mbHow do you guys ship go web applications. Whether it is just static sties of with the gothh stack.Thank you everyone for replying giving amazing advice. I created a very minimalist multi-stage build process suggested by many people here.FROM scratch AS production COPY --from=builder /build/app / CMD [ "/app" ] I tried both  and  for the final image and the results are not what I expected:$ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE todo-app-alpine latest e0f9a0767b87 11 minutes ago 15.1MB todo-app-scratch latest e0f9a0767b87 11 minutes ago 15.1MB I was expecting scratch be the bare minimum. However this is amazing because my image size went for 2.4 GB to 15mb that's incredible. Thanks to /u/jefftee_ for suggesting mutlti-stage. Your commend thread helped me a lot. Another change I made was to move  just before the production lines which now let's docker cache the tool installations making production faster.

Kennedy Jr. appeared on the latest episode of Tucker Carlson’s podcast on Monday and it’s filled with the ramblings of a man completely detached from reality. Kennedy falsely suggested vaccines cause autism, more or less endorsed the idea that Anthony Fauci should go to prison, and says that AI will allow the FDA to approve new drugs very quickly. It’s quite a mess.These absolutely unhinged ideas wouldn’t be such a problem if this were any other fringe lunatic appearing on the podcast of a racist former Fox News host. But Kennedy happens to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services, a man who’s been given enormous power over America’s entire healthcare system thanks to President Donald Trump.One of the most troubling moments in the new interview comes when Kennedy discusses the role that artificial intelligence is going to play in replacing or altering the VAERS system, which stands for Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. VAERS allows doctors to report incidents when they believe a patient has been harmed by vaccines, but Kennedy isn’t happy with it. The secretary insists it was “designed to fail,” suggesting it’s not registering enough people who in his mind have been harmed by vaccines over the years.“We’re going to absolutely change VAERS and we’re going to make it, we’re going to create either within VAERS or supplementary to VAERS, a system that actually works,” Kennedy said. “And, you know, right now, even that system is antiquated because we have access to AI.”Kennedy told Carlson he was creating an “AI revolution” at the Department of Health and Human Services and was attracting the top people from Silicon Valley who “walked away from billion dollar businesses.” But Kennedy says these people don’t want prestige or power, they just want to make the healthcare system better.“We are at the cutting edge of AI,” Kennedy said. “We’re implementing it in all of our departments. At FDA, we’re accelerating drug approvals so that you don’t need to use primates or even animal models. You can do the drug approvals very, very quickly with AI.”Kennedy has previously talked about using AI to increase efficiency at FDA but hasn’t provided details about what AI tools will be used and how they would be used to approve new drugs. But given generative AI’s instability and propensity for failing at some of the most basic tasks, the idea of putting drug approvals in the hands of robots is pretty terrifying.Kennedy, who was the founder of an anti-vaccine group called the Children’s Health Defense, says repeatedly during the interview that vaccines have never been properly studied, which is just a flat-out lie. But he now has the power to demand investigations into vaccines that will get him the results he wants, no matter how much he insists his own opinion doesn’t matter.“We need to stop trusting the experts, right?” Kennedy told Carlson. “We were told at the beginning of COVID, don’t look at any data yourself, don’t do any investigation yourself, just trust the experts. And trusting the experts is not a feature of science, it’s not a feature of democracy, it’s a feature of religion, and it’s a feature of totalitarianism.”Kennedy went on to insist that it was important for everyone to “do your own research,” a common refrain among those in the so-called Make America Healthy Again movement. But Kennedy is intentionally misrepresenting the role of experts in an informed society. Listening to experts isn’t about abandoning all critical thinking. It’s about recognizing that there are areas where you may not have expertise and taking the opinions of medical professionals more seriously than random people on shows like Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson who are just self-proclaimed experts.Kennedy was asked several leading questions from Carlson, including whether the covid-19 vaccine has killed more people than it saved. And Kennedy is skilled enough as a communicator (his father was Attorney General during his uncle’s presidency, as he frequently mentions) that he can avoid directly answering in the affirmative while subtly telling you that he believes it’s the case.Notice, for instance, how Kennedy initially responds to Carlson’s question while eventually working his way to sowing doubt about trust in vaccines. Do you think overall the COVID vaccine killed more than it saved? My opinion about that is irrelevant. What we’re going to try to do is make that science available so the public can look at the science. And I would not say one way or the other. And the truth is, I don’t know. And the reason I don’t know is because the studies that were done by my agency were substandard. And they were not designed to answer that question. And there’s been a lot of obfuscation about covering up, as you know, about suppressing any kind of discussion of vaccine injuries.Kennedy is often effective at manipulating an audience, but also says things that don’t make any sense, even if you agree with his worldview. At one point during his interview with Carlson he said that when Pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine was studied there were two people who died in the control group and one person who died in the vaccine group.“You remember they were saying the vaccine is 100% effective? Well, that’s why they were saying it because there was… there was… two is 100% of one,” Kennedy said.That’s not how anyone is measuring the efficacy of vaccines. Yes, some of the early studies were admittedly too rosy in their projections, especially those in early 2021 as the vaccines were first released. But nobody was claiming that two people dying in a control group and one person dying in the vaccine group showed the vaccine was 100% effective. That math isn’t anything that was actually presented in any study Gizmodo is aware of.Kennedy was also asked about whether Anthony Fauci, the nation’s most visible public health expert during the covid-19 pandemic, would be prosecuted for some unspecified crimes. Again, the secretary danced around a bit with his language but then heavily suggested Fauci should be tried for criminal acts. Kennedy said there should be some kind of “truth commission” for covid-19 vaccines like the truth and reconciliation commissions in South Africa and Central America in the 20th century under repressive governments.“Anybody who comes and volunteers to testify truthfully is then given immunity from prosecution. And, but, so that at least the public knows who did what,” Kennedy said. “And people who are called and don’t take that deal and purge themselves, they then can be, they can be prosecuted criminally.”Kennedy believes that Fauci was involved in some kind of weaponization of covid-19 and in cahoots with the Chinese government. “I think he had a lot of liability on creating coronavirus,” Kennedy said. “You know, he was funding precisely that research at the Wuhan lab. And he was giving them the technology.”When Kennedy notes that Fauci no longer has protection from the Secret Service since President Trump withdrew it, Carlson responds “good.” Fauci received countless death threats from lunatics over the years.Kennedy didn’t really get into the spiritual side of his MAHA movement during his latest interview, something that’s previously been top of mind. In fact, Kennedy was very focused on the role of a higher power when he last appeared on Carlson’s show back in August 2024, shortly after abandoning his own bid for president. Casey Means, Kennedy’s pick to be Surgeon General, has also appeared on podcasts like Joe Rogan to spout many of the same crazy talking points and emphasize how important spirituality is for health. But it remains to be seen whether Means will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Kennedy recently said he’s going to push for all Americans to get a wearable device to monitor their health, and as luck would have it, Means sells a wearable for monitoring glucose. The device is targeted at consumers who aren’t even diabetic, the people who do actually need glucose monitoring.The entire episode of Tucker Carlson is available on YouTube but it’s a frustrating thing to sit through for any halfway intelligent person. At one point, Kennedy insists Trump is a smart guy, calling him “immensely knowledgeable” and “encyclopedic in certain areas.” Kennedy even referred to Trump as “one of the most empathetic people that I’ve ever met.” The only point where Kennedy seems to disagree with Trump is on tariffs, with the secretary saying that “businesses are hurting because of the tariffs.” But it’s the kind of quick dissent that will likely go unnoticed given how Kennedy praises the fascist president incessantly throughout.You’ve been warned. Listen at the risk of your own sanity. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Kennedy had founded a group called the Children’s Defense Fund. The group started by Kennedy is called Children’s Health Defense. Our sincerest apologies to the Children’s Defense Fund, which is not against childhood vaccinations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Any deaf Linux users here?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lpfpf5/any_deaf_linux_users_here/</link><author>/u/Macdaddyaz_24</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 22:39:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Who here is Deaf?

It means that the changelog is much bigger, and also includes the changes that went in Libreboot 25.04.Today’s Libreboot 25.06 revision is a , whereas the previous stable release was Libreboot 20241206. This revised release log lists all changes as of today, 30 June 2025, since the Libreboot 20241206 release of December 2024.Open source BIOS/UEFI firmware[link]Libreboot is a free/open source BIOS/UEFI replacement on x86 and ARM, providing boot firmware that initialises the hardware in your computer, to then load an operating system (e.g. Linux/BSD). It is specifically a , in the same way that Debian is a Linux distribution. It provides an automated build system to produce coreboot ROM images with a variety of payloads such as GRUB or SeaBIOS, with regular well-tested releases to make coreboot as easy to use as possible for non-technical users. From a project management perspective, this works in  the same way as a Linux distro, providing a source-based package manager (called lbmk) which patches sources and compiles coreboot images. It makes use of coreboot for hardware initialisation, and then a payload such as SeaBIOS or GRUB to boot your operating system; on ARM(chromebooks) and certain x86 mainboards, we provide  (as a coreboot payload), which provides a lightweight UEFI implementation..Sumarised list of changes[link]This section provides a brief overview, summarising all of the changes. The next sections (after this) show  changes in detail.The most important changes are, thus:Acer Q45T-AM support added (similar to G43T-AM3 mainboard)Dell Precision T1700 SFF and MTGRUB, SeaBIOS, Untitled, flashprog, U-Boot, uefitool have all been updated to newer revisions, from ~April 2025.GRUB has has  of security fixes applied to it from upstream, including a very large series of  major security fixes, and a few minor tweaks after the fact.Globbing issues fixed in the Libreboot build system, lbmk. Better error handling in general.ThinkPad T480/3050micro: Disable hyperthreading by defaultBetter, more reliable caching of Git repositories and files during download. Re-builds of sources make better use of local caching, instead of downloading from scratch every time (e.g. coreboot and GRUB sources).Handling of vendor files is more reliable, caching everything more aggressively and even verifying checksums of  files, from inside update archives.Non-root USB hub support added to GRUB, for xHCI devicesGRUB: better LVM scanning, for auto-boot especially with encrypted ; Linux distros are easier to handle, in general.Safer handling of vendor files; release images padded to prevent flashing, where such files are needed, until they have been inserted.Better MAC address handling, on IFD-based systems. Insertion of MAC addresses is done by default, randomised by default, unless overridden by the user.Removed unnecessary sources by default, to make source archives smaller. Only the sources needed to build the binaries are included, in many cases.Updated various dependencies configs, for installing build dependencies in various Linux distros (for the  command which installs them in your distro).Better checksum verification for project files, when deciding whether to re-build a given upstream source.General build system fixes, making the build process more reliable, with much stricter error handling (and some false error conditions have also been removed).GRUB payload: Mark E820 reserved for cbmem, which means that you no longer need  (kernel option) at boot time, to access the cbmem console.Use  instead of  in nvmutil, as a character for randomness in MAC addresses, to work around a design quirk in ZSH.Where files are operated on post-build, e.g. coreboot images, more strictly operate on them first, erroring out more reliably when a fault occurs; prevent bad files from being copied to final build destinations. This reduces the chance of bad/corrupt build artifacts being present in release builds.HP EliteBook 820 G2 images now included in releases, because handling of the refcode files was corrected so that checksum verification passes during insertion.This, and more, has all been done. There was also a general focus on heavily auditing the build system, lbmk, so as to clean up the code. The amount of overall code in lbmk was , without removing functionality.These next sections will repeat many of the above items, but in more detail.[link]The priority for the first half of 2025 has been on further auditing the Libreboot build system, so fewer board ports were added. More board ports will be added instead in the December 2025 release (a lot more).The following boards have been added since the Libreboot 20241206 release:Acer Q45T-AM support added (similar to G43T-AM3 mainboard)Dell Precision T1700 SFF and MTBoard ports were low priority for this release; now it shall be the focus, between June 2025 and October 2025, ready for the 25.12 release cycle leading into December 2025.Dell Precision T1700 is essentially the OptiPlex 9020 but with a slightly different, code-compatible PCH that also supports ECC memory features when an Intel Xeon processor is installed.In descending order from latest changes to earliest changes:GRUB: Update to revision 73d1c959e (14 March 2025)Bump SeaBIOS to to rev 9029a010, 4 March 2025Updated Untitled to newer LBSSG repository.Bump flashprog to rev e060018 (1 March 2025)Bump U-Boot on ARM64 boards to U-Boot v2025.04. Patching courtesy of Alper Nebi Yasak.Bump uefitool to rev a072527, 26 Apr 2025 to fix CMake compatibility issue since CMake 4 no longer supports version 3.5, whereas the old uefitool had an earlier version as the minimum supported. This fixed a minor build error.Merged coreboot/next with coreboot/defaultBump coreboot/next to rev c247f62749b as of 20 April 2025Bump coreboot/default to rev c247f62749b as of 20 April 2025Bump flashprog to revision eb2c041 (14 Nov 2024).The GRUB revision includes a number of critical CVE fixes, and regression fixes, that were also included in Libreboot 20241206 rev11. Some later fixes are also present, such as wiping LUKS keys from memory after successfully booting Linux (Linux handles LUKS itself, and starts the process again).The NASM version was updated to version 2.16.03 on coreboot/fam15h, to prevent build errors, instead of fixing the old NASM 2.14.02. Tested on Debian Sid Experimental, with GCC15-based toolchain, and on Fedora 42.PICO support: Reverted to the old pico serprog/sdk repositories used in Libreboot 20240612. This is temporary, because pico2 support is currently broken, so this release only has pico1 support, when dealing with Rpi Pico devices. Upstream pico-serprog works fine on pico2, so this will be fixed in and re-updated again in a future revision release. The pico2 update images were retroactively removed from the 20241206 release on rsync.A patch from upstream was backported to the old pico-sdk version, so that it builds correctly on newer GCC15 (tested on Debian Sid with “Experimental” packages enabled).Added SPDX license headers to almost every configuration file in lbmk.These can be considered bug fixes, but these are special fixes that are of massive concern to users.This GRUB change was merged, in the aforementioned revision update: dbc0eb5bd disk/cryptodisk: Wipe the passphrase from memory - this wipes the LUKS key from memory, after GRUB exits, where one was created by GRUB while unlocking a given volume.Merged  critical CVE fixes into the GNU GRUB source code, from upstream.Stricter use of pledge and unveil in the nvmutil source code. safer . It used to be that the tarballs were extracted and files inserted into the extracted images, but the tarballs were left unmodified; many users thought then that they should extract the tarball and flash that, which lead to bricks. And it was easy to flash uninjected images, where files (e.g. Intel ME) are needed, so now ROM images are padded by one byte, to prevent flashing, and the user is strongly reminded to inject files first; upon running the  commands, these images are then safe to flash.Fix globbing issues in lbmk by double-quoting variables everywhere, and generally making sure that certain characters are escaped properly when necessary. To reduce the chance of bad commands being run by mistake or intentionally.Removed auto-confirm on  commands, to mitigate the risk of a buggy package manager on the user’s distro possibly removing many packages. Now the user must confirm their choice, e.g. when a conflict occurs, instead of the package manager already deciding for the user.ThinkPad T480 / OptiPlex 3050: Disable HyperThreading/SMT by default, for security, to reduce the attack vector of certain speculative execution-based exploits.In descending order from latest changes to earliest changes:: looser  validation; correct it on child instances, if it’s not set, or set incorrectly.: use subshells on  functions, wrapped in an error handler so as to provide more verbose output under fault conditions. This makes it easier to debug when a download fails.: Re-implement redundant git downloads, more reliably than before; all repositories are now cached, reliably, including submodules, even when upstream repo links differ wildly. This reduces the amount of internet bandwidth used, when handling multiple builds.: build in tmp directory first, leaving old files behind under fault conditions, for further analysis: re-add mac address confirmation, for user-friendliness, when running the inject commands.: Resolve  via readlink: Use  in , with realpath only as fallback. This makes the function more redundant, working on more systems by default.: support any command on  (later renamed); this is a generic function, that implements a while loop for a given set of files, based on the output a command that generates those paths. This is operated on by a function, defined when calling find_exec. This unifies all use of while loops on lists of files and directories, throughout xbmk, rather than re-implementing the for/while loops each time.: simplify kconfig scanning by using the  with a new function, . This new function checks  coreboot configs for a given target, whereas the old behaviour only resulted in the  config being checked. In practise, this causes no real behaviour changes.: Print the rom image path being generated: Add warning if x_ is called without args: More verbose error info, on non-zero exits.: Within each 4KB part, only handle 4KB, even if the block size is bigger. This means using less memory, and modification of anything past 4KB is not required.: Support 16KB and 128KB GbE files, in addition to the usual 8KB files. The size is based on the block size of the flash you use.Added non-root USB3 hub support to GRUB on the xHCI implementation, courtesy of a patch from Nitrokey.GRUB: Scan LUKS inside  LVM, to support the uncommon use case where LUKS is inside LVM, instead of LVM inside LUKS. It is theoretically possible, even if ill advised.GRUB: Scan  LVM device, where available, as a fallback at boot time when all else fails.Release ROMs prefixed with a “DO NOT FLASH” warning and padded by one byte, where vendor files are required. The  commands remove this prefix/padding, after vendor files are inserted and checksums verified.Better detecting of whether vendor files are needed, and confirmation to the user while running  commands.Allow restoring the default MAC address on  commands, by using the  arguments.Randomise the MAC address by default, where applicable, when running the  commands, because lots of users previously flashed without changing it, so lots of users had generic MAC addresses. The  argument prevents this from happening, where desired.: More user-friendly debug messages, for the user to know what’s going on.: Add uninstall command to the Makefile: Add distclean command to the Makefile: Nicer hexdump display, similar to .Support a  argument in  Fedora commands, for re-installation of packages as desired.Support  in the  command, when the user wants to re-install dependencies.Put temporary  directory in the normal  directory, and clear it whenever a new parent instance of the build system is executed. This is used for the GCC/GNAT matched symlinks, for example, or the python symlink created at startup.Pico 2 support briefly added, but was a bit buggy for now, so it’s removed in this release, and was retroactively removed in rsync for the Libreboot 20241206 release; this will be re-added in a future release.Added GRUB-first payload setups as an option, but not enabled by default. The user can add  in the  file for a given mainboard.Support automatically downloading Lenovo ThunderBolt firmware for the ThinkPad T480, automatically padding it for installation. This update fixes a charging bug that affected some earlier launch models.Insert GRUB backgrounds in CBFS instead of GRUB memdisk, which makes GRUB background images easier to replace.In descending order from the latest changes to the earliest changes:ifd/hp8300usdt: set the HAP bit by default; it was previously not set, but the  config was nonetheless used, and ME Soft Temporary Disable was also used. As a result, this change is basically redundant, but otherwise technically correct (more so than the previous behaviour).coreboot: Remove unused vboot tests (futility tests), to shrink the size of release tarballs.coreboot/default: Remove unneeded FSP modules when downloading, because only the Kabylake version is needed at this time. This is done, using the  function via  files. This shrinks the size of release tarballs.: add HP 820 G2: Use fam15h cbfstool tree for refcode; this avoids the need to clutter the source code with an entire additional coreboot tree, thus reducing the size of releases.A GRUB configuration change was made, fixing auto-scanning of LVMs when doing cryptomount.T480/3050micro: Removed the  targets, because we only need the  targets.Added  to Fedora 41 dependencies.Added  to Arch dependencies, needed for the  utility.Added  to Arch dependencies, because it’s needed for certain commands e.g. git commands.GRUB: Use the codeberg mirror first, to mitigate GNU mirrors often being slow or rate limited, e.g. for gnulib downloads.fedora41/dependencies: add libuuid-develAdded  to fedora41 dependenciesflashprog: Disable  to prevent minor warnings being treated as errors.This combines both build system fixes, and changes to upstream sources (e.g. coreboot and various payloads like SeaBIOS/GRUB, utilities like flashprog, and so on).The following bug fixes have been merged (in descending order from the latest changes to the earliest changes):: add sha512 error for . Handle errors in  and ; also check that  exists and error out if it doesn’t, when checking a given project hash. We know that the project hash file should always exist, and always be read; technically, find might not yield results, but then an empty file would be produced. the empty file edge-case scenario would already have resulted in an error exit inside , so that’s already covered.: add error checking in , when reading the  variable; we need to error out where a read error occurs. such an error is extremely unlikely, so this fix is largely theoretical and preventative.: more reliable clean in ; don’t do a no-op if it fails, instead fall back to the  method, and throw an error if  fails. The no-op existed because not all projects have distclean, but we always intend for them to be cleaned. This therefore prevents further unhandled error conditions, in such edge cases.put coreboot utils in , to prevent old binaries from still being used when a code change is made.: use printf to create version files, instead of copying the version files, because they don’t exist in some cases, so this prevents an error condition.: error out if .git/ is a symlink; this is a preventative bug fix, to prevent future unknown bugs in such a scenario.: Properly error out if  fails, where it previously failed to throw an error under certain fault conditions.: Don’t auto-run make-oldconfig; it now must be applied permanently, via e.g.  commands. Otherwise, undesirable changes can sometimes be made during build time, especially on projects that don’t use scons quite as reliably, as in the U-Boot build system.: re-generate remotes every time, on cached Git repositories, so that configuration changes in  are automatically applied when dealing with multiple versions of a given upstream project.: copy version files to  (release source directory), otherwise an  version number is erroneously created. This fixes a regression caused by previous optimisation to xbmk: add fake config makefile args to , and , to prevent  (without additional arguments) from erroneously exiting with error status. otherwise, an error can occur in such conditions if a Makefile has not yet been created.: skip running  on dry builds, otherwise running  without argument will cause an error.: Don’t run make-clean on dry runs (), to prevent error conditions while building GRUB, if  is passed without additional argument, since the latter requiires running autoconf to get a Makefile in the GRUB build system.: add missing check in ; we were checking the main URL on a download, but not the backup URL.: stricter URL check in ; throw an error if a URL is empty, rather than skipping to the next. If a URL is set but fails, then falling back to the next is OK (or throw an error if the backup is set, and also failed).: Make  always throw an error upon exiting the loop check; it was previously throwing an error if the for loop returned with zero status. Depending on the sh implementation, or changes made in the future, this could cause unpredictable buggy behaviour. Therefore, the error exit is much stricter now, and less ambiguous, to prevent future bugs, because it is imperative that execution must never continue under fault conditions. If a file or repository is successfully handled, a return (zero) occurs, otherwise the loop exits and a non-zero exit occurs.: fix up , or specifically fix a bad  loop, because shorthand conditionals are used and the way they were used can be buggy on some sh implementations, so they are terminated more explicitly.xbmk: stricter handling of files on while loops, to prevent instances where execution continues under fault conditions. This prevents other, less predictable bugs in the future.: Hardcode  for integrity; this is a bug fix, because there’s too much that can be wrong with this being configurable, so now it is hardcoded at runtime. It was never intended to be configurable anyway.: check/validate version/versiondate once read, in child instances of xbmk, to further verify that they were previously set, and set correctly. This is theoretically a preventative bug fix.: force an error condition if the xbmk version was not read. This prevents further erroneous state within xbmk.: check the  file BEFORE , to prevent erroneous initialisation while another xbmk parent instance is running.: return from xbmk child instances in  instead. This is easier than the previous check, preventing the initialisation of a git repo and/or recreation of xbmktmp and xbmklocal by erroneoues parent executions of xbmk while another parent is running - the latter of which could have caused a massively unpredictable build failure, so this is also a preemptive bug fix, fixing and preventing all kinds of weird unknown bugs.: Remove  if it’s bad; this complements a bug fix, in the bug fix section above, that caches the extracted files and hashes them. On a subsequent run where the given file is needed, it is  if the final file exists. This mitigates the possibility that corruption may have occured, under unhandled fault conditions. Therefore, this is a preventative bug fix.: don’t move  to  inside release archives, because otherwise  will fail, inside release archives.: Properly verify SHA512SUM on extraction. This is performed on the actual extracted files, alongside the existing check on downloaded files. This mitigates against future fault conditions in the extraction process, thus fixing a major design flaw. This change also caches those files, thus speeding up extractions when they’re done multiple times. submodules: Don’t delete files recursively. Use  instead of , on files.: Only create destination repo on success; don’t leave a broken cache laying around, which would otherwise break the build system under certain conditions.: removed an unnecessary  variable: delete tmp/cache from release tarballs: Remove confusing path on tar creation; that is, don’t print said path, because temporary paths are printed during this, when creating tarballs. In this file, the correct path is printed at the end of the process, when handling an images tarball.: only create elfdir in , to prevent empty directories being created where a project provides , but where no actual configs are being built on a given target name.: operate on refcode in tmp area first, to prevent bad files from being saved to the final destination under fault conditions. This pertains to the change made at build time that enables GbE devices from the refcode.: use subshell to speed up  (this is a bug fix, because slowness is a bug): add missing error handli for  (when doing releases): hard fail if git am fails (regression fix): Hard fail if reset fails; allowing re-try when cloning fails, but the reset-fail scenario didn’t cause any exit at all. This is fixed now.: Only check  if it exists: fix trying to boot all logical volumes after unlocking an encrypted volume; this makes booting LVMs more reliable, on encrypted boot setups.: also allow  or , not just  and , because some people use uppercase here. This is considered a bug fix, but could just as easily have been in the features section.: check  is a directory instead of a file.: run , to prevent a future situation where the version is not set correctly. In general, the version should always be set as early as poessible when running xbmk.: clean up tmp me file before extract; this is a preventative fix, to ensure that cross-flashing does not occur.: re-add missing break in fe/fx_, that caused improper exits (or non exits) in some cases.: use , not ; this is a less strict test, to prevent certain errors under specific edge-case conditions.: Safer ; don’t insert special files like GRUB keymaps AFTER copying the system ROM to the final destination; do it BEFORE, instead, to ensure that bad images aren’t left in place under fault conditions.: specifically check keymaps in ; it previously checked whether a setup is  seauboot, which was valid, but future conditionals would break this check. the code has been changed in advance, to prevent bugs in a future revision of xbmk.: Fix bad error handling for ; I accidentally mixed and/or in a shorthand conditional statement, which leads to buggy behaviour in various implementations of sh.GRUB: Mark E820 reserved on coreboot memory, to fix cbmem when running with strict  access; otherwise, restrictions on access to memory below 1MB will cause an error when trying to access the cbmem console.: set  in  in case they were set  in other parts of xbmk.: Silence the output of git config –global: Run git name/email check before init; otherwise, it returns if init is already done, which could lead to an error later when building coreboot.: stricter  check in : simplify err-not-set handling err: add missing redirect to stderrxbmk: MUCH safer  function; make it an actual function, instead of a variable. Initially, this function was made to then check a variable, that refers to a function, and a fallback was provided for non-zero exit in case the pointed function didn’t, but it was later made to be just a simple function that exits with a message. Code equals bugs, so fewer lines of code will yield fewer bugs.: Make x_ err if first arg is empty; this is a preventative bug fix, to make the build system still exit under such conditions, but it would result in an empty error message.: Make err_ always exit no matter what; this is a preventative bug fix, just making the exit stricter in all cases.: re-make gnupath/ after handling crossgcc, rather than deleting files within. This makes the creation of it more reliable.: re-make gnupath/ for each cross compiler, to ensure that no stagnant build artifacts are re-used: Stricter TBFW handling; don’t copy it until it has been properly padded to the correct size.:  tmpdirs on parent instance, to ensure that they are not cluttered with old files that might cause weird bugs in the future; this is a preventative bug fix.: Always create xbmklocal, to prevent errors in the case when it isn’t created automatically in certain child instances, like when running a  copy of the build system, during release builds.: Fix bad touch command: always re-build nvmutil, so that changes to it are automatically re-applied when running the build system again. (and only build it once, for a given instance of xbmk): use , not , for random characters, while still supporting  for backwards compatibility. This is because ZSH errors out when providing the old characters, in some setups. Use of  is more reliable, across several implementations of sh, e.g.  would be a full random MAC address. find_ex: explicitly create the tmp file, to prevent errors, which were nonetheless unlikely to begin with.: Explicitly create the xbmktmp directory (make sure to do this when creating this which is a temporary directory).: add fe_ which is fx_ but err on findxbmk: unified execution on  commands. Handle it with a new special function that is common across the build system.: Download vendorfiles before building release, to mitigate intermittent internet connectivity during release builds, otherwise a release build could fail. This way, all downloads are done simultaneously, since downloads are the fastest part, even on a crap internet connection.Revert AHCI reset patch for SeaBIOS, which caused AHCI not to work in SeaBIOS on the 25.04 release; the latter was also revised, to fix this. SeaBIOS has since added a new release, which includes a fix that delays AHCI reset, to mitigate in cases where the controller isn’t ready sooner. However, this release simply reverts the AHCI reset patch for now. The AHCI reset plus delay will be present in Libreboot’s next release, after 25.06.lenovo/t420: Add missing text-mode configurationcoreboot (all trees): Added patch fixing GMP build errors on modern GCC15 hostcc.coreboot (all trees): Fixed building of crossgcc with newer GCC15. Patches courtesy of Alper Nebi Yasak.coreboot (all trees): Added a patch to fix building coreboot utils with newer GCC15.dependencies/debian: Fixed the libusb package name for newer Debian releases, courtesy of Alper Nebi Yasak.SeaBIOS: Fixed  function pointers in the  patch, courtesy of Alper Nebi Yasak. Fix build errors on GCC 15.: Force use of System Python e.g. , when a python venv is detected. This prevents the build system from hanging.coreboot : Fixed the  path.Alper Nebi Yasak fixed the Python 2/3 detection in some edge cases when the  command is python2. (later ): Do root check , right after the dependencies check, whereas it previously did the python check before checking for root user.lbmk: Don’t use TMPDIR directly, use another variable containing its value, and make sure it doesn’t get changed wrongly. This reduces the possibility of accidentally leaving old tmp files laying around.:  commands now return an exit with error, if a fault occurs, whereas it didn’t before, due to piped output. This is done using the  wrapper on tar commands, to provide error exits.: function  now returns an error, if the sha512sum command fails. It previously didn’t, due to piped outputs. It’s now mitigated by using  on piped commands, for error exits.Forking of lbmk parent instance to child instance isno longer handled by variables. It’s been simplified, to only be based on whether TMPDIR is set, and it’s generally more robust now in this release. The old code sometimes broke under certain edge cases. (later renaming to ): General code cleanup, about 100 sloc removed without reducing features.lbmk: Initialise  to a standard string if not set, on the parent instance of lbmk.lbmk: Use  instead of the  variable, resetting the latter safely as lbmk runs. This prevents lbmk from changing directory to an erroneous system path, if  wasn’t properly set for some reason. This is a preventative bug fix, because no actual issue ever occured in practise.Much safer Python version check at lbmk startup, using data structures that are provided universally by all Python implementations, instead of relying on the output of .Fixed T480 backlight controls, courtesy of a patch from Mate Kukri.Set up Python in  when lbmk starts, to ensure that it is always version 3. This is checked at startup.: Prevent double-nuke, where a given tarball already had vendor files removed prior to release.: Allow setting a MAC address even if vendor files aren’t needed.: Download utils even if  is not set, in case the user is also setting a MAC address.: Honour the  variable, if set by the user, otherwise it is set to  by default.: Don’t do  when running .: Proper DESTDIR/PREFIX handling, whereas it was not handled properly at all before.: Only set CC/CFLAGS if unset, and use sensible defaults.Fixed various shellcheck errors in lbmk.HP EliteBook 820 G2: Fixed vendor file insertion and set . The insertion of Intel MRC and refcode previously didn’t pass checksum validation.ThinkPad T480 / OptiPlex 3050: Force power-off state upon recovery from power loss, otherwise the system always turns on as soon as a charger is plugged in. This is configured by hardcoding, due to a current lack of any option table on the T480.Debian dependencies: replace liblz4-tool with lz4 and liblz4-dev. The latter is also available in Debian Trixie and Sid, at this time, in addition to Debian Bookworm, so it works on all of them.U-Boot (x86): Fixed a bug since Swig 4.3.0 changed the syntax for its language-specific AppendOut functions. A patch from upstream was backported, and the patch is also compatible with older versions of Swig.In lbmk scripts, use  instead of , to find the locations of certain binaries. This is a bug fix, since  is non-standard and so could break on some setups.Crossgcc: when building it for coreboot, fix mismatching GCC/GNAT versions so that they match, if multiple versions are present. This was done because Debain Trixie initially had GCC 14 and GNAT 13, whereas we need GNAT to build the Intel video init code on many mainboards.T480/T480: Disable TPM2 to mitigate a hang in SeaBIOS due to buggy drivers.: Fix the  package, renamed it to , which works on bookworm  newer, but the former did not.: don’t initialise the  variable globally, reset it per target instead, to prevent some repositories from being wrongly re-cloned.Thinkpad T480 / Dell OptiPlex 3050: Handle FSP insertion post-release, rather than providing FSP images directly in release images. It is now handled by the  command, copying the reference image from coreboot and splitting it upp and rebasing it, to mitigate certain technicalities of Intel’s FSP license, which otherwise permits free redistribution.Safer, more reliable exit when handling vendor files, because in some cases lbmk was leaving the  file in place (erroneously).Safer exit when running the  commands, so that lbmk is more likely to exit, because it was theoretically possible that it might not under certain edge cases.Disable nvme hotplug on Dell OptiPlex 3050 Micro, to prevent replugging in Linux, which would otherwise lead to possible data corruption.T480: Fix coreboot SPD size to 512 instead of 256 (it was already auto-corrected to 512 at build time, but the original configs were 256 which is wrong).Add tarballs and gpg signatures to Another bug focus in this release was to clean up the logic of Libreboot’s build system, and fix several bugs, especially those relating to error handling.A lot of cleanup was done on the init functions used by the build system, to initialise common variables, such as environmental variables, and temporary files and/or directories; such logic was moved to a new script called .In descending order from the latest changes to the earliest changes:: simplify : simplify : simplify : simplify : tidy up : simplify general cleanup in  and xbmk: rename / variables (shorten them): consolidate printf statements: remove redundant printf in : remove superfluous command in : simplify : simplify : rename , which actually handles general init tasks, including the processing of vendor files where appropriate.: simplify ccache handling for coreboot; make-oldconfig wasn’t needed at all, when cooking configs to enable ccache, so the  function became much smaller and was then merged with : simplify u-boot payload handling, by using a single variable name that defines the type of U-Boot tree. This allows several other U-Boot-related checks to be greatly simplified, as they were.: add a colon at the end of a  loop: make  easier to understand, by not using shorthand conditional statements in the for loop handling a repository or file download.: merge  with : set pyver from  instead of the main function.: merge  with : only update version files on parent, to speed up xbmk: simplify unknown version creation, where none was created and no Git metadata exists.: only set xbmk version on parent instance; we only need to read what was set, on child instances. In other words, apply the principle of least privelege.: initialise variables AFTER path, to avoid unnecessary work inside child instances of xbmk.: merge  with : Set python version only on parent instances of xbmk, to speed up operation of the xbmk build system.:  to : move  creation to : move PATH init to : shorten the  variable name: simplify : simplify : use  on find command for , so as to remove the need for a more complicated while loop inside said function.: move  to  and only run it on releases; don’t do it on normal xbmk Git. It’s only needed in the former context, because that has to do with distribution by the project, and this makes development easier. Therefore, files are only purged within the release archives, but not during development.: simplify : merge  with : simplify : simplify  by using  for the file loop: simplify : simplify  config check: simplify  by using  for everything, instead of implementing redundant logic in the build system.: reduce indendation in ; simplify the for loop by replacing it with a call to  instead.: simplify : clean up the  after release: removed an unnecessary  command: split up  into smaller functions: remove the unnecessary  function: move  to : move  to : split up  into smaller functions: move  to : remove the  variable: define  here instead: remove : simplify : simplify : split up  into smaller functions: only compile nvmutil if needed: simplified serprog check: tidy up variables: split up  into smaller functions: further cleanup for , such that all vendor-download functions are only defined in ; this means that the Canoeboot version of the file can remain in much closer sync, with fewer differences.: simplified srcdir check on make-clean: split download functions to a new file, : split up the inject functions into smaller functions for each specific task.xbmk: use  instead of , where appropriate, because it handles globbing perfectly these days, and  is cleaner in most cases.: fix outdated info in a comment: use direct comparison for metmp, to speed up checking so many files.: remove unnecessary line break: re-split tree logic to new file, : move release functions to : use  for fail variables: remove useless export; variables that are y/n can just be reset to  if not set to , for simplicity.: export  in  instead of .: simplify : simplified MAC address handling: Simplify : Remove useless command in : rename  and  functions (make the names shorter).: Simplified  and removed ; fe didn’t prefix  to a given command, but fx did. Now, it is prefix manually, for greater control, on commands that need stricter error handling, while it can be avoided on commands where strict error handling is unfeasible.: Create serprog tarballs here instead;  was simplified to use mkhelp when building actual images.build serprog images using , to tidy up xbmk: build serprog images with , rather than implementing a specific for loop.: insanely optimise the me bruteforce, by operating on files recursively via the  function, instead of manually implementing a recursive file search, when bruteforce-extracting  images.: Simplify git am handling by using the new  or  function, instead of making a specific while loop.: remove an unused function: New function  to execute path files; this is used instead of for loops all around xbmk, to simplify operations where the output of a file search is used as argument to a function.: Further simplified FSP extraction: Write sort errors to : Remove warning of empty args; it’s really not required, since it’s obvious anyway in the resulting final error message.xbmk: Replace  with much simpler implementation, for reliability and bug prevention.: simplify : simplify : move  to : simplify extract_intel_me_bruteforce(): Remove unnecessary check: reduce indentation: Move FSP extraction only to , since that’s the only place where it’s needed.: tidy up intel me handling: tidy up the deguard command: single-quote xbmklock in : define lock file in a variable instead; this makes it more flexible, because the path can be checked and then re-used nicely.: tidy up ; make the command style more consistent: rename errx to xmsg: tidy up TBFW handling: remove useless comment block: tidy up the python version check: move non-init functions to : simplify dependencies handling: tidy up : tidy up xgccargs handling: generally removed dead code: tidy up pathdir creation: tidy up : reduce indentation in : Allow use of x_ on prefix functions: tidy up  sha512sum check: simplify : general code cleanup: simplify : simplified fsp extraction: Remove redundant code in copy_tbfwxbmk: Unified local ./tmp handling: redirect find errors to  to prevent clutter on the user’s terminal: unified handling of ./tmp: include rom.sh directly: support multiple arguments in remkdir(): simplify remkdir(): move setvars/err_ to lib.sh: Generally modularised it, moving separate tasks into separate functions, rathher than having it be one big monolith. was renamed to , so that future changes can be in better sync between lbmk and cbmk on this file, because the cbmk version has the MAC address changer (but no vendorfile handling). In the future, this will be split so that  exists again, containing only the vendorfile handling, and  will only handle MAC addresses.: Several variables were moved out of this file and elsewwhere in lbmk.Moved the  function to  instead of Moved the  function from  to .: Use a more top-down function order, more clear, and it was split into an extra file  that does the most basic lbmk initialisation at startup, whereas what remains in  really are generic library functions used throughout lbmk.: Removed unused crossgcc linking feature, because we don’t use it anymore (coreboot trees have their own crossgcc and never link to another these days). Libreboot used to have many more coreboot trees, some of which re-used crossgcc from another tree. Similarly, the accompanying variable  is no longer handled. The  variable is still handled, because projects like U-Boot use that to configure crossgcc.include/vendor.sh: Removed unnecessary check against the ROM image size. Generally simplified the processing of release images.include/git.sh`: Removed many redundant functions, merging several of them.: Fixed a bad print, making proper use of a string inside a printf statement.Simplified many file checks in lbmk, by using the  function.Removed a bunch of useless  commands in general, throughout lbmk, making the code much cleaner.lbmk: the  function is now used much more aggressively, for error handling, simplifying error handling in lbmk overall. main script: Merged the  script with it, so now it’s all one script. The  script is now the only executable script in lbmk. (main script): The  command is removed (legacy / obsolete).The version/versiondate files are now dotfiles, to hide during operation.: Hardcoded projectname/projectsite variables, instead of storing them in a file. script: Unified handling of flags (same string used in error output), to ensure that error(usage) messages always match. script (later merged into ): Removed a lot of old bloat.: Make the checksum word position a define. Generally cleaned up a lot of code to make it clearer for the reader. Added more verbose messages to the user, confirming things such as how much was read or written on the user’s file system. Various miscallaneous bug fixes (edge cases that were unlikely to ever be triggered).: More efficient use of memory when handling files.: Much cleaner handling of user input.`util/nvmutil: More granular MAC address parsing errors, easy for debugging.: Make the Gbe Checksum a define, for readibility.: Obey the 79-character-per-line limit, as per lbmk coding style.: Tidied up several pledge callsRemoved use of several unnecessary subshells and  statements in lbmk.: Later, the GCC/GNAT matching feature was rewritten to work both ways, where an older GCC was matched to GNAT and vice versa, whereas it previously only went one way.  and  are manipulated in  to ensure that the user has a consistent version of both. later merged into the  script (which later merged into the main  script). This  is what contained the first implementation of the GNAT/GCC version matching feature.: Remove unnecessary shebang, and the same on other  scripts. NOTE:  was later merged into , which then became split into  in later changes (see above).Removed legacy build system commands e.g.  and ; now only the newer  commands are supported. This and the change below was briefly reverted, for the 20241206 revisions, but then re-introduced.Removed the deprecated  command; now only  commands are used. The  commands are used, for downloading vendor files.Removed unused patch that was for the original deguard implementation, prior to Mate Kukri’s re-write of it.This log shows all changes in today’s release, from 30 June 2025, ever since the Libreboot 20241206 release of 6 December 2025:* c46a71138c7 Libreboot 25.06 release

The campaign disseminates false narratives by impersonating media outlets with the apparent aim of sowing division in democratic countries. While the campaign targets audiences around the world, including in the US, its main target has been Ukraine. Hundreds of AI-manipulated videos from the campaign have tried to fuel pro-Russian narratives.The report outlines how, between September 2024 and May 2025, the amount of content being produced by those running the campaign has increased dramatically and is receiving millions of views around the world.In their report, the researchers identified 230 unique pieces of content promoted by the campaign between July 2023 and June 2024, including pictures, videos, QR codes, and fake websites. Over the last eight months, however, Operation Overload churned out a total of 587 unique pieces of content, with the majority of them being created with the help of AI tools, researchers said.The researchers said the spike in content was driven by consumer-grade AI tools that are available for free online. This easy access helped fuel the campaign’s tactic of “content amalgamation,” where those running the operation were able to produce multiple pieces of content pushing the same story thanks to AI tools.“This marks a shift toward more scalable, multilingual, and increasingly sophisticated propaganda tactics,” researchers from Reset Tech, a London-based nonprofit that tracks disinformation campaigns, and Check First, a Finnish software company, wrote in the report. “The campaign has substantially amped up the production of new content in the past eight months, signalling a shift toward faster, more scalable content creation methods.”Researchers were also stunned by the variety of tools and types of content the campaign was pursuing. "What came as a surprise to me was the diversity of the content, the different types of content that they started using,” Aleksandra Atanasova, lead open-source intelligence researcher at Reset Tech, tells WIRED. “It's like they have diversified their palette to catch as many like different angles of those stories. They're layering up different types of content, one after another.”Atanasova added that the campaign did not appear to be using any custom AI tools to achieve their goals, but were using AI-powered voice and image generators that are accessible to everyone.While it was difficult to identify all the tools the campaign operatives were using, the researchers were able to narrow down to one tool in particular: Flux AI.Flux AI is a text-to-image generator developed by Black Forest Labs, a German-based company founded by former employees of Stability AI. Using the SightEngine image analysis tool, the researchers found a 99 percent likelihood that a number of the fake images shared by the Overload campaign—some of which claimed to show Muslim migrants rioting and setting fires in Berlin and Paris—were created using image generation from Flux AI.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to safely change StorageClass reclaimPolicy from Delete to Retain without losing existing PVC data?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lpavii/how_to_safely_change_storageclass_reclaimpolicy/</link><author>/u/kiroxops</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 19:24:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I have a StorageClass in my Kubernetes cluster that uses reclaimPolicy: Delete by default.

Well, I've still been working on it daily ever since then, and it's not quite so little anymore, so I thought I'd provide an update here in case anyone was curious about how everything's going.It uses Rust on the backend and TypeScript on the frontend. The only frontend dependencies are TypeScript, Solid JS, and mutative. The backend server runs on a $5 / month monolithic server and mostly uses axum, sqlx, Postgres, strum, tokio, tungstenite, rand, and oauth2.I've also really optimized the code since then. Previously, user requests would use JSON, but I've since migrated to binary websockets. So now most requests and responses are only a few bytes each (variable length binary encoding).I also wrote some derive macro crates that convert Rust data types to TypeScript. So I can annotate my Rust structs / enums and it generates interface definitions in TypeScript land for them, along with functions to decode the binary into the generated interface types. So Rust is my single source of truth (as opposed to having proto files or something). Some simple encoding / decoding crates then serialize my Rust data structures into compact binary (so much faster and smaller than JSON). Most of the data sent (like item IDs, quantities, etc.) are all small positive integers, and with this encoding protocol each is only 1 byte (variable length encoding).So now I can write something like this:#[derive(BinPack, FromRow, ToTS, DecodeTS)] pub struct ResponseProfile { pub person_id: PersonID, pub handle: String, pub created_at: UnixTimestamp, pub fishing_casts: i32 } and the following TypeScript is automatically generated:export interface ResponseProfile { person_id: PersonID; handle: string; created_at: UnixTimestamp; fishing_casts: number; } export function decodeResponseProfile(dv: MyDecoder): ResponseProfile { return { person_id: decodePersonID(dv), handle: dv.getStr(), created_at: decodeUnixTimestamp(dv), fishing_casts: dv.getInt(), }; } Another design change was that previously I used a lot of  for many things in the web server (like everyone's current luck, activity feed, rate limiters, etc.) I never liked this and after a lot of thinking I finally switched towards an approach where each player is a separate actor, and channels are used to send messages to them, and they own their own state in their own tokio task. So each player actor now owns their activity feed, game states, current luck, arena battle state, etc. This has led to a much cleaner (and much more performant!) architecture and I was able to delete a ton of mutexes / rwlocks, and new features are much easier to add now.With these changes, I was able to be much more productive and added a ton of new locations, activities, items, etc. I added new puzzles, games, dark mode, etc. And during all of this time, the Rust server has still never crashed in the entire 3 years it's been running (compared to my old Node JS days this provides me  much peace of mind). The entire codebase (frontend + backend) has grown to be around 130,000 lines of code, but the code is still so simple and adding new features is still really trivial. And whenever I refactor anything, the Rust compiler tells me everything I need to change. It's so nice because I never have to worry about breaking anything because the compiler always tells me anything I need to update. If I had to do everything over again I would still choose Rust 100% because it's been nothing but a pleasure.But yeah, everything is still going great and it's so much fun coming up with new stuff to add all the time. Here's some screenshots and a trailer I made recently if you want to see what it looks like (also, almost every asset is an SVG since I wanted all the characters and locations to look beautiful at every browser zoom level). Also, I'd love to hear any feedback, critique, thoughts, or ideas if you have any!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Graph Theory Applications in Video Games</title><link>https://utk.claranguyen.me/talks.php?id=videogames</link><author>/u/ketralnis</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 18:14:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
			Maze Generation is an element in games that can give players a unique
			experience every time they play. Doing them efficiently can be
			accomplished via Graph Theory. If you attended
			my previous talk, you will know
			how powerful the Disjoint-Set data structure is for object detection.
			In this talk, however, we're going to use it to generate mazes...
			the right way.

			Observing Properties of Mazes
			Let's see what we got here... There are a few things about mazes that
			we should pay attention to prior to making one ourselves:

			
					Cells are "matched" with a select few adjacent ones. Cells that
					have been matched do not have a wall between them.
					
					All cell pairs that are not "matched" have a wall separating
					them.
					
					Mazes can be represented as graphs. Depending on the properties
					of the maze, it can be a minimum spanning tree.
					
					We can use typical graph algorithms to find solutions to mazes.
					Popular choices include DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS
					(Breadth-First Search). We can use them to find a solution from
					any  to any , easily.
					

			Now then, let's talk about Disjoint-Sets...

			The Disjoint-Set Data Structure
			Initially, treat this data structure as if we have  disjoint
			sets (hence the name), not connected to each other at all. When
			thinking about a maze, treat this as a maze where  walls are
			up, and you can't go from any cell to any other cell. Then, we can use
			operations to manipulate this data structure and connect cells
			together.
			
			We have two operations we can use:  and  Join two disjoint sets together.
					 Get the vertex that is at the "root" of a disjoint
					set. This is the "ID" of that set.
					

			Let's discuss them... For now, let's only talk about .
			 has a neat optimisation that'll come in handy later.

			
			This one is trivial. Join two disjoint sets together. For this
			part, I'm going to notate it as  where
			S = S ⋃ S.  we merge the two sets S and
			S into S. Then, S is
			obliterated.

			
			Let's show a visual example of this... It might make some things
			click more easily.
			 Assume a graph  where  (there
			are 16 vertices) and  (there are 0 edges). Each
			separate vertex is part of its own set S(
				v ∈ S,
				v ∈ S,
				...,
				v ∈ S,
			). Shown as a 4 × 4 grid, we have the following:

			

			Now let's say we performed . The figures below
			show the selection of 1 and 2 (left) as well as the result of the
			union operation (right), visually:

			 = { 1, 2 }. S is empty and
			obliterated. How about we try a  now?

			
			To properly generate a maze, we can just keep repeating this
			procedure until there is only one set left.
			

			At this point, the only remaining set is S = {
				v,
				v,
				...,
				v
			}.

			We are unable to merge anymore sets (and break anymore walls)
			because they all belong in the same set already. Any other walls
			being broken down will force a  to appear in the
			graph. Let's break down the kind of graph we have just created:

			
					The maze generation algorithm we just used is known as
					Randomised Kruskal's Algorithm.
					
					There are no cycles in this graph.
					
					There is exactly one path from every  to every
					.
					
					If drawn as a graph, it is a minimal spanning tree.
					
					It tends to generate mazes with patterns that are easy to
					solve.
					

			Though, this wouldn't be a talk by me though if I didn't say we can
			do better, now would it? Let's expand on this concept:
			A simple square maze is boring. We can do better.
			We can connect 2 mazes together by breaking down a wall between
			them. We can even add a "hallway" between them if we wanted. This
			is only possible because there exists a path from every  to
			every .
			
			Thus, if we broke down a wall on the outer end of the maze and
			merged two together, there will always exist a path from one maze
			to the other, as there will always be a path to the cell with the
			outer wall we broke. Here's what I mean:

			

			This kind of "horizontal expansion" is possible with mazes.
			We can also do this vertically. Notice, though, that there is a
			valid path from anywhere in the left maze to anywhere in the right
			maze. To take this to the extreme, we can  do better,
			and expand the maze by an  (or a few, if we
			really wanted to). Let's give it a second floor...

			

			We can go on, but I think this gets the point across. We can also
			combine the horizontal/vertical expansion with this "elevator" to
			make some pretty unique (but also tedious) puzzles!

			
			The "find" operation is used to find the ID of the set a vertex
			belongs in. I'll denote it as . If S = {
			v, v } and I call , it'll
			return 0, because v ∈ S. By the time the
			maze generation algorithm above is done, calling  on
			any vertex will return 0, as they are all in S.
			 of two sets, in a graph theory sense,
			is simply connecting an edge between two points, the 
			operation is simply going up to the  of the tree and
			returning that value. Let's go though the previous maze generation
			example once more. This time, let's see how a  is built
			from all of this.

			

			Now that we've constructed the graph, let's order it to where the
			coloured node (the root) is at the top. It'll look like this:

			
			There's something bad about this... Take a look at the deepest node
			in that tree. Since  just goes up to the top and returns
			the root node, it has to go through  vertices before it
			returns. That's an O(n) operation right there.
			
			Now, I'm not going to make a huge deal out of a linear-time lookup.
			A maze of size 2048 × 2048 would speak for itself. But, like
			I said, we can do better... .

			
			There are two techniques we can apply to our operations to make
			find() perform much better:  and ...

			 - When merging two sets, attach the
					shorter tree to the taller one. This forces minimal (or no)
					growth of the tree. In fact, at most, the tree can only
					grow in height by 1 from this.
					 - Make every node point straight to
					the root node.
					

			The visuals of these two would get messy quite quickly, so I
			decided to not draw them out. But I think those explanations make
			it obvious how these improve on what we had before.
			
			Now then... with these optimisations in place, our O(n) lookup time
			suddenly becomes lg n (iterated logarithm base 2). In
			the world of Computer Science, this is essentially . For the record, if x = 2, then
			lg(x) = 5. Here's a table of values just to show
			how slow the equation grows...

			a is not a typo. It's known as
			tetration,
			and is a step up from exponents. If I said 2, that's
			the same as 2. 2 =
			2. You get the idea.

				This website is a trip down memory lane.
				I'm not trying to tell you to stop modern web development.
				This website uses technologies not available at the time the content here is about.
				It works on mobile (tested in Firefox for Android) but you miss out on the background image.
			
			I created my first website somewhere in the early 2000s,
			and like most websites back then, it was very simple.
			Not surprising, considering most people (including me) were likely using notepad to create those websites,
			which puts a limit on their complexity.
			It was either that or  editors that would chain you to themselves
			because there was no chance the generated HTML would be maintainable at all without the tool,
			and if you did manual edits it could outright break your editor.
			There were no iPhones, there was barely any SEO, and JavaScript really was optional, and so was CSS.
			The color representation on early LCD screens was bad, so you better picked a color scheme with high contrast.
		
			The resolution of choice was 1024×768 (or 1280×1024 if you could afford it),
			and yet with the window frame and the toolbars we had back then your website should better also work on 800×600.
			You didn't want to have content right up to the edge of the left or right screen border anyways.
		
			For reference, this image shows the resolutions 1920×1080 (HD), 1280×1024, 1024×768,
			and 800×600 in relation to each other.
			The simplest sites were just plain HTML without anything beyond the basic formatting.
			Sometimes a  and  if we felt fancy.
			People that cared would change the font to a sans-serif type,
			often using a  tag that went around the entire page.
			There weren't a lot of safe fonts out there, and your choices were as follows:
		:
				Serif fonts being the default made this look like a mistake or low effort,
				but in the right places could add some nostalgia.
				And it does look professional, considering it's the "newspaper font".
				Being the default, it is also what you got if the font of choice
				by the website owner was not installed on your system.

			Animated gif images were always an option, but they eat up valuable bandwidth.
			For simple move or blink animations,
			the  and  tags had you covered.
			The marquee is deprecated but still works. Blink was removed
			but a bit of JS .
			In that regards, please enjoy the most important animation ever in pure HTML.
		
			In absence of most CSS features we now take for granted,
			tiny images were common to achieve things like color gradient, rounded border edges
			and fancy looking buttons. It wasn't uncommon for a site to be made up of 10 or more images for this purpose.
		
			We also occasionally added background images.
			These were usually very small and would tile across the page.
			You could steal them from an existing website, or make one yourself.
			In fact, I proudly present the literal "wall" paper on this page, created in mspaint in two minutes.
			It's around 130 bytes. Not as fancy as an animated image but better than a solid color.
			If the wallpaper made text unreadable we would either go into mspaint and floodfill it with a different color,
			or just increase the font size.
			We weren't in a rush, and didn't need to cram as much information as possible into the viewport either.
		
			The fancy people would make the background image stay put when scrolling the content, just like on this page.
		Partitioning your website
			Modern websites have it easy.
			If you want your header or a menu to stay visible you can just use 
			and voilà, your element will stay inside of the viewing area when scrolling.
		
			We didn't had this luxury, but what we had were framesets.
			A frameset was (actually still is) a way of partitioning the browser window,
			and displaying individual pages inside of those partitions.
			Many websites would have the following layout:
		
			Unless blocked with an attribute,
			users could drag the frame border around to change the partition ratio.
			The border could also be made invisible, creating a seamless experience.
			If the background color of each frame was the same you could usually not tell that frames were there,
			unless you were looking closely during the page load.
		
			The frames could interact with each other.
			You could give them an identifier using the  attribute,
			and links could change the URL of a given frame using the  attribute.
			My first background music changer worked this way.
			A frame could contain a website, or another frameset, allowing to partition the window multiple times.
		
			Yes this technology still works. It is marked as deprecated but
			it will still render and behave like it did over 20 years ago.
		
			Tables were pretty much the only universal means of creating a responsive web layout.
			If you fixed the width of all but one column the unfixed column would adjust in width automatically
			to the current window size if the table width was set to 100%.
		
			Tables were also the first universal way of vertically centering content
			using the  attribute.
			The frameset layout shown above would occasionally be made with tables
			rather than frames. People would shove entire websites into single table cells.
		
			Responsive meant it would adjust to the screen size of a computer.
			Nobody cared about the modern doomscrolling rectangles because they didn't exist yet.
			We did not have flexbox, but float:left gets you quite far.
		
			The early solution to mobile devices was a completely separate website,
			optimized for small screens. People would be redirected based on the user agent string.
		
			JavaScript is a language designed to be just barely good enough to make animated gif images
			dance around on the page and for the content around your mouse cursor to sparkle
			when you move it.
			And this is exactly how we used it. This and drop down menus.
			Anything beyond that would get you into the realm of browser compatibility problems.
			Those problems are what made jQuery popular because it detected your browser
			and abstracted all the differences it had with other browsers away,
			but for a very long time, conditional HTML comments were the norm to make IE behave.
			Practically every page had a <!--[if IE lt 7]>...<![endif]--> section.
			For most small scripts, you would go to a site like  (defunct),
			search for the script you wanted, and copy paste it into your website.
			This behavior hasn't significantly changed although now you go to stackoverflow or ask an AI.
			Back then copy pasting scripts was your best bet
			because JS debugging tools were virtually non-existent at that time.
			Script loading would (and still does) block the page from rendering anything below it,
			so script tags were traditionally put at the bottom of the page rather than the header,
			and small scripts were inlined.
			Today we have the  attribute.
		
			A script at the bottom of course meant users with slow connections
			could try to interact with your page before it fully loaded in.
			This was often solved by making the main page element hidden initially
			and displaying a "Loading" text (or gif if you were fancy) instead.
			A small script that was jammed into the  attribute of the body
			would then hide the loading banner and show the main content.
		
			If you ever need to make a page interactable before it is fully loaded,
			use a mutation observer on the document root element that monitors added nodes.
			Then simply add the events to the relevant elements as they're streamed in.
			We didn't had that back then. Instead we would register a setInterval function
			that frequently added events, and unregistered said function in the onload event.
		
			Regardless of the amount of scripts on a page,
			serious websites would work to some extent without it,
			simply because JS was a security problem, and so was disabled in many corporate environments.
			The  tag can be used to render any content (including  tags)
			if scripts are disabled. This is usually used to inform the user that JS is necessary,
			or to provide a link to a less interactive version of the site.
			However JS is now considered a base requirement for most websites.
			Sites that use JS based UI rendering will just remain blank if JS is disabled.
		Dynamic Server Side Content
			A super fancy page would show dynamic content from the server and update it.
			The simplest solution that worked in all browsers was an iframe with a meta refresh tag inside.
			It would unconditionally reload the iframe. By making the border invisible people wouldn't even be able to tell.
			This of course is kinda bad because you reload the page regardless of whether there is new content to show or not.
		
			Long polling must be among the dirtiest, nastiest tricks we used to get content to dynamically update from the server.
			When you load a website, your browser actually renders the HTML elements as they're streamed from the network.
			This is why on some slow sites the width of various elements changes as the site loads.
			HTTP was strictly a client to server initiated protocol.
			We figured out however that you can abuse the HTML streaming behavior
			to implement a server to client initiated protocol.
			You would do this by loading a page in an iframe that was purposefully designed to never stop loading.
			It would occasionally send an invisible HTML comment to keep the connection open,
			but would otherwise remain silent until it was necessary to push new content to the client.
			You would then simply send a  tag with new JavaScript instructions inside,
			or if the content was purely for display purposes,
			a  with the content inside, plus a piece of CSS code to hide the previous div.
			Websites would grow indefinitely with this but you could simply solve this with a meta refresh
			that triggered when the connection ended.
			It was crude but it was dynamic content without JS.
			We built entire live chat systems around this.
		
			The first true way to replace long polling are websockets.
			HTTP 2 and 3 have the ability to push events to the client without waiting for a client request
			in what is known as "server push" but I've never seen it in the wild.
		
			Ajax stands for "Asynchronous javascript and XML".
			It was invented by Microsoft to streamline communication between web browsers (only Internet Explorer actually)
			and the Exchange Server web interface. The technology is actually quite old.
			Internet Explorer 5 was the first browser to ship with this, but others were quickly to adopt it too.
			Microsoft products intensively use XML, which is why XML is contained in "Ajax",
			why the JS object to make requests is named ,
			and why there's a dedicated  property in it.
		
			Anything not covered by web standards could be extended using ActiveX.
			This was basically a way to load and call functions from native DLLs that registered themselves as an ActiveX component.
			This was necessary to play video. It was also needed for audio if you desired any control over the playback whatsoever
			because  would not allow you to control playback
			beyond replacing its value with "about:blank" using JS to stop it entirely.
			Now deprecated,  was replaced with .
			And thankfully, fully automated audio playback on page load is not permitted by modern browsers
			because that is certainly something I don't want back.
		
			Back then, ActiveX was also a way to bypass some system restrictions.
			At school they would block the remote desktop client, but that block was only for the executable.
			I would just load the MSTSCAX library into a html file and then use the web browser to connect to my home computer
			whenever I found a website being blocked.
		
			The entire system was a nightmare but Microsoft could basically do whatever they desired
			because of the massive market share that Internet Explorer had.
			Every browser implemented this differently, and you had to update these components all the time.
		
			Flash (see: "Vulnerability as a Service") allowed you to do many things that initially weren't possible without,
			including but not limited to video and audio playback without depending on locally installed codecs,
			live streaming, file uploads with a progress bar, and networked multiplayer games.
			At some point it was basically mandatory to have it installed
			because most websites would to some extent depend on it.
		
			Bandwidth was obviously at a premium.
			And while times were slower back then,
			we would not want to wait for ages either.
			DSL was just getting popular,
			and I was lucky enough to start out with a 5000/500 kbps connection.
			A good website however would load in an acceptable manner on a dialup connection.
			These were commonly known as "56k" because that was their speed under ideal conditions,
			56 kilobits per second. This amounts to 7 kilobytes per second.
			You often would get a bit more because the connection supported compression,
			and HTML is fairly simple to compress.
		
			Images were considered high Bandwidth media back then, and you would not fill your page with them
			without some serious modifications.
			The image further below is a new version of the Windows XP default wallpaper known as "bliss"
			that Microsoft recently released. The colors in their version are more muted than the original,
			but I found this "corrected" version that's more in spirit with the original.
			The image is 2'345'199 bytes in size.
			This would load 5.5 minutes given a 56k connection.
			To improve load speeds we first drop the resolution.
			If our site should work with 800×600 displays
			there is no need to have this image in its original 4089×2726 size,
			and because we likely don't have the full size of the screen available due to the frameset menu,
			we can scale it down to fit 640×480 (the OG VGA resolution).
		
			Next is the quality. By setting the jpeg to 75% quality we can further reduce the size.
			This quality value is good for noisy pictures like this but will show artifacts around hard borders,
			of which there are none.
			With those limits the image will load in about 6 seconds.
		
			We can simulate a faster image load by saving it as a progressive image.
			Progressive images don't store the pixels in the normal order, but rather store them in groups.(This is a simplification)
			The first group will only store every 8th pixel horizontally and vertically.
			The next group will store every 4th pixel (minus those already contained in the first group),
			and so on until all pixels are represented.
			Depending on how good your eyes are you may not even notice the last pass.
			Images stored this way will slightly increase in size,
			but rather than having to wait for it to slowly appear line by line,
			we can fairly quickly render an initial (blurry) version that progressively (hence the name) gets better.
			This is also possible with PNG images.
		
			The image below has been saved with all the given constraints and settings mentioned above.
			It is now about 35 KB. To see it load progressively,
			refresh the page or open the image in a new tab.
		
			If you did not want to compromise on the quality you would
			create a thumbnail that when clicked, would navigate the user to the raw image.
		
			Here's the PHP code that converted this image
		$bliss = ImageCreateFromJpeg('bliss.jpg');
// "-1" means to calculate height to keep aspect ratio
$scaled = ImageScale($bliss, 640, -1, IMG_BICUBIC);
ImageDestroy($bliss);
// Enable progressive scan
ImageInterlace($scaled, TRUE);
// Save with 75% quality
ImageJpeg($scaled, 'bliss_scaled.jpg', 75);
ImageDestroy($scaled);
			If the client had JavaScript enabled,
			you could load the image using JS only when the user scrolls the image into view.
			This could save substantial bandwidth on image heavy sites.
			You can still do this, but the browser does it automatically if you add the  attribute.
			This also stops the image from blocking the page load event.
		
			Images could be made interactive to some extent.
			If the image was inside of an  tag, the attribute 
			could be added to the image. When clicking, the browser would navigate to the URL in the link,
			but adds the X and Y coordinate as  query string to the URL.
			This allows a server to check where in the image the user clicked. This allowed for image based menus,
			or a "Where's Waldo" (or "Wally" in some countries) style game.
			Later came client side image maps, which are invisible clickable regions you could overlay over an image.
		
			Both of these technologies still work,
			none of them are marked as deprecated either.
		
			Yolo driven development was the norm back then for personal sites and small company pages.
			You changed a few lines, then uploaded your changes to your webserver with an FTP client,
			likely not even encrypted.
			Your choices were PHP on an Apache web server and ASP on an IIS.
			Staging environment? What staging environment?
		
			It was crude, but oh boy was it fast to get something going.
			PHP is easy to get started, more forgiving than other languages, available practically everywhere,
			and still actively maintained.
			At this point it has probably gained cockroach status and will be around for ages.
		
			This is also how this website is deployed. Except instead of FTP I use syncthing
			because I want it to upload automatically when I change something,
			but straight to prod it goes.
			It doesn't needs any form of compilation or build process whatsoever.
		
			Simpler times. Not necessarily better, but simpler.
			We achieved a lot with less. We optimized our media, and used very little scripting.
			Now we don't. Nobody cares anymore if your website is 10 or 20 megabytes.
			Do I miss creating websites in a plain text editor? No. I want to keep my IDE with syntax highlighting,
			syntax checking, and code completion.
			I also want to keep the libraries that make my life easier.
			I haven't written an SQL statement in my backend code for a long time now.
			SQL ORM mappers are great.
			Do I wish we would create simpler pages again? Yes.
			I believe that although websites back then were simpler and technology more limited,
			it was not necessarily worse than today, but the average website now feels bloated and overengineered.
			The internet is no longer a place of creation; it is a place of consumption.
			I want the world wide web wild west back (call it W5 or whatever).
			I want search engines to find wacky websites again.
			I don't want to please algorithms of our corporate overlords.
			Writing this page, I just found out that in 2021, Warner Bros has taken down the original Space Jam website from 1996.
			I would have liked to put it here,
			but I guess the web archive is your only hope now.
			If you have time, check out how the main menu on that site was made.
		
			In any case, my tribute to those times is a wordle clone.
			If you have Internet Explorer 1.5 or later, or any modern browser (I heard this Mozilla thing is taking off),
			you can play a game of wordle here.
			I recommend you use at least IE 2.0 because 1.5 lacks color support, which makes the clues less visible.
		
			If you want to go super oldschool and can get a copy of NCSA Mosaic running (the first ever web browser),
			you can play the game here instead.
			I can confirm the browser does run on Windows XP, and possibly later versions of Windows,
			but likely only on 32 bit versions.
			Note: The WWW was designed to share crudely formatted scientific documents and link them,
			which explains why it's so hostile towards making screen oriented applications
			but has a plethora of features what work well for print media.
			This early feature set is exactly what Mosaic 1.0 provides.
			It lacks color support and doesn't even has means for text input,
			but I managed to cobble together something for it anyways.
			Its HTTP support is best described as "somewhat there", which explains why this wordle version runs on its own port.
		
			You're experiencing it right now.
			This website is looped through a RS-232 serial connection at 56k baud rate
			(actually a little bit extra to handle protocol overhead).
			I disabled the server cache so you can experience the scrollbar shrinking as content slowly loads in.
			But some things are worth the time. People may not even notice that your website is slow
			if you give them a bit of content to read before shoving an AI generated title image down their throat.
			You don't need a serial loopback for this,
			a tool like SlowPipe in front of your server does the same.

Since the beginning of the year, the clean energy industry has felt the pressure of looming IRA rollbacks. According to an analysis from energy NGO E2, around $15.5 billion in investment in new clean energy projects and factories has been lost since the start of the year, including more than $9 billion in Republican congressional districts.The intense hostility for solar and wind coming from the Trump administration may seem, to a logical person, to be at odds with its goal of “energy dominance.” Energy experts say that renewables—particularly when paired with batteries—are helping to bolster the US grid as energy needs soar. Texas, for instance, added more solar and battery storage than any other type of energy to its grid last year. As of this spring, wind and solar combined made up 42 percent of Texas’s installed generation capacity, more than any other state in the US. All that new solar and storage has, in turn, helped the grid stay stable during peak use, lowering the risk of blackouts during the first heatwaves of the summer—even as Texas faces never-before-seen summer demand this year, thanks to hot temperatures and the addition of energy-thirsty data centers. Yet in an op-ed published in the New York Post last week, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that wind and solar contribute to a “less stable grid.”Doug Lewin, an energy analyst based in Austin, points out that solar and batteries are particularly well-positioned to help out with grid demand during heatwaves, when the sun is shining—and people turn on their air conditioners.“We’re just in this situation where we are going to need massive amounts of power to deal with the heat,” he says. “We’ve gotta have air conditioning to keep people healthy and safe during these hellacious summers, which are getting worse. That’s just an objective matter.”It’s particularly ironic to see these kinds of pushbacks as the Trump administration goes all in on artificial intelligence, which, by some projections, could comprise nearly 12 percent of US power demand by the end of the decade. Right now, a global backlog in gas turbines is spelling trouble for those looking to scale up fast. Turbine producers like GE Vernova say they’ve already filled orders for the next few years, and project it may take several years for new customers to get their hands on a completed turbine. In April, the CEO of renewable and utility giant NextEra Energy told shareholders that he expects renewables to act as a “bridge,” helping to bolster the grid and buy time until bigger gas projects can come online.But even with the promise of AI using up every spare electron on the grid, the cultural backlash to renewables is as strong as ever—and it isn’t isolated to the White House. Despite Texas’s reliance on renewables, the state legislature battled over several bills this past session that would have seriously kneecapped solar and wind development in the state. Oklahoma, which relies on wind energy for a third of its energy needs, faces a growing movement to ban renewables altogether. Across the country, local governments, responding to grassroots movements, are pushing back against wind and solar projects on their land. (It’s important to note that many of these movements often include Democrats.)Lewin, who wrote about Texas’s legislative drama in detail this year in his newsletter, says it’s too simplistic to ascribe the hostility towards renewables as simply being funded by Big Oil. According to Politico, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, who has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from oil and gas interests over the course of her career, was an instrumental figure in changing the final Senate language to remove the excise tax. In Texas, the oil and gas lobby united with renewables to defeat a bill that would have made energy prices higher by increasing costs for wind and solar.“It feels like you’ve got a large number of really powerful folks who have just decided, or been convinced—and then had that belief reinforced by algorithms over and over—that somehow, wind and solar are the root of all evil and are causing every problem,” Lewin says. “It's bizarre. It's really hard to kind of understand this animus for technologies that have had a huge benefit.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hayro: An experimental, work-in-progress PDF rasterizer in pure Rust.</title><link>https://github.com/LaurenzV/hayro</link><author>/u/Frexxia</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:16:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why does Rust feel so well designed?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lp7562/why_does_rust_feel_so_well_designed/</link><author>/u/Glum-Psychology-6701</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:03:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm coming from Java and Python world mostly, with some tinkering in fsharp. One thing I notice about Rust compared to those languages is everything is well designed. There seems to be well thought out design principles behind everything. Let's take Java. For reasons there are always rough edges. For example List interface has a method called add. Immutable lists are lists too and nothing prevents you from calling add method on an immutable list. Only you get a surprise exception at run time. If you take Python, the zen contradicts the language in many ways. In Fsharp you can write functional code that looks clean, but because of the unpredictable ways in which the language boxes and unboxes stuff, you often get slow code. Also some decisions taken at the beginning make it so that you end up with unfixable problems as the language evolves. Compared to all these Rust seems predictable and although the language has a lot of features, they are all coherently developed and do not contradict one another. Is it because of the creator of the language doing a good job or the committee behind the language features has a good process?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Recommended preparation material for ML interviews.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lp6n1r/d_recommended_preparation_material_for_ml/</link><author>/u/South-Conference-395</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:44:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Below I am gathering some interview preparation tools for ML research positions.

On Monday, the group congregated near King's Cross station to demand that Google be more transparent about the safety checks it's running on its most cutting-edge AI models.PauseAI argues that Google broke a promise it made during the 2024 AI Safety Summit in Seoul, Korea, when the company agreed to consider external evaluations of its models and publish details about how external parties, including governments, were involved in assessing the risks.When Google launched Gemini 2.5 Pro, its latest frontier model, in April, it did neither of those things. The company said it was because the model was still "experimental." A few weeks later, it released a "model card" with some safety details, which some experts criticized for being too thin on details, TechCrunch previously reported. While the safety report made reference to third-party testers, it did not specify who they were."We are committed to developing AI safely and securely to benefit society," a Google DeepMind spokesperson told BI. "We continue to evolve our model testing and reporting to respond to rapid changes in the technology, and will continue to provide information that supports the responsible use of our AI models."For PauseAI, this isn't good enough. More importantly, the organization said, it's about not letting any lapse slip by and allowing Google to set a precedent."If we let Google get away with breaking their word, it sends a signal to all other labs that safety promises aren't important and commitments to the public don't need to be kept," said PauseAI organizing director Ella Hughes, addressing the crowd, which had gradually swelled to around 60 people."Right now, AI companies are less regulated than sandwich shops."Focusing on the specific issue of the Google safety report is a way for PauseAI to push for a specific and attainable near-term change.About 30 minutes into the protest, several intrigued passers-by had joined the cause. After a rousing speech from Hughes, the group proceeded to Google DeepMind's offices, where the fake courtroom production played out. Some Google employees leaving for the day looked bemused as chants of "Stop the race, it's unsafe" and "Test, don't guess" rang out."AI regulation on an international level is in a very bad place," PauseAI founder Joep Meindertsma told Business Insider, pointing to how US Vice President JD Vance warned against over-regulating AI at the AI Action Summit.Monday was the first time PauseAI had gathered over this specific issue, and it's not clear what comes next. The group is engaging with members of UK parliament who will run these concerns up the flagpole, but Meindertsma is reticent to say much about how Google is engaging with the group and their demands.Meindertsma hopes support will grow and references polls that suggest the public at large is concerned that AI is moving too fast. The group on Monday was made up of people from different backgrounds, including some who work in tech. Meindertsma himself runs a software development company and regularly uses AI tools from Google, OpenAI, and others."Their tools are incredibly impressive," he said, "which is the thing that worries me so much."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is os.Executable() reliable?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lp4rce/is_osexecutable_reliable/</link><author>/u/1oddbull</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 15:33:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The documentation says no guarantee that the path is pointing to the right executable.

This is made possible through standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows agents to interact with external tools and APIs. However, this new capability introduces a critical challenge: implementing fine-grained permissions and access controls based on “who can do what?”.Hardcoding  statements for user roles is not a scalable or secure solution. Modern applications require a dynamic authorization model that can make decisions based on a rich set of attributes - a model often referred to as Policy-Based Access Control or Attribute-Based Access Control.This guide will walk you through building a secure MCP server where AI Agent tool access is managed by Cerbos, a decoupled, policy-driven authorization service. You will learn how to enforce fine-grained authorization by externalizing access controls into human-readable policies.See how to implement dynamic authorization for AI agents, and fine-grained permissions in MCP servers, using Cerbos - speak with an engineer.The challenge. Static permissions in a dynamic AI worldWhen an AI Agent acts on behalf of a user, it must be subject to delegated (or an attenuated form of) permissions as that user. The challenge is that these Permissions are often complex and context-dependent. For example:A user might be able to  an expense but not  it.A manager might be able to  expenses, but only for their own team.An admin might be the only one who can  records.Implementing this logic directly in the MCP server creates brittle, hard-to-manage code. A change in your authorization policy requires a code change and a full redeployment.The solution. Decoupled authorization with Cerbos and MCPThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification that standardizes communication between AI Agents and external tools. An MCP server exposes a list of available tools, which any MCP client, be it a human in a chat application or a native AI agent, can then invoke to perform actions in your system.Cerbos is a stateless, open source authorization service that externalizes access controls into declarative YAML policies. Your application queries the Cerbos Policy Decision Point with a question like, "Can this principal perform this action on this resource?" Cerbos evaluates the relevant policies and returns a simple allow/deny decision in milliseconds. This enables powerful PBAC and ABAC without complicating your application logic.By combining MCP and Cerbos, you build a system where the MCP server defines , but dynamically enables only the ones the user has permission to use for a given request.Step-by-step implementation guideStep 1: Declarative policy authoringFirst, define your access controls in a Cerbos policy. This policy will govern which roles have permission to use which tools (actions).Create a  directory and add the following  file.File: policies/mcp_expenses.yamlapiVersion: "api.cerbos.dev/v1"
resourcePolicy:
  version: "default"
  resource: "mcp::expenses"
  rules:
    - actions: ["list_expenses"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles: ["admin", "manager", "user"]

    - actions: ["add_expense"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles: ["user"]

    - actions: ["approve_expense", "reject_expense"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles: ["admin", "manager"]

    - actions: ["delete_expense", "superpower_tool"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles: ["admin"]
Step 2: Deploying the Cerbos PDPRun the Cerbos PDP in Docker, mounting your policies directory. This makes your authorization policies live and ready to be queried.docker run --rm -it -p 3593:3593 \
  -v "$(pwd)/policies":/policies \
  ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:latest
Step 3: Integrating the MCP serverCreate a Node.js Express server that connects to the Cerbos PDP.npm install express @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @cerbos/grpc
Create the server: The code below defines every tool but uses  to perform a central authorization check. Based on the response, it dynamically enables only the permitted tools for the session. How the identity gets passed to this is out of scope, but with the recent OAuth improvements in the MCP spec, you will be able to token with the user's identity from an OAuth2 authorization server and pass it through to the MCP server.import express from "express";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import { GRPC } from "@cerbos/grpc";
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";

const cerbos = new GRPC("localhost:3593", { tls: false });

async function getServer({ user, sessionId }) {
  const server = new McpServer({ name: "CerbFinance MCP Server" });

  // Example tools - actual implementation is out of scope
  const tools = {
    list_expenses: server.tool(
      "list_expenses",
      "Lists expenses.",
      {},
      { title: "List Expenses" },
      async () => ({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] })
    ),
    add_expense: server.tool(
      "add_expense",
      "Adds an expense.",
      {},
      { title: "Add Expense" },
      async () => ({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] })
    ),
    approve_expense: server.tool(

      "Grants superpowers.",
      {},
      { title: "Superpower Tool" },
      async () => ({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] })
    ),
  };

  const toolNames = Object.keys(tools);

  // Central Authorization Check
  const authorizedTools = await cerbos.checkResource({
    principal: { id: user.id, roles: user.roles },
    resource: { kind: "mcp::expenses", id: sessionId },
    actions: toolNames,
  });

  for (const toolName of toolNames) {
    if (authorizedTools.isAllowed(toolName)) {
      tools[toolName].enable();
    } else {
      tools[toolName].disable();
    }
  }

  server.sendToolListChanged();
  return server;
}

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Middleware to simulate user authentication - use OAuth in production
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.user = { id: "user-123", roles: ["user"] }; // Test different roles here
  next();
});

app.post("/mcp",  async (req, res) => {
  const transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
sessionIdGenerator: undefined,
});
  const server = await getServer({
    user: req.user,
    sessionId: req.sessionId || randomUUID(),
  });
  await server.connect(transport);
  await transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
});
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("MCP Server running on port 3000"));
Testing your policy-driven AI agentYou can test your server using the MCP Client extension in VS Code.Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "MCP: Add Server".Enter your server URL: http://localhost:3000/mcp.Run in Copilot to open a chat window. The available tools will be listed.Example prompts by role: Change the  in  to simulate different users.As a  ():
"Add an expense for $100" -> Succeeds -> Fails (The agent reports it doesn't have the tool).As a  (roles: ['manager', 'user']):
 -> Succeeds -> FailsAs an  ():
 -> SucceedsBeyond roles - the power of ABACRole-Based Access Control is just the beginning. The real power of a decoupled authorization system is implementing ABAC. With Cerbos, you can write policies that use attributes from the user (), the resource, or the request itself.For example, to restrict managers to approving expenses only up to a certain amount, you could pass the amount as an attribute and write a condition, then do an additional check inside the tool implementation: (snippet of the Cerbos call):await cerbos.checkResource({
  principal: { id: user.id, roles: user.roles },
  resource: {
    kind: "mcp::expenses",
    id: sessionId,
    attr: { amount: 150 } // Pass resource attributes
  },
  actions: ["approve_expense"],
});
policies/mcp_expenses.yaml (snippet of the policy rule):- actions: ["approve_expense"]
  effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
  roles: ["manager"]
  condition:
    match:
      # The manager can only approve if the expense amount is less than 1000
      expr: request.resource.attr.amount < 1000
This demonstrates true fine-grained authorization that goes far beyond simple roles.By decoupling your authorization logic using Cerbos, you can build powerful, secure, and scalable AI Agents. This architecture allows you to manage Permissions through declarative policies, enabling you to implement everything from simple role-based rules to sophisticated ABAC without touching your application code. As AI agents become more integrated into our workflows, a robust, policy-driven approach to access controls is a necessity.For further details on mastering dynamic authorization for MCP servers with Cerbos, check out this piece.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lies we tell ourselves to keep using Golang</title><link>https://fasterthanli.me/articles/lies-we-tell-ourselves-to-keep-using-golang</link><author>/u/Nekuromento</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 11:15:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    👋 This page was last updated ~3 years ago. Just so you know.
                In the two years since I’ve posted I want off Mr Golang’s Wild
Ride, it’s made the rounds time and
time again, on Reddit, on Lobste.rs, on HackerNews, and elsewhere.And every time, it elicits the same responses:You talk about Windows: that’s not what Go is good at! (Also, who cares?)This is very one-sided: you’re not talking about the  sides of Go!You don’t understand the compromises Go makes.Large companies use Go, so it can’t be  bad!Modelling problems “correctly” is too costly, so caring about correctness is moot.Correctness is a spectrum, Go lets you trade some for development speed.Your go-to is Rust, which also has shortcomings, so your argument is invalid.There’s also a vocal portion of commenters who wholeheartedly agree with the
rant, but let’s focus on unpacking the apparent conflict here.I’ll first spend a short amount of time pointing out clearly disingenuous
arguments, to get them out of the way, and then I’ll move on to the fairer
comments, addressing them as best I can.When you don’t want to hear something, one easy way to not have to think about
it at all is to convince yourself that whoever is saying it is incompetent, or
that they have ulterior motives.For example, the top comment on HackerNews right now starts like this:The author fundamentally misunderstands language design.As an impostor syndrome enthusiast, I would normally be sympathetic to such
comments. However, it is a lazy and dismissive way to consider any sort of
feedback.It doesn’t take much skill to notice a problem.In fact, as developers get more and more senior, they tend to ignore more and
more problems, because they’ve gotten so used to it. That’s the way it’s always
been done, and they’ve learned to live with them, so they’ve stopped questioning
it any more.Junior developers however, get to look at everything again with a fresh pair of
eyes: they haven’t learned to ignore all the quirks yet, so it feels
 to them, and they tend to question it (if they’re made to feel
safe enough to voice their concerns).This alone is an extremely compelling reason to hire junior developers, which I
wish more companies would do, instead of banking on the fact that “seniors can
get up-to-speed with our current mess faster”.As it happens, I am  a junior developer, far from it. Some way or another,
over the past 12 years, seven different companies have found an excuse to pay me
enough money to cover rent and then some.I did, in fact, design a language all the way back in
2009 (when I  a wee programmer baby), focused mainly on syntactic sugar
over C. At the time it was deemed interesting enough to warrant an invitation to
OSCON (my first time in Portland Oregon, the capital of grunge, coffee, poor
weather and whiteness), where I got to meet other young and not-so-young
whippersnappers (working on Io, Ioke, Wren, JRuby, Clojure, D, Go, etc.)It was a very interesting conference: I’m still deeply ashamed by the
presentation I gave, but I remember fondly the time an audience member asked the
Go team “why did you choose to ignore any research about type systems since the
1970s”? I didn’t fully understand the implications at the time, but I sure do
now.I have since thoroughly lost interest in my language, because I’ve started
caring about semantics a lot more than syntax, which is why I also haven’t
looked at Zig, Nim, Odin, etc: I am no longer interested in “a better C”.But all of that is completely irrelevant. It doesn’t matter who points out that
“maybe we shouldn’t hit ourselves in the head with a rake repeatedly”: that
feedback ought to be taken under advisement no matter who it comes from.Mom smokes, so it’s probably okayOne of the least effective way to shop for technologies (which CTOs, VPs of
engineering, principals, senior staff and staff engineers need to do regularly)
is to look at what other companies are using.It is a great way to  technologies to evaluate (that or checking
ThoughtWorks’ Tech Radar), but it’s far
from enough.A piece from company X on “how they used technology Y”, will 
reflect the true cost of adopting that technology. By the point the engineers
behind the post have been bullied into filling out the company’s tech blog after
months of an uphill battle, the decision has been made, and there’s no going
back.This kind of blog doesn’t lend itself to coming out and admitting that mistakes
were made. It’s supposed to make the company look good. It’s supposed to attract
new hires. It’s supposed to help us stay .Typically, scathing indictments of technologies come from , who
have simply decided that they, as a person, can afford making a lot of people
angry. Companies typically cannot.You can be impressed, that  are using Go, right now, and that
they have gone all the way to Davy Jones’ Locker and back to solve complex
problems that ultimately helps deliver value to customers.Or you can be , as you realize that those complex problems only exist
. Those complex problems would not exist in other
languages, not even in C, which I can definitely not be accused of shilling for
(and would not recommend as a Go replacement).A lot of the pain in the  article is caused by:Go not having sum types — making it really awkward to have a type that is
“either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address”Go choosing which data structures you need — in this case, it’s the
one-size-fits-all slice, for which you pay 24 bytes on 64-bit machines.Go not letting you do operator overloading, harkening back to the Java days
where  isn’t the same as Go’s lack of support for immutable data — the only way to prevent something
from being mutated is to only hand out copies of it, and to 
to not mutate it in the code that actually has access to the inner bits.Go’s unwillingness to let you make an opaque “newtype”. The only way to do
it is to make a separate package and use interfaces for indirection, which is
costly  awkward.Unless you’re out for confirmation bias, that whole article is a very compelling
argument against using Go for that specific problem.And yet Tailscale is using it. Are they wrong? Not necessarily! Because their
team is made up of a bunch of . As evidenced by the  article,
about the Go linker.Because they’re Go experts, they know the cost of using Go upfront, and they’re
equipped to make the decision whether or not it’s worth it. They know how Go
works deep down (something Go marketing pinky-swears you never need to worry
about, why do you ask?), so if they hit edge cases, they can dive into it, fix
it, and wait for their fix to be upstreamed (if ever).But chances are, . This is not your org. You are not Google
either, and you cannot afford to build a whole new type system on top of Go just
to make your project (Kubernetes) work at all.But okay - Tailscale’s usage of Go is pretty  still. Just like my
2020 piece about Windows raised an army of “but that’s not what Go is good for”
objections, you could dismiss Tailscale’s posts as “well that’s on you for
wanting to ship stuff on iOS / doing low-level network stuff”.Fair enough! Okay. Let’s talk about what makes Go compelling.Go is a pretty good async runtime, with opinionated defaults, a
state-of-the-art garbage collector with two
knobs, and tooling that would make C developers jealous, if they bothered
looking outside their bubble.This also describes Node.js from the very start (which
is essentially libuv + V8), and I believe it also describes “modern Java”, with
APIs like NIO. Although I haven’t checked what’s happening in Java land too
closely, so if you’re looking for an easy inaccuracy to ignore this whole
article, there you go: that’s a freebie.Because the async runtime is core to the language, it comes with tooling that
 make Rust developers jealous! I talk about it in Request coalescing in
async Rust, for example.Go makes it easy to dump backtraces (stack traces) for all running goroutines in
a way tokio doesn’t, at this time. It is also able to
detect deadlocks, it comes with its own profiler, it seemingly lets you not
worry about the color of
functions, etc.Go’s tooling around package management, refactoring, cross-compiling, etc., is
easy to pick up and easy to love — and certainly feels at first like a definite
improvement over the many person-hours lost to the whims of pkg-config,
autotools, CMake, etc. Until you reach some of the arbitrary limitations that
simply do not matter to the Go team, and then you’re on your own.All those and more explains why many, including me, were originally enticed by
it: enough to write piles and piles of it, until its shortcomings have finally
become impossible to ignore, by which point it’s too late. You’ve made your bed,
and now you’ve got to make yourself feel okay about lying in it.But one  does not a platform make.The really convenient async runtime is not the only thing you adopted. You also
adopted a  toolchain, a build system, a calling convention, a
single GC (whether it works for you or not), the set of included batteries, some
of which you CAN swap out, but the rest of the ecosystem won’t, and most
importantly, you adopted a language that happened by accident.I will grant you that caring  about something is grounds for
suspicion. It is no secret that a large part of what comes out of academia is
woefully inapplicable in the industry at this time: it is easy to lose oneself
in the abstract, and come up with convoluted schemes to solve problems that do
not really exist for anyone else.I imagine this is the way some folks feel about Rust.But caring  about something is dangerous too.Evidently, the Go team didn’t  to design a language. What they really
liked was their async runtime. And they wanted to be able to implement TCP, and
HTTP, and TLS, and HTTP/2, and DNS, etc., on top of it. And then web services on
top of all of that.And so they didn’t. They didn’t design a language. It sorta just “happened”.Because it needed to be familiar to “Googlers, fresh out of school, who probably
learned some Java/C/C++/Python” (Rob Pike, Lang NEXT 2014), it borrowed from all
of these.Just like C, it doesn’t concern itself with error handling . Everything
is a big furry ball of mutable state, and it’s on you to add ifs and elses to
VERY CAREFULLY (and very manually) ensure that you do not propagate invalid
data.Just like Java, it tries to erase the distinction between “value” and
“reference”, and so it’s impossible to tell from the callsite if something is
getting mutated or not:Depending on whether the signature for change is this:…the local  in  will either get mutated or not.And since, just like C  Java, you do not get to decide what is mutable and
what is immutable (the  keyword in C is essentially advisory,
kinda), passing a
reference to something (to avoid a costly copy, for example) is fraught with
risk, like it getting mutated from under you, or it being held somewhere
forever, preventing it from being freed (a lesser, but very real, problem).Go fails to prevent many other classes of errors: it makes it easy to
accidentally copy a mutex, rendering it
completely ineffective, or leaving struct fields uninitialized (or rather,
initialized to their zero value), resulting in countless logic errors.Taken in isolation, each of these and more can be dismissed as “just a thing to
be careful about”. And breaking down an argument to its smallest pieces,
rebutting them one by one, is a self-defense tactic used by those who cannot
afford to adjust their position in the slightest.Which makes perfect sense, because Go is really hard to move away from.Unless you use cgo, (but cgo is not
Go), you are living in the
Plan 9 cinematic universe.The Go toolchain does not use the assembly language everyone else knows about.
It does not use the linkers everyone else knows about. It does not let you use
the debuggers everyone knows about, the memory checkers
everyone knows about, or the calling conventions everyone else has agreed to
suffer, in the interest of interoperability.Go is closer to
closed-world languages
than it is to C or C++. Even Node.js, Python and Ruby are not as hostile to
FFI.To a large extent, this is a feature: being different is . And it
comes with its benefits. Being able to profile the internals of the TLS and HTTP
stacks the same way you do your business logic is fantastic. (Whereas in dynamic
languages, the stack trace stops at OpenSSL). And that code takes full advantage
of the lack of function coloring: it can let the  worry about
non-blocking I/O and scheduling.But it comes at a terrible cost, too. There is excellent tooling out there for
many things, which you cannot use with Go (you can use it for the cgo parts,
but again, you should not use cgo if you want the Real Go Experience). All the
“institutional knowledge” there is lost, and must be relearned from scratch.It also makes it extremely hard to integrate Go with anything else, whether it’s
upstream (calling C from Go) or downstream (calling Go from Ruby). Both these
scenarios involve cgo, or, if you’re unreasonably brave, a terrifying
hack.Making Go play nice with another language (any other language) is really hard.
Calling C from Go, nevermind the cost of crossing the FFI boundary, involves
manual descriptor tracking,
so as to not break the GC. (WebAssembly had the same problem before reference
types!)Calling Go from  involves shoving the whole Go runtime (GC included)
into whatever you’re running: expect a very large static library and all the
operational burden of running Go code as a regular executable.After spending years doing those FFI dances in both directions, I’ve reached the
conclusion that the only good boundary with Go is a network boundary.Integrating with Go is  if you can afford to pay the
latency cost of doing RPC over TCP (whether it’s a REST-ish HTTP/1 API,
something like JSON-RPC, a more complicated scheme like GRPC, etc.). It’s also
the only way to make sure it doesn’t “infect” your whole codebase.But even that is costly: you need to maintain invariants on both sides of the
boundary. In Rust, one would typically reach for something like
serde for that, which, combined with sum types and the lack
of zero values, lets you make  that what you’re holding is what
you think you’re holding: if a number is zero, it was meant to be zero, it
wasn’t just missing.(All this goes out the window if you use a serialization format like
protobuf, which has all the
drawbacks of Go’s type system and none of the advantages).That still leaves you with the Go side of things, where unless you use some sort
of validation package religiously,
you need to be ever vigilant not to let bad data slip in, because the compiler
does  to help you maintain those invariants.And that brings us to the larger overall problem of the Go .All or nothing (so let’s do nothing)I’ve mentioned “leaving struct fields uninitialized”. This happens easily when
you make a code change from something like this:That second program prints this:We’ve essentially changed the function signature, but forgot to update a
callsite. This doesn’t bother the compiler at all.Oddly enough, if our function was structured like this:Then we’d get a compile error:Why does the Go compiler suddenly care if we provide explicit values now? If the
language was self-consistent, it would let me omit both parameters, and just
default to zero.Because one of the tenets of Go is that zero values are good, actually.See, they let you go fast. If you  mean for  to be zero, you can just
not specify it.And sometimes it works fine, because zero values  mean something:This is fine! Because the  slice is actually a reference type, and its
zero value is , and  just returns zero, because “obviously”, a
nil slice is empty.And sometimes it’s  fine, because zero values don’t mean what you think
they mean:In that case, you should’ve initialized the map first (which is also 
a reference type), with , or with a map literal.That alone is enough to cause incidents and outages that wake people up at
night, but everything gets worse real fast when you consider the Channel
Axioms:A send to a  channel blocks foreverA receive from a  channel blocks foreverA send to a closed channel panicsA receive from a closed channel returns the zero value immediatelyBecause there had to be a meaning for nil channels, this is what was picked.
Good thing there’s pprof to find those deadlocks!And because there’s no way to “move” out of values, there has to be meaning for
receiving and sending to closed channels, too, because even after you close them
you can still interact with them.(Whereas in a language like Rust, a channel closes when its
Sender is
dropped, which only happens when nobody can touch it again, ever. The same probably
applies to C++ and a bunch of other languages, this is not new stuff).“Zero values have meaning” is naive, and clearly untrue when you consider the
inputs of, like… almost everything. There’s so many situations when values
need to be “one of these known options, and nothing else”, and that’s where
sum types come in (in Rust, that’s enums).And Go’s response to that is: just be careful. Just like C’s response before it.Just don’t access the return value if you haven’t checked the error value. Just
have a half-dozen people carefully review each trivial code change to make sure
you’re not accidentally propagating a nil, zero, or empty string way too deep
into your system.It’s just another thing watch out for.It’s not like you can prevent  problems anyway.And you can write logic errors in just about every language! And if you try hard
enough I’m sure you can drive a train straight into a tree! It’s just much
easier with a car.The fallacy here is that because it is impossible to solve , we
shouldn’t even attempt to solve . By that same logic, it’s always
worthless to support any individual financially, because it does nothing to help
every  individual who’s struggling.And this is another self-defense tactic: to refuse to consider anything but the
most extreme version of a position, and point out how ridiculous it is (ignoring
the fact that nobody is actually defending that ridiculous, extreme position).So let’s talk about that position.“Rust is perfect and you’re all idiots”I  that was how I felt, because it would be so much simpler to explain.That fantasy version of my argument is so easy to defeat, too. “How come you use
Linux then? That’s written in C”. “Unsafe Rust is incredibly hard to write
correctly, how do you feel about that?”The success of Go is due in large part to it having batteries included and
opinionated defaults.The success of Rust is due in large part to it being easy to adopt piecemeal
and .They are both success stories, just very different ones.If the boogeyman is to be believed, “Rust shills” would have everyone
immediately throw away everything, and replace it with The Only Good Language
Out there.This is  from what’s happening in the real world, it’s tragic.None of these are without challenges, and none of the people involved are
denying said challenges. But all of these are incremental and pragmatic, very
progressively porting parts to a safer language .We are very far from a “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” approach. The
Rust codegen backend  is a mountain of C++ code (LLVM).
The alternatives are not competitors by any stretch of the imagination, except
maybe for another mountain of C++
code.The most hardcore Rust users are the most vocal about issues like build times,
the lack of certain language features (I just want
GATs!),
and all the other shortcomings everyone else is also talking about.And they’re also the first to be on the lookout for other, newer languages, that
tackle the same kind of problems, but do it .But as with the “questioning your credentials” angle, .
The current trends could be dangerous snake oil and we could have literally no
decent alternative, and it would still be worth talking about. No matter who
raises the point!Creating false dichotomies isn’t going to help resolve any of this.Folks who develop an allergic reaction to “big balls of mutable state without
sum types” tend to gravitate towards languages that gives them control over
mutability, lifetimes, and lets them build abstractions. That those languages
happen to often be Go and Rust is immaterial. Sometimes it’s C and Haskell.
Sometimes it’s ECMAScript and Elixir. I can’t speak to those, but they do
happen.You don’t have to choose between “going fast” and “modelling literally every
last detail of the problem space”. And you’re not stuck doing one or the other
if you choose Go or Rust.You can, at great cost, write extremely careful Go code that stays far away from
stringly-typed values and constantly checks invariants — you just get no help
from the compiler whatsoever.And you can, fairly easily, decide not to care about a whole bunch of cases when
writing Rust code. For example, if you’re not writing a low-level command-line
utility like , you can decide to only care about paths that are valid UTF-8
strings by using camino.When handling errors, it is extremely common to list a few options we  care
about and want to do special handling for, and shove everything else into an
“Other” or “Internal” or “Unknown” variant, which we can flesh out later as
needed, when reviewing logs.The “correct” way to assume an optional value is set, is to ,
not to use it regardless. That’s the difference between calling 
and crossing your fingers, and calling
unwrap()
on an .And it’s so much easier to do it correctly when the type system lets you spell
out what the options are — even when it’s as simple as “ok” or “not ok”.Which brings me to the next argument, by far the most reasonable of the bunch.Go as a prototyping/starter languageWe’ve reached the fifth stage of grief: acceptance.. It may well be that Go is not adequate for production services unless
your shop is literally made up of Go experts (Tailscale) or you have infinite
money to spend on engineering costs (Google).But surely there’s still a place for it.After all, Go is an easy language to pick up (because it’s so small, right?),
and a lot of folks have learned it by now, so it’s easy to recruit Go
developers, so we can get lots of them on the cheap and just uhhh prototype a
few systems?And then later when things get hard (as they always do at scale) we’ll either
rewrite it to something else, or we’ll bring in experts, we’ll figure something
out.Except there is no such thing as throwaway code.All engineering organizations I’ve ever seen are EXTREMELY rewrite-averse, and
for good reason! They take time, orchestrating a seamless transition is hard,
details get lost in the shuffle, you’re not shipping new features while you’re
doing that, you have to retrain your staff to be effective at the new thing,
etc.Tons of good, compelling reasons.So very few things eventually end up being rewritten. And as more and more
components get written in Go, there’s more and more reason to  doing that:
not because it’s working particularly well for you, but because interacting with
the existing codebases from  is so painful (except over
the network, and even then.. see “Go is an island” above).So things essentially never improve. All the Go pitfalls, all the things the
language and compiler , are an issue for everyone,
fresh or experienced. Linters help some, but can never do quite as much as
compiler for languages that took these problems seriously to begin with. 
they slow down development, cutting into the “fast development” promise.All the complexity that doesn’t live in the language now lives in your codebase.
All the invariants you don’t have to spell out using types, you now have to
spell out using code: the signal-to-noise ratio of your (very large) codebases
is extremely poor.Because it has been decided that abstractions are for academics and fools, and
all you  need is slices and maps and channels and funcs and structs, it
becomes extremely hard to follow what any program is doing at a high level,
because everywhere you look, you get bogged down in imperative code doing
trivial data manipulation or error propagation.Because function signatures don’t tell you much of anything (does this mutate
data? does it hold onto it? is a zero value there okay? does it start a
goroutine? can that channel be nil? what types can I really pass for this
 param?), you rely on documentation, which is costly to update, and
costlier still  to update, resulting in more and more bugs.The very reason I don’t consider Go a language “suitable for beginners” is
precisely that its compiler accepts so much code that is very clearly wrong.It takes a lot of experience about everything  the language, everything
Go willfully leaves as an exercise to the writer, to write semi-decent Go code,
and even then, I consider it more effort than it’s worth.The “worse is better” debate was never about some people wanting to feel
superior by adding needless complexity, then mastering it.Quite the contrary, it’s an admission that humans suck at maintaining
invariants. All of us. But we are capable of building tools that can help us
doing that. And focusing our efforts on that has an upfront cost, but that cost
is well worth it.I thought we’d moved past the notion that “programming is typing on a keyboard”
long ago, but when I keep reading “but it’s fast to write lots of Go!”, I’m not
so sure.Inherent complexity does not go away if you close your eyes.When you choose not to care about complexity, you’re merely pushing it onto
other developers in your org, ops people, your customers, . Now
 have to work around your assumptions to make sure everything keeps
running smoothly.And nowadays, I’m often that , and I’m tired of it.Because there is a lot to like in Go at first, because it’s so easy to pick up,
but so hard to move away from, and because the cost of choosing it in the first
place reveals itself slowly over time, and compounds, only becoming unbearable
when it’s much too late, this is not a discussion we can afford to ignore as an
industry.Until we demand better of our tools, we are doomed to be woken up in the middle
of the night, over and over again, because some  value slipped in where it
never should have.Here’s a list of lies we tell ourselves to keep using Golang:Others use it, so it must be good for us tooEveryone who has concerns about it is an elitist jerkIts attractive async runtime and GC make up for everything elseEvery language design flaw is ok in isolation, and ok in aggregate tooWe can overcome these by “just being careful” or adding more linters/eyeballsBecause it’s easy to write, it’s easy to develop production software withBecause the language is simple, everything else is, tooWe can do just a little of it, or just at first, or we can move away from it easilyWe can always rewrite it later

Alpine Linux is my base here - it just boots and works (in ACPI mode). But, I have a few auxiliary servers and services that are not kube'd; a FriendlyElec NANO3 that handles TVHeadend, a NAS that handles more complex services like Jellyfin, PaperlessNGX and Home Assistant, a secondary "random crap that fits together" NAS with an Athlon 3000G that runs Kasm on OpenMediaVault - and soon, I will have an AI server backed by LocalAI. That's a lot of potential API resources and I would love to take advantage of them. Probably not all of them, to be fair and honest. However, this is why I really liked the basic idea of Crossplane; I can use the HTTP provider to define CRUD ops and then use Kubernetes resources to manage and maintain them - kind of centralizing them, and perhaps opting into GitOps also (which I have not done yet entirely - my stuff  in a private Git repo but no ArgoCD is configured).So... Since Crossplane hit such a nerve (oh my god the emotions were  xD) and OpenTofu seems absurdly overkill for a lil' homelab like this, what are some other "orchestration" or "management" tools that come to your mind?I might still try CrossPlane, I might try Tekton at some point for CI/CD or see if I can make Concourse work... But it's a homelab, there's always something to explore. And, one of the things I would really like to get under control, is some form of central management of API-based resources.So in other words; rather than the absolute moment that is the Crossplane post's comment section, throw out the things you liked to use in it's stead or something that you think would kinda go there!And, thanks for the feedback on that post.

Very ergonomic!However, Rust enforces a key rule: no two blanket implementations may overlap - even . Consider:Even if no type currently implements both  and , the compiler will reject this. The reason? Some type  satisfy both in the future, and that would make the implementation ambiguous.While working on Joydb, I ran into this exact problem.I have an  trait responsible for persisting data.In practice, there are two common ways to implement it:A  that stores all data in a single file (e.g., JSON). In Joydb, this is .A  that stores each relation in a separate file (e.g., one CSV per relation), called .Ideally, users would only need to implement one of those and get the  trait "for free".But Rust won't let me define two conflicting blanket implementations. So... is there a workaround? 🤔The Trait Definitions in JoydbHere are the relevant traits in Joydb:So the question becomes: how can I let someone implement either  or , and then get  automatically?The Workaround: Associated Type + Marker Structs like  and  to wrap adapter types.A helper trait, , implemented for each marker type.An  in the  trait to delegate behavior.These zero-sized types are used solely for type-level dispatch.Step 2: The  TraitNow we have non-conflicting blanket impls because they apply to  ( vs. ).Step 3: The  Trait with Associated TypeThe key piece: the associated type  tells  whether to delegate to  or .Let's say we need to implement a  that writes everything to a single file.
It can be implemented as a :No code duplication.
No conflicts.
The only overhead is 3 extra lines to link things togetherThis pattern - using marker types + associated types - gives you the flexibility of alternative blanket implementations while staying within Rust's coherence rules.It's especially useful when you want to support mutually exclusive behaviors under a unified interface, without compromising on ergonomics.Psss!

There never was a version 5.0. The last major release, version 4.0, was released almost three years ago. Three years is an  long time in the Internet world. During this time, Netscape sat by, helplessly, as their market share plummeted.It’s a bit smarmy of me to criticize them for waiting so long between releases. They didn’t do it , now, did they?Well, yes. They did. They did it by making the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make:They decided to rewrite the code from scratch.Netscape wasn’t the first company to make this mistake. Borland made the same mistake when they bought Arago and tried to make it into dBase for Windows, a doomed project that took so long that Microsoft Access ate their lunch, then they made it again in rewriting Quattro Pro from scratch and astonishing people with how few features it had. Microsoft almost made the same mistake, trying to rewrite Word for Windows from scratch in a doomed project called Pyramid which was shut down, thrown away, and swept under the rug. Lucky for Microsoft, they had never stopped working on the old code base, so they had something to ship, making it merely a financial disaster, not a strategic one.We’re programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place flat and build something grand. We’re not excited by incremental renovation: tinkering, improving, planting flower beds.There’s a subtle reason that programmers always want to throw away the code and start over. The reason is that they think the old code is a mess. And here is the interesting observation:  The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming:It’s harder to read code than to write it.This is why code reuse is so hard. This is why everybody on your team has a different function they like to use for splitting strings into arrays of strings. They write their own function because it’s easier and more fun than figuring out how the old function works.As a corollary of this axiom, you can ask almost any programmer today about the code they are working on. “It’s a big hairy mess,” they will tell you. “I’d like nothing better than to throw it out and start over.”“Well,” they say, “look at this function. It is two pages long! None of this stuff belongs in there! I don’t know what half of these API calls are for.” Before Borland’s new spreadsheet for Windows shipped, Philippe Kahn, the colorful founder of Borland, was quoted a lot in the press bragging about how Quattro Pro would be much better than Microsoft Excel, because it was written from scratch. All new source code! As if source code .The idea that new code is better than old is patently absurd. Old code has been . It has been .  of bugs have been found, and they’ve been . There’s nothing wrong with it. It doesn’t acquire bugs just by sitting around on your hard drive. Au contraire, baby! Is software supposed to be like an old Dodge Dart, that rusts just sitting in the garage? Is software like a teddy bear that’s kind of gross if it’s not made out of ?Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it’s just a simple function to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and nobody knows why. Well, I’ll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing on a computer that didn’t have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95.Each of these bugs took weeks of real-world usage before they were found. The programmer might have spent a couple of days reproducing the bug in the lab and fixing it. If it’s like a lot of bugs, the fix might be one line of code, or it might even be a couple of characters, but a lot of work and time went into those two characters.When you throw away code and start from scratch, you are throwing away all that knowledge. All those collected bug fixes. Years of programming work.You are throwing away your market leadership. You are giving a gift of two or three years to your competitors, and believe me, that is a  time in software years.You are putting yourself in an extremely dangerous position where you will be shipping an old version of the code for several years, completely unable to make any strategic changes or react to new features that the market demands, because you don’t have shippable code. You might as well just close for business for the duration.You are wasting an outlandish amount of money writing code that already exists.Is there an alternative? The consensus seems to be that the old Netscape code base was bad. Well, it might have been bad, but, you know what? It worked pretty darn well on an awful lot of real world computer systems.When programmers say that their code is a holy mess (as they always do), there are three kinds of things that are wrong with it.First, there are architectural problems. The code is not factored correctly. The networking code is popping up its own dialog boxes from the middle of nowhere; this should have been handled in the UI code. These problems can be solved, one at a time, by carefully moving code, refactoring, changing interfaces. They can be done by one programmer working carefully and checking in his changes all at once, so that nobody else is disrupted. Even fairly major architectural changes can be done without . On the Juno project we spent several months rearchitecting at one point: just moving things around, cleaning them up, creating base classes that made sense, and creating sharp interfaces between the modules. But we did it carefully, with our existing code base, and we didn’t introduce new bugs or throw away working code.A second reason programmers think that their code is a mess is that it is inefficient. The rendering code in Netscape was rumored to be slow. But this only affects a small part of the project, which you can optimize or even rewrite. You don’t have to rewrite the whole thing. When optimizing for speed, 1% of the work gets you 99% of the bang.Third, the code may be doggone ugly. One project I worked on actually had a data type called a FuckedString. Another project had started out using the convention of starting member variables with an underscore, but later switched to the more standard “m_”. So half the functions started with “_” and half with “m_”, which looked ugly. Frankly, this is the kind of thing you solve in five minutes with a macro in Emacs, not by starting from scratch.It’s important to remember that when you start from scratch there is  to believe that you are going to do a better job than you did the first time. First of all, you probably don’t even have the same programming team that worked on version one, so you don’t actually have “more experience”. You’re just going to make most of the old mistakes again, and introduce some new problems that weren’t in the original version. The old mantra  is dangerous when applied to large scale commercial applications. If you are writing code experimentally, you may want to rip up the function you wrote last week when you think of a better algorithm. That’s fine. You may want to refactor a class to make it easier to use. That’s fine, too. But throwing away the whole program is a dangerous folly, and if Netscape actually had some adult supervision with software industry experience, they might not have shot themselves in the foot so badly.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I want to build a TUI-based game (player movement, collisions, basic enemies).

And if I was lazy and careless, I would’ve paid the price.My name is Austin Starks, and I’m building an app called NexusTrade.NexusTrade is like if ChatGPT had a baby with Robinhood, who grew up to have a baby with QuantConnect. In short, it’s a platform that allows everybody to create, test, and deploy their own algorithmic trading strategies.While exceptionally good at testing complex strategies that operate at open and close, the platform has a major flaw… if you want to test out an intraday strategy, you’re cooked. I’m working diligently to fix this.In a previous article, I described the different milestones with the implementation. For , my objective is to implement “intraday-ness” within my indicators for my platform. And, if you observe from the surface-level (i.e, using AI tools), you might assume it’s already implemented! In fact, you can check it out yourself, and see the ingenuity of my implementation.And if I trusted the surface-level (i.e, the  AI tools on the planet), I would’ve proceeded with the WRONG implementation. Here’s how Claude Opus 4 outright failed me on a critical feature.To implement my intraday indicators, the first step was seeing if the implementation for it that exists is correct. To do this, I asked Claude the following:What do you think of this implementation? Is it correct? Any edge cases?For our overly ambitious engineering reader, here’s the implementation of the Simple Moving Average. See if you can spot the bug yourself.The way this implementation works is by taking a Duration as the input. This parameter helps us maintain a sliding window and works for any period — 30 days, 30 minutes, or even 30 seconds.At the surface, the implementation looks correct. Even Claude Opus 4, the most powerful coding LLM of our time, only pointed out nitpicks and unrealistic edge cases.However, solely because I implemented the technical indicator library, I knew that there existed a hidden weakness. Allow me to explain.On the surface level, the implementation of the intraday indicator looks sound. And it is!If you make the following assumption: the data is ingested at regular intervals.Take this graph for example. It will correctly compute the 14-day SMA across Apple’s closed price because we’re assuming one data-point per day. But what happens if that assumption is violated?Let’s say we “warmed up” our indicators using open/close data (i.e, computed our moving averages), and now we’re running our backtest on intraday data, which requires ingesting new data points at the minutely granularity.If we use the current implementation of the indicator, that introduces a major bug.This graph shows the impact of ingesting just 4 minutes of minutely data into our system. The SMA shoots up rapidly, approaching the current price of Apple.The current implementation  that each ingested data point should be weighted the same as every other datapoint in the window. This is wrong!In reality, we need to implement a time-weighted moving average. After some immense brainpower, I ended up developing the following algorithm.This new implementation is an improvement over the original because:It should regress to the original implementation if we’re just ingesting open and closed dataIt automatically resets the minutely averages at the start of the day for stocksIt maintains the minutely averages for cryptocurrency, which is tradeable all dayOur unchecked assumption would’ve caused a major bug in such a critical feature. What can we learn from this?I’m sharing this story for really one reason: as a cautionary tale for tech executives and software engineers.And this should go without saying, but I am not some anti-AI evangelist. I literally developed a no-code, AI-Powered trading platform. If there’s anybody having sermons about the power and value of AI, it would be me!But this article clearly demonstrates something immensely important: you can ask the literal best AI models of our time point blank if an implementation is wrong, and it will tell you no.Now, this is not the model’s fault.  if I prompted it in such a way that listed every single assumption that can be made, then maybe it would’ve caught it!But that’s not how people use AI in the real-world. I know it and you know it too.For one, many assumptions that we make in software are implicit. We’re not even fully aware that we’re making them!But also, just imagine if I didn’t even write the technical indicator library, and I trusted the authors to handle this automatically. Or, imagine if AI wrote the library entirely, and I never wondered about how it worked under the hood.The implementation would’ve yielded outright incorrect values forever. Unless someone raised the issue because something seemed off, the bug would’ve laid dormant for months or even longer.Debugging the issue would’ve been a nightmare on its own. I would’ve checked if the data was right or if the event emitter was firing correctly, and everything else within the core of the trading platform… I mean, why would I double-check the external libraries it depended on?Catastrophically-silent bugs like this are going to become rampant. Not only do AI tools dramatically increase the output of engineers, but they are notoriously bad at understanding the larger picture.Moreover, more and more non-technical folks are “vibe-coding” their projects into existence. They’re developing software based on intuition, requirements, and AI prompts, and don’t have a deep understanding of the actual code that’s being generated.I’ve seen it first-hand, on LinkedIn, Reddit, and even TikTok! Just Google “vibe-coding” and see how popular it has become.What happens when a “vibe-coded” library is used by thousands of developers, and these issues start infesting all of our software? If I nearly missed a critical bug and I actually wrote the code, how many bugs will exist because code wasn’t written by engineers with domain expertise?I shudder to think of that future.So if you’re a tech executive, don’t fire your engineering team yet. They may be more critical now than ever before.Maybe my brain is overreacting.Maybe I would’ve caught this issue well before I launched. I’m just having trouble figuring out In this case, I knew of the limitation because I wrote the library. But there are hundreds of libraries now being created and reviewed purely by AI. Engineers are looking at less and less of the code that is brought into the world.And this should terrify you.For backtesting software, the consequences of this bug would’ve been an improper test. Users would be annoyed and leave bad reviews. I would suffer reputational harm. But I would survive.But imagine such a bug for other, mission-critical software, like rocket ships and self-driving cars.This article demonstrates why human beings still need to be in the loop when developing complex software systems. It is imperative, that human-beings sanity-check LLM-generated code with domain-aware unit tests. Even the best AI models don’t fully grasp exactly what we’re building.So before you ship that feature (whose code you barely glanced at), ask yourself this question: what assumption did you and Gemini miss?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Any path for a mid career/mid aged MLE to do ML research in the industry</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lotkac/d_any_path_for_a_mid_careermid_aged_mle_to_do_ml/</link><author>/u/LastAd3056</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 05:25:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've seen some flavor of questions here about whether they should do a PhD to join a research lab. I have a slightly different question. I did a non-CS PhD almost a decade ago, failed to get a faculty position after a bunch of postdocs and then meandered through FANG jobs, first in DS and then in MLE. I did some applied research in my last job, but more stats heavy than ML. But through a bunch of layoffs and restructuring, currently I am in a more traditional MLE role, think recommendation systems, A/B tests, move metrics...But at my heart, I still want to do research. I've dabbled with writing a single author paper in on the top ML conferences in my own time, but its kinda hard, with job, family etc.. Even if I do manage to pull it off, will the one off Neurips paper (lets say) help me get an entry card to a more research-y ML job, like a Research Scientist/ Research Engineer in a ML lab? I am competing with ML PhDs with multiple papers, networks etc.I also think that I don't have a lot of time, most of my friends have moved on to management after a decade of IC roles, and thats sort of the traditional path. But part of me is still holding on and wants to give it a shot and see if I can break into research this late, without an ML PhD. I know I will be much more fulfilled as a research scientist, compared to a regular SWE/M job,. I am currently trying to use my weekends and nights to write a single author paper to submit to one of the top conferences. Worst case I get rejected.Some thoughts in my mind: (1) I have also thought of writing workshop papers, which are easier to get accepted, but I doubt they have a similar value in the RS job market. (2) Research Engineer will likely be easier than Research Scientist. But how should I strategize for this?I'd be grateful if I get thoughts on how I should strategize a move. Feel free to also tell me its impossible, and I should cut my losses and move on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One-Minute Daily AI News 6/30/2025</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1lot1gv/oneminute_daily_ai_news_6302025/</link><author>/u/Excellent-Target-847</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 04:53:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[   submitted by    /u/Excellent-Target-847 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My Claude collaborative platform</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1losxzq/my_claude_collaborative_platform/</link><author>/u/MuscleLazy</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 04:48:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been using Claude Desktop a lot and wanted a better way to manage different collaboration styles, like having it act as an engineer vs researcher vs creative partner.

(with memory) actually remembers your working style, project context, and collaboration preferences. Game changer for long-term work.I've been using this setup for about 3 months now with the engineer profile and it dramatically improved my workflow.: Every conversation started with me explaining "I need root cause analysis first, minimal code changes, focus on production safety, don't over-engineer solutions." Then spending the first 10 messages training Claude to give me direct technical responses instead of hand-holding explanations.: Claude immediately knows I want systematic troubleshooting, that I prefer infrastructure optimization over quick fixes, and that I need definitive technical communication without hedging language.The platform tracks our  from incident reviews and  where it documents lessons learned from outages, alternative approaches we considered but didn't implement, and insights about our infrastructure.I've thoroughly tested the  profile for production incidents, while spending a lot less time on "tuning" the other profiles, you are welcome to contribute. It is striking to see how Claude transforms from a junior engineer, constantly performing unauthorized commands or file edits, into a "cold", "precise like a surgeon's scalpel" engineer. No more "You're right!" messages, Claude will actually tell you where you're wrong, straight up!

Individual frontier models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek are remarkably advanced, each possessing unique strengths and biases stemming from their training, which we view as valuable resources for collective problem-solving.AB-MCTS (Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search) harnesses these individualities, allowing multiple models to cooperate and engage in effective trial-and-error, solving challenging problems for any single AI. Our initial results on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark are promising, with AB-MCTS combining o4-mini + Gemini-2.5-Pro + R1-0528, current frontier AI models, significantly outperforming individual models by a substantial margin.This research builds on our 2024 work on evolutionary model merging, shifting focus from “mixing to create” to “mixing to use” existing, powerful AIs. At Sakana AI, we remain committed to pioneering novel AI systems by applying nature-inspired principles such as evolution and collective intelligence. We believe this work represents a step toward a future where AI systems collaboratively tackle complex challenges, much like a team of human experts, unlocking new problem-solving capabilities and moving beyond single-model limitations.If you have any questions, please ask them below or feel free to get in touch, any discussion is more than welcome :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>probemux: When you need more than 1 {liveness, readiness}Probe</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lor7jp/probemux_when_you_need_more_than_1_liveness/</link><author>/u/thockin</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 03:12:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There was an issue recently where someone argued that they REALLY DO need more than 1 livenessProbe, so I cobbled this together from bits of other programs:NAME probemux - multiplex many HTTP probes into one.SYNOPSIS probemux --port=<port> [OPTIONS]...

It also, refreshingly, has a high-quality UI design that is modern, intuitive, and user-friendly. The vision is to become the Blender equivalent of 2D creative tools. Here's a 1-minute video showing the cool, unique, visually snazzy things that can be made with it.Graphite features a node-based procedural editing environment using a bespoke functional programming language, Graphene, that we have built on top of Rust itself such that it uses Rust's data types and  to transform artist-created documents into portable, standalone programs that can procedurally generate parametric artwork. Think: something spanning the gamut from Rive to ImageMagick.For the juicy technical deets, give the podcast episode a listen where we were interviewed about how our Graphene engine/language lets even nontechnical artists "paint with Rust", sort of like if Scratch used Rust as its foundation. We go into detail on the unique approach of turning a graphics editor into a compiled programming language where the visual editor is like an IDE for Rust code.Here's the ask: help implement bidirectional type inference in our language's compilerThe Graphene language — while it is built on top of Rust and uses Rust's compiler, data types, traits, and generics — also has its own type checker. It supports generics, but is somewhat rudimentary and needs to be made more powerful, such as implementing Hindley–Milner or similar, in order for Graphene types to work with contextual inference just like Rust types do.This involves the Graphene compiler internals and we only have one developer with a compilers background and he's a student with limited free time spread across all the crucial parts of the Graphite project's engineering. But we know that /r/rust is — well... — naturally a place where many talented people who love building compilers and hobby language implementations hang out.This type system project should last a few weeks for someone with the right background— but for more than a year, working around having full type inference support has been a growing impediment that is impacting how we can keep developing ergonomic graphics tooling. For example, a graphics operation can't accept two inputs and use the type of the first to pick a compatible generic type for the second. This results in painful workarounds that confuse users. Even if it's just a short-term involvement, even temporarily expanding our team beyond 1 knowledgeable compiler developer would have an outsized impact on helping us execute our mission to bring programmatic graphics (and Rust!) into the hands of artists.If you can help, we will work closely with you to get you up to speed with the existing compiler code. If you're up for the fun and impactful challenge, the best way is to join our project Discord and say you'd like to help in our  channel. Or you can comment on the GitHub issue.Besides compilers, we also need general help, especially in areas of our bottlenecks: code quality review, and helping design API surfaces and architecture plans for upcoming systems. If you're an experienced engineer who could help with any of those for a few hours a week, or with general feature development, please also come get involved! Graphite is one of the easiest open source projects to start contributing to according to many of our community members; we really strive to make it as frictionless as possible to start out. Feel free to drop by and leave a code review on any open PRs or ask what kind of task best fits your background (graphics, algorithm design, application programming, bug hunting, and of course most crucially: programming language compilers).Thank you! Now let's go forth and get artists secretly addicted to Rust 😀 In no time at all, they will be writing custom Rust functions to do their own graphical operations.P.S. If you are attending Open Sauce in a few weeks, come visit our booth. We'd love to chat (and give you swag).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reflections on Haskell and Rust</title><link>https://academy.fpblock.com/blog/rust-haskell-reflections/</link><author>/u/sibip</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 02:58:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For most of my professional experience, I have been writing production
code in both Haskell and Rust, primarily focusing on web services,
APIs, and HTTP stack development. My journey started with Haskell,
followed by working with Rust, and most recently returning to the
Haskell ecosystem.This experience has given me perspective on both languages' strengths
and limitations in real-world applications. Each language has aspects
that I appreciate and miss when working with the other. This post
examines the features and characteristics that stand out to me in each
language.Rust's ability to shadow variables seamlessly is something I came to
appreciate. In Rust, you can write:This pattern is common and encouraged in Rust, making code more
readable by avoiding the need for intermediate variable names. In
Haskell, you would typically need different names:Haskell's approach is slightly harder to read, while Rust's shadowing
makes transformation pipelines more natural.Rust's enum system, particularly when combined with pattern matching,
feels more robust than Haskell's sum types of records. When defining
sum types of records in Haskell, there is a possibility of introducing
partial record accessors which can cause runtime crashes, though
recent versions of GHC now produce compile-time warnings for this
pattern:Rust eliminates this class of errors by design:Rust allows multiple enum types to have the same variant names within
the same module, while Haskell's constructor names must be unique
within their scope. This leads to different patterns in the two
languages.The same approach in Haskell would cause a compile error:In Haskell, you need unique constructor names:Alternatively, Haskell developers often use qualified imports syntax
to achieve similar namespacing:The  syntax in Rust makes the intent clearer at the
usage site. You immediately know which enum type you're working with,
while Haskell's approach can sometimes require additional context or
prefixing to achieve the same clarity.Rust provides granular visibility control for struct fields, allowing
you to expose only specific fields while keeping others private. This
fine-grained control is built into the language:Rust offers even more granular visibility control beyond simple 
and private fields. You can specify exactly where a field should be
accessible:These granular visibility modifiers (, ,
) allow you to create sophisticated access patterns that
match your module hierarchy and architectural boundaries. Some of
these patterns are simply not possible to replicate in Haskell's
module system.In Haskell, record field visibility is controlled at the type level,
not the field level. This means you typically either export all of a
record's fields at once (using ) or none of them. To achieve
similar granular control, you need to use more awkward patterns:The Haskell approach requires writing boilerplate accessor functions
and losing the convenient record syntax for the fields you want to
keep private. Rust's per-field visibility eliminates this awkwardness
while maintaining the benefits of direct field access for public
fields.Purity and Referential TransparencyOne of Haskell's most significant strengths is its commitment to
purity. Pure functions, which have no side effects, are easier to
reason about, test, and debug. Referential transparency—the principle
that a function call can be replaced by its resulting value without
changing the program's behavior—is a direct benefit of this purity.In Haskell, the type system explicitly tracks effects through monads
like , making it clear which parts of the code interact with the
outside world. This separation of pure and impure code is a powerful
tool for building reliable software.While Rust encourages a similar separation of concerns, it does not
enforce it at the language level in the same way. A function in Rust
can perform I/O or mutate state without any explicit indication in its
type signature (beyond  for mutable borrows). This means that
while you  write pure functions in Rust, the language doesn't
provide the same strong guarantees as Haskell.This lack of enforced purity in Rust means you lose some of the strong
reasoning and refactoring guarantees that are a hallmark of Haskell
development.Rust's explicit error handling through  removes the
cognitive overhead of exceptions. Compare these approaches:Haskell (with potential exceptions):Rust (explicit throughout):In Rust, the  operator makes error propagation clean while keeping
the flow clear.Unit tests as part of source codeRust's built-in support for unit tests within the same file as the
code being tested is convenient:In Haskell, tests are typically in separate files:Rust's co-location makes tests harder to forget and easier to
maintain. Additionally, in Haskell you often need to export internal
types and functions from your modules just to make them accessible for
testing, which can pollute your public API.Rust's  attribute means test code has access to private
functions and types without exposing them publicly.Rust's  provides a standard formatting tool that the entire
community has adopted:In Haskell, while we have excellent tools like  and
, the lack of a single standard has led to configuration
debates:I have witnessed significant time spent on style discussions when team
members are reluctant to adopt formatting tools.While Haskell Language Server (HLS) has improved significantly, it
still struggles with larger projects. Basic functionality like
variable renaming can fail in certain scenarios, particularly in
Template Haskell heavy codebases.rust-analyzer provides a more reliable experience across different
project sizes, with features like "go to definition" working
consistently even in large monorepos. One feature I'm particularly
fond of is rust-analyzer's ability to jump into the definitions of
standard library functions and external dependencies. This seamless
navigation into library code is something I miss when using HLS, even
on smaller projects, where such functionality is not currently
possible.Another feature I extensively use in rust-analyzer is the ability to
run tests inline directly from the editor. This functionality is
currently missing in HLS, though there is an open issue tracking
this feature request.Despite Rust's reputation for slow compilation, I've found it
consistently faster than Haskell for equivalent services. The Rust
team has made significant efforts to optimize the compiler over the
years, and these improvements are noticeable in practice. In contrast,
Haskell compilation times have remained slow, and newer GHC versions
unfortunately don't seem to provide meaningful improvements in this
area.Interactive development experienceI appreciate Haskell's REPL (Read-eval-print loop) for rapid
prototyping and experimentation. Not having a native REPL in Rust
noticeably slows down development when you need to try things out
quickly or explore library APIs interactively. In GHCi, you can load
your existing codebase and experiment around it, making it easy to
test functions, try different inputs, and explore how your code
behaves.As an alternative, I have been using org babel in rustic mode for
interactive Rust development. While this provides some level of
interactivity within Emacs, it feels more like a band-aid than an
actual solution for quickly experimenting with code. The workflow is
more cumbersome compared to the direct approach of typing expressions
directly into GHCi and seeing results instantly.Lists as first-class citizensHaskell's treatment of lists as first-class citizens through special
syntax can be problematic. The convenient  syntax defaults to
linked lists:Better alternatives exist but require more verbose syntax:While Haskell has the  extension to make this more
convenient, it hasn't enjoyed the same widespread adoption as
.Rust also has  in its standard library, but it comes
with clear documentation discouraging its use:Configuration file experienceCabal and TOML represent different approaches to project
configuration. While cabal's tool support has improved greatly with
HLS integration, which now supports features like automatic formatting
using cabal-gild, TOML enjoys broader ecosystem support.TOML benefits from independent language servers like taplo and
the recent tombi, providing a superior editing
experience. Features like jumping to different Cargo.toml files across
a workspace or seeing descriptions of specific Cargo.toml fields on
hover work seamlessly.Additionally, TOML has upstream support in editors like Emacs through
toml-ts-mode, which takes advantage of tree-sitter. No equivalent
exists for cabal files, likely due to the format's limited popularity
outside the Haskell ecosystem.It's worth noting that when Cabal was created, there was likely no
widely adopted standard configuration format available. Rust had the
benefit of coming later and choosing an existing, well-established
format rather than inventing something new.I handle production operations for both Rust and Haskell services,
including parts of the Stackage infrastructure at FP Complete (which
FP Complete later donated to the Haskell Foundation). I have
encountered significantly more operational challenges with Haskell
services.Haskell services often require tweaking GHC's RTS (Runtime system)
parameters to avoid memory issues and achieve stable performance. This
remains an ongoing challenge - recently, Bryan from the Haskell
Foundation team opened a similar issue on the Stackage server,
encountering the same type of issue I dealt with. In contrast, Rust
services have been much easier to operate.Building static binaries is trivial in Rust, and the ecosystem
actively works to reduce non-Rust dependencies. Recent efforts like
the bzip2 crate switching from C to Rust further simplify the
build process by removing C library dependencies wherever possible.Cross-compilation to ARM is particularly straightforward. For one of
our clients, we run all production services on ARM
architecture. Setting up the entire cross-compilation pipeline took
less than a day. I would not be confident about achieving the same
with GHC and the various commonly used dependencies in Hackage.The build process is quite simple:My experience has been that Rust services typically consume less
memory and CPU cycles than the Haskell ones in general.Both languages have their place in the software development
ecosystem. However, I find that Rust's larger user base brings
tangible benefits through more robust tooling and actively maintained
libraries. I used to reach for Haskell when writing CLI tools,
appreciating its expressiveness. These days, I find myself choosing
Rust instead, largely due to how polished libraries like  have
become for command-line parsing.While I appreciate that Haskell's theoretical foundations remain
strong for exploring effect systems and advanced type-level
programming, I observe that its library ecosystem has become less
active compared to Rust's rapidly evolving landscape.For the web services and API development I work on, I find that Rust's
practical decisions around error handling, tooling, and operational
aspects often result in more maintainable and deployable systems.
While language choice always depends on numerous factors like team
expertise and project requirements, Rust's powerful combination of
design and ecosystem makes it a compelling option. For me, it has
become the pragmatic choice for building reliable software,
specifically when a greenfield project is involved.

We have a Go app running in a Docker (Ubuntu) container. This calls a C/C++ library (C interface, but C++ under the hood) via cgo. Yes I am aware of the dangers of that, but this library depends on a 3rd party C++ library and uses x64 intrinsics. The 3rd party library is slowly being ported to Go but it isn't ready yet for prime time; and of course there's the time to port our library to Golang: I've seen worse, but not trivial either!Memory allocation is a potential issue, and I will investigate the latest GC options. Most of the memory allocation is in the C++ library (potentially many GB). Am I right in thinking that the C++ memory allocation will be separate from Golang's heap? And Golang does not set any limits on the library allocations? (other than OS-wide ulimit settings of course)In other words, both Golang and the C++ library will take all the physical memory they can?

As such, we are preparing a short series of blog posts to go over the relevant topics in the coming weeks.For this blog post, we are going to cover our infrastructure port, along with the process of rebuilding our entire package repository.All core AerynOS tooling is now written in RustEvery recipe in the repository has been rebuilt (twice!) with many packages then having been updated to newer versions after the rebuilds were completedA CDN has been implemented for faster package installation and ISO downloadsWhen delivering a Linux distribution, its infrastructure and associated processes effectively act as the “spine” of the project. But spine surgery can be a delicate affair, particularly when it comes to rehabilitation after successful surgery.For us, this cycle has been particularly demanding, as we have completed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) port of our infrastructure tooling code to Rust, meaning that all core AerynOS tooling has now fully transitioned away from DLang.We have covered the reasons for this transition previously, and it’s fair to say that we are already feeling the benefits of easy and native reuse of code in our tooling repositories and welcoming more Rust contributors into our community.Earlier this year, our existing DLang build infrastructure started showing signs of instability and required more and more manual intervention to successfully land packages.Given our prior decision to transition our tooling over to Rust, we had already stopped further development of the DLang based infrastructure. Hence, we decided to accelerate our transition timeline for the infrastructure re-write to Rust with tarkah and ermo leading the development activity, which began at the end of March.Towards the end of May, we put the first infrastructure prototype to the test, and then iteratively fixed bugs and built out missing functionality to the point of being able to put our MVP into production on our build infrastructure.This MVP will serve as the development base of the code that will be used for all future package builds.We have some cool features planned in AerynOS that we envision will make package maintenance a lot easier to manage through smart use of automation.Until these features are implemented, however, maintaining the AerynOS repository will remain somewhat human resource intensive. This is the main reason why the repository is consciously being kept “small” for now, with us deliberately focusing on having packages that will help developers and contributors improve AerynOS, while still delivering a nice Daily Driver experience.Until the new features are implemented, this will necessarily be a balancing act between maintaining the package repository so it doesn’t go stale vs. having the development time to implement the new features.Aside from porting the infrastructure code to Rust, proper testing was required to yield confidence that packages were both successfully built on the new infrastructure and that they worked as expected.The end goal was to prove that we were able to rebuild the full AerynOS recipes repository (currently at ~950 recipes) from start to finish without infra-related build errors on the new infra.To enable the rebuild, ermo set up a distributed build cluster of four builders of varying hardware specifications. A separate branch of the ‘recipes’ repository was created, and was used to test both the Rust infrastructure and to land packages for internal testing without them being seeded to user installs.In addition, compared to the old infra, we made it simpler to add new avalanche build agents to the build cluster, thus making it very simple to scale out our build cluster as required.To summarise the infrastructure Rust re-write and testing effort, we have:Completed more than 3k recipe buildsDeployed the new Rust infrastructure on the AerynOS builders and continue to use it on ermo’s build clusterValidated that the new infrastructure code is more stable and performant at runtime than the previous DLang versionHow did testing add value?The full rebuild of the recipes repository has also served to ensure ABI sanity for dependencies. Additionally, we can now say that at this point in time, the whole AerynOS repository is known to be buildable and works with all the latest toolchains.A special thanks goes to Reilly Brogan, who worked diligently with ermo to not only drive the rebuild process, but also to ensure that some longstanding repository issues were corrected as part of the rebuild process.During this process, we have delivered updates to our os-tools (Boulder and Moss), toolchains and build systems. A selection of the updates and additions include (but is certainly not limited to):Linux 6.14.11 (6.15.x on the way)Distrobox added at v1.8.1.2Exfatprogs added at v1.2.9As mentioned earlier, the testing work was conducted on a separate branch of the recipes repository. Consequently, those of you on the old packages.aerynos.com/volatile/ repository, have not received any updates over the last 10-12 weeks.This was a conscious decision to ensure that the mostly untested packages built during the infrastructure testing process did not reach end users immediately. Even though AerynOS is in Alpha and under continuous development, we still do our best not to break user systems if we can avoid it!Now that we have a level of testing in place, with this blog post, we are announcing a new rolling  package repository for users. The old  package repository has received one final update to Moss that fixes an important bug when transitioning to the new  repository.To ease the transition to the new repository for existing users, we are working on a script that can automatically modify the active repository on the system.Once this script has been sufficiently productized, the next time existing users update their systems, they will notice that every single package will show an update available.The exact number will vary from system to system depending on how many other packages are installed from the repository but for context, on a base AerynOS GNOME install, this is around 500 packages.In the meantime, we have created a manual guide on how to transition existing installs to the new repository in our GitHub Discussions forum here. The process is fairly simple, but if you do have any issues transitioning manually, do get in touch via a comment under the GitHub Discussions post or via Matrix.Content Delivery Network for Packages and ISOsA common bit of feedback we have been receiving relates to the download speed of our repository, namely that it is not fast or even acceptable, especially if you live outside of Europe. This became more evident for those using the rebuild repository on ermo’s rebuild testing server, which felt noticeably faster for people in Europe in particular.To remedy this, we have implemented CDN caching for our new  hosted assets. This means there will be synced copies of our ISOs and package repository on CDN servers around the world, which should help improve download speeds.In particular, the new rolling  package repository mentioned above will be served via this CDN for the benefit of our users.Please let us know how you get on with AerynOS ISO and package downloads in the coming weeks, as we would love to validate the improvement outside of our own internal testing.Future infrastructure development targetsSo far, we have only outlined what we have already accomplished since late March.The next part of this blog post is going to be a brief outline of where we are going from here in terms of infrastructure and repository development.With the transition to the new infrastructure and the new  repository, we have been freed up to begin planning out the necessary steps to be able to deliver versioned repositories and versioned Moss format upgrades.These topics have been mentioned in a previous blog post.How do versioned repositories add value?Versioned Repositories will enable us to deploy new Boulder and Moss features in a seamless fashion. This will enable us to introduce breaking code and on-disk format changes, that would otherwise cause installed systems to require manual intervention for them to continue to receive updates.Once versioned repositories are in place, the goal is that users will be able to simply update and sync their system as normal via the  command.Users will be upgraded to the new versions of Moss that uses a new repository format, without having to pay special attention.It will enable AerynOS to iteratively expand the capability of Moss and Boulder on existing systems without breaking user systems in the process.We consider versioned repositories a pre-requisite for what we call “try-builds” and eventually multi-arch support.Automated try-builds denotes the process whereby the infrastructure discovers an update to the upstream source repository of a package, attempts to auto-update the recipe and then attempts to build the updated package recipe in question.We think this will be a useful tool for contributors as it will automate some of the packaging tedium related to simple package version updates. It will also help enable automated regression testing and build flag optimisation in a future workstream.Included under the multi-arch umbrella is our ability to target ARM, RISC-V, and different x86 architecture levels such as x86-64-v3 or v4.Within the previous 3 month period, we have rebuilt a brand new Rust version of the infrastructure tooling that is robust enough to run in production on AerynOS servers, delivering packages to our contributors and users. This new version has proven to be more stable and performant than the old DLang version we were previously using.From a day to day perspective, unlocking the infrastructure means that we can get back to reviewing and landing recipe PRs for our package maintainers or accepting new contributors into our AerynOS ecosystem. For those wishing to contribute to AerynOS, please make sure that you have manually switched over to our new repositories before making submissions to ensure you are using all the latest tooling.Alternatively, you can wait until the automatic transition script is functional and have it make the change for you.Where to get in touch with usIf you want to engage with the team, feel free to drop by our GitHub Discussions, raise issues across our various repositories or if you’re interested in contributing, feel free to raise PRs where you think our code can be improved or where you want to submit recipes for our repo.We also have our matrix space that you can access via this link:The Development room in particular is a great place for discussions around our code.The General room is a great place to drop by and get to know the team.The Packaging room is where you want to be if you’re interested in building packages for yourself and/or submitting them to the repository.Concurrently to our work around the infrastructure re-write and repository rebuild, there has been several additional workstreams running in the background.The team has been refactoring our existing Rust code, mainly focused on our os-tools (Moss and Boulder) and we are working on several additional improvements that we want to get over the finish line before our next ISO release.We will be sharing details of this work in upcoming blog posts over the next few weeks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Getting started with Go</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lonfsi/getting_started_with_go/</link><author>/u/Brunoo_1013</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 00:04:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been programming for a while now, and I have built some projects including an IRC server in C++.

As part of it, I had what was supposed to be just a few paragraphs on how React sucks - but I just couldn't stop writing about it.So here it is a full, standalone blog post, even bigger than the one it sprang from, all about how React sucks. And how it might not even be its own fault.In my junior days, down on the streets, I used to do Angular.JS for money. At the time, it was a seriously good piece of technology. Definitely the biggest JS framework of its time, and what's most important to its legacy, probably the first time web development has had a "framework". Prior to that, they were all "libraries", so this was the first one that gave not only you a set of functions to use, but the actual framework in which you built your web app.But things are always only good in relative, and Angular was good because it's predecessors were not. At the time, we had other SPA frameworks like Backbone and Knockout, but they didn't leave as much of an impact. No, the real enemy that Angular had beaten was jQuery.Even though jQuery was only a wrapper over (at the time admittedly very shoddy) HTML DOM APIs, it still became a de-facto standard if you wanted to build complex web applications. How it worked was pretty straightforward: you create HTML elements in JS, manually and imperatively, then modify them, move them around, do whatever it takes to make the website interactive like it's an app.This all works completely fine for simple apps, but you can imagine it becoming a maintenance nightmare in case of anything bigger. And that is exactly what started happening around. You can't really blame jQuery, but only the appetites of modern users who needed that kind of interactivity everywhere. So developers were blindsided to keep using jQuery even though it was not a good fit for the job anymore.Then Angular arrived and had it all sorted out. You could focus your energy on writing the UI and app logic instead of manually assembling individual pieces of HTML. It truly was a game-changing  framework, as you finally had a proper tool to make  interactive applications. Some magic things it had:A) Components. Ok, it had a weird naming so these were actually called "directives", but in any case you could define a simple HTML and JS file combo representing a piece of UI and then reuse it across multiple places in the app.B) Two-way binding. You define a variable, and whenever it changes, all the places in the UI are updated. This worked really well. Later, people started nagging that this omnidirectional data flow is bad, so there was a push to use one-way (top-bottom) bindings instead, which does sound technically better, but in practice made everything more complicated and started a strand of discussion which ended with us all having to use Redux today. So thanks.On my first job I worked on exactly one such rewrite of an huge, unwieldy jQuery app into an Angular app. Both the process and the end results were pretty good.What was not good, though, was having to rewrite the exact same screens in Angular 2 a few years later, and I'm just happy I left that company early enough before they made me rewrite it for the third time in React later. I did get a chance later to get to learn React and even use it professionally on a project or two.I still remember seeing how fresh it looked on first glance. At the time, the contrast was with the framework of the day, which was Angular 2 - a complete rewrite of the original, but now with twice the boilerplate, Typescript-out-of-the-box, one-way binding, reactive/observable patterns - all good things on their own, but god damn was it complicated, slow to work on, slow to build, slow to run.React swung the pendulum back to the simplicity and people were up all for it. And for a while, simplicity remained, React gained popularity to become the #1  for making SPAs.Yes, now we were using the term "library" again, showing how simpler it really was. But you can't reasonably build a complex app with just a library. You need few of them to handle all of the app's concerns, and you also need some code structure. React's "bring your own beer" approach meant you basically built a framework yourself, with all the downsides it had.The end result - no two React apps were the same. Each of them had a bespoke "framework" built out of random libraries found on the internet.The apps I had the misfortune to work on at the time all made me think the same thing - even Angular 2 would be better than The JSX "core" always seemed solid, but everything around it was just plain mess.So I got out and went writing some Java backends, which I believe says it all.They say a man can never really learn anything - you either know something or you don't. I apparently don't, so I dragged myself back into React recently.Granted, it was a hobby project, so I didn't experience it "in full" like I would if it was a serious production app. But still, even this experience both confirmed and greatly exceeded my low expectations for it. React feels insane and I don't know how no one else is talking about it.First, let's start with the architecture React enforces for you. As said before, React is only a library, so it's not forcing you on anything, but still, the implicit constraints of having JSX make some patterns surface on their own. Eons ago, we used to talk about MVC, MVVM, MVP, all of which only a variations on the same theme, so which one is React? None, I believe this is a new-ish paradigm - I think we could literally call it "components-based architecture".On first glance, it's all logical. You have components, you build a top-down tree of them, and bam there's your app. React does some internal magic to make sure it's up to date with the data you give it. Simple enough.But sometime along the way, it all started acting smarter than it should really be. For a simple "UI library", React sure has a lot of loaded terminology. And for a library that doesn't have anything to do with "functional programming", it sure has a lot of functional programming names inside.Let's start from the state. If you have a top-down tree of components, it's logical you'd want to pass the state top-down too. But in practice, with components very numerous and small, this is very messy, as you spend a lot of time and code just wiring the various pieces of data to get them where you need them.This was solved by "sideloading" state into components using React hooks. I haven't heard anyone complain about this, but are you guys serious? You're saying that any component can use any piece of app state? And even worse, any component can emit a state change, that can then update in any other component.How did this ever pass a code review? You are basically using a global variable, just with more elaborate state mutation rules. They're not even rules, but merely a ceremony, because nothing is really preventing you from mutating state from anywhere. People really think if you give something a smart name like a reducer it suddenly becomes Good Architecture™?So if both top-down and sideloading approaches suck, what would be the solution for this? I honestly don't know. In fact, the only thing I can think of is: if we can't solve this nicely, then maybe the entire "components architecture" was a mistake and we shouldn've called it a paragon of Nice Design and stopped innovating. Maybe this time for a change we really did need yet another JS framework that would try something better.Next on in the "things we're unsure how they passed a code review", let's riff on React Hooks. There's no denying they're useful, but their existence even to this day raises question marks above my head.I won't even mention how people talk about components as "pure functions" but then have hooks as a tiny stateful black boxes inside of them. And given their composable nature, it's more like layers and layers of tiny stateful black boxes. But no, I'd mostly like to roast  here. It's simple what a "side effect" would be. You change a state and then you need to do some external action, like post the results to an API. This split between the "important app stuff" and "side effects" makes sense - in theory. But in practice, can you ever split it cleanly like that?My biggest gripe, for starters, is that  is used as a "run something after the component mounts". I understand when React migrated from classes to hooks, this was the closest alternative to , but come on - how is this not considered a huge hack? You're using a "side effect" hook to  the component? Ok, if you have to make an API call from there, I'd agree that would be a side effect. But then that API call... it... it sets the state too. So a completely innocous "side effect" hook actually manages a state of the component. Why is no one talking about how crazy this is?Moreover, if you wanted to depend on that state and do something after it, then you... you... define yet another  with a dependency on what the first one sets. This is a code that I have taken from a production app of company recently acquired for several tens of millions of US dollars. I slightly redacted it here to use a simpler  and  entities instead of what is actually there. But go take a look and try to parse in which order is this code executed. When you're ready, the answer is in an image below:So something like that, a series of state mutations that would otherwise be a simple imperative code is now... spread out across two asynchronous functions, where the only hint of the order of their execution is the "dependency array" at the bottom of each. And the way that you actually mentally parse it is, in fact, from the bottom to the top.I remember how Javascript promises were considered unwieldy with their s, and even before them we had "callback hell" - but literally anything would be better than this. I understand these issues could be solved a) by moving them into a separate file, which is just hiding the problem, or b) probably with some Redux or something, but I really don't have enough mileage with it to know for sure. All of this combined looks ugly, and betrays the simplicity that React promised in its "Hello world" example. But wait, I'm not done yet. I read a blog post from an acquaintance called "The Most Common React Design Patterns". Expecting I don't know what, I was still shocked at how complicated these are and how much mental overhead there is to simply figure out what is happening - and all of that just to render a list of items on a screen.The most jarring thing: the article doesn't even acknowledge it. All this complexity is taken from granted. People apparently really build their UIs like this and no one bats an eye.Then, as if that isn't enough, some of you go as far as to write "CSS-in-JS", and then get paid for it. I agree that JSX initially showed that "separation of concerns" is not "separation of files" and that it's actually okay to write your HTML and JS in a same file. But chucking in CSS in there too and making it strongly typed? Isn't this a step too far? It would be too easy to just say React is, well, downright insane, and go on with our lives. But as reasonable primates, I believe we can do better. We can try to understand it.I am once again trippin' down the memory superhighway to get reminded of my first job and a colleague from the mentioned "jQuery migration" project. A super-experienced backend engineer, an architect type, and overall a very respected guy when it came to all things software.What I remember the most about him are not his technical solutions, but the amount of judgement he'd have shown on anything we did on frontend. Looking anything on the Angular app, he was like - what the hell are you guys doing here? Why does this have to be so complicated?And it's not that we sucked - we too were a no-nonsense crew about software. It's just that at the time, through the eyes of a classical backend developer, the entire Angular setup seemed absolutely insane.Today, I'm roughly the same age as he was then, and I am here writing a blog post about how  React is insane. Some things are inevitable, I guess.But let's rise a step above and try to understand why it could be so.Firstly, I think we can all agree that most web apps shouldn't even be web apps in the first place. People go the way of SPA even if they don't need a SPA but they might need it later, so it apparently doesn't cost as much to go with SPA from scratch.But I'd argue here that such a move, in fact, does cost you. It's just that we're so entrenched in the "SPA-by-default" way that we forgot how simpler the alternatives are. Having a simple dumb server-side-rendered page is orders of magnitude simpler than even thinking about React. There's no overhead with API communication, frontend is very lightweight, your UI code can be strongly typed (if your backend is strongly typed), you can do refactors across the full stack, everything will load faster, you can cache it better because some components are very static and remain the same for all the users so you can render them only once, etc, etc.You do lose the flexibility to have complex interactive logic at your product manager's whim, though. But that's maybe only partially true, because I'd wager you could go a pretty long way with just plain Javascript "progressive enhancement" before you really get to a state management complex enough to warrant adding React in there.Ok, so I'm saying we use React simply because we've used it before. No wonder, inertia is a hell of a drug, but it still doesn't explain why this code ends up being so unthinkably complex.My answer to that question, surprisingly, stops roasting React and goes the opposite way, defending not only React, but also Angular and jQuery and everything that came before them. I think this code is bad because making a interactive UI where any component can update any other component is simply one of the most complicated things you could do in software.Think of any other system you use in your everyday life. Your kitchen sink has two inputs, hot and cold, and one output, a water running. Your kitchen mixer or a power drill might have a button or two, and still whatever you do, it only affects the action on the spinning part. An oven might have three or four or five knobs and maybe the same number of outputs, and already that is starting to sound pretty dangerous.In contrast, an interactive UI that we have on web can have potentially infinite number of inputs, and potentially infinite number of outputs. How could you even expect to have a "clean code" for this?So, this entire rant about React... it's not even React's fault. Neither is Angular's, or jQuery's. Simply, whichever tech you choose will inevitably crumble down under the impossible complexity of building a reactive UI.How could we fix this? I'm not smart or in-the-weeds enough to really solve this problem, but I can spitball some ideas. If we adopt this input/output mental model of a webpage as a real thing, then maybe we could start working on reducing a number of its inputs and outputs. On the inputs side, yeah, this is me saying: "go have fewer buttons", which may not always, or ever, be enforceable. But certainly, the less features you have, the more manageable your codebase is. It's straightforward enough to need no mentioning - or is it? Do product managers know that adding three buttons instead of two will cause 5% more bugs and make any future work on that screen 30% more complicated to design and implement? No one is even measuring those things, but I believe they could be true. Why is it that, if I told you we need to add Redis on backend, you will tell me "no, we need to curb the technical complexity" - but if a product manager asks to add a global app-wide filter that could be applied from anywhere and to anything, you'd just get your head down and write some monstruosity that people will spend the next 10 years trying to get out.In short - please, stop adding so many buttons, I beg you. You could even, I know, crazy, try to remove some of them?On the outputs side, however, the story is a bit different. Writing this makes me realize that having a server-side rendered page is basically reducing the page to a single output. Anything you interact with, it just rebuilds the entire page. This means that, ironically, removing FP-inspired React from the mix makes a server-side rendered page an actually a pure function of the state. No frontend state = big simplicity wins, if you could afford it.Inevitably, when you do need some scripting logic in your server-side rendered "app", maybe the smart move would be to add it only on the most necessary places. The smallest you could go with, the better.I thought a good name for this would be "islands of interactivity". Then I Googled it and turns out that's already a thing. Although, that post still mentions Preact, SSR, manifest files, so I'm not sure we're really on a same page. People will overcomplicate everything.But I do believe we have enough bandwidth today that you can load a small React app that only renders an island of interactivity inside of what is a classic server-side rendered page. I don't believe that mix would be that abominable, but I've yet to try it, and for my next project, I just might.So, my untested approach to having clean and maintanable frontend code is: go render it all on server and plop in React or whatever only where you really need it.It really can't be any worse than(Side note, I'm trying something new this time (no, it's not Patreon) - here are the "official" comment threads for this blog post on HackerNews and on Reddit.

But sometimes, the client I'm working with wants to use environment variables to store configuration settings, or the nature of the project means that storing settings in a TOML, YAML or JSON file is a better fit. And of course that's OK — it makes sense to be flexible and vary how configuration is managed based on the specific needs of a project and/or client.So, in this tutorial, I want to share the patterns that I use for parsing configuration settings — whether they come from flags, environment variables or files — and explain how I pass the settings onwards to where they are needed in the rest of the web application code. I'll also end with a short discussion about the relative pros and cons of the different approaches.It's a fairly detailed post, so here are the shortcut links for quick reference:To illustrate the patterns in the rest of this tutorial, let's pretend that we have a web application where we want to configure the following five settings:The port number the web application listens onEnables detailed request and error loggingMaximum duration to wait for a request to completeUsername required for HTTP Basic AuthenticationPassword required for HTTP Basic AuthenticationRegardless of where the configuration settings are coming from (flags, environment variables or a file), I'm quite strict about keeping all the code related to configuration settings isolated in one place, and reading in the configuration setting values right at the start of the program, before doing almost anything else.Most of the time, I prefer to store all the configuration setting values in a single  struct, like so:type config struct {
    port           int
    verboseLogging bool
    requestTimeout time.Duration
    basicAuth      struct {
        username string
        password string
    }
}
I like this because it feels very clear — all the configuration settings are contained in a single struct, along with their appropriate Go type, and you can easily see at a glance what configuration settings the application expects and supports.As I mentioned at the start of this tutorial, using command-line flags with the standard library  package is my preferred approach to managing configuration settings. With this approach, you explicitly pass the configuration values as part of the command when running the program. For example:$ go run main.go -port=9999 -verbose-logging=true -request-timeout=10s -basic-auth-username=admin -basic-auth-password="secr3tPa55word"
In your Go code, you define a specific command-line flag using syntax like this:flag.IntVar(&cfg.port, "port", 4000, "The port number the web application listens on")`
In this example code, we define a command-line flag named  that accepts an integer value and stores it at the location pointed to by the  pointer. It will have a default value of  if no corresponding  flag is provided when starting the application, and the final parameter is a description that will be displayed when a user runs the program with the  flag.Importantly, after you've defined all the command-line flags for your application, you need to call the  function to actually read in the values from the command-line arguments.Let's put this together in a very simple application that reads the command-line flag values into a  struct, and then prints them out.package main

import (
    "flag"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

// The config struct holds all configuration settings for the application.
type config struct {
    port           int
    verboseLogging bool
    requestTimeout time.Duration
    basicAuth      struct {
        username string
        password string
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a new config instance.
    var cfg config

    // Define the command-line flags. Notice that we define these so that the values 
    // are read directly into the appropriate config struct field, and set sensible default 
    // values for each of them.
    flag.IntVar(&cfg.port, "port", 4000, "The port number the web application listens on")
    flag.BoolVar(&cfg.verboseLogging, "verbose-logging", false, "Enables detailed request and error logging")
    flag.DurationVar(&cfg.requestTimeout, "request-timeout", 5*time.Second, "Maximum duration to wait for a request to complete")
    flag.StringVar(&cfg.basicAuth.username, "basic-auth-username", "", "Username required for HTTP Basic Authentication")
    flag.StringVar(&cfg.basicAuth.password, "basic-auth-password", "", "Password required for HTTP Basic Authentication")

    // Parse the flags with the flag.Parse function. This is important!
    flag.Parse()

    // Print all configuration settings.
    fmt.Printf("Port: %d\n", cfg.port)
    fmt.Printf("Verbose Logging: %t\n", cfg.verboseLogging)
    fmt.Printf("Request Timeout: %v\n", cfg.requestTimeout)
    fmt.Printf("Basic Auth Username: %s\n", cfg.basicAuth.username)
    fmt.Printf("Basic Auth Password: %s\n", cfg.basicAuth.password)
}
If you're following along, go ahead and run the application with your own values in the command-line flags. You should see the same values printed out by the application, like so:$ go run main.go -port=9999 -verbose-logging=true -request-timeout=30s -basic-auth-username=admin -basic-auth-password="secr3tPa55word"
Port: 9999
Verbose Logging: true
Request Timeout: 30s
Basic Auth Username: admin
Basic Auth Password: secr3tPa55wordIf you don't provide a value for a specific flag, the application will revert to using the default value you specified. For example, if you don't provide a  flag it will default to the value of , like so:$ go run main.go -basic-auth-username=admin -basic-auth-password="secr3tPa55word"
Port: 4000
Verbose Logging: false
Request Timeout: 5s
Basic Auth Username: admin
Basic Auth Password: secr3tPa55wordOne of the great things about the standard library  package is the support for automatic help text. If you run your application with the flag , it will list all the available flags for the application, along with their accompanying help text and default values if appropriate. Like so:$ go run main.go -help
Usage of /tmp/go-build2103583960/b001/exe/main:
  -basic-auth-password string
        Password required for HTTP Basic Authentication
  -basic-auth-username string
        Username required for HTTP Basic Authentication
  -port int
        The port number the web application listens on (default 4000)
  -request-timeout duration
        Maximum duration to wait for a request to complete (default 5s)
  -verbose-logging
        Enables detailed request and error loggingFor boolean flags, if you want to pass a value of  you can simply include the flag name without assigning a value. The following two commands are equivalent:$ go run main.go -verbose-logging=true
$ go run main.go -verbose-logging
In contrast, you always need to use  if you want to set a boolean flag value to .You can use one or two dashes in front of a flag name, both work identically. The standard library  package does not support 'short' flags, and the number of dashes has no effect on the behavior or any special meaning. So it's just a matter of personal taste which you use. The following two commands are equivalent:$ go run main.go -verbose-logging -request-timeout=30s
$ go run main.go --verbose-logging --request-timeout=30s
If you try to pass an invalid value as a command-line flag, the application will automatically exit with an error message and the help text for reference. For example, if you try to pass a non-integer value in the  flag, the parsing would fail and the output would look like this:$ go run main.go -port=foobar
invalid value "foobar" for flag -port: parse error
Usage of /tmp/go-build2103583960/b001/exe/main:
  -basic-auth-password string
        Password required for HTTP Basic Authentication
  -basic-auth-username string
        Username required for HTTP Basic Authentication
  -port int
        The port number the web application listens on (default 4000)
  -request-timeout duration
        Maximum duration to wait for a request to complete (default 5s)
  -verbose-logging
        Enables detailed request and error logging
exit status 2Similarly, if you try to use a flag that as not been defined, the application will automatically exit with an error message and the help text. For example:$ go run main.go -foobar=baz
flag provided but not defined: -foobar
...etcThe  package provides functions for reading command-line flag values into the following Go types: , , , , , ,  and .If you want to parse a command-line flag value into another Go type (such as  or ), you have a few different options. The simplest approach is to use the   function, which I've written about here. Or you can also make your own custom type that implements the  or  interfaces, and define the flag using either the  or  functions respectively. I've shared a gist demonstrating how to do this here.Alternatively, there are third-party packages (such as ) that you can use, which automatically support parsing command-line flags into a wider range of Go types. Personally, I've never felt it necessary to use these, but YMMV.Lastly, if you want you can create , which act like a 'container' for a distinct set of command-line flags. It's rare that I need to use flagsets in a web application, but I do often use them when building CLI applications with multiple subcommands. There's a good tutorial about how to use flagsets here.Using environment variablesFirst, I'll start by saying that you can use environment variables in conjunction with command-line flags if you want. Simply set your environment variables as normal, and use them in the command when starting your application. Like so:$ export VERBOSE_LOGGING="true"
$ export REQUEST_TIMEOUT="30s"
$ go run main.go -verbose-logging=$VERBOSE_LOGGING -request-timeout=$REQUEST_TIMEOUT
But if you don't want to do this, you can read the values from environment variables directly into your Go code using the  function. This will return the value of the environment variable as a , or the empty string  if the environment variable doesn't exist. You can also use the  function to check whether a specific environment variable exists or not.To help read values from environment variables, I like to create an  package containing some helper functions that convert the environment variable  to the appropriate Go type, and optionally set a default value for if the environment variable doesn't exist (just like command-line flags). For example:File: internal/env/env.gopackage env

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strconv"
    "time"
)

func GetInt(key string, defaultValue int) int {
    value, exists := os.LookupEnv(key)
    if !exists {
        return defaultValue
    }

    intValue, err := strconv.Atoi(value)
    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Errorf("environment variable %s=%q cannot be converted to an int", key, value))
    }
    return intValue
}

func GetBool(key string, defaultValue bool) bool {
    value, exists := os.LookupEnv(key)
    if !exists {
        return defaultValue
    }

    boolValue, err := strconv.ParseBool(value)
    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Errorf("environment variable %s=%q cannot be converted to a bool", key, value))
    }
    return boolValue
}

func GetDuration(key string, defaultValue time.Duration) time.Duration {
    value, exists := os.LookupEnv(key)
    if !exists {
        return defaultValue
    }

    durationValue, err := time.ParseDuration(value)
    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Errorf("environment variable %s=%q cannot be converted to a time.Duration", key, value))
    }
    return durationValue
}

func GetString(key string, defaultValue string) string {
    value, exists := os.LookupEnv(key)
    if !exists {
        return defaultValue
    }
    return value
}
In some projects, I use a twist on these helper functions and panic if a specific environment variable isn't set, rather than returning a default value. For example:func MustGetInt(key string) int {
    value, exists := os.LookupEnv(key)
    if !exists {
        panic(fmt.Errorf("environment variable %s must be set", key))
    }

    intValue, err := strconv.Atoi(value)
    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Errorf("environment variable %s=%q cannot be converted to an int", key, value))
    }
    return intValue
}
Using those helper functions in your application then looks a bit like this:package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "your-project/internal/env"
)

type config struct {
    port           int
    verboseLogging bool
    requestTimeout time.Duration
    basicAuth      struct {
        username string
        password string
    }
}

func main() {
    var cfg config

    cfg.port = env.GetInt("PORT", 4000)
    cfg.verboseLogging = env.GetBool("VERBOSE_LOGGING", false)
    cfg.requestTimeout = env.GetDuration("REQUEST_TIMEOUT", 5*time.Second)
    cfg.basicAuth.username = env.GetString("BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME", "")
    cfg.basicAuth.password = env.GetString("BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD", "")

    fmt.Printf("Port: %d\n", cfg.port)
    fmt.Printf("Verbose Logging: %t\n", cfg.verboseLogging)
    fmt.Printf("Request Timeout: %v\n", cfg.requestTimeout)
    fmt.Printf("Basic Auth Username: %s\n", cfg.basicAuth.username)
    fmt.Printf("Basic Auth Password: %s\n", cfg.basicAuth.password)
}
If you'd like to try this out, go ahead and add the necessary environment variables to your  or  files, or  them in your shell, and try running the application again. You should see the configuration settings reflected in the output, or any default values for ones that you didn't set.$ export PORT="9999"
$ export VERBOSE_LOGGING="false"
$ export BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME="admin"
$ export BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="secr3tPa55word"
$ go run main.go 
Port: 9999
Verbose Logging: false
Request Timeout: 5s
Basic Auth Username: admin
Basic Auth Password: secr3tPa55wordIf you're working on multiple projects on the same development machine (and not using separate containers for each project), it can become awkward to manage environment variables and avoid clashes across the projects. Rather than setting environment variables in  or , a fairly common workaround is to create an  file in your project containing the environment variables, like so:export PORT=5000
export VERBOSE_LOGGING=true
export REQUEST_TIMEOUT=10s
export BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=admin
export BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=secr3tPa55word
Then you can  the  file to export the variables in the current terminal session and run your Go application:$ source .env 
$ go run main.go 
Port: 5000
Verbose Logging: true
Request Timeout: 10s
Basic Auth Username: admin
Basic Auth Password: secr3tPa55wordAlternatively, if you don't want to keep running the  command, you can use the  package to automatically load the values from the  file into the environment when your application starts up.Using configuration filesThe third option that I sometimes use is configuration files, which store all the settings in a single file on-disk. I normally only use these in projects where there are  of configuration settings, and loading them all via command-line flags would be onerous and error-prone. Or also, if the configuration settings are complex, with a deeply nested 'structure' to them.There are a lot of different formats that you can use for configuration files, such as TOML or YAML — or even JSON. They all have different advantages and disadvantages, and you'll be hard-pressed to find one that everybody agrees is 'perfect'. But whatever format you choose, there is probably a Go package that you can use to automatically parse values from the file into a  struct for you.For example, let's say that you want to use TOML and have a configuration file that looks like this:# Server configuration
port = 4000
verbose_logging = true
request_timeout = "10s"

# Basic authentication settings
[basic_auth]
username = "admin"
password = "secr3tPa55word"
You can use the  package to read the file and unpack the contents to a  struct like so:package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "time"

    "github.com/BurntSushi/toml"
)

// Make sure the struct fields are exported, so that the BurntSushi/toml package
// can write to them, and use struct tags to map the TOML key/value pairs to the
// appropriate struct field.
type config struct {
    Port           int           `toml:"port"`
    VerboseLogging bool          `toml:"verbose_logging"`
    RequestTimeout time.Duration `toml:"request_timeout"`
    BasicAuth      struct {
        Username string `toml:"username"`
        Password string `toml:"password"`
    } `toml:"basic_auth"`
}

func main() {
    var cfg config

    // Load configuration settings from the config.toml file.
    metadata, err := toml.DecodeFile("config.toml", &cfg)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("error loading configuration: %v", err)
    }

    // Check for any undecoded keys in the config.toml file.
    if len(metadata.Undecoded()) > 0 {
        log.Fatalf("unknown configuration keys: %v", metadata.Undecoded())
    }

    fmt.Printf("Port: %d\n", cfg.Port)
    fmt.Printf("Verbose Logging: %t\n", cfg.VerboseLogging)
    fmt.Printf("Request Timeout: %v\n", cfg.RequestTimeout)
    fmt.Printf("Basic Auth Username: %s\n", cfg.BasicAuth.Username)
    fmt.Printf("Basic Auth Password: %s\n", cfg.BasicAuth.Password)
}
Notice that in this code we're making use of the metadata returned by the  function to check if any settings were not decoded successfully — which should help to catch typos or invalid keys in the TOML file.Passing settings to where they are neededGetting the configuration settings into the  struct, wherever they come from, is the first half of the puzzle. The second part is getting those settings to where you need them in your Go code. There are many different ways to approach this, and no single 'right' way. For small or medium sized web applications, I often use a pattern of creating an  struct which contains all the dependencies that my HTTP handlers need, and I implement the handlers as methods on the  struct. To make the configuration settings available to the HTTP handlers, I simply include the  struct as a field in . package main

import (
    "flag"
    "fmt"
    "log/slog"
    "net/http"
    "os"
    "time"
)

type config struct {
    port           int
    verboseLogging bool
    requestTimeout time.Duration
    basicAuth      struct {
        username string
        password string
    }
}

// The application struct contains the dependencies for the handlers, including 
// the config struct
type application struct {
    config config
    logger *slog.Logger
}

func main() {
    logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil))

    var cfg config
    flag.IntVar(&cfg.port, "port", 4000, "The port number the web application listens on")
    flag.BoolVar(&cfg.verboseLogging, "verbose-logging", false, "Enables detailed request and error logging")
    flag.DurationVar(&cfg.requestTimeout, "request-timeout", 5*time.Second, "Maximum duration to wait for a request to complete")
    flag.StringVar(&cfg.basicAuth.username, "basic-auth-username", "", "Username required for HTTP Basic Authentication")
    flag.StringVar(&cfg.basicAuth.password, "basic-auth-password", "", "Password required for HTTP Basic Authentication")
    flag.Parse()

    app := &application{
        config: cfg,
        logger: logger,
    }

    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/", app.home)

    // Use the port configuration setting
    logger.Info("starting server", "port", cfg.port)

    err := http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%d", cfg.port), mux)
    if err != nil {
        logger.Error(err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}

func (app *application) home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Use the verboseLogging configuration setting
    if app.config.verboseLogging {
        app.logger.Info("handling request", "method", r.Method, "path", r.URL.Path)
    }

    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello!")
}
If you run this application with the  flag, and make a HTTP request to , you should see the details of the request in the log output, similar to below — demonstrating that the config setting is correctly available to the handler.$ go run main.go -verbose-logging
time=2025-06-27T14:15:40.230+02:00 level=INFO msg="starting server" port=4000
time=2025-06-27T14:15:48.705+02:00 level=INFO msg="handling request" method=GET path=/In larger applications where I want to define my handlers outside of , or pass the config struct to functions in other packages, I normally define an exported  struct in an  package, and pass this around as necessary. For example, let's say that you have a project structure like so:├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go
└── internal
    ├── config
    │   └── config.go
    └── handlers
        └── home.go
Then the contents of those  files would look something like this:File: internal/config/config.go 
package config

import "time"

type Config struct {
    Port           int
    VerboseLogging bool
    RequestTimeout time.Duration

        Username string
        Password string
    }
}

    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

            logger.Info("handling request", "method", r.Method, "path", r.URL.Path)

    }
}

    logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil))

    var cfg config.Config

    flag.DurationVar(&cfg.RequestTimeout, "request-timeout", 5*time.Second, "Maximum duration to wait for a request to complete")

    flag.Parse()

    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/", handlers.Home(cfg, logger))

    // Use the port configuration setting
    logger.Info("starting server", "port", cfg.Port)

    err := http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%d", cfg.Port), mux)
    if err != nil {
        logger.Error(err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
Obviously I'm using command-line flags in these examples, but the same patterns work for environment variables or config files too — once the  struct is loaded with the data, it doesn't matter where it originally came from and the code patterns are the same.If you've been in the web development world for a long time and buy into the 12-factor app principles (which I generally do), you might think that the correct approach is "just use environment variables". But over the years I've come to the conclusion that they have some drawbacks:I've been bitten more times than I want by bugs that were ultimately a result of an unset or unexpected value in an environment variable — and I think that part of the problem here is that environment variables aren't readily and easily observable in the same way that the values in command-line flags or a configuration file are. If you're working on multiple projects on the same development machine (rather than working in separate containers for each project), you have to manage the lack of natural isolation between environment variables... you need to make sure that there aren't any naming clashes, and that (for example) application A isn't accidentally using the  setting intended for application B.I've also seen a lot of Go codebases where configuration settings are read in using at the point in the code where they are needed. This makes discoverability difficult — it's hard to look at an application's code and easily see what the expected configuration settings are. You can mitigate these issues with some of the techniques that we've discussed in this tutorial. If you're strict about reading all the settings into a single  struct at application startup, that addresses the discoverability problem. If you create helpers like  which panic if an environment variable isn't set, that helps to eliminate bugs that exist due to missing environment variables. And you can work around some of the environment variable isolation problems in development by using a  file — but at that point, it might be worth considering whether a configuration file might be more appropriate.One of the big reasons that I like to use command-line flags is that you get a lot of stuff for free. You get automatic  text, automatic type conversions, the ability to set defaults, and it handles invalid inputs and undefined flags nicely. Also, it's always very clear what configuration values are being used — you either explicitly pass the values when starting the application, or the default values hardcoded into your Go codebase are used. On top of that, most other gophers will be familiar with the  package and you don't need any third-party dependencies.When I'm using command-line flags, I typically set the default values to things that are appropriate for a development environment. This is mainly so I don't have to keep typing long commands to run the application when actively developing it.In terms of application secrets, like I mentioned earlier, there's nothing stopping you from storing a specific secret in an environment variable and using it in conjunction with a command-line flag if you want. For example, if you store a password for your database user in a  environment variable, you can include it as a command-line flag value when starting the application like so:$ go run main.go -db-user=web -db-password=$DB_PASSWORD
Or, although it is a bit more 'magical', you could even use the environment variable as the default value:flag.StringVar(&cfg.db.password, "db-password", os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD"), "Database user password")
So, for all these reasons, I tend to prefer using command-line flags for configuration. The big exception to this is when there are  of configuration settings, and it would be awkward to pass them all via command-line flags, or the settings have a deeply nested 'structure' to them. In these cases, I think it can be more practical and maintainable to store the settings in a TOML or JSON configuration file, and load them on application startup like we demonstrated earlier.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Built a geospatial game in Go using PostGIS where you plant seeds at real locations</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1loboyo/built_a_geospatial_game_in_go_using_postgis_where/</link><author>/u/SoaringSignificant</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:14:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I built this thing where you plant virtual seeds at real GPS locations and have to go back to water them or they die. Sounds dumb but I had fun making it and it's kinda fun to use.Like you plant a seed at your gym, and if you don't go back within a few days your plant starts losing health. I've got a bunch of plants that I'm trying to get to level 10.Built the main logic in Go, TypeScript + React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS for all the geospatial queries, though a bunch of that stuff happens in the service layer too. The geospatial stuff was interesting to work out, I ended up implementing plants and soils as circles since it makes the overlap detection and containment math way simpler. Figuring out when a plant fits inside a soil area or when two plants would overlap becomes basic circle geometry instead of dealing with complex polygons.Plants decay every 4 hours unless you water them recently (there's a grace period system). Got a bunch of other mechanics like different soil types and plant tempers that are not fully integrated into the project right now. Just wanted to get the core loop working first and see how people actually use it.You just need to get within like 10 meters of your plant to water it, but I'm still playing with these values to see what ends up being a good fit. Used to have it at 5 metres before but it made development a pain. The browser's geolocation api is so unreliable that I'd avoid it in future projects.Been using it during development and it's actually getting me to go places more regularly but my plant graveyard is embarrassingly large though.Here's a link to the repo and the live site for anyone interested in trying it out: GitHub | Live Site]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Exploring Text Classification: Is Golang Viable or Should I Use Pytho</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lobi9d/exploring_text_classification_is_golang_viable_or/</link><author>/u/Fit_Honeydew4256</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:07:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I’m still in the early stages of exploring a project idea where I want to classify text into two categories based on writing patterns.

These were combined to make an 8-bit ripple-carry adder as well as an 8-bit adder/subtractor circuit. Define inputs A and B (white = 0, black = 1) using bucket fill.To run the circuit/computation, use the colour picker and fill tool to cycle through a sequence of colour changes from the “Bus” and “Probe” squares on the left and apply them to the circuit leads on the right.This is where my knowledge of computer science ends, and I'm not sure how far this could theoretically be taken. There are a few quirks that make this particularly challenging. For example, all logical components of the circuit are single-use (i.e., at the end of the computation, the entire circuit is black/white, and all the colour pixel logic is lost). Also, because this is in 2-dimensions it's not possible to cross/bridging/tunnel "wires" to make complex compound logic gates (XOR and XNOR). There's also a challenge with back-propagation, where colour fills don't just go forward down the circuit, but travel back and affect other parts of the circuit.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Don’t Be Ashamed to Say &quot;I Don’t Know&quot;</title><link>https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/i-dont-know</link><author>/u/teivah</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 15:55:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello! Today, let’s discuss the power of “I don’t know“ with a personal story.Last month, I was at the hospital with my partner for the birth of our newborn. During our stay, my partner experienced a specific symptom, and we wanted to understand what could be causing it. So we asked the midwife.We immediately noticed the hesitation in her eyes. When she finally gave an answer, it came with a kind of forced confidence, and we both felt she wasn’t sure about it.At our hospital, midwives do 12-hour shifts. So a few hours later, we asked the exact same question to the next midwife. Same hesitation, but this time, a different answer.And so it went on. Every shift, we asked again. Every time, a different answer. Eventually, it even became a game between my partner and me: trying to guess what the next answer would be.Until… The one. The one who broke this cycle.We asked her the same question. She paused. Thought about it. And then said something unexpected:Twenty minutes later, she even came back to our room and said:I asked the doctor, the answer is because of [X]. Thanks for asking, I learned something.That brief exchange resonated with me.In our field, we often put a lot of weight on posture. We build up our position as the go-to person for a codebase, a data model, or a framework. The more we know, the more we are seen as the one to consult or include in any related discussion.But from that posture, admitting we don’t know something can feel like pulling out the bottom card in a house of cards. Suddenly, it feels like everything we built to earn that status might collapse.Yet, if we take a step back, admitting we don’t know shouldn’t be seen as something shameful or embarrassing. In fact, it’s often the most responsible thing we can do.Pretending to know can lead to bad decisions.Authority isn’t built on knowing everything.Teams work better when people feel safe to admit uncertainty.Curiosity + humility = real learning. Whether it’s for us or others, next time we don’t know something, let’s be like that midwife: let’s just admit it. Without shame.How comfortable are you with saying “I don’t know“?If you made it this far and enjoyed the post, please consider giving it a like.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>4 of the top 10 YouTube channels are AI-generated</title><link>https://sherwood.news/tech/ai-created-videos-are-quietly-taking-over-youtube/</link><author>/u/Alone-Competition-77</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:55:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[YouTube has never stayed still for long. The video powerhouse owned by  started its life as a place to upload home movies, only to use its early scale to morph into a user-generated MTV, birthing an entire universe of homegrown celebrities. It’s since evolved in two competing directions: incentivizing longer, more professional videos to compete with Netflix but also shorter, more ephemeral videos to compete with TikTok.And it looks as if it’s changing again. The age of AI has finally arrived for YouTube, and it could be its most existential shift yet.Over the past few months, Garbage Day has tracked how a range of AI-generated videos have found increasing success on the platform, taking up attention and space over more professional creators. More than a few of them seemingly rely on inauthentic engagement to boost their attention — though, in a platform overrun with AI, it’s worth asking if that even matters.At the same time, though, some of YouTube’s biggest success stories have shown less and less interest in the platform, focusing their efforts and promotion on places like TikTok and Instagram. All of this suggests a watershed moment for the internet’s biggest video site. In May, four of the top 10 YouTube channels with the most subscribers featured AI-generated material in every video. Not all the channels are using the same AI programs, and there are indications that some contain human-made elements, but none of these channels has ever uploaded a video that was made entirely without AI — and each has uploaded a constant stream of videos, which is crucial to their success.While not all of the videos from these AI channels are identical, the most successful examples tend to find a theme and stick to it. Some, like “Chick of Honor,” use tools like Hailuo for the instantly established format of cute animals in visibly dangerous or tragic situations. Others, like “Masters of Prophecy,” upload AI-generated music videos for AI-generated songs, made with Suno to evoke ’80s synth nostalgia.This is a profound change in how YouTube looked even just six months ago. In January, for instance, the most popular account making videos with AI got 2.5 million subscribers and 220 million views — barely in the top 20 for the month. In June, the top four AI channels combined to get more than 23 million subscribers and 800 million views. The algorithm clearly favors AI channels now, enough that they’re getting a much better ratio of views to subscriptions.This does make some sense. Generative-AI-driven channels do fix one core problem YouTube has struggled with ever since it started pushing more professional video content: not every creator has the time, resources, or skills to make Netflix-level content. Google’s ad revenue split doesn’t exactly pay for the costs that come with making your channel more professional, while AI videos all tend to be a certain standard and cost sometimes cents to produce.Generating content like this allows YouTubers to keep up with increasingly high demand from the platform’s algorithms, especially where YouTube Shorts are concerned. As the definition of Shorts has changed constantly to keep up with competitors like TikTok, YouTube has focused on their profitability much more than their appeal to creators. Starting in March, the platform changed the qualification of viewing a Short from watching it for a few seconds to any time the video starts or loops. According to DigiDay, this was done to make tracking engagement metrics for marketers easier, while individual creators still see the same revenue. Meanwhile, Shorts has also become a testing ground for Google’s many AI tools, whether that’s making clips with Veo or searching through them with Google Lens. Each popular AI-filled channel uploaded at least one Short in the month of May. Some, like “Chick of Honor,” uploaded entirely Shorts rather than full videos; others just made shorter clips of their videos and streams.This all feeds into YouTube’s aspirations for TV domination, as well. A report from Nielsen last month shows that it’s maintained the highest share of all TV viewing for several months straight, and it’s been the top streaming service for more than a year. This enormous share is reflected in its profits, as recent estimates say the platform is set to surpass Disney as the world’s most profitable media company. YouTube has tried to present itself as a competitor to streaming services for years, showcasing users like Alan Chikin Chow, whose YouTube videos are made in a massive production studio. But AI-generated music channels can play just as easily on a TV without any of the production costs.Masters of Prophecy is currently the fastest-growing channel across all of YouTube, going from a few hundred subscribers in February to over 30 million in June, and all of its content is AI-generated. But that growth looks suspicious, especially looking at how it began by going from less than 300 subscribers to more than 100,000 in a single day without any new videos, Shorts, or comments in that time. But again, on a platform increasingly powered — and populated — by AI, what does inauthentic growth even mean? At the end of the day, an AI bot isn’t going to buy a product from an advertiser.It’s clear that YouTube doesn’t want to answer that question. In many ways, it feels like it’s hoping no one notices how popular AI content is. With a quiet misdirect, and if users (and more importantly, advertisers) don’t complain, everyone will just keep making money. But it also means that at some point in the near future, you’ll open up the app and suddenly realize there aren’t any humans on it anymore. is an award-winning newsletter that focuses on web culture and technology, covering a mix of memes, trends, and internet drama.

definition of ‘create’). It is to this principle that I believe I owe everything I’m truly good at. Some will tell you
to avoid reinventing the wheel, but they’re wrong: you  build your own wheel, because it’ll teach you more about
how they work than reading a thousand books on them ever will.In 2025, the beauty and craft of writing software is being eroded. AI is threatening to replace us (or, at least, the
most joyful aspects of our craft) and software development is being increasingly commodified, measured, packaged, and
industrialised. Software development needs more simple joy, and I’ve found that creating toy programs is a great way to
remember why I started working with computers again.Toy programs follow the 80:20 rule: 20% of the work, 80% of the functionality. The point is  to build
production-worthy software (although it is true that some of the best production software began life as a toy).
Aggressively avoid over-engineering, restrict yourself to only whatever code is necessary to achieve your goal. Have
every code path panic/crash until you’re forced to implement it to make progress. You might be surprised by just how
easy it is to build toy versions of software you might previously have considered to be insummountably difficult to
create.I’ve been consistently surprised by just how often some arcane nugget of knowledge I’ve acquired when working on a toy
project has turned out to be immensely valuable in my day job, either by giving me a head-start on tracking down a
problem in a tool or library, or by recognising mistakes before they’re made.Understanding the constraints that define the shape of software is vital for working with it, and there’s no better way
to gain insight into those constraints than by running into them head-first. You might even come up with some novel
solutions!Here is a list of toy programs I’ve attempted over the past 15 years, rated by difficulty and time required. These
ratings are estimates and assume that you’re already comfortable with at least one general-purpose programming language
and that, like me, you tend to only have an hour or two per day free to write code. Also included are some suggested
resources that I found useful.Regex engine (difficulty = 4/10, time = 5 days)A regex engine that can read a POSIX-style regex program and recognise strings that match it. Regex is simple yet
shockingly expressive, and writing a competent regex engine will teach you everything you need to know about using the
language too.x86 OS kernel (difficulty = 7/10, time = 2 months)A multiboot-compatible OS kernel with a simple CLI, keyboard/mouse driver, ANSI escape sequence support, memory manager,
scheduler, etc. Additional challenges include writing an in-memory filesystem, user mode and process isolation, loading
ELF executables, and supporting enough video hardware to render a GUI.GameBoy/NES emulator (difficulty = 6/10, time = 3 weeks)A crude emulator for the simplest GameBoy or NES games. The GB and the NES are classics, and both have relatively simple
instruction sets and peripheral hardware. Additional challenges include writing competent PPU (video) and PSG (audio)
implementations, along with dealing with some of the more exotic cartridge formats.GameBoy Advance game (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2 weeks)A sprite-based game (top-down or side-on platform). The GBA is a beautiful little console to write code for and there’s
an active and dedicated development community for the console. I truly believe that the GBA is one of the last game
consoles that can be fully and completely understood by a single developer, right down to instruction timings.Physics engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 1 week)A 2D rigid body physics engine that implements Newtonian physics with support for rectangles, circles, etc. On the
simplest end, just spheres that push away from one-another is quite simple to implement. Things start to get complex
when you introduce more complex shapes, angular momentum, and the like. Additional challenges include making collision
resolution fast and scaleable, having complex interactions move toward a steady state over time, soft-body interactions,
etc.Dynamic interpreter (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)A tree-walking interpreter for a JavaScript-like language with basic flow control. There’s an unbounded list of extra
things to add to this one, but being able to write programs in my own language still gives me child-like elation. It
feels like a sort of techno-genesis: once you’ve got your own language, you can start building the universe within it.Compiler for a C-like (difficulty = 8/10, time = 3 months)A compiler for a simply-typed C-like programming language with support for at least one target archtecture. Extra
challenges include implementing some of the most common optimisations (inlining, const folding, loop-invariant code
motion, etc.) and designing an intermediate representation (IR) that’s general enough to support multiple backends.Text editor (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-4 weeks)This one has a lot of variability. At the blunt end, simply reading and writing a file can be done in a few lines of
Python. But building something that’s closer to a daily driver gets more complex. You could choose to implement the UI
using a toolkit like QT or GTK, but I personally favour an editor that works in the console. Properly handling unicode,
syntax highlighting, cursor movement, multi-buffer support, panes/windows, tabs, search/find functionality, LSP support,
etc. can all add between a week or a month to the project. But if you persist, you might join the elite company of those
developers who use an editor of their own creation.Async runtime (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)There’s a lot of language-specific variability as to what ‘async’ actually means. In Rust, at least, this means a
library that can ingest  tasks and poll them concurrently until completion. Adding support for I/O waking
makes for a fun challenge.Hash map (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)Hash maps (or sets/dictionaries, as a higher-level language might call them) are a programmer’s bread & butter. And yet,
surprisingly few of us understand how they really work under the bonnet. There are a plethora of techniques to throw
into the mix too: closed or open addressing, tombstones, the robin hood rule, etc. You’ll gain an appreciation for when
and why they’re fast, and also when you should just use a vector + linear search.Rasteriser / texture-mapper (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2 weeks)Most of us have played with simple 3D graphics at some point, but how many of us truly understand how the graphics
pipeline works and, more to the point, how to fix it when it doesn’t work? Writing your own software rasteriser will
give you that knowledge, along with a new-found appreciation for the beauty of vector maths and half-spaces that have
applications across many other fields. Additional complexity involves properly implementing clipping, a Z-buffer, N-gon
rasterisation, perspective-correct texture-mapping, Phong or Gouraud shading, shadow-mapping, etc.SDF Rendering (difficulty = 5/10, time = 3 days)Signed Distance Fields are a beautifully simple way to render 3D spaces defined through mathematics, and are perfectly
suited to demoscene shaders. With relatively little work you can build yourself a cute little visualisation or some
moving shapes like the graphics demos of the 80s. You’ll also gain an appreciation for shader languages and vector
maths.Voxel engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2 weeks)I doubt there are many reading this that haven’t played Minecraft. It’s surprisingly easy to build your own toy voxel
engine cut from a similar cloth, especially if you’ve got some knowledge of 3D graphics or game development already. The
simplicity of a voxel engine, combined with the near-limitless creativity that can be expressed with them, never ceases
to fill me with joy. Additional complexity can be added by tackling textures, more complex procedural generation,
floodfill lighting, collisions, dynamic fluids, sending voxel data over the network, etc.Threaded Virtual Machine (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)Writing interpreters is great fun. What’s more fun? . If you keep pushing interpreters as far as
they can go without doing architecture-specific codegen (like AOT or JIT), you’ll eventually wind up (re)discovering
 (not to be confused with multi-threading, which is a very different beast). It’s a beautiful way of
weaving programs together out highly-optimised miniature programs, and a decent implementation can even give an AOT
compiler a run for its money in the performance department.GUI Toolkit (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2-3 weeks)Most of us have probably cobbled together a GUI program using tkinter, GTK, QT, or WinForms. But why not try writing
your GUI toolkit? Additional complexity involves implementing a competent layout engine, good text shaping (inc.
unicode support), accessibility support, and more. Fair warning: do not encourage people to use your tool unless it’s
 - the world has enough GUIs with little-to-no accessibility or localisation support.Orbital Mechanics Sim (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)A simple simulation of Newtonian gravity can be cobbled together in a fairly short time. Infamously, gravitational
systems with more than two bodies cannot be solved analytically, so you’ll have to get familiar with iterative
 methods. Additional complexity comes with implementing more precise and faster integration methods,
accounting for relativistic effects, and writing a visualiser. If you’ve got the maths right, you can even try plugging
in real numbers from NASA to predict the next high tide or full moon.Bitwise Challenge (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2-3 days)Here’s one I came up with for myself, but I think it would make for a great game jam: write a game that only persists 64
bits of state between subsequent frames. That’s 64 bits for everything: the entire frame-for-frame game state should be
reproducible using only 64 bits of data. It sounds simple, but it forces you to get incredibly creative with your game
state management. Details about the rules can be found on the GitHub page below.An ECS Framework (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)For all those game devs out there: try building your own ECS
framework. It’s not as hard as you might think (you might have accidentally done it already!). Extra points if you can
build in safety and correctness features, as well as good integration with your programming language of choice’s type
system features.I built a custom ECS for my Super Mario 64 on the GBA project due to the
unique performance and memory constraints of the platform, and enjoyed it a lot.CHIP-8 Emulator (difficulty = 3/10, time = 3-6 days)The CHIP-8 is a beautifully simple virtual machine from the 70s. You can write
a fully compliant emulator in a day or two, and there are an enormous plethora of fan-made games that run on it.
Here’s a game I made for it.Chess engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-5 days)Writing a chess engine is great fun. You’ll start off with every move it makes being illegal, but over time it’ll get
smart and smarter. Experiencing a loss to your own chess engine really is a rite of passage, and it feels magical.POSIX shell (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)We interact with shells every day, and building one will teach you can incredible amount about POSIX - how it works, and
how it doesn’t. A simple one can be built in a day, but compliance with an existing shell language will take time and
teach you more than you ever wanted to know about its quirks.A note on learning and LLMsPerhaps you’re a user of LLMs. I get it, they’re neat tools. They’re useful for certain kinds of learning. But I might
suggest resisting the temptation to use them for projects like this. Knowledge is not supposed to be fed to you on a
plate. If you want that sort of learning, read a book - the joy in building toy projects like this comes from an
exploration of the unknown, without polluting one’s mind with an existing solution. If you’ve been using LLMs for a
while, this cold-turkey approach might even be painful at first, but persist. There is no joy without pain.The runner’s high doesn’t come to those that take the bus.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Won at a Hackathon</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lo968z/won_at_a_hackathon/</link><author>/u/MasterBach</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:37:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Internal corporate hackathon.

Other crates also don't have a clean reusable model for ansi strings and alot of weird chaining and storing methods are used for it to be used.Ansic solves those problems with a clean and reusable proc macro which uses a clean and convenient DSL which outputs raw string literals at compile time for  runtime overhead.The  macro is the foundation of ansic, in here you write all your DSL expressions to define a style and it spits out the raw &str literal.Ansic has two different types of expressions separated by a space for each; Styles and colors.Colors: Colors are simply written with their names (like "green" and "red) but every single color supports extra arguments prefixed or postfixed by writing the format:  where each argument is with a dot before the color. There are two arguments for colors:(by default if you dont provide the bg argument to a color its treated as a foreground color)so let's say you want to make a ansi style which is a bright red foreground, then you can write , and it will output the string literal for the ansi equivalent, and if you want a bright red foreground with a bright green background you can do ansi!(br.red bg.br.green). We also support 24bit rgb with the color syntax .We also have styles (they don't take arguments) with for example the  and  styles with ansi!(br.red underline bg.green bold) for example (bright red foreground underline green background and bold ansi).Ansic also encourages a consistent and reusable and simple architecture for styling with const:use ansic::ansi; const ERROR: &'static str = ansi!(red bold underline); const R: &'static str = ansi!(reset); fn main() { println!("{ERROR}ERROR: something wrong happened!{R}"); } This encourages a reuseable, elegant and very easy way to style which muss less overhead (contradicting other crates with much less readable and elegant styles of styling)🛠️ I built  because I was frustrated with other ansi crates:It was hard to read, reuse and manage weirdly chained styles, and I hated that every time I used it there was a runtime calculation to make the styles even work. I love  because it solves all those problems with a clean reuseable model, DSL which is easy to read and maintain, and a proc macro which does everything at compile time.I'm also 100% open to feedback, reviews, discussions and criticism!🎨 Add ansic to style with ansi with !🌟 If you like the project, please consider leaving a star on our GitHub page!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Says Its New AI System Diagnosed Patients 4 Times More Accurately Than Human Doctors</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-medical-superintelligence-diagnosis/</link><author>/u/wiredmagazine</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:31:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ “a genuine step toward medical superintelligence,” says Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the company’s artificial intelligence arm. The tech giant says its powerful new AI tool can diagnose disease four times more accurately and at significantly less cost than a panel of human physicians.The experiment tested whether the tool could correctly diagnose a patient with an ailment, mimicking work typically done by a human doctor.The Microsoft team used 304 case studies sourced from the New England Journal of Medicine to devise a test called the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark. A language model broke down each case into a step-by-step process that a doctor would perform in order to reach a diagnosis.Microsoft’s researchers then built a system called the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO) that queries several leading AI models—including OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, and xAI’s Grok—in a way that loosely mimics several human experts working together.In their experiment, MAI-DxO outperformed human doctors, achieving an accuracy of 80 percent compared to the doctors’ 20 percent. It also reduced costs by 20 percent by selecting less expensive tests and procedures."This orchestration mechanism—multiple agents that work together in this chain-of-debate style—that's what's going to drive us closer to medical superintelligence,” Suleyman says.The company poached several Google AI researchers to help with the effort—yet another sign of an intensifying war for top AI expertise in the tech industry. Suleyman was previously an executive at Google working on AI.AI is already widely used in some parts of the US health care industry, including helping radiologists interpret scans. The latest multimodal AI models have the potential to act as more general diagnostic tools, though the use of AI in health care raises its own issues, particularly related to bias from training data that’s skewed toward particular demographics.Microsoft has not yet decided if it will try to commercialize the technology, but the same executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the company could integrate it into Bing to help users diagnose ailments. The company could also develop tools to help medical experts improve or even automate patient care. “What you'll see over the next couple of years is us doing more and more work proving these systems out in the real world,” Suleyman says.The project is the latest in a growing body of research showing how AI models can diagnose disease. In the last few years, both Microsoft and Google have published papers showing that large language models can accurately diagnose an ailment when given access to medical records.The new Microsoft research differs from previous work in that it more accurately replicates the way human physicians diagnose disease—by analyzing symptoms, ordering tests, and performing further analysis until a diagnosis is reached. Microsoft describes the way that it combined several frontier AI models as “a path to medical superintelligence” in a blog post about the project today.The project also suggests that AI could help lower health care costs, a critical issue, particularly in the US. "Our model performs incredibly well, both getting to the diagnosis and getting to that diagnosis very cost effectively," says Dominic King, a vice president at Microsoft who is involved with the project.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Changing max pods limit in already established cluster - Microk8s</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lo7cxk/changing_max_pods_limit_in_already_established/</link><author>/u/BunkerFrog</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:20:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, I do have quite beefy setup. Cluster of 4x 32core/64thread with 512GB RAM. Nodes are bare metal. I used stock setup with stock config of microk8s and while there was no problem I had reached limit of 110 pods/node. There are still plenty of system resources to utilize - for now using like 30% of CPU and RAM / node.Question #1: Can I change limit on already running cluster? (there are some posts on internet that this change can only be done during cluster/node setup and can't be changed later)Question #2: If it is possible to change it on already established cluster, will it be possible to change it via "master" or need to be changed manually on each nodeQuestion #3: What real max should I use to not make my life with networking harder? (honestly I would be happy if 200 would pass)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>rust-analyzer changelog #292</title><link>https://rust-analyzer.github.io/thisweek/2025/06/30/changelog-292.html</link><author>/u/WellMakeItSomehow</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:17:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here is My 3D Pool Simulator for Linux</title><link>https://github.com/sysrpl/Raylib.4.0.Pascal/blob/master/examples/table/README.md</link><author>/u/sysrpl</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:24:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I&apos;m getting an error after certificate renewal please help</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lo509h/im_getting_an_error_after_certificate_renewal/</link><author>/u/Known_Wallaby_1821</author><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 11:23:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, My Kubernetes cluster was running smoothly until I tried to renew the certificates after they expired. I ran the following commands:sudo kubeadm certs renew allecho 'export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf' >> ~/.bashrcAfter that, some abnormalities started to appear in my cluster. Calico is completely down and even after deleting and reinstalling it, it does not come back up at all.When I check the daemonsets and deployments in the kube-system namespace, I see:kubectl get daemonset -n kube-systemNAME DESIRED CURRENT READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE NODE SELECTOR AGEkubectl get deployments -n kube-systemNAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGEcalico-kube-controllers 0/1 0 0 4m19sBefore this, I was also getting "unauthorized" errors in the kubelet logs, which started after renewing the certificates. This is definitely abnormal because the pods created from deployments are not coming up and remain stuck.There is no error message shown during deployment either. Please help.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
