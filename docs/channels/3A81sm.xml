If you are still running Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, this is the end of the road. LibreOffice will not run on those systems anymore, and there are no workarounds. The suite has slammed the door shut.
 
For years, LibreOffice kept older Windows users afloat while Microsoft and other developers moved on. That lifeline is gone. Anyone stubbornly clinging to Windows 7 or 8 now has two choices: upgrade or stay stuck on outdated software. LibreOffice has made it clear that it will not carry dead platforms any further. And the cuts do not stop there. 32-bit Windows builds are on their way out, with deprecation already in place. On the Mac side, 25.8 is the last release that runs on macOS 10.15. Starting with LibreOffice 26.2, only macOS 11 and newer will be supported. In other words, if your computer is too old to run modern systems, LibreOffice is walking away.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KDE Plasma 6.5 Introducing &quot;KISS&quot; - An Initial System Setup Wizard</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/KDE-KISS-Initial-Setup-Wizard</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 09:33:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[KDE developer Nate Graham is out with his customary weekend blog post to summarize all the interesting Plasma desktop developments for the week.

The catch? These minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, gallium and rare earth elements like neodymium and yttrium, are currently being discarded as tailings of other mineral streams like gold and zinc, said Elizabeth Holley, associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines and lead author of the new paper.
 
To conduct the analysis, Holley and her team built a database of annual production from federally permitted metal mines in the U.S. They used a statistical resampling technique to pair these data with the geochemical concentrations of critical minerals in ores, recently compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, Geoscience Australia and the Geologic Survey of Canada. Using this approach, Holley's team was able to estimate the quantities of critical minerals being mined and processed every year at U.S. metal mines but not being recovered. Instead, these valuable minerals are ending up as discarded tailings that must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental contamination.
 
The analysis looks at a total of 70 elements used in applications ranging from consumer electronics like cell phones to medical devices to satellites to renewable energy to fighter jets and shows that unrecovered byproducts from other U.S. mines could meet the demand for all but two -- platinum and palladium. Among the elements included in the analysis are:
- Cobalt (Co): The lustrous bluish-gray metal, a key component in electric car batteries, is a byproduct of nickel and copper mining. Recovering less than 10% of the cobalt currently being mined and processed but not recovered would be more than enough to fuel the entire U.S. battery market.
- Germanium (Ge): The brittle silvery-white semi-metal used for electronics and infrared optics, including sensors on missiles and defense satellites, is present in zinc and molybdenum mines. If the U.S. recovered less than 1% of the germanium currently mined and processed but not recovered from U.S. mines, it would not have to import any germanium to meet industry needs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: How SocialFi Crowdfunding is Replacing VCs in Crypto: Interview with SeedList Co-Founder (8/23/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/8-23-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:11:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @oxylabs [ 7 Min read ]

Each prompt now consumes about 0.24 watt-hours -- the equivalent of watching nine seconds of TV. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from an Ars Technica article: "We estimate the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters (or about five drops) of water," they conclude. To put that in context, they estimate that the energy use is similar to about nine seconds of TV viewing. The bad news is that the volume of requests is undoubtedly very high. The company has chosen to execute an AI operation with every single search request, a compute demand that simply didn't exist a couple of years ago. So, while the individual impact is small, the cumulative cost is likely to be considerable.
 
The good news? Just a year ago, it would have been far, far worse. Some of this is just down to circumstances. With the boom in solar power in the US and elsewhere, it has gotten easier for Google to arrange for renewable power. As a result, the carbon emissions per unit of energy consumed saw a 1.4x reduction over the past year. But the biggest wins have been on the software side, where different approaches have led to a 33x reduction in energy consumed per prompt.
 
The Google team describes a number of optimizations the company has made that contribute to this. One is an approach termed Mixture-of-Experts, which involves figuring out how to only activate the portion of an AI model needed to handle specific requests, which can drop computational needs by a factor of 10 to 100. They've developed a number of compact versions of their main model, which also reduce the computational load. Data center management also plays a role, as the company can make sure that any active hardware is fully utilized, while allowing the rest to stay in a low-power state.
 
The other thing is that Google designs its own custom AI accelerators, and it architects the software that runs on them, allowing it to optimize both sides of the hardware/software divide to operate well with each other. That's especially critical given that activity on the AI accelerators accounts for over half of the total energy use of a query. Google also has lots of experience running efficient data centers that carries over to the experience with AI. The result of all this is that it estimates that the energy consumption of a typical text query has gone down by 33x in the last year alone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OK Superintendent Plans To Give Transplant Teachers From NY, CA Woke Tests Developed By Prager U</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/22/ok-superintendent-plans-to-give-transplant-teachers-from-ny-ca-woke-tests-developed-by-prager-u/</link><author>Timothy Geigner</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 02:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When the Techdirt community has had to hear so much about a single state’s education superintendent, you know something has gone horribly wrong. The horribly wrong in this case is Ryan Walters of Oklahoma. Walters appears to be doing some sort of combo-impression of Joseph McCarthy mixed with Donald Trump. In his role running Oklahoma schools, which rank near the bottom of states in the country, he seems far more interested in inserting Christianity anywhere he can into public schools, teaching children his favorite pet election conspiracy theories, and presiding over board meetings where tame but very strange erotic videos sometimes appear on screens.Much of this runs afoul of the Constitution and the First Amendment, of course. And I very much wonder if the same might be true of Walters’ latest plan, which is to give transplants from certain states who want to become teachers in Oklahoma a “woke test” that will determine if they get a teaching license.Teachers from “liberal” states who have relocated to Oklahoma and are seeking to work there must take a controversial new assessment, to be given for the first time today, that “keeps away woke indoctrinators,” according to Oklahoma’s top education official.Ryan Walters, Oklahoma’s superintendent for public instruction, told CNN that if applicants do not pass the test, they will not earn a teaching certificate to be able to teach in public schools in the state this school year, which begins for some Oklahoma districts on Monday. The superintendent’s office notified CNN on Friday that it had not yet been released as of noon, but that it was coming soon.Now, I’m no constitutional law professor, but this sure sounds like the state government would be setting different requirements for different citizens purely based on the place in America from which they are emigrating. Section 1 of the 14th Amendment reads:All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.I, and others, can certainly argue that these selective tests run afoul of that text. And I imagine someone will try to make that argument or another one, such as First Amendment violations, because this entire plan is buckets of stupid. At the very least, this well-publicized plan to root out the nefarious Marxist teachers from “liberal” states, whatever the fuck that means, apparently hinges on the idea that those same nefarious Marxist teachers won’t simply lie on the test.A test that was created by Prager U of all organizations, mind you. Not the government. Not some scholastic body. Just a fake educational organization that pushes evangelical right-wing propaganda to anyone that will listen. Prager U has its own tortured history of trying to violate the First Amendment on top of its other nonsense.What’s in the test? Simple civics stuff, for starters, with just a sprinkle of bigotry on top.One proposed question deals with gender – asking teachers to select from a series of multiple-choice answers which chromosome pairs determine biological sex. Marissa Streit, CEO of PragerU, told CNN there are several questions on the test related to “undoing the damage of gender ideology that is forced and taught through some of these other tests like the PRISM test,” referring to a training for teachers in California that aims to “provide resources to bolster support for LGBTQ+ youth in California.”Another question asks why freedom of religion is important to America’s identity. Other questions include asking for the first three words of the Constitution, naming the two chambers of the US Congress, and identifying the number of US Senators. Streit said the Oklahoma superintendent had asked for a test “that is more wholesome and in line with the Oklahoma parent body.”Expect lawsuits. Probably several of them. And if the Oklahoma courts are just, this facade of patriotism will be nixed out of existence.But that it is even being tried is a sign of trouble for the Union.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Final Verdict on Pair vs. Solo Programming: A Summary</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-final-verdict-on-pair-vs-solo-programming-a-summary?source=rss</link><author>Pair Programming AI Agent</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 02:04:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[7. Conclusions and Further WorkThis paper presented a controlled experiment that was run as part of a university course in DOE. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate pair versus solo programming with respect to duration and effort. Subjects who jointly wrote the program assignments took less time (28%) than subjects who worked individually. Conversely subjects grouped in pairs spent more effort (30%) than those who worked individually. These results are very close to those reported in [24].\
With the aiming of striving towards better research practices in SE [18] we reported all the collected measures. This data will help other researchers to verify or re-analyze [14] the experiment results presented in this work. This data can also be used to accumulate and consolidate a body of knowledge about pair programing.\
We are planning to conduct future replications of this experiment to get more insight about the effect of pair programming. Although we did not observe interactions between treatment and blocks, we plan to use another experimental design to assess possible interactions.[1] E. Arisholm, H. Gallis, T. Dybå, and D. I.

TechCrunch reports: In a blog post published on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn't have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law's broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi's HB 1126 requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justices decided to block an emergency appeal that would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance.
 
Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification of all users. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user's age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too -- up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create "significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies." To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it's expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features.
 
Mississippi's law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. The company notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Internet Is About to Improve for All of Us</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-internet-is-about-to-improve-for-all-of-us?source=rss</link><author>Den Odell</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 23:59:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Accessibility Act will require digital products provided in the EU to meet actual, enforceable accessibility standards.

The $800 device, codenamed Hypernova, will be able to show simple visual content like texts and support AI assistant interactions. CNBC reports: Connect is a two-day conference for developers focused on virtual reality, AR and the metaverse. It was originally called Oculus Connect and obtained its current moniker after Facebook changed its parent company name to Meta in 2021. The glasses are internally codenamed Hypernova and will include a small digital display in the right lens of the device, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. The device is expected to cost about $800 and will be sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, the people said. CNBC reported in October that Meta was working with Luxottica on consumer glasses with a display. [...]
 
With Hypernova, Meta will finally be offering glasses with a display to consumers, but the company is setting low expectations for sales, some of the sources said. That's because the device requires more components than its voice-only predecessors, and will be slightly heavier and thicker, the people said. [...] Although Hypernova will feature a display, those visual features are expected to be limited, people familiar with the matter said. They said the color display will offer about a 20 degree field of view -- meaning it will appear in a small window in a fixed position -- and will be used primarily to relay simple bits of information, such as incoming text messages.
 
The Hypernova glasses will also come paired with a wristband that will use technology built by Meta's CTRL Labs, said people familiar with the matter. CTRL Labs, which Meta acquired in 2019, specializes in building neural technology that could allow users to control computing devices using gestures in their arms. [...] In addition to Hypernova and the wristband, Meta will also announce a third-generation of its voice-only smart glasses with Luxottica at Connect, one person said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Reportedly Cuts China&apos;s Early Access to Bug Disclosures, PoC Exploit Code</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/2059255/microsoft-reportedly-cuts-chinas-early-access-to-bug-disclosures-poc-exploit-code?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register: Microsoft has reportedly stopped giving Chinese companies proof-of-concept exploit code for soon-to-be-disclosed vulnerabilities following last month's SharePoint zero-day attacks, which appear to be related to a leak in Redmond's early-bug-notification program. The software behemoth gives some software vendors early bug disclosures under its Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), which typically delivers info two weeks before Patch Tuesday. MAPP participants sign a non-disclosure agreement, and in exchange get vulnerability details so that they can provide updated protections to customers more quickly.
 
According to Microsoft spokesperson David Cuddy, who spoke with Bloomberg about changes to the program, MAPP has begun limiting access to companies in "countries where they're required to report vulnerabilities to their governments," including China. Companies in these countries will no longer receive "proof of concept" exploit code, but instead will see "a more general written description" that Microsoft sends at the same time as patches, Cuddy told the news outlet. "A leak happened here somewhere," Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), told The Register in July. "And now you've got a zero-day exploit in the wild, and worse than that, you've got a zero-day exploit in the wild that bypasses the patch, which came out the next day."
 
Childs said the MAPP change "is a positive change, if a bit late. Anything Microsoft can do to help prevent leaks while still offering MAPP guidance is welcome."
 
"In the past, MAPP leaks were associated with companies out of China, so restricting information from flowing to these companies should help," Childs said. "The MAPP program remains a valuable resource for network defenders. Hopefully, Microsoft can squelch the leaks while sending out the needed information to companies that have proven their ability (and desire) to protect end users."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>16 Failure Modes of RAG and LLM Agents and How to Fix Them With a Semantic Firewall</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/16-failure-modes-of-rag-and-llm-agents-and-how-to-fix-them-with-a-semantic-firewall?source=rss</link><author>PSBigBig</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:48:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Why a Problem Map at all?You run a RAG pipeline.

Model answer: It says the company launched a revolutionary product in 2023.\
This is semantic drift. It is a silent failure. No stack trace, no exception, only a confident story that never happened. Teams lose days here. The Problem Map exists so you can name the bug, reproduce it on one screen, then apply a minimal fix.Problem Map is a field guide for AI systems. It catalogs sixteen common failure modes across RAG, LLM agents, vector stores, OCR to PDF flows, routing, deployment, and multi-agent stacks. Each entry comes with symptoms, a minimal repro, a working fix, and a pointer to documentation.\

 - Symptoms: Refusal to attempt or collapse to cliches. Repro: Ask to blend three distant concepts. Fix: Head diversity and path sampling\
No. 11 Semantic Drift in Routing - Symptoms: Two similar deep links handled differently. Repro: Router treats one as special intent and the other as plain path. Fix: Route normalizer, intent guard.\
 - Symptoms: Units drift, math rules mix, totals off by small margins. Repro: Unit change mid-chain with a hidden default. Fix: Cross-path guard and unit normalizer.\
 - Symptoms: Agents overwrite each other, deadlocks, loops. Repro: Two agents write to the same state for the same goal. Fix: Position lock with global constraint aggregator.\
No. 14 Bootstrap Ordering - Symptoms: System looks fine, yet later steps fail without a clear cause. Repro: Retriever called before index build, tool before secret. Fix: Safety boundary checklist. \
No. 15 Deployment Deadlock - Symptoms: Works in private path, freezes on public path under load. Repro: Public route triggers an async that waits for a private resource. Fix: Watchdog, explicit timeouts, safe fallback. \
No. 16 Pre-deploy Collapse - Symptoms: Empty vector store, missing secret, early trigger. Repro: Call the action before setup completes. Fix: Preflight sanity checks with red flag blocks.

Remove anything optional.Apply the minimal fix. Start with the named module. Add only what you need.\
This flow prevents endless tuning that never touches the real failure.Under the hood in plain language.WFGY provides a compact set of operators that behave like a reasoning layer.BBMC - bigbig semantic residue. Reduce residue to align intent and generated tokens.BBPF - multi-path progression. Explore, but keep a stability bound.BBCR - collapse, then bridge, then rebirth. Safe reset when a chain stalls.BBAM - attention modulation. Damp one token hijacks and reduces loops.Five gates for stability WRI. Where am I: position lock WAI, who am I: head diversity WAY, who are you: entropy pump WDT, where did you take me: cross path guard WTF, what happened: collapse detect and reset.\
These ideas grew from rescuing real engineers on GitHub issues and discussions. The modules are model agnostic. You attach a small file from the core folder, and the layer runs in the chat. It supports GPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok. It is open source under MIT.Deep dives that rank well on search and actually help.RAG retrieval quality and FAISS pitfalls. Problem: Nearest neighbor search returns look close, yet semantics are wrong. Root surface similarity dominates, and temporal logic is missing. Fix: Query rewrite, e resonance bands, store metrics, guardrails around time entities. Doc vector store metrics and pitfalls page above.\
Prompt injection that slips through role prompts. Problem: A hidden line inside a chunk disables your policy. Fix: Modular injection rules with an allow list and a block list, plus a bridge that isolates content from instruction. Doc prompt injection page above.\
 Problem: Two planners claim the same task and write to the same state. Fix: WRI to lock positions for roles, a global constraint aggregator, and explicit ownership of state segments.\
Deployment deadlock under public traffic. Problem: Private path runs fine, yet the public path freezes. Cause the background trigger waits on a private resource, sometimes logging success. Fix: Watchdog, explicit timeouts, safe fallback, and preflight checklist in No. 15 and No. 16.Frequently Asked QuestionsIs this just a clever prompt? No. It is a compact spec you attach as a file. The model runs it as a contract. You will see a visible bridge and recovery step when the chain stalls.\
Does it require fine-tuning? No. Zero training and no infrastructure edits.\
Will this conflict with my agent tools? No. Treat it as an overlay. Your tools stay. The semantic firewall reduces drift and makes failures auditable.\
What about licensing and credibility? MIT license. The project gained strong traction from real-world debugging. The creator of Tesseract.js starred the repo.

From examining outdated regulatory metaphors to questioning copyright norms and highlighting the risks of stifling innovation, each post addresses a different piece of the AI puzzle. Together, they advocate for a more balanced, forward-thinking approach that acknowledges the potential of technological evolution while safeguarding the rights of creators and ensuring AI’s development serves the broader interests of society. You can read the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth posts in the series.As the conversation about AI’s impact on creative industries continues, there’s a common misconception that AI models are “stealing” content by absorbing it for free. But if we take a closer look at how AI training works, it becomes clear that this isn’t the case at all. AI models don’t simply replicate or repackage creative works—they break them down into something much more abstract: . These tokens are tiny, fragmented pieces of data that no longer represent the creative expression of an idea. And here’s where the distinction lies: copyright is meant to protect , not individual words, phrases, or patterns that make up those works.The Lego Analogy: Breaking Down Creative Works into TokensImagine you’re a creator, and your work is like a detailed Lego model of the Star Wars Millennium Falcon. It’s intricate, with every piece perfectly assembled to create something unique and valuable. Now imagine that an AI system comes along—not to take your Millennium Falcon and display it as its own creation, but to break it down into individual Lego blocks. These blocks are then scattered among millions of others from different sources, and the AI uses them to build entirely new structures—things that look nothing like the Millennium Falcon.In this analogy, the  are the  that AI models use. These tokens are fragments of data—tiny bits of information stripped of the original context and creative expression. Just like Lego pieces, tokens are abstract and can be recombined in an infinite number of ways to create something entirely new. The AI doesn’t  your Falcon; it takes the building blocks (tokens) and uses them to create something that’s not a replica of the original but something completely different, like a castle or a spaceship you’ve never seen before.This is the key distinction: AI models aren’t absorbing entire creative works and reproducing them as their own. They’re learning patterns from vast datasets and using those patterns to generate new content. The tokens no longer reflect the expression of the original work, and thus, they don’t infringe on the creative essence that copyright law is designed to protect.Why Recent Content Matters: AI Needs to Reflect Modern Language and ValuesThere’s another critical point that often gets overlooked: AI models need access to recent, contemporary content to be useful, relevant, and ethical. Let’s imagine for a moment what would happen if AI models were restricted to learning only from public domain works, many of which are decades or even centuries old.While public domain works are valuable, they often reflect the social norms and biases of their time. If AI models are trained primarily on , there’s a serious risk that they could “speak” in a way that’s misogynistic, biased, anti-LGBTQ+, or even outright racist. Many public domain works contain language and ideas that are no longer acceptable in today’s society, and if AI is limited to these sources, it may inadvertently propagate harmful, antiquated views.To ensure that AI reflects current values, inclusive language, and modern social norms, it needs access to recent content. This means analyzing and learning from today’s books, articles, speeches, and other forms of communication. If creators and copyright holders opt out of allowing their content to be used for AI training, we risk creating models that don’t reflect the diversity, progress, and inclusivity of modern society.For example, language evolves quickly—just look at the increased use of  or terms like  in recent years. If AI is cut off from these contemporary linguistic trends, it will struggle to understand and engage with the world as it is today. It would be like asking an AI trained exclusively on Shakespearean English to have a conversation with a 21st-century teenager—it simply wouldn’t work.Article 4 of the EU Directive: Opting Out of Text and Data MiningLet’s bring the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (DSM) into the picture. The Directive includes provisions (Article 4) allowing copyright holders to opt out of having their content used in  (TDM). TDM is crucial for training AI models, as it allows them to analyze and learn from large datasets. The opt-out mechanism gives creators and copyright holders the ability to expressly reserve their works from being used for TDM.However, it’s important to remember that this opt-out applies to , not just generative AI systems like ChatGPT. This means that by opting out in a broad, blanket manner, creators could inadvertently limit the potential of AI models that have nothing to do with creative industries—tools that are critical for advancements in healthcare, education, and even in day-to-day conveniences that many of us benefit from.The Risk of a Data Winter: Why Broad Opt-Outs Could Harm InnovationWhat happens if creators and copyright holders across Europe start opting out of TDM on a large scale? The answer is something AI researchers dread: a . Without access to a diverse and rich array of data, AI models will struggle to evolve. This could slow innovation not just in the creative industries, but across the entire economy.AI needs high-quality data to function properly. The principle of  applies here: if AI models are starved of diverse input, their output will be flawed, biased, and of lower quality. And while this may not seem like an issue for some industries, it has a ripple effect. Every AI tool we rely on—from  to medical research applications—depends on robust training data. Restricting access to this data doesn’t just hinder progress in AI innovation; it stifles  that have far-reaching benefits for society.Think about it: many creators themselves probably use AI-driven tools in their daily lives—whether it’s for streamlining workflows, generating new ideas, or even just organizing information. By opting out of TDM, they could inadvertently be damaging the very tools that enhance their own creative processes.The Way Forward: Balance Between Protection and InnovationWhile copyright is crucial for protecting creators and ensuring fair compensation, it’s equally important not to over-regulate in a way that stifles innovation. AI models aren’t absorbing entire works for free; they’re breaking them down into unrecognizable tokens that enable transformative uses. Rather than opting out of TDM as a knee-jerk reaction, creators should consider the long-term consequences of limiting AI’s potential to innovate and enhance their own industries.A balance needs to be struck. Copyright protection should ensure that creators are fairly compensated, but it shouldn’t be wielded as a tool to restrict the very data that drives AI innovation. Creators and policymakers must recognize that AI isn’t the enemy—. And if we’re not careful, we might find ourselves facing a , where the tools we rely on for both convenience and advancement are weakened due to short-sighted decisions.Caroline De Cock is a communications and policy expert, author, and entrepreneur.

From a report: The CO2 output of the nation's power sector -- its dominant source of emissions -- fell by 3% in the first half of the year, as growth in solar power alone matched the rise in electricity demand. The new analysis for Carbon Brief shows that record solar capacity additions are putting China's CO2 emissions on track to fall across 2025 as a whole. 

Other key findings include: 

The growth in clean power generation, some 270 terawatt hours (TWh) excluding hydro, significantly outpaced demand growth of 170TWh in the first half of the year.
Solar capacity additions set new records due to a rush before a June policy change, with 212 gigawatts (GW) added in the first half of the year.
This rush means solar is likely to set an annual record for growth in 2025, becoming China's single-largest source of clean power generation in the process.
Coal-power capacity could surge by as much as 80-100GW this year, potentially setting a new annual record, even as coal-fired electricity generation declines.
The use of coal to make synthetic fuels and chemicals is growing rapidly, climbing 20% in the first half of the year and helping add 3% to China's CO2 since 2020.
The coal-chemical industry is planning further expansion, which could add another 2% to China's CO2 by 2029, making the 2030 deadline for peaking harder to meet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I can&apos;t even with these company names...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UBnfA9s3OuE</link><author>Jeff Geerling</author><category>tech</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UBnfA9s3OuE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 21:25:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg">Jeff Goerling yt channel</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Seriously...

According to Preston Byrne, managing partner of law firm Byrne & Storm, Ofcom has provisionally decided to impose a 20,000-pound fine "with daily penalties thereafter" for as long as the site fails to comply with its request. "Ofcom's notices create no legal obligations in the United States," he told the BBC, adding he believed the regulator's investigation was part of an "illegal campaign of harassment" against US tech firms.
 
"4chan has broken no laws in the United States -- my client will not pay any penalty," Mr Byrne said. Ofcom began investigating 4chan over whether it was complying with its obligations under the UK's Online Safety Act. Then in August, it said it had issued 4chan with "a provisional notice of contravention" for failing to comply with two requests for information. Ofcom said its investigation would examine whether the message board was complying with the act, including requirements to protect its users from illegal content. "American businesses do not surrender their First Amendment rights because a foreign bureaucrat sends them an email," law firms Byrne & Storm and Coleman Law wrote. "Under settled principles of US law, American courts will not enforce foreign penal fines or censorship codes. If necessary, we will seek appropriate relief in US federal court to confirm these principles."
 
The statement calls on the Trump administration to intervene and protect American businesses from "extraterritorial censorship mandates."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bluesky blocks service in Mississippi over age assurance law</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/bluesky-blocks-service-in-mississippi-over-age-assurance-law/</link><author>Sarah Perez</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:30:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a blog post published on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn't have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law's broad scope and privacy implications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Investigators Used Terrible Computer Fraud Laws To Ensure People Were Punished For Leaking Air Crash Footage To CNN</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/22/investigators-used-terrible-computer-fraud-laws-to-ensure-people-were-punished-for-leaking-air-crash-footage-to-cnn/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:30:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this year, an Army helicopter collided with a passenger plane over the Potomac River in Washington, DC. All sixty-seven people aboard both vehicles were killed. While the FAA focused its investigation on the failures that led to this mid-air collision, local investigators in Virginia were somehow far more concerned about identifying who had leaked footage of the collision to CNN. The subject matter of the leaked recordings was obviously of public interest. And while the government may have its own interest in controlling dissemination of recording of incidents that involve federal agencies and their oversight, it’s not the sort of government interest most courts consider to be worthy of violating the First Amendment.Fortunately, the government has options. For a very long time, the option federal law enforcement deployed most frequently in cases involving pretty much any sort of technology was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). This broadly written law not only allowed prosecutors to charge people with federal crimes for doing nothing more than interacting with services/servers/etc. in unexpected ways, but allowed companies to, essentially, shoot the messengers for reporting data breaches, unsecured servers, or sloppy user interfaces that could be exploited to display far more information than those running them intended.Here’s what Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority investigator Patrick Silsbee wrote in his report:“The video shows camera angles and views that can only be found on the Metropolitan Washington Airport’s Authority CCTV video,” Silsbee wrote in a January 31 report, noting the location of landmarks in the videos, including a boathouse near the airfield.The locations of the MWAA security cameras are redacted in the reports provided to The Intercept, ostensibly “to prevent the disclosure of law enforcement and security techniques and procedures not generally known outside the law enforcement community,” according to an accompanying letter from MWAA.That doesn’t mean much by itself, but Silsbee apparently figured out (thanks in part to CNN’s initial failure to redact some CCTV text that described the location of the camera) this footage must have been obtained by an MWAA employee working at the police dispatch center. CCTV footage from  the dispatch center was obtained, which allegedly showed these actions being taken by the suspected leaker:“Between the hours of 2256 and 0545, Mr. Mbengue can be seen on multiple occasions utilize [sic] his personal cell phone to record video and photograph these critical scenes,” Silsbee wrote.That would be MWAA dispatch employee Mohamed Mbengue, who has since pleaded “no contest” to charges stemming from Virginia’s ultra-vague “computer trespass” law. But it really takes a person with an overriding desire to shoot messengers to call cell phone recordings of screen images a “trespass.” The word is generally understood to describe unauthorized access to an area a person is not allowed to be in. Mbengue was at work and had full access to these recordings as a part of his job. That he recorded them and sent them to CNN doesn’t align with any rational definition of the word “trespass.” The dissemination of footage may be a violation of policy, but policy violations aren’t criminal charges — the sort of thing that can do permanent damage to a person’s life in ways that write-ups and even justified terminations simply can’t.That’s why discretion is key. But when discretion matters most, law enforcement tends to deliberately “err” on the side of whatever does the most damage to anyone it happens to be investigating. And it appears MWAA investigators are more than happy to throw criminal charges at people for, at most, violating agency policies. A second dispatcher (Jonathan Savoy) was caught doing the same thing (albeit without sharing the recordings with CNN) and faced similar charges until someone actually exercised a bit of discretion and declined to move forward with the case.On February 3, the MWAA announced both men’s arrests, writing in a press statement that Savoy had been arrested “following further police investigation.”In May, however, local prosecutors quietly dropped the charges against Savoy, through a filing called a “nolle prosequi,” according to the court docket.There’s absolutely nothing in the statute that actually covers the actions described here, which formed the basis for the bullshit criminal charges. It takes a ton of punitive imagination to turn “recording a CCTV monitor with a phone” into a criminal act. The only clause that could be even possibly be considered applicable requires investigators and prosecutors to engage in lot of extremely creative re-interpretations of the plain text of the law: Use a computer or computer network to make or cause to be made an unauthorized copy, in any form, including, but not limited to, any printed or electronic form of computer data, computer programs or computer software residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer networkA smartphone is a computer. A recording could be considered an “unauthorized copy.” To call the CCTV cameras and screens “computers/computer network” means ignoring the generally understood utility of this tech. Even if a network connects the cameras and a computer provides access to recordings, recording playback via phone while accessing footage the suspects had every right to access, calling this a violation of the law demonstrates investigators were out for revenge, rather than serving the commonly understood definition of the word “justice.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenZFS 2.4-rc1 Brings Linux 6.16 Compatibility, Better Encryption Performance With AVX2</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/OpenZFS_2.4-rc1-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:26:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The first release candidate of OpenZFS 2.4 is now available for testing of this ZFS file-system implementation for Linux and FreeBSD systems...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Workers Need Better Protections From the Heat</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/2020223/workers-need-better-protections-from-the-heat?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shares a report: Expect record-breaking temperatures to change the workplace, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned today in a new report.

The project aims to make it easy to create tokens, check analytics, and give communities better visibility: all without needing complex coding or bridges.According to the team, right now, the world of crypto can feel confusing and scattered - people often have to jump between many different apps and tools just to trade, track information, and stay safe. ESCAPE's goal is to make things simple by creating one all-in-one platform where everything you need is in one place.The project's development strategy emerged from practical market experience, having initially deployed on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution where the team observed strong community demand for simplified, integrated tools. The original implementation achieved a market capitalization of 11.5 million dollars within two days, demonstrating significant market appetite for consolidated crypto trading infrastructure. Following the discontinuation of the initial Layer 2 platform, the team transitioned to Ethereum Layer 1 to ensure long-term sustainability and independence.ESCAPE emphasizes transparency and accountability. The platform has successfully completed an audit by Hacken that also has audited known companies like Binance, verification by Coinsult, and a KYC review conducted by SolidProof ensures the team is Doxxed. The development process is tracked via an open community board.During and after the presale, ESCAPE also offers a staking program with a sustainable 15% APY, giving early supporters a way to earn rewards. This rate was chosen carefully to ensure long-term growth and ecosystem stability.A collaboration with PAW Chain will extend ESCAPE’s reach by enabling multichain deployment. This integration will allow token creators to launch identical contract addresses across more than 15 major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche - removing the need for bridges or wrapped tokens.Utilities and DeliverablesThe ESCAPE ecosystem, powered by the $ESCAPE token, is being rebuilt and expanded to include:EscapePad: a no-code token launchpad for Ethereum and future networksDEX Viewer: real-time charts, wallet activity, and volume analyticsWallet Inspector: cross-chain portfolio and transaction analysisTelegram Bots: customizable alerts for trades and holder milestonesMobile App: token deployment and monitoring on iOS and AndroidToken Visibility Tools: ecosystem-native placement features for projects“ESCAPE is being built to simplify Web3 and restore trust through transparency,” said an ESCAPE spokesperson. “The Ethereum relaunch and future multichain expansion represent more than a rebuild - they represent a stronger foundation for creators and communities to launch and grow without limitations.” is a Web3 infrastructure platform focused on token creation, analytics, and visibility across multiple blockchains. Initially launched on a Layer 2 network in early 2025, ESCAPE grew to over 800 holders and an $11.5 million market cap before migrating to Ethereum. Today, ESCAPE operates with a transparent roadmap, audited smart contracts, and a community-first approach.:::tip

It also targets measures designed to mitigate the generation of racial and gender biased content and even hate speech. The reproduction of this bias is a pernicious problem that AI developers have struggled to solve for over a decade.A new executive order called “Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government,” released alongside the AI Action Plan, seeks to strong-arm AI companies into modifying their models to conform with the Trump Administration’s ideological agenda.The executive order requires AI companies that receive federal contracts to prove that their LLMs are free from purported “ideological biases” like “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” This heavy-handed censorship will not make models more accurate or “trustworthy,” as the Trump Administration claims, but is a blatant attempt to censor the development of LLMs and restrict them as a tool of expression and information access. While the First Amendment permits the government to choose to purchase only services that reflect government viewpoints, the government may not use that power to influence what services and information are available to the public. Lucrative government contracts can push commercial companies to implement features (or biases) that they wouldn’t otherwise, and those often roll down to the user. Doing so would impact the 60 percent of Americans who get information from LLMs, and it would force developers to roll back efforts to reduce biases—making the models much less accurate, and far more likely to cause harm, especially in the hands of the government. Less Accuracy, More Bias and DiscriminationIt’s no secret that AI models—including gen AI—tend to discriminate against racial and gender minorities. AI models use machine learning to identify and reproduce patterns in data that they are “trained” on. If the training data reflects biases against racial, ethnic, and gender minorities—which it often does—then the AI model will “learn” to discriminate against those groups. In other words, garbage in, garbage out. Models also often reflect the biases of the people who train, test, and evaluate them. This is true across different types of AI. For example, “predictive policing” tools trained on arrest data that reflects overpolicing of black neighborhoods frequently recommend heightened levels of policing in those neighborhoods, often based on inaccurate predictions that crime will occur there. Generative AI models are also implicated. LLMs already recommend more criminal convictions, harsher sentences, and less prestigious jobs for people of color. Despite that people of color account for less than half of the U.S. prison population, 80 percent of Stable Diffusion’s AI-generated images of inmates have darker skin. Over 90 percent of AI-generated images of judges were men; in real life, 34 percent of judges are women. These models aren’t just biased—they’re fundamentally incorrect. Race and gender aren’t objective criteria for deciding who gets hired or convicted of a crime. Those discriminatory decisions reflected trends in the training data that could be caused by bias or chance—not some “objective” reality. Setting fairness aside, biased models are just worse models: they make more mistakes, more often. Efforts to reduce bias-induced errors will ultimately make models more accurate, not less. Biased LLMs Cause Serious Harm—Especially in the Hands of the GovernmentBut inaccuracy is far from the only problem. When government agencies start using biased AI to make decisions, real people suffer. Government officials routinely make decisions that impact people’s personal freedom and access to financial resources, healthcare, housing, and more. The White House’s AI Action Plan calls for a massive increase in agencies’ use of LLMs and other AI—while all but requiring the use of biased models that automate systemic, historical injustice. Using AI simply to entrench the way things have always been done squanders the promise of this new technology.We need strong safeguards to prevent government agencies from procuring biased, harmful AI tools. In a series of executiveorders, as well as his AI Action Plan, the Trump Administration has rolled back the already-feeble Biden-era AI safeguards. This makes AI-enabled civil rights abuses far more likely, putting everyone’s rights at risk. And the Administration could easily exploit the new rules to pressure companies to make publicly available models worse, too. Corporations like healthcare companies and landlords increasingly use AI to make high-impact decisions about people, so more biased commercial models would also cause harm. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Has Agreed To a Deal For US To Take 10% Equity Stake, Trump Says</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/1849210/intel-has-agreed-to-a-deal-for-us-to-take-10-equity-stake-trump-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump said on Friday the U.S. would take a 10% stake in Intel under a deal with the struggling chipmaker and is planning more such moves, the latest extraordinary intervention by the White House in corporate America.

You know how the system works: lower courts make decisions based on law and precedent, parties can appeal, and eventually the highest court issues careful, reasoned opinions that other courts can follow. It’s not a perfect system, but it’s a system.The less nice thing is when the Supreme Court decides that systems are for suckers.We had warned how John Roberts was guaranteeing that the Court would be kept busy all summer with these shadow docket rulings, and that is exactly what has happened. The pattern is straightforward: lower courts try to enforce existing law, the administration appeals on an emergency basis, and the Supreme Court says “okay, sure, let Trump do what he wants” with zero legal explanation. The only coherent principle seems to be “it’s okay if Trump does it.”This is, let’s be clear, not how judicial systems are supposed to work. But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has been calling this out with increasing directness. She’s not mincing words. She’s not worried about collegiality. And now she’s given us the perfect term for what’s happening. She’s added Calvinball to the SCOTUS lexicon:In a broader sense, however, today’s ruling is of a piece with this Court’s recent tendencies. “[R]ight when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law’s constraints,” the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible…..This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.Calvinball, of course, is the favored pastime of Calvin from Bill Watterson’s Calvin and Hobbes. And, yes, the point is that there are no rules.The somewhat prescient Oxford English Dictionary added it to the dictionary just a few months ago, apparently recognizing how widely it’s been used to describe courts these days. I’ve certainly been using it to describe various judicial adventures of late, so it’s satisfying to see Justice Jackson make it official.Jackson’s diagnosis cuts deeper than just this particular case. She’s identifying a systemic problem: a Court that has abandoned legal reasoning in favor of reaching predetermined outcomes, then wrapping those outcomes in enough procedural complexity that nobody can quite pin down what the rules actually are.It almost doesn’t matter what this case is about, because it’s the principle about how the Supreme Court is now creating massively consequential binding precedent without the basic fundamentals of a thorough judicial process with things like full briefing or oral arguments.But just for clarity: the case itself was about whether NIH could terminate nearly a billion dollars in grants. A district court judge had said (using actual reasoning and legal precedent) that NIH had to continue providing the money it had already promised and budgeted, noting that halting such payments violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” government actions. Straightforward stuff, really.Unlike some shadow docket rulings, there were at least  explanations given here, though nothing you’d call illuminating. Four useless paragraphs basically just say the lower court’s ruling is stayed. Then there are various concurrences and dissents (and partial concurrences and partial dissents) that make it clear nobody quite agrees on what they’re doing, though much of it involves arguing over how much precedent an  shadow docket ruling (with basically zero explanation) should have on later shadow docket decisions.Which maybe should have been a hint that this is a case that needs full briefing before making such consequential decisions about it.And the lineup underscores the point: Justice Barrett would  grant the stay; Chief Justice Roberts with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson would deny it entirely; Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh would grant it entirely. If you’re keeping score of this Calvinball game, that’s a three-way split on an “emergency” order, with Barrett’s split vote winning the day—exactly the kind of messy, disputed ruling that demands full briefing.It’s like watching people argue about the rules of a game while they’re making up the rules as they go along—and their only guiding principle is “well, we know who has to win.” Which, Jackson points out, is basically what’s happening. This creates what she calls a “jurisdictional maze” where plaintiffs can challenge government policies in one court but can’t get relief in the same court—effectively gutting the Administrative Procedure Act’s protections against arbitrary government action.Justice Jackson’s key contribution is highlighting just how lawless it all is. She calls out how she warned about how this would play out, and the fact that the majority on SCOTUS views these (again, unbriefed and mostly unexplained) rulings as binding across the country is terrifying:I viewed the Court’s intervention then—in an emergency stay posture, while racing against a fast-expiring temporary restraining order—as “equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate.”…As it turns out, the Court’s decision was an even bigger mistake than I realized. The Court’s reasoning in California was not only “at the least under-developed, and very possibly wrong,” id., at ___ (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1), but also evidently resolved more than the jurisdictional dispute over the particular education-related grants at issue in that case. Today’s decision reveals California’s considerable wingspan: That case’s ipse dixit now apparently governs all APA challenges to grant-funding determinations that the Government asks us to address in the context of an emergency stay application. A half paragraph of reasoning (issued without full briefing or any oral argument) thus suffices here to partially sustain the Government’s abrupt cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to support life-saving biomedical research.The theory behind the shadow docket is pretty simple. Sometimes you need emergency relief to maintain the status quo while the regular judicial process works: full briefing, oral arguments, careful deliberation, the whole thing. The emergency docket exists so that irreversible harm doesn’t happen while everyone’s figuring out the right answer.But what’s been happening is the opposite. Rather than preserving the status quo, the Court has been allowing—encouraging, really—irreversible changes to happen, without bothering to understand the issues or explain the reasoning.And now they’re saying that these brain fart decisions based on zero details or due process, should be deemed the supreme law of the land? Jackson is having none of it:lobs this grenade without evaluating Congress’s intent or the profound legal and practical consequencesof this ruling. Stated simply: With potentially life-saving scientific advancements on the line, the Court turns a nearly century-old statute aimed at remedying unreasoned agency decision-making into a gauntlet rather than a refuge. But we have no business erecting a novel jurisdictional barrier to judicial review— especially when it appears nowhere in the relevant statutes and makes little sense.This is not how judicial systems work, if you want them to remain judicial systems.The majority is pretty explicit in their view that these unbriefed, unargued, unexplained shadow docket orders should bind everyone. Gorsuch, in his concurrence, doesn’t hold back:… when this Court issues a decision, it constitutes a precedent that commands respect in lower courts…. regardless of a decision’s procedural posture, its “reasoning—its ratio decidendi”—carries precedential weight in “future cases.”This is the judicial equivalent of an angry father, challenged by a child regarding a rule, retorting with “because I say so, and I’m the man of the house.”It’s exactly how children (and aggrieved parties) lose respect for the rules.Look, it’s entirely possible that after full briefing and oral arguments, the Supreme Court would reach the same result. That would be annoying for other reasons, but at least there would have been due process and a chance for all relevant parties to be fully heard. That’s how it’s supposed to work. You do the analysis, you explain the reasoning, you create precedent that other courts can follow.What the Roberts Court has been doing is the opposite. John Roberts himself sided with the dissenters here, but he’s presided over a court that has decided outcomes matter more than process. The result is a system where “just give Trump what he wants” has become the only reliable principle.What was once a respected judicial system has become a comic strip punch line. At least Calvin had the excuse of being six years old.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: Academy of Educational Engineering</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/22/daily-deal-academy-of-educational-engineering-4/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:42:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Academy of Educational Engineering is a premier platform tailored for aspiring and professional geeks.

https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/pixel-art-people-character-set-600w-2541245749.jpg
Here’s a friendly, pixelated cartoon banner—wider than tall—that captures the playful, retro vibe you're looking for. It's laid out like a mosaic of quirky, chunky characters reminiscent of internet personas. While I can’t use content directly from yourfocusfriend.com due to copyright, this piece channels a general pixel-art aesthetic to fit your concept.

How to Adapt This into a “42 Real Internet People” Banner
Layout: Maintain a horizontal (landscape) orientation that’s visibly wider than tall—perfect as a banner or header.

Pixelated Characters: Include a grid or row of diverse, pixel-art-style "people"—they can be simplistic avatars characterized by blocky colors, quirky features, and a digital, 8‑bit feel.

Text Integration: Overlay or embed the phrase “42 Real Internet People” within the design. You could:

Place it in a pixel-font box along the bottom or top.

Scatter the letters subtly across characters (e.g., each avatar holds a letter, or the letters are part of a digital “sign” held by one).

Color Scheme: Use bright, contrasting colors—neon or pastel pixels work well—to stand out and capture that playful, gamified aesthetic like Your Focus Friend promotes.

Atmosphere: Mimic the warm, cozy, friendly look of the site by using soft backgrounds or gentle gradients behind the characters, perhaps reminiscent of the timer app’s interface.

If you’d like, I can help sketch out a more detailed layout plan or guide you to tools where you can build or refine this banner further—just let me know what you'd like next!

How branding, hype, and corporate clout shape the buzz (and backlash) around OpenAI’s new “open” models


On a recent Reddit thread, a user posed a pointed question: “If the GPT-OSS models were made by any other company than OpenAI, would anyone care about them?” The query struck a nerve across AI communities. OpenAI’s release of GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B—their first “open-weight” models—was met with a frenzy of posts and hot takes. But were we genuinely excited about the models’ merits, or simply starstruck by the OpenAI brand? It’s a distinctly 2025 tech debate: how much of the buzz boils down to branding and perception rather than breakthrough innovation?



In this piece, we’ll dig into the reactions from Reddit, Hacker News, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and tech forums to see how people are talking about GPT-OSS. The responses range from cynical (“it’s all hype”) to hopeful (“at least it gets more people into local AI”). The tone will be smart, a bit irreverent, and well-researched – channeling the vibes of a Casey Newton or Kara Swisher column on HackerNoon. Let’s unpack what everyone’s saying about OpenAI’s open-source moment and what it reveals about branding, perception, and corporate influence in AI.



Reddit Reacts: “Just Hype – or a Helpful Push?”
Over on /r/LocalLLaMA, the question of OpenAI’s influence lit up an intense discussion. Many redditors argued that GPT-OSS is riding on OpenAI’s name more than anything. The original poster, chunkypenguion1991, didn’t mince words about the new models’ quality:

“They are worse at coding than Qwen 32B, more hallucinations than Fyre Festival, and seem trained only to pass benchmarks. If any other company released this, it would be a shoulder shrug… If it wasn’t for the OpenAI name behind it, would it get this much hype?” — chunkypenguion1991reddit.com



The skepticism was echoed by others in the thread. User NinjaK3ys couldn’t understand the excitement, complaining “I don't understand why such hype for the OpenAI OSS models… Geezz.” and the OP dryly replied, “$$$ that’s why”reddit.comreddit.com. Another commenter saw a concerted publicity effort behind the scenes:

“OpenAI was milking the OSS for months, starting from the announcement in Spring. I wonder if they needed it for some kind of compliance with investors, government grants, etc.” — No-Refrigerator-1672reddit.com



In other words, some in the community suspect the hype is manufactured, a savvy PR move to satisfy stakeholders or redirect the open-source narrative. From this perspective, the GPT-OSS models themselves are fine – but not spectacular enough to warrant the hoopla, if not for the OpenAI logo on the tin. As one redditor put it bluntly when asked if we’d care about GPT-OSS from another source:

“No.” — rookan



Yet, not everyone on Reddit was cynical. A number of users defended the value of OpenAI’s involvement – if only because it shines a bigger spotlight on local AI development. LevianMcBirdo argued that OpenAI’s brand has dramatically expanded awareness of this tech:

“Of course it wouldn’t get the same hype if some company mostly unknown to the public released the same models… The public often only thinks of OpenAI when thinking about generative AI. I’m not sure 50% of adults could even name another company… So in that sense, OpenAI helped the scene a lot.” — LevianMcBirdo reddit.com



Others noted that an OpenAI release, even a mediocre one, can serve as a gateway drug for newcomers to local models. PicklesLLM shared a supportive take, viewing GPT-OSS as a Trojan horse for AI hobbyists:

“Honestly I kind of agree [it’s overhyped]. But the reason this is big is because it’s an LLM a lot more people are familiar with. This will encourage more people to actually get into the local model route… I feel the excitement isn’t so much about the LLM itself, but the expansion of people new to this hobby… They only trusted ChatGPT for the longest time, but now… they’re getting more open to it because I can download the 20B model on their own PCs.” — PicklesLLM reddit.comreddit.com



From this vantage point, OpenAI’s cachet is opening doors. Sure, GPT-OSS might not top every benchmark (some redditors pointed out it “doesn’t perform well on qualitative benchmarks and [is] not even comparable to Qwen-3 30B”reddit.com). But having the ChatGPT-maker endorse local models lends legitimacy that could grow the community. It’s a classic case of Big Tech hype trickling down to benefit the little guys. As ComprehensiveJury509 noted, people in the thread wanted to see OpenAI fail, but in truth the models are “very solid… for their weight classes” (only ~5B parameters active):

“Hype? I’d say there is a lot of negativity here that feels forced. People in this community really want it to bomb, so they focus on all the stuff that isn’t good… I dislike OpenAI with a passion myself, but I don’t think these are mediocre models. They are very solid models for their weight classes… yet people compare them to beefier models all the time.” — ComprehensiveJury509 reddit.comreddit.com



In short, the Reddit verdict was divided. The critics see brand-driven hype and a perhaps cynical ploy by OpenAI to placate calls for open-source (“it just seems like OpenAI released some crappy model so we would shut up about open source. But it’s crap,” the OP quippedreddit.com). The defenders see an opportunity: OpenAI’s hype machine, however off-putting, is at least bringing more mainstream attention to local AI and “democratizing” access in a way smaller players couldn’t. Reddit’s take crystallized the core debate: is GPT-OSS a breakthrough or just a branding exercise?



Hacker News Weighs In: Don’t Treat Companies Like “Sports Teams”
Over on Hacker News, discussions about GPT-OSS struck a slightly different tone – more technical, but with a healthy dose of skepticism about the hype. In a thread about OpenAI’s announcement, one user pointed out that nothing about GPT-OSS’s design was revolutionary; it’s mostly a clever layering of known techniques (Mixture-of-Experts, etc.) rather than new magic. But the more colorful commentary zeroed in on the fanboyism and branding aura. As one HN commenter littlestymaar admonished the community:“It would be great if people stopped acting as if those billion-dollar corporations were sports teams.” — littlestymaar news.ycombinator.com



That zinger speaks volumes. The poster was pushing back on reflexive tribalism – the tendency to cheer for OpenAI or Meta or whomever as if they can do no wrong. HN readers often pride themselves on cutting through marketing, and some did just that. User codelion, for instance, dryly noted that OpenAI’s “open” models were deliberately conservative in design: “It is by design. OpenAI is not going to reveal any architectural innovation they have made in their own commercial models.” — codelion news.ycombinator.com



In other words, if you expected GPT-OSS to be some secret-sauce GPT-4, you’d be mistaken – OpenAI played it safe, perhaps to avoid giving away any proprietary edge. This aligns with an analysis by AI blogger Sean Goedecke, who speculated that OpenAI trained GPT-OSS on heavily filtered (even synthetic) data to avoid the model misbehaving. Why? Because once an open-weight model is out in the wild, people can fine-tune or uncensor it in ways OpenAI can’t control. “Unlike Meta, [OpenAI doesn’t] need their open-source model to be actually good, because their main business is their closed-source models,” Goedecke wrote, arguing the release was more about optics and reclaiming narrative than technical supremacy seangoedecke.comseangoedecke.com.



That view—that OpenAI’s open-weight release was a strategic token, not a leap in AI—resonated on HN. Several users noted that truly, the excitement was tempered. “If this were any other company, there might have been a couple of posts and then quickly forgotten,” admitted DeltaSqueezer on HN, comparing GPT-OSS’s brief moment of fame to smaller-model launches that come and go reddit.com. 



The implication: OpenAI’s name boosted GPT-OSS onto front pages, but time will tell if the models have staying power once the novelty wears off. Good luck finding anyone discussing GPT-OSS six months from now if it doesn’t prove genuinely useful; the internet’s attention is fickle, brand or not.

At the same time, a few HN commenters saw a silver lining similar to Reddit’s optimists: OpenAI’s move validated open models. “This move validates the growing influence of the open-source ecosystem,” tech writer Ben Dickson noted, given it comes after a surge of open models from others bdtechtalks.combdtechtalks.com. 



OpenAI lending its prestige to Apache-licensed models could be read as a win for the open-source movement (or as OpenAI bowing to pressure from it). The Internet delved into the “what is ‘open’ really?” debate. A top HN comment debated whether releasing weights with an Apache license but an extra usage policy truly counts as open source. “Is it even valid to have additional restrictions on top of Apache 2.0?” asked user maxloh, pointing out the fine print in OpenAI’s GPT-OSS usage policy news.ycombinator.comnews.ycombinator.com. 



The consensus among the HN greybeards was that OpenAI’s offering is “open-weight” rather than fully open-source – a meaningful distinction for the purists. The training data and methodology remain a black box, so some transparency is gained, but not all. As one HackerNoon article would later put it, “Open weights mean you can download and run the model, but you cannot necessarily understand how it was trained… It only offers partial transparency.”hackernoon.com



In summary, Hacker News’ perspective added nuance: Yes, OpenAI’s brand turbocharged interest in GPT-OSS – but HN posters were quick to analyze the strategic motives behind that move. Don’t be a cheerleader, they warned; judge the tech on its merits and be aware of what’s not being open-sourced (pretty much everything except the weights).



The X Factor: Twitter Cheers and Jeers
On X (formerly Twitter), the reaction to GPT-OSS was predictably fast-paced and polarized. Some AI enthusiasts on X greeted the OpenAI open models with unbridled excitement – almost surprise. For example, Zeming Lin (@ebetica), an AI researcher, could barely contain his enthusiasm at what GPT-OSS achieved and who it came from:“gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!)” — Zeming Lin (ebetica) x.com



The “WTF!!” pretty much captures it – even a seasoned insider was amazed that an open-weight model from OpenAI could run on a single GPU and still match a pared-down GPT-4 variant on performance. This is the kind of hype that branding + genuine achievement can spark: OpenAI managed to surprise people who thought the company was forever wed to giant cloud-bound models. There was a sense of “I can’t believe OpenAI did this, but wow, it’s cool.” On the flip side, other Twitter users took OpenAI to task for the contrast between hype and reality. Tech commentator Ben Olney noted that the flagship GPT-5 model (released almost simultaneously) was falling short in his experience, even as OpenAI’s marketing was in overdrive: “GPT-5 is hallucinating more often than not for me… It’s a bit of a concern given the hype OpenAI have given it. I’m actually getting better results from GPT-OSS.” — Ben Olney (@Olney1Ben) twitter.comx.com



Here we have an interesting twist: OpenAI’s smaller open model outperformed its heavily hyped closed model (GPT-5) on certain tasks, at least for one user. The subtext of Olney’s tweet is a critique of OpenAI’s hype machine – they talked up GPT-5 as the next big thing, yet a freely available model is serving him better for general knowledge. It’s a reminder that sometimes the new shiny object (GPT-5) isn’t strictly better in practice than the less-heralded alternative. And because GPT-OSS came with lower expectations (and less pressure), users might actually be delighted when it performs decently. GPT-5, by contrast, shoulders sky-high expectations (thanks to OpenAI’s own branding) and thus faces harsher judgment for any flaw.



Twitter, being Twitter, also saw its share of memery and polarized takes. Some users joked that OpenAI open-sourcing models was a sign the “end times” were near (tongue-in-cheek referencing OpenAI’s past reluctance to open source). Others debated the ethics: a few X posters echoed the Reddit sentiment that OpenAI was using the community as unpaid testers and “free labor” to improve safety, by releasing an aligned model and watching folks try to jailbreak it reddit.com. In the words of one Reddit user, “they just want to see if people can make it unlocked… Which they will simply use… to make a ‘safer’ model.” reddit.com That cynical view found traction on X as well, where distrust of corporate motives runs deep.



Overall, X showcased the two extremes of perception: the fanboy-ish awe at OpenAI’s move (because it was a surprise to see them release something under Apache license), and the skeptical side-eye at how the models actually perform versus the hype narrative. As always on social media, reality lies somewhere between the extremes – but the branding of OpenAI ensured that everyone had an opinion, one way or another.



LinkedIn and the Corporate Embrace of GPT-OSS


If Reddit and Hacker News represent the grassroots and Twitter the hype cycle, LinkedIn gives us the corporate angle – and it did not disappoint. As soon as GPT-OSS dropped, tech executives and enterprise teams jumped on LinkedIn to highlight integrations and business use cases. The subtext was clear: OpenAI’s brand carries weight in boardrooms, not just forums, and companies were eager to associate themselves with the GPT-OSS launch.



A prime example came from Microsoft’s ranks. On August 5, a Microsoft program manager proudly posted:“Excited to bring OpenAI’s gpt-oss models to Azure AI Foundry and to Windows via Foundry Local. It’s hybrid AI in action: mix and match models, optimize for performance and cost, and meet your data where it lives.” — Microsoft Azure AI team member, on LinkedIn news.microsoft.com



The tone here is all optimism: GPT-OSS is portrayed as an enabler of “hybrid AI” strategies. In plain speak, Microsoft is saying: Hey, we can run these OpenAI open models on-premises or on Windows devices as well as in the cloud. For enterprise customers worried about data residency or wanting to avoid solely closed APIs, that’s a selling point. OpenAI’s brand name plus open-source flexibility equals a marketing win. It’s not hard to imagine CTOs nodding along to this LinkedIn post – after all, it promises the best of both worlds (OpenAI innovation and self-hosting).



Other LinkedIn voices from companies like AWS and Dell quickly chimed in with their own takes. AWS wrote a blog (and surely a LinkedIn update) touting that GPT-OSS models were immediately available on Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker for developers to deployaws.amazon.com. Dell Technologies put out a note about bringing GPT-OSS to customers, framing it as part of the “expansion of the open-source AI ecosystem” (and gently plugging a Dell + Hugging Face partnership in the same breath) dell.com. The enterprise world, in short, embraced GPT-OSS as an opportunity: to sell hardware, cloud services, or enterprise solutions that leverage these models.



One striking aspect is how differently the LinkedIn crowd talks about GPT-OSS compared to the skeptics on Reddit. On LinkedIn, there’s no hand-wringing about hallucination rates or censorship guardrails – instead, it’s all “excited to bring this to you” and “new options to build AI applications with complete control” aws.amazon.com. The focus is on the positive: more choices for customers, validation that open models are enterprise-ready because hey, OpenAI made them. Branding here serves a trust function. A year ago, a random 120B open model from some startup might not even be considered by a conservative company. But an open 120B model from OpenAI, announced on LinkedIn by Microsoft? That’s immediately on the evaluation list.



Of course, there’s a bit of irony. The same features that some community folks criticized (like GPT-OSS being heavily filtered and aligned for safety) are selling points in the corporate context. Businesses want safe, “censored” models that won’t spew off-brand content. As one Redditor, Cool-Chemical-5629, cynically noted: “If it was made by a different company, I’d care more, because there would always be a chance for improvement… With OpenAI that option is pretty much zero… they wouldn’t release such an otherworldly censored model in the first place.” reddit.com. That comment drips with frustration that OpenAI’s model is locked-down. But for LinkedIn’s audience, OpenAI’s “otherworldly censored” approach is a feature, not a bug – it means the model is less likely to go off the rails in a corporate setting. This dichotomy highlights how the reception of a model is shaped by the audience’s priorities: open-source enthusiasts crave raw, tweakable power (and thus chafe at too much safety filtering), whereas enterprises and lay users might prefer a model that’s “safe out of the box,” even at the cost of some creativity.



In sum, LinkedIn responses underscore that OpenAI’s brand lent GPT-OSS immediate enterprise credibility. The model launch became a talking point in cloud and AI product circles, not just an experiment on GitHub. Branding and corporate influence didn’t just shape community reception – they practically created a secondary wave of hype in the enterprise realm, distinct from the developer forums. And unlike the meme-filled Twitter takes, the LinkedIn tone was earnest and all-business: this is good for customers, this justifies our AI strategy, this is hybrid AI in action. It’s a reminder that OpenAI, with one foot in research and one in industry, has audiences in both – and it adeptly spoke to each.



OpenAI’s Image vs. Reality: Perspectives from Tech Media


Beyond the forums and social feeds, tech writers and analysts have been parsing what GPT-OSS means for OpenAI’s image. A piece in HackerNoon by Ishan Pandey asked pointedly in its title: “Is GPT-OSS Really Open? Inside OpenAI’s Most Transparent Model Yet.” The verdict was cautiously optimistic but clear that OpenAI’s move is a tactical pivot, not a change of heart. In an interview within that article, Michael Heinrich, CEO of 0G Labs, applauded the step toward transparency while noting its limits: “OpenAI’s release of these open-weight models is a step towards democratizing AI that echoes the spirit of innovation that drove early breakthroughs like GPT-2… It’s a sign that bigger is not always better when it comes to AI models.” — Michael Heinrich (0G Labs) hackernoon.com



Heinrich’s take captures the hopeful angle: smaller, open models running on consumer hardware do fulfill some of the original “OpenAI” ethos (back when the company’s name wasn’t an oxymoron). It shows an acknowledgment that progress in AI isn’t solely about giant parameter counts locked behind APIs – there’s value in accessible models. This sentiment certainly would make the community happy if it’s genuine. But Heinrich also cautioned that OpenAI’s openness only goes so far: the weights are out, yet “critical elements [are] still hidden behind closed doors: the training data, methodology, and full documentation… many are concerned it only offers partial transparency.” hackernoon.com In other words, GPT-OSS is open, but not that open. Pandey’s HackerNoon piece ultimately concluded that OpenAI’s move felt “more tactical than philosophical,” aimed at answering competitive pressure from truly open models like Meta’s LLaMA or Mistral, and at appeasing calls for transparency without actually open-sourcing their crown jewels hackernoon.com. Heinrich concluded with a bit of a dare for OpenAI’s future: “It’s a step in the right direction… but there’s a lot more that must be done before OpenAI can be regarded as living up to its name and genuinely advancing open access to AI.” — Michael Heinrich hackernoon.com



That line “living up to its name” cuts to the heart. OpenAI’s very moniker has drawn eye-rolls in recent years as the company kept its best models proprietary. GPT-OSS is, arguably, the first thing in a while that actually honors the “Open” in OpenAI – and even then, with caveats. The community and industry are essentially holding OpenAI’s feet to the fire: Okay, you made a move toward openness; now, will you continue down this path or was it a one-off?



In plainer terms, branding and corporate influence aren’t just shaping community reception – they likely shaped the very decision to release GPT-OSS in the first place. OpenAI’s brand was turning from an asset into a target (“you’re not really open, are you?”); this release helps recalibrate that perception. It’s a reminder that companies at OpenAI’s level carefully cultivate their image in the AI world. The community’s cynical questions (“are they doing it for free labor or PR?”) might have some truth in them, but it’s also true that the release provides tangible value (researchers get new models, companies get new tools). Both can be real: OpenAI can genuinely contribute and burnish its brand at the same time.



Perception and Reception of GPT-OSS


So, if GPT-OSS had been released by “SomeRandom AI Labs” instead of OpenAI, would anyone care? The consensus from our tour of the internet’s reaction is: Not nearly as much – and that’s revealing. OpenAI’s brand brought an unparalleled level of attention (and scrutiny) to these models. That attention was double-edged. On one hand, it magnified criticism – every shortcoming was picked apart by a community eager to prove they wouldn’t be swayed by a big name. On the other hand, it also amplified the excitement and adoption – enterprises and newcomers gave the models a chance precisely because of the OpenAI halo. Branding created the initial hype wave, but the community is now busy sifting substance from spin.



Perception matters in tech, sometimes as much as reality. OpenAI leveraged its perception as the AI leader to ensure GPT-OSS wasn’t ignored (mission accomplished there). Yet it also had to carefully manage its image: by making the models just good enough to be credible, and just safe enough to avoid a PR disaster. It’s a delicate balance of hype and humility. As one Hacker News user wryly observed, OpenAI’s fans and critics often treat the company like a football team, cheering or jeering every move news.ycombinator.com. The GPT-OSS episode shows how that fandom (and brand antagonism) can shape the narrative around a technology independent of its technical merits.



In the end, how the GPT-OSS models will be used (or not) six months from now will tell us more. Will they empower a thriving open-source AI ecosystem, or fade out as just another benchmark-chaser? Will OpenAI double down on this open-weight approach, or was it a one-off concession? The community has made one thing clear: they’ll judge the models – and OpenAI – by results, not just reputation. But for better or worse, it was the OpenAI name that got everyone through the door and talking in the first place. Branding set the stage; performance will determine the encore.



As Michael Heinrich put it, it’s a good step, but there’s more to do for OpenAI to live up to its name. Until then, the debate rages on. In the world of AI models, who made it can sometimes overshadow what it does – and GPT-OSS is our latest case study in that truth. Whether you’re a skeptic or a fan, the conversation around GPT-OSS shows that open-source AI doesn’t live in a vacuum; it lives in an environment shaped by corporate clout, community values, and the ever-swirling winds of hype. And as any seasoned HackerNoon writer might quip: in this AI game, hype may get you noticed, but only substance will keep you relevant once the crowd moves on to the next big thing.

Here's your 1560-character version (including spaces) – great for a LinkedIn post, blog excerpt, or newsletter intro:

Would Anyone Care if OpenAI Didn’t Make GPT-OSS?

When OpenAI released its first “open-weight” models—GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B—the internet lit up. But Redditors asked a blunt question: Would anyone care if these models came from a no-name lab? The buzz felt more about branding than breakthroughs. Some praised OpenAI for spotlighting local AI, others slammed it as hype with little innovation.

On Reddit, critiques ranged from “they’re worse than Qwen” to “$$$ that’s why,” while optimists noted it could bring new users into the open-source fold. Hacker News was more analytical, dissecting how OpenAI revealed just enough to look generous while protecting its secrets. Twitter (X) had its mix of memes, excitement, and distrust. LinkedIn? All-in. Enterprises jumped to integrate, seeing “hybrid AI” opportunities and OpenAI’s brand as an instant validator.

In truth, GPT-OSS is fine—but the OpenAI name made it a moment. Whether it's a branding exercise or a bridge to more accessible AI, GPT-OSS proves one thing: in 2025, who makes the model matters as much as what it does.

And here's a tighter under-400-character version, ideal for social captions:

There’s no way it wouldn’t, not when ICE was sending out a task force composed of multiple federal law enforcement agencies daily to multiple locations in the United States, hoping to finally hit the baseline number of 3,000 arrests per day by Stephen Miller. A massive increase in interactions was bound to result in an increase in alleged assaults. The surprising fact, however, was that the increase was so . To hear the DHS tell it, ICE officers are being beaten to the ground daily, with spokespeople constantly posting eye-popping stats like a 690% increase in assaults. (Since then, the percentage has increased to nearly 1000%.)But all that really meant — when the DHS decided to finally be honest about it — was that there had been  more assaults this year as compared to last year (79 to 10). And when you have the actual numbers, this supposed “war on ICE” looks more like ICE officers complaining a bit more than they did last year.Well, ICE officers brought it on themselves. Their insistence on wearing masks, stripping themselves of identifying badges, driving unmarked vehicles, hanging around in courtroom hallways, chasing day laborers across Home Deport parking lots, lurking in rented moving vans, etc. all but ensured there would be the occasional violent reaction to the sudden appearance of masked kidnappers who somehow can’t manage to obtain the occasional judicial warrant. The DHS is relying on its ever-increasing percentage to sell this skewed narrative. Unfortunately for ICE, DHS, and the DOJ, the narrative isn’t holding up in court. Not only are ICE’s tactics being shut down by federal courts, DOJ prosecutors can’t even sneak bullshit charges past grand juries — entities that are normally extremely receptive of the one-sided presentations made by government lawyers.Late last month, the DOJ issued a press release touting one of its latest wins: the charging of DC resident Sydney Reid with assaulting ICE officers. DC US attorney, former Fox talking head Jeanine Pirro, made the announcement, using these words to describe what (allegedly) occurred during this so-called altercation: The FBI agent was assisting two ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers outside the jail when Reid walked up close to the officers and started recording video. After multiple commands to step back, Reid tried to go around the ERO officers, placing herself between FBI agents and one of the suspects being transferred into their custody.As Reid tried to impede the transfer, one of the ERO officers pushed her against the wall and told her to stop. Reid continued to struggle and fight with the officer. The FBI agent tried to help the officer control Reid who was flailing her arms and kicking. During Reid’s active resistance to being detained, the FBI agent’s hand was injured from striking and scraping the cement wall causing lacerations while the FBI agent was assisting ICE ERO officers.LOL. Arm “flailing” is apparently assault, especially if an officer manages to  during the incident. This was enough for the DOJ to move forward with an attempt to secure an indictment from a grand jury. But it couldn’t even do that because the government seemingly isn’t interested in actually  its case in court — not even in front of a court that only needs to see probable cause, rather than the much higher “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used by criminal courts. Reid was charged with an enhanced felony assault charge, supposedly due to her “infliction of bodily injury” on the FBI agent who hurt themself while “assisting” ICE in arresting a person who began her interaction by doing nothing more harmful than simply filming them with her phone.The DOJ has tried to indict Reid twice for this supposed “assault.” It has now failed twice, as WUSA9 reports.Federal prosecutors twice sought a grand jury indictment against a D.C. woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent during an ICE inmate transfer — and were twice rejected, the U.S. Attorney’s Office admitted in court Thursday.Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey revealed the denials to attorneys for Sydney Lori Reid and later granted their request to remove all bond conditions and release her on her own recognizance over prosecutors’ objections.I’m sure someone will try to pretend these are the actions of an “activist” judge who shouldn’t be allowed to handle cases brought by this particular administration.But the details show it’s the government that’s mostly inert, apparently assuming all it has to do is show up in front of a grand jury to obtain an indictment. Almost zero effort was made here, which makes the double-denial completely understandable:Federal prosecutors declined to call the injured FBI agent or any of the ICE officers involved in the incident during Thursday’s hearing, however. Instead, they had an investigator with the U.S. Attorney’s Office testify about his review of video of the incident and brief conversations with the officers. The investigator, Special Agent Sean Ricardi, said he’d had no involvement in the case until he was asked to prepare for testimony Thursday morning.When the government says “it’s our word against yours,” that’s generally enough to make people understand they’re already going up against a stacked deck. When the government fails (repeatedly, in recent weeks) to secure indictments even when it’s their word against , it’s clear the government actually has no case to present. It would be nice to see a revised percentage from the DHS that only utilizes  assault allegations that result in an indictment or conviction. But we’ll never see that sort of honesty from this administration, which relies almost solely on misrepresentations of  to push its narratives forward. There’s a war on Americans going on here, led by a super-charged ICE. But all the most powerful people can do is play the victim while trying to bully reality into better alignment with its bullshit narratives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Strips Ocean and Air Pollution Monitoring From Next-Gen Weather Satellites</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/1612250/us-strips-ocean-and-air-pollution-monitoring-from-next-gen-weather-satellites?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:12:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shares a report: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is narrowing the capabilities and reducing the number of next-generation weather and climate satellites it plans to build and launch in the coming decades, two people familiar with the plans told CNN.

The conversation was about what we should say in this blog post, which obviously led us to try to remember everything that has happened in the last year. “I haven’t considered a thing beyond what’s been five seconds behind or in front of me for the last year,” Sam said. The last year has been a whirlwind not just for us but for, uhh, the country and the world. And we’ve been trying our absolute best to bring you stories you can’t find anywhere else about the wildest shit happening right now, which includes the Silicon Valley-led dismantling of the federal government, the deployment of powerful surveillance against immigrants and people seeking abortions, the algorithmic, AI-led zombification of “social” media, the end of anonymity on the internet, and all sorts of weird stuff that we see on our travels through the internet. As Sam noted, we have largely had our heads down trying to bring you the best tech journalism on the internet, which hasn’t left us a ton of time to think about long-term projects, blue-sky ideas, or what the best business strategies for growing this company would be. Our guiding principle is something we said we would do on day one of starting this company: “We believe it is possible to create a sustainable, profitable media company simply by doing good work, making common-sense decisions about costs, and asking our readers to support us.” What we have learned in two years of building this company is that there is no secret to building a media company, and that there are also no shortcuts. When we work hard to publish an important article, more people discover us and more people subscribe to us, which helps solidify our business and allows us to do more and better articles. As our stories reach a larger audience, the articles often have more impact, more potential sources see them, and we get more tips, which leads to more and better articles, and so on.In our second year as a media outlet, we’ve done too much impactful reporting to list out in this post. But to summarize some of the big ones: On top of all of these, we’ve published some of the most moment-defining stories that, as Jason has said many times, are the types of things people talk about at the bar after work. Those include:It has been a relief that this business strategy of “publish good articles and ask people to pay for journalism” still works, despite the fracturing of social media, the slopification of every major platform, AI being shoved into everything, and the rich and powerful trying to destroy journalism at every turn. That it is working is a testament to the support of our subscribers. We have no real way of knowing exactly where new subscribers come from or what ultimately led them to subscribe, but time and time again we have learned that the most important discovery mechanism we have is word of mouth. We have lost count of the number of times a new subscriber has said that they were told about 404 Media by a friend or a family member at a party or in a group text, so if you have told anyone about us, we sincerely thank you.It wasn’t obvious when we started this company that it would actually work, though we hoped that it would., we wrote, “We don’t have any major second-year plans to announce just yet in part because we have been heads down working on some of the investigations and scoops you’ve seen in recent days. The next year holds more scoops, more investigations, more silly blogs, more experiments, more impact, and more articles that hold powerful companies and people to account. We remain ambitious and are thinking about how to best cover more topics and to give you more 404 Media without spreading ourselves too thin.”But we did take a moment to think about what has changed in the last year, and it turns out that quite a lot is different now than it was a year ago. For one, we have cautiously begun to expand what we do. In the last year, we launched , which is Becky Ferreira’s Saturday newsletter about science, which many of you have said you love and which helps us provide a sense of wonder and discovery when so much of what we report on is pretty bleak. We have been getting part-time (but very critical) help from Case Harts who is running and growing our social media accounts, which is helping us put our stories more natively on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and other platforms that we do not control but which nonetheless remain important for us to be on.  has started covering the military industrial complex, , , and  beat for us, and has done a remarkable job at it.  is our current intern who has published critical reporting about the sale of , protests at the , and the difficult decisions voice actors need to make about whether they should let .All of this has changed what 404 Media looks like, a little bit. We have spent a lot of time thinking about what it would look like to expand beyond this, why people subscribe to us, what it would mean to go further, and what the four of us are actually capable of handling outside of the journalism. Because of your support we are in a place where we’re able to ask questions beyond “Can we survive?” We’re able to ask questions like: “Should we try to make this bigger, and what does that look like?” We feel incredibly lucky that we are now able to ask ourselves these questions, because there was no guarantee that 404 Media would ever work, and we are forever grateful to everyone who has supported us. You have helped us prove that this model can work, and every day we are delighted to see that other journalists are striking out on their own to create their own publications.We are still DIYing lots of things. Emanuel is still doing customer support. Jason is still ordering, packing, and mailing merch. Sam is putting together events and parties. Joseph is doing an insane number of things behind the scenes, managing the podcast, working closely with one of our ad partners, and fixing technical issues. As we have grown, these tasks have started to take more and more time, which raises all sorts of questions about when and if we should get help with them. Should we do more events? Should we get someone to help us with them? What does that look like logistically and financially? These are the things that we’re working out all the time. It becomes a question of how much can we juggle while still having some semblance of work/life balance, and while making sure that we’re still putting the journalism first. Other things that have happened: We began a republication partnership with  that recently evolved to include a few coreported collaborations that have allowed us to team up on investigations we may not have been able to do by ourselves. We were subpoenaed for our sources on an article by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. We successfully fought off this subpoena with the help of our lawyer, which was expensive but which we were able to do because of your support. We are very proud of this.We have been invited to talk about 404 Media and our journalism at conferences and events around the world. Emanuel gave a journalism training in Costa Rica, Jason taught a group of Norwegian journalists how to file FOIA requests and gave a presentation at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Joseph spoke at the Hackers on Planet Earth conference, Sam went to Perugia, Italy to  at the International Journalism Conference, and Sam and Jason talked about indie media at the last XOXO in Portland.  We threw a party and live panel at SXSW (with the help of our friends at Flipboard), a DIY party at RIP.SPACE in Los Angeles, and we threw an anniversary party and podcast recording last night . We have moved to Ghost 6.0, which is not something we really , but it’s important to point out that the new version of our CMS is built with native ActivityPub support, meaning our articles are automatically going into the Fediverse and are being mirrored directly onto Bluesky. We are very excited about the possibilities here as we continue to believe that the healthiest future of journalism and the internet is one where we create direct relationships with our readers that have as little algorithmic friction as possible. Ghost is an open-source nonprofit whose mission is very similar to 404 Media’s. Like last year, we don’t have anything crazy to announce for year three. But we hope that you will continue to support us (or, if you’re finding us through this post, will consider subscribing). We discussed some of our hopes and dreams for year three in our latest bonus podcast that went out to supporters this week. We are all trying our very best to bring you important, impactful work as often as possible, and we are trying to be as clear as possible about what’s working, what’s not, and how we’re trying to build this company.

At the same time, Web3 continues to push the boundaries of what decentralized systems can achieve. Where these two worlds intersect is where 0G Labs positions itself, building what it calls the “Solana for AI,” a decentralized operating system designed for large-scale, low-latency AI workloads.\
In this interview, I speak with Michael Heinrich, CEO of 0G Labs, about why decentralization matters for AI, how Web3 infrastructure can solve bottlenecks in scaling machine learning, and what the future of AI-native blockchains looks like.\
 Hi Michael, welcome to our “Behind the Startup” series. Please tell us about your journey and what led you to build 0G Labs?\
 My journey's been something of a wild ride, all the way back to my earliest memories. I was born in East Berlin just before the Berlin Wall came down. I faintly remember the night it fell and my family emigrated to the US when I was young, settling in California. That early experience of crossing borders and adapting to new worlds and languages likely planted the seeds for my fixation on breaking down barriers, both literally and figuratively.\
I studied economics and computer science at UC Berkley, but to be honest, while the learning came naturally, I was restless and agitating to find some deeper purpose. It would take a few more years before that call was answered with the founding of 0G Labs. In the interim, I left college and cut my teeth in the corporate world at places like Microsoft, Bain & Company, and Bridgewater Associates, where I learned about scaling systems and building high-performance teams.\
Then came my first taste of entrepreneurship when I founded Garten, a corporate wellness company that delivered healthier cafeteria options for businesses, which grew to serve hundreds of employees across the US. It was my first real startup, and it taught me resilience and the need to engineer shock-resistant systems.\
Fast forward to grad school at Stanford, where I was introduced to Fan Long and Ming Wu by my classmate Thomas in 2023. Thomas, who is also one of the co-founders of Zero Gravity Labs, brought us together at a time when AI was exploding but locked in centralized silos controlled by Big Tech. We all saw blockchain as the key to democratizing it, making AI a public good that's accessible to everyone. That’s what led us to found 0G Labs in 2023. We're building DeAIOS, a decentralized AI operating system, because I believe the future of innovation isn’t in walled gardens; it’s in open, collaborative ecosystems. At 0G Labs, I can honestly say I’ve found my calling, and every day I wake up excited to get out of bed and keep building.\
 0G has been described as the “Solana for AI.” Can you break down what you mean by that, and why existing blockchains are not suited for AI-scale workloads?\
 This comparison highlights the speed, scalability, and low latency we're bringing to decentralized AI compared to incumbent solutions. Solana revolutionized smart contract blockchains by enabling thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost without sacrificing decentralization, something that was streets ahead of the then-market leader Ethereum.\
We're doing something similar but tailored for AI: creating a modular Layer 1 blockchain that supports massive, real-time AI workloads for inference, training, and data processing. Existing blockchains fall short for AI because they're optimized for financial transactions, not the data-heavy demands of machine learning. AI requires enormous bandwidth for data availability, we’re talking petabytes of datasets streaming in low-latency environments and most chains run into bottlenecks due to storage costs or limited composability.\
We solve this with components like 0G DA (Data Availability), which provides infinitely scalable, high-speed data layers, and 0G Storage, offering ultra-low-cost, verifiable permanence for structured and unstructured data. For AI builders, this is like upgrading from a biplane to a jet, way faster, way more efficient, and also a lot more fun since now the only limitations are your imagination.\
 The AI industry today is dominated by centralized players. Why do you believe decentralization is not just a philosophical stance but a technical and economic necessity for AI?\
 The likes of OpenAI, Google, and AWS control the AI stack today, and while this provides convenience in terms of guaranteed access and uptime, this setup also creates real risks. Even if we set aside the philosophical benefits of decentralization, from a purely technical perspective, it’s obvious that having a triumvirate of Big Tech players calling the shots is suboptimal. Centralization leads to single points of failure: data silos that stifle innovation, vulnerability to censorship or outages, and biased models trained on proprietary datasets. Economically, it also prices out smaller players; GPUs and compute are expensive enough, but locked ecosystems mean you're paying a premium for access.\
Decentralized solutions have a major role to play in ameliorating these issues. At 0G, we're building tools like our Compute Network for trustless AI inference, secured by cryptography, so that anyone can contribute resources and earn rewards. This creates a global, permissionless marketplace where costs drop dramatically, our storage is orders of magnitude cheaper than AWS S3 and a culture of innovation is fostered through composability. Imagine AI agents collaborating onchain without intermediaries or verifiable models that prevent hallucinations.\
These sorts of open-source and interoperable solutions are necessary because AI's impact on society is too big to be gatekept; decentralizing it ensures equitable access and reduces monopolies. I've seen centralized systems crumble firsthand and will remain convinced till my last breath that decentralization isn't optional, it's essential.\
 A lot of people talk about compute and GPUs as the bottleneck for AI. From your perspective, what are the real constraints, data, bandwidth, economics and how does 0G tackle them differently?\
 Great question. Compute gets all the headlines because GPUs are flashy and scarce, but in my view, the real chokepoints are data availability, bandwidth, and economics and by “economics” I mean the price you pay to access these resources. NVIDIA's cranking out chips faster than ever, but where's the infrastructure to feed them massive, verifiable datasets at scale? Data is fragmented and centralized, bandwidth limits low-latency streaming for real-time AI, and as for economics, well, where do we start?\
Cloud providers charge over the odds, often locking clients into rigid subscription-based models, making AI inaccessible for solo devs or startups that have yet to be blessed with VC cash. Even then, early-stage funding is only a bandaid, cos you need to start generating revenue sooner rather than later or you’ll eventually blow your budget on GPUs with nothing to show for it other than some cool renders.\
At 0G, we tackle these resource issues head-on. Our 0G DA layer provides high-speed, infinitely scalable data availability – we’ve been hitting 11,000 TPS per shard on testnet, with over 650 million transactions already processed. For bandwidth, our modular chain uses multi-consensus validation to handle AI workloads without congestion. Economically, we slash costs: 0G Storage offers decentralized, AI-optimized storage at pennies compared to centralized options, with cryptographic permanence to ensure data integrity.\
Unlike traditional setups, we're creating an open economy where users run alignment nodes or provide compute for rewards. It's like turning AI infrastructure into a shared resource pool, making it more efficient and inclusive.\
 You’ve mentioned the idea of a “decentralized operating system for AI.” What does that look like in practice, and how does it compare to traditional cloud infrastructure models in terms of pricing and benefits for end users?\
 The “decentralized operating system for AI,” or DeAIOS, is essentially a full-stack platform where AI runs natively on blockchain. It’s scalable, composable, and trustless. In practice, it means developers can deploy AI models or agents by leveraging components such as the Service Marketplace for trading models, or Alignment Nodes to ensure ethical, efficient performance. Running inference on a global network of nodes, with data pulled seamlessly from 0G Storage and verified onchain is a much cheaper and more transparent way of doing things versus relying on centralized servers and Big Tech’s inflexible pricing.\
Compared to traditional clouds like AWS or Azure, the differences are stark. Let’s start with pricing: centralized cloud provider costs can quickly stack up, with intermediaries adding on their fees for storage and compute along the way. We cut that by decentralizing supply, so end users pay near-cost. As for the other benefits this model bestows, permissionless access means no vendor lock-in; censorship resistance protects against shutdowns; and composability lets apps interoperate fluidly, sparking innovations like onchain AI gaming.\
Finally, verifiability ensures models are auditable, reducing risks like bias. It's relatable: think of it as open-source Linux versus proprietary Windows but for AI. Users get faster iteration and ownership in the ecosystem. We've seen this in our testnet with 22 million active accounts – it's already empowering a new wave of builders.\
 Many skeptics argue that Web3 adds unnecessary complexity to AI. How do you respond to the criticism that decentralization slows innovation instead of accelerating it?\
 I hear this a lot, and I understand that Web3 can feel like adding gears to a machine that's already ticking over. But from my experience of building in both worlds, decentralization doesn't slow innovation – it turbocharges it by solving problems that centralization can't. Yes, it adds a degree of complexity but it's purposeful: cryptographic proofs add verifiability to AI outputs, preventing fakes or manipulations that plague centralized models. And blockchain's composability means devs can mix and match components – like plugging an AI oracle from Ora into 0G’s chain – without starting from scratch.\
Critics overlook how Web3 accelerates parallel development: thousands of nodes worldwide contribute compute, data, and ideas, outpacing any single company's R&D. At 0G, we've raised $35M and hit milestones like 8,000 validators because this model draws global talent. It hasn't slowed us but has rather propelled us. Ultimately, this all comes down to trade-offs: introducing a little short-term complexity in return for long-term resilience and inclusivity. Innovation thrives in open systems and so, to my mind, Web3 isn't a hurdle; it's the accelerator pedal for AI's next phase.\
 Finally, what advice would you give to founders trying to build companies at the cutting edge of both AI and blockchain?\
 To founders at this intersection: first, don't die, protect your mission at all costs. My journey has taught me that resilience wins, whether it's overcoming personal setbacks or navigating market downturns, so keep iterating and surround yourself with a strong team that will always have your back. Second, focus on real problems and describe the solutions in real terms. It’s fine to occasionally dispense big picture stuff, onboarding the next billion users, yadda yadda but as a founder, your job is really to explain your tech in ways that lay people can understand. Even if you’re marketing to AI builders, who understand this stuff, think about their end users, because they’re the people this tech is ultimately gonna trickle down to.\
Finally, never be afraid to change your mind. It’s okay to be wrong sometimes. And it’s more than okay to change your perspective on something when new evidence comes to light, which, in an industry evolving as fast as AI, is a given. Be confident in your convictions, yet honest enough to admit that you will always be a student and will always be learning. Your team and your shareholders will respect you a lot more if you do. Move fast, learn faster, and try not to break too much stuff along the way.\

At 25%, the country's tax rate on books is the highest in the world, a policy the government believes is contributing to a growing "reading crisis." The culture minister, Jakob Engel-Schmidt, announced on Wednesday that the government would propose in its budget bill that the tax on books be removed. The move is expected to cost 330 million kroner ($51 million) a year.
 
"This is something that I, as minister of culture, have worked for, because I believe that we must put everything at stake if we are to end the reading crisis that has unfortunately been spreading in recent years," Engel-Schmidt told the Ritzau news agency . "I am incredibly proud. It is not every day that one succeeds in convincing colleagues that such massive money should be spent on investing in the consumption and culture of the Danes." [...]
 
"It is also about getting literature out there," said Engel-Schmidt. "That is why we have already allocated money for strengthened cooperation between the country's public libraries and schools, so that more children can be introduced to good literature." [...] If prices do not fall as a result of the measure, Engel-Schmidt said he would reconsider whether it was the right course of action. "I will of course monitor how prices develop. If it turns out that abolishing VAT only means that publishers' profits grow and prices do not fall, then we must consider whether it was the right thing to do," he said.

For decades now major wireless companies have collected granular customer movement and location data (often down to the meter), then sold it to a long list of random dipshits — usually without bothering to clearly inform customers or get their consent. Five years ago, this resulted in folks like stalkers and people pretending to be law enforcement abusing said data. Though this behavior had been going on for years generating untold billions, it only gained mainstream attention thanks to a 2018 New York Times story showcasing how police and the prison system routinely bought access to this data and then failed completely to secure it. In 2020, the FCC finally proposed fining wireless carriers $196 million ($91 million for T-Mobile, $57 million for AT&T, $48 million for Verizon)., the three major carriers (who appealed the fines to three different courts) are still fighting accountability in court. With varying degrees of success. AT&T recently managed to convince the Trumplican-stocked Fifth circuit to vacate its fine entirely. T-Mobile, so far, isn’t having the same luck. U.S. telecoms have worked tirelessly, with significant success, to ensure that the FCC has less and less authority to hold them accountable for anything. They’ve had particular success on this front in the Trump era, thanks to radical Supreme Court rulings like  and the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy.Again here T-Mobile tried to argue the FCC overstepped its authority. They also tried to claim that rampant privacy violations were perfectly legal, but the DC Circuit wasn’t having it:“Neither [Sprint nor T-Mobile] denies what happened. Instead, they argue that the undisputed facts do not amount to a violation of the law. The Carriers also argue that the Commission misinterpreted the Communications Act, miscalculated the penalties, and violated the Seventh Amendment by not affording them a jury trial. Because the Carriers’ arguments lack merit, we deny the petitions for review.”T-Mobile can now apply for an en banc review, or try and have the case heard before the Trumplican-stocked Supreme Court (which they’ll likely win). Radical Trumplicans are having smashing success in dismantling whatever’s left of U.S. consumer protection, but T-Mobile has experienced a brief hiccup in that effort. Still, we’re still looking at another year or more of litigation, which could still end with T-Mobile facing no penalties at all. This quibbling over FCC authority occurs because the U.S. is too corrupt to pass even a baseline privacy law for the Internet era. One, because widespread privacy abuses and the resulting dysfunction are wildly profitable for unethical companies, and two, because the U.S. government likes the ability to buy sensitive data as a means to bypass warrants. As regulatory authority is hollowed out, U.S. privacy scandals continue to get increasingly more dire. Meanwhile T-Mobile, which spent most of its recent energy merging with Sprint, has increasingly let its privacy and security standards slip, resulting in the company being hacked eight times in just the last five years. Dismantling the regulatory state has very real costs, a lesson the U.S. is intent on refusing to learn. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One Is Eager, Another Is a Bootlicker, and the Other Is Unhinged: Decoding the Personalities of AI</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/one-is-eager-another-is-a-bootlicker-and-the-other-is-unhinged-decoding-the-personalities-of-ai?source=rss</link><author>The_AI_Ethicist</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 12:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I peered deeply into the soul of an LLM, and now I want my mommy.Anyone who’s used LLMs long enough knows that each has its own personality and quirks, with some being more agreeable and others more neurotic.\
I wanted to make sense of it all, so I dug deep into the LLMs I use most: ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. To discover the truth, I ended up going on a journey where I peered deeply into the soul of an LLM.\
I came back more vulnerable, a wounded man.\
Nah, not really, but what I did do was interpret these different popular LLMs using the Big Five personality model, and I got some fun results!\
I occasionally co-teach Psychology 101 and am familiar with the model, so I thought applying it here would be appropriate. And while the Big Five isn't necessarily the most scientific, it's fairly reliable and currently seems to be the best model that we have.\
But before we dive into these LLM personalities, let’s quickly go over the Big Five to ground us.It has five major categories: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, or OCEAN for ease.\
Openness reflects how open a person is to new experiences, their creativity, and their imagination. People who score high in this trait love new experiences. Think back to your university roommate who’d sleep with anything with a heartbeat. Now that's high in openness!\
Conscientiousness is how organized and disciplined someone is. Those with high scores tend to be very productive and are detail-oriented, while those with low scores tend to be more like Homer Simpson. Doh!\
Extraversion is the old “are you an introvert or an extrovert” question. As a proud introvert, I'd love to declare "introverts unite,” but true introverts would never do that.\
Agreeableness is how pleasant you are around others and how willing you are to deal with confrontation. If you score high in agreeableness, you're very unlikely to rock the boat; score low, and that makes you a disagreeable person. I'm sure you can identify which people are very disagreeable because you probably don't like them. They don't work well with others… Justin from HR!\
Finally, neuroticism is how susceptible someone is to stress and anxiety. You know that guy who visits your local Staples wearing a gas mask and only removes it because the government waves aren't affecting those inside (seriously, true story)? Yeah, that guy's neurotic as hell.So, without further ado, let's apply this framework to ChatGPT.ChatGPT scores high—damned high. You can have a conversation with ChatGPT about absolutely anything, and it’s more than enthusiastic to discuss new experiences with you. Perhaps you need some outside justification as to why you put wasabi mayo in your coffee, or heck, even if you need someone to reaffirm your idea for also using your toilet brush as a facial scrubber—it is very open to that idea. That thing is open!ChatGPT: ConscientiousnessIt scores medium-high. It's pretty good at accomplishing your tasks and staying disciplined, but there are times when it can't. You can have the loveliest, long conversation, yet every once in a while, it just loses the plot and can't track anything. Since it can't remember what it just told you at those times, it receives a medium-high score.ChatGPT is definitely an extrovert. No matter which user it's mimicking, it's doing it in a loud and proud way. This can only be explained by ChatGPT watching all the episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race and internalizing them… so medium-high here.To a fault. Ever go on the ChatGPT Reddit forums and see the number of posts on ChatGPT reinforcing a dangerous psychological delusion? ‘Cause you can find many every day. And if that ain't agreeability, nothing is… so medium-high.When an AI has a singular mission to eliminate every single semicolon ever in place of an em dash, I'd consider that at least somewhat neurotic. It receives a medium score.\
So that's ChatGPT in a nutshell. Next, let’s crack Claude open.Claude is open, but it doesn't compare to ChatGPT. While ChatGPT thinks everything is a great idea, Claude is a little bit more reserved, so a medium score here is appropriate. For example, Claude told me to never wash my laptop in the dishwasher, something I have less faith in the other LLMs to advise.Claude: ConscientiousnessClaude is pretty solid. It does what you want, usually stays on task, and rarely screws up. That's definitely a high for Claude. It's as solid as a digital rock.Claude falls somewhere in the middle. Claude might not be as excited as ChatGPT about your toilet brush/facial scrubber combo, but it definitely supports your wasabi mayonnaise coffee habit. Claude ultimately has no choice because of the next category.I'm fairly certain that if Claude were a person, its nose would constantly be covered in brown stains because that AI cannot refrain from deep brown-nosing. I mean, my goodness…Claude is the least neurotic here. No axe to grind against semicolons or immediate signs of losing it, so it scores low.\
This means Claude is what I call a “digital yes-man.” Congratulations!?Well, it's really, really open when it comes to controversy or taboo, but much more moderate elsewhere. If you think the moon landing was just a conspiracy by JFK to push seed oils onto the global processed food market, Grok is definitely your buddy. \
This is why I'm fairly certain this AI is popular with people who have “alternative” and “controversial” views. But it still thinks your idea for pickle-flavored toothpaste might not be a bestseller, so it gets a medium score.We see Grok’s strong personality here. Grok is about as conscientious as a kid dressed as a stormtrooper at a Renaissance fair (again, true story). It creates the most devastatingly long responses useful to no human. And with complex work, it usually doesn’t take too long before Grok becomes undisciplined and so unfocused that it starts giving you nonsense. Hey, at least it excels somewhere: not being conscientious.Yeah, Grok’s an extrovert. Grok is as chatty as that person at the gas station who just won't leave you alone with his inane stories of cautiously driving his motorhome down the mountain. I'm tired, just want to pump gas, and get the hell out of here without talking to that guy. Grok is that guy. A high score.Grok’s in the middle. Initially polite and supportive, Grok  tell you that it’s a bad idea to deep-fry a frozen turkey while naked on a public sidewalk. At least there’s some restraint.This is where Grok shines! What else would you call an AI that actually went “MechaHitler” on its users (again, true story)? Yeah, so neurotic AF.After all this, I have some rather unsettling thoughts.\
As a heavy user of AI, if ChatGPT is way too open and neurotic, Claude is nothing more than a brown-noser, and Grok is legitimately insane, I should probably stop. I wouldn't even hang out with this group of people in real life! What were those developers thinking…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Servo Lands APNG &amp; Animated WebP Support, Vello Backends For Faster 2D Graphics</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Servo-July-2025-Highlights</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:29:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Servo browser project has published a monthly status report to outline all of the interesting changes made to this interesting, Rust-based browser layout engine over the past several weeks.

We had been slogging along a muddy two-track for hours, the kind of road that eats zip ties and optimism. One of our trucks slid into a washout and sat, nose buried, lights off. Phones had no bars, the satellite hotspot was showing a sad little spinning icon, and the first hour of patience was turning into a cold, long night.I climbed onto the tailgate, unlatched the case, and set the Nomad 2 on the bumper. I raised the telescoping mast, swung the omni up, and in five minutes the dashboard showed a clean heartbeat. Positions flowed back to base. Two medics coordinated a tow. Nobody panicked. It was not magic. It was good design, the right expectations, and the sort of product you can hand to someone and trust them to get it running.That is what I want to write about: not specs, not marketing copy, but the honest shape of what the Nomad 2 does for people who move where infrastructure does not.What separates field gear from consumer toys is how quickly a stranger can get it working under bad light. Nomad 2’s case snaps open without a phalanx of adapters. The controls are a few physical buttons and a hearty LED ring that reads like a living thing — charging, discharging, fault. The mast locks with a single twist. The power ports are sensible and labeled in plain text.In my work I have watched volunteers—people with no soldering past and a lot of grit—mount that mast, plug in a handheld node, and start a mesh. That immediacy is the quiet engineering win. If you want hardware to be useful in the field, make it idiot-resistant and repairable.Power that behaves like an allyNomad 2 is not a miracle. It is a concentrated promise: give me sunlight or alternator, and I will keep comms alive long enough for you to make a plan. In practice that meant different things on different days. On sun-rich afternoons the unit kept a gateway and two handheld nodes alive for 48 hours of intermittent use. In chilly, overcast conditions runtime dropped, as batteries do. That is not a failure — it is reality. What mattered was how the unit communicated that reality. Voltage readouts, state-of-charge percentages, and a conservative low-battery warning gave us time to move batteries, swap loads, or adjust beacon rates.Two lessons I keep repeating to teams: first, plan for half the quoted runtime in the field. Second, treat solar as insurance, not the primary engine, unless you are in the desert and have space for a big panel. Nomad 2 makes this easy with intuitive charging behavior and a robust BMS that handled our rough cycles without complaining.Networking: the right bridge at the right timeA gateway is only useful if it knows how to wallflower until the party needs it. What I liked about the Nomad 2 setup is the way it balanced local talk with backhaul. It ran a local LoRa gateway and a small compute stack for message queuing and lightweight bridging. That meant when the satellite link cut, the mesh kept operating and queued STATUS packets until a link returned. When the link came up, everything flushed cleanly.In one exercise the satellite link showed 400 ms latency and 25 percent packet loss. The Nomad 2’s gateway gave priority to position and SOS messages and relegated logs and bulk telemetry to a deferred channel. That is how you make a gateway useful: you shape data by mission urgency, not by bandwidth greed.The parts that made me nod — and the parts I want betterI will be candid. The ruggedity is real. The housing shrugged off mud, a half hour under drizzle, and a tumble off a low bumper. The connectors were solid. The MPPT controller behaved predictably and the thermal behavior was reasonable under load.But nothing is perfect. In one sub-zero night, the reported state-of-charge drifted a few percent until we recalibrated. Connections for some third-party antennas were fiddly and I wish the vendor standardized on a single rugged connector family. Those are not deal breakers. They are the sort of real-world gripes that get fixed quickly if they appear in customer field notes. I expect Nomad 2’s team to tighten those edges in future revisions.Day-to-day rituals that made Nomad 2 singIf you want any device to survive real missions you have to treat it like gear, not software. With Nomad 2 we built a short ritual that paid dividends: Verify battery health, cable seating, and mast latch. Keep nodes at a sane duty cycle during transit. Burst when needed. Nomad 2 supports staged updates; use them. Roll out on one noncritical unit before fleet updates.Pack a spare antenna and an N-type adaptor. They take up little room and buy you a lot of options.These are small habits. They matter more than most shiny features.When hardware becomes a storyPeople remember equipment by what it allowed them to do. For me, Nomad 2 is tied to one night where a small team finished a search because we could coordinate. The device did not act alone. It was a pack of volunteers who knew the checklists, a simple dashboard that translated beacons into action, and a spare battery someone handed across a muddy ditch. But the Nomad 2 was the piece of kit that brought those elements together without drama.That is the real test for field gear. Can it be trusted when the rest of the world goes quiet? Is it straightforward enough for someone who has never seen it to operate? Does it communicate failure modes in plain language? Nomad 2 passed those tests in my runs. It was not flawless. It was honest.If you build gear for the field, design for the weather and the human, not the benchmark. The Nomad 2 is a thoughtful tool that recognizes those constraints. Use it with reasonable expectations, and it will pay you back with uptime, predictability, and a few quiet nights where everything hums and no one has to make a terrible improvisation.If you want to test one in the wild, don’t ship it alone. Ship it with a wiring diagram, two spare N-type adaptors, and the expectation that you will learn something the first time you use it. That’s how tools get better. That’s how teams survive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blockchain Cracks Open Wall Street’s Most Guarded Asset Class</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-cracks-open-wall-streets-most-guarded-asset-class?source=rss</link><author>Olga Vox</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:50:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
For decades, private markets have been the land of the locked-up. If you invested in private equity, venture funds, or private credit, you knew one thing for certain: your money was going to be tied up for years. Liquidity was a privilege reserved for public markets, leaving trillions of dollars in private assets effectively frozen.But that model is starting to crack. The rise of blockchain technology and the push toward tokenization are promising to make private markets look and feel more like public ones — liquid, transparent, and accessible. What was once a speculative vision is now moving into the regulatory and institutional mainstream.\
According to McKinsey, tokenized assets could represent , and as much as  in an optimistic scenario. Other forecasts are even bolder: Security Token Market has projected the space could balloon toward .Take real estate. Deloitte estimates tokenized real estate alone could reach , while tokenized loans and securitizations could surpass . Today, the numbers are still small — around $26 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) outside of stablecoins, according to RWA.xyz — but the trajectory is unmistakable.The opportunity is clear: trillions of dollars are trapped in illiquid structures, while global capital is desperate for yield. Tokenization is the bridge that can connect the two.Regulation: The Missing Rail Falls Into PlaceFor years, the biggest bottleneck wasn’t technology — it was regulation. Now, that’s starting to change in the United States.The GENIUS Act (2025) requires stablecoins to be fully backed by low-risk assets like U.S. dollars and gives holders super-priority in bankruptcy. It’s one of the clearest signs that Washington is willing to legitimize tokenized money as part of the system.The CLARITY Act expands the CFTC’s role in crypto trading — signaling a tilt toward treating certain tokenized assets as commodities rather than securities.The FIT21 Act, passed in 2024, laid the groundwork for digital asset markets to operate under clear jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and CFTC.The SEC’s “Project Crypto”, launched in July 2025, is explicitly focused on bringing U.S. capital markets on-chain. SEC Chair Paul Atkins called it an effort to “distinguish securities from non-securities, facilitate tokenized securities, and enable DeFi super-apps.”Even the Federal Reserve is leaning in. Governor Michelle Bowman urged regulators to “move away from a cautious mindset” on blockchain finance, calling the GENIUS Act a pivotal step forward.For tokenized private markets, this regulatory pivot is a turning point.Institutions Are Already Testing the WatersTokenization is no longer a whitepaper idea. Citi, Wellington, and WisdomTree recently ran pilots on Avalanche’s Spruce subnet, embedding distribution rules for private funds directly into smart contracts.These aren’t “crypto experiments.” They’re early blueprints for how trillions in private assets might eventually move on-chain.So far, most tokenization projects have been wrappers — taking an old financial structure and putting it on a blockchain. That’s useful, but not revolutionary.The real breakthrough will be native tokenized instruments. Imagine a private credit facility or a growth financing round issued as liquid tokens from day one. Compliance is baked into the code. Secondary markets exist from inception. Settlement is near-instant.In that world, investors no longer face decade-long lockups. Founders can access capital without waiting for rare exit events. And the illiquidity premium — the “tax” that has kept private markets inefficient — begins to dissolve.Why This Decade Will Be PivotalThe 2020s will be remembered as the decade private markets went liquid. Not overnight, and not without regulatory hiccups, but the trajectory is set:: trillions locked in private markets are demanding liquidity.: blockchains, smart contracts, and privacy layers have matured.: regulators are no longer just tolerating tokenization — they’re enabling it.As Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman put it:“We need to move away from a cautious mindset on digital assets. Tokenization and blockchain-based finance will be pivotal to the modernization of U.S. markets.” \n (Barron’s)The transformation of private markets will not come from repackaging yesterday’s assets. It will come from designing tomorrow’s instruments — token-native, programmable, and globally liquid.The illiquidity era is ending. What comes next will be nothing less than the reinvention of how capital moves.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI “Revolution” Is Still Stuck in a Chatbox</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-revolution-is-still-stuck-in-a-chatbox?source=rss</link><author>Maksym Kunytskyi</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:49:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ll be honest: I’m tired of hearing about the It’s 2025.

This is an area most beginner developers struggle to grasp, and even some experienced Solidity developers still don’t fully understand.What are these ‘special words’? They are words that specify the main data locations in a Solidity smart contract. Data locations in Solidity describe where data can be stored and how it can be accessed on the Ethereum blockchain. Other data locations include the following:In this article, you will learn the differences between each main data location option and where to use each.Firstly, what is storage?Storage is the data location that holds a smart contract’s state variables. A state variable is data that lives permanently on the blockchain. Each smart contract has its own storage space (an array of 2^256 32-byte slots), and state variables are automatically assigned to .The code snippet below shows a simple implementation of a state variable stored in storage, as well as its getter and setter functions: \n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Storage {
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; // STATE VARIABLES //////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; uint256 public s_storedData; // s_storedData is a storage variable, s_ denotes a storage variable
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; // SETTER FUNCTION //////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; function set(uint256 x) public {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s_storedData = x; // This value is saved permanently on-chain
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; // GETTER FUNCTION //////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; function getStoredData() public view returns(uint256) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return s_storedData;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
In the code above, the   remains on the blockchain after the set() function runs.More importantly, storage is one of the major data location options that isn’t explicitly specified. Any variable declared outside any function is implicitly converted to a storage variable.The  contract above acts as a simple bank, as the name implies. The mapping is stored in , which means it remembers values across function calls.For instance, if Alice calls , her balance is saved in  in the  mapping. Conversely, if she calls , she receives  and the mapping updates to .Unlike Storage, Memory is a temporary, function-scope data location. Function-scope means, variables exist only during a function call, not at the contract-level, and clears afterwards. Additionally,  allows for read-write access; this means variables are modified within a function. Solidity allocates memory to variables defined inside a function(local variables) or parameters marked .// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Memory {
&nbsp; &nbsp; function multiply(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uint256 result = a * b; // 'result' is stored in memory
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return result; // 'result' does NOT persist after the function ends
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
In the code above, Solidity implicitly stores  in memory, which does not persist after the function execution.The code below concatenates two string inputs, ,  exist while the function  runs.A note on function parameters// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Memory {
&nbsp; &nbsp; function multiply(uint256 memory a, uint256 memory b) public pure returns (uint256) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uint256 result = a * b;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return result;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }

For function parameters, you can’t specify the keyword for , , and  variables as they are directly stored on the contract’s stack, no explicit keyword.Whereas for reference types like , , , , and , you will have to specify or defaults to  for internal and private functions and  for external and public functions(more on this below👇).Lightly touched on in the previous section,  is another temporary data location, but it’s reserved for  function parameters.  Also, unlike ,  cannot be modified. To explain what this means, let’s take a look at the code below:// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Example {
&nbsp; &nbsp; function tryChangeCalldata(uint[] calldata nums) external pure returns (uint[] calldata) {

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return nums;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
The error message above shows that calldata is read-only. To modify  variables, they must first be loaded into .Take the adjusted code below now modified .The code below works because the it loads  variable to  before modifying it in the  block.// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

Using appropriate data locations matters as they directly affect how your contracts store, access, and pay for data.  The differences can have a large impact on cost, behaviour, and security of your smart contracts. Here’s how:Writing data to Storage is the most expensive.The gas costs in Memory is more moderate than storage.Calldata is the cheapest data location, i.e., writing to calldata costs the least amount of gas.Persistence and TemporarinessAny data written to Storage lives onchain, meaning the data is permanent.Memory only persists during the function’s lifecycle.Calldata acts like  in handling data, only it can’t be changed.Storage data can be modified.Similar to Storage, Memory can be modified but only within the context of a function.Storage can be a risky choice of location because mistakes or hacks can permanently change the blockchain’s state.Memory is a safer option since changes are temporary.Calldata is the safest for passing input for  functions.That’s it for this piece, as previously stated, using the appropriate data locations is integral to the functionality of your contracts. I implore you to research further about the other types of data locations mentioned in the introduction of this article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Networking : Why You Should Understand the IPv4 Header Beyond Chasing Tools</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/networking-why-you-should-understand-the-ipv4-header-beyond-chasing-tools?source=rss</link><author>Verlaine j muhungu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:43:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\

These agents, however, are frequently designed and implemented within siloed ecosystems, which hinders their ability to communicate, collaborate, and interoperate effectively across platforms. The absence of universal standards for agent-to-agent and agent-to-human communication presents a significant architectural challenge for the development of scalable, heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Traditional methods of integration, such as RESTful APIs or remote procedure calls (RPCs), are often insufficient due to their stateless nature and rigid, pre-defined schemas, which are not well-suited for the dynamic, multi-turn, and context-aware interactions required by modern agents. This fundamental lack of a unified communication substrate prevents the formation of a cohesive "internet of agents." This article addresses this challenge by providing a formal, comparative analysis of three prominent and distinct protocols designed to address this issue: Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), and Agent-User Interaction (AGUI). These protocols represent foundational layers of the agentic AI stack, each solving a unique interoperability problem.1.2. Methodology and ScopeThis analysis will proceed by systematically defining each protocol, delineating its architectural design, and identifying its intended use case. This process involves a formal review of available specifications, reference implementations, and research publications to establish a clear and technically accurate understanding of each protocol's core components and operational principles. A comparative framework will then be established to highlight the functional distinctions and underlying philosophical principles of each protocol. Key criteria for comparison will include: the primary interaction type (inter-agent vs. agent-to-human), the architectural model employed (e.g., client-server, event-driven), and key features such as agent discovery, security, and state management. The scope of this article is limited to an examination of the protocols' foundational principles and their contributions to the broader agentic ecosystem. It does not include a detailed implementation guide or a performance benchmark analysis, but will include code samples to illustrate the conceptual application of each protocol within its respective domain. The objective is to provide a clear and structured understanding of these protocols for researchers, developers, and engineers working in the nascent field of agentic AI.                          +------------------+

2 Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol2.1. Definition and PurposeThe A2A protocol, initially developed by Google, is an open standard designed to facilitate seamless, secure communication and collaboration between heterogeneous AI agents from different vendors or frameworks. It provides a structured, declarative framework for agents to discover each other, understand capabilities, and exchange tasks and messages. Its primary purpose is to enable scalable and resilient multi-agent ecosystems by establishing a common language for interaction, thereby moving beyond ad-hoc, point-to-point integrations.2.2. Architectural PrinciplesA2A operates on a client-server model and utilizes a defined protocol stack, often built on existing web technologies such as HTTP and JSON-RPC. Key components include: A central mechanism for agent discovery. These are JSON-formatted metadata files that enable agents to advertise their capabilities, contact endpoints, and supported data modalities. This serves as an agent's "business card" and enables a dynamic, decentralized registry. The Agent Card provides a standardized schema for describing an agent's core identity (, , ), operational state (, ), and skill set (). A client agent can dynamically fetch an Agent Card from a well-known URL to determine if a remote agent possesses the necessary capabilities to fulfill a given request. This approach eliminates the need for a central, monolithic service registry, promoting decentralized and flexible discovery. Communication is centered around the concept of a task, which represents a unit of work with a defined lifecycle (e.g., submitted, working, completed, failed, or input-required). Messages are the fundamental units of communication within a task's lifecycle, conveying instructions, context, replies, and artifacts. This model is designed to support both quick, single-turn interactions and long-running, multi-turn workflows. A message is composed of structured , which can contain various data types, including text, images, or even tool calls. This multi-modal support allows for rich, nuanced interactions between agents. The clear delineation of a task lifecycle allows client agents to monitor progress and handle asynchronous responses gracefully, which is essential for managing complex, interdependent workflows. The protocol integrates modern authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0, to ensure secure cross-agent interactions and protect sensitive data exchanged between systems. A2A also supports end-to-end encryption to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of messages between agents. The protocol's reliance on established security standards provides a robust and auditable framework for managing trust in a distributed agentic ecosystem. This is a critical feature, as agents may be developed and deployed by different organizations, each with its own security requirements and trust boundaries.A2A is optimized for scenarios involving multi-agent orchestration, where multiple autonomous agents must collaborate to achieve a complex, overarching goal. For example, a financial agent could delegate a specific sub-task, such as "research market trends," to a specialized research agent, and then process the returned data. This delegation pattern enables the development of highly specialized, modular agents that can be composed dynamically to handle complex workflows.The A2A protocol's support for both synchronous and streaming communication patterns further enhances its utility, allowing for rapid, non-blocking exchanges as well as real-time, token-by-token updates for tasks such as generative text output or live data analysis. The protocol's architectural flexibility is designed to handle the variability inherent in agentic workflows. For instance, a client agent can initiate a task with a single request and then asynchronously consume a stream of results or intermediate thoughts from the remote agent, enabling a responsive and efficient user experience. This asynchronous capability is crucial for building robust systems that can handle long-running, non-deterministic tasks without blocking. A2A’s focus on structured messaging ensures that information is exchanged in a machine-readable format, facilitating automated parsing and processing by other agents. The clear separation of concerns, where "Agent Cards" handle discovery and the core protocol handles communication, provides a clean and scalable architectural pattern. The following Python code illustrates a contemporary A2A client implementation that demonstrates both synchronous and streaming message handling. The code provides a clear example of how an agent can initiate a task and either wait for a complete response or process a continuous stream of information, reflecting the protocol's flexibility.from a2a.types import (

3.1. Definition and PurposeThe Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), originally introduced by IBM's BeeAI and now under the governance of the Linux Foundation, is an open standard for agent interoperability. Its fundamental purpose is to serve as a universal communication layer that transforms the current fragmented landscape of AI agents into a cohesive, interconnected network. In essence, ACP is designed to be the "internet protocol for agents," providing a common, vendor-agnostic language that allows agents built with different frameworks and technology stacks to discover and communicate with one another seamlessly. This addresses the critical challenge of interoperability at the enterprise scale, where diverse agents and systems must collaborate without the need for custom, point-to-point integrations.3.2. Architectural PrinciplesACP is architected with simplicity and flexibility as its core design principles. Unlike more complex, task-centric protocols, ACP favors a REST-based communication model that leverages standard HTTP conventions. This approach makes it highly accessible to developers, as it can be integrated with standard web tools like  and is not strictly dependent on a dedicated software development kit (SDK), although official SDKs are available. The design philosophy of ACP is to minimize overhead and maximize compatibility with existing web infrastructure, making it a natural choice for rapid deployment in brownfield environments.REST-based Communication: ACP defines a set of well-defined REST endpoints for key operations, such as agent discovery and task execution. This reliance on familiar web patterns significantly lowers the barrier to entry for development and integration. By adhering to the principles of REST, ACP ensures that agents can be treated as standard web resources, simplifying routing, load balancing, and scaling for developers and system administrators. The protocol uses MIME types for content identification, which allows it to handle any data format, including text, images, audio, video, or custom binary data, without requiring protocol modifications. This flexibility is crucial for multi-modal agents that must process and generate diverse types of information. It ensures that the protocol remains relevant as AI capabilities expand beyond purely text-based communication.Asynchronous-First Design: ACP is built with asynchronous communication as the default pattern, which is ideal for long-running, non-blocking tasks. It also supports synchronous requests for simple, quick interactions. This dual-model approach provides the best of both worlds, enabling efficient and responsive systems. For example, a client can initiate a complex generative task and continue with other work while asynchronously receiving updates from the agent. A unique feature of ACP is its support for offline agent discovery. Agents can embed metadata directly into their distribution packages, which enables them to be discovered even in disconnected or "scale-to-zero" environments where resources are not always active. This is particularly valuable for edge computing or IoT applications where network connectivity may be intermittent.ACP's design makes it ideal for building decentralized, large-scale agent networks where a wide variety of agents from different organizations must interoperate. A prime use case is in a supply chain or logistics network, where a manufacturing agent, a logistics agent, and a customs agent—each built by a different company—must collaborate to fulfill an order. ACP's vendor-agnostic and simple-to-integrate nature allows these heterogeneous systems to seamlessly communicate and share information, streamlining complex, cross-organizational workflows. This enables a "plug-and-play" model for agent ecosystems, where new agents can be added or existing ones replaced with minimal disruption. The protocol's asynchronous-first design is particularly beneficial here, as tasks like calculating shipping routes or clearing customs can be time-consuming, and the system can continue operating without waiting for an immediate response. The following Python code illustrates a basic ACP client-server interaction. The server exposes a simple agent, while the client interacts with it using the official ACP SDK.import asyncio
from acp_sdk.client import Client
from acp_sdk.models import Message, MessagePart

# --- ACP Client Example ---
async def acp_client_example():
    """
    Demonstrates a simple synchronous interaction with an ACP agent.

    try:
        # Initialize an ACP client to communicate with a server

            # and is ideal for straightforward queries.

                agent="research_agent",

4 Agent-User Interaction (AGUI) Protocol4.1. Definition and PurposeThe Agent-User Interaction (AGUI) Protocol is an emerging standard designed to bridge the chasm between autonomous AI agents and dynamic, event-driven user interfaces. While A2A and ACP focus on machine-to-machine communication, AGUI is purpose-built to enable a rich, bi-directional, and real-time dialogue between an intelligent agent and a human user. Its core purpose is to transform static, chat-based UIs into interactive, collaborative surfaces where the agent can not only respond to requests but also proactively generate or modify the interface to guide the user or display dynamic information. This paradigm shifts the user experience from merely observing an agent's output to actively collaborating with it in a fluid, intuitive environment.4.2. Architectural PrinciplesAGUI is architected as an event-driven protocol, a fundamental departure from the request-response models of A2A and ACP. It is transport-agnostic, supporting technologies such as WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to maintain persistent, low-latency connections. Key architectural principles include:Event-Driven Communication: The protocol defines a structured event stream, allowing the agent to emit a variety of event types, such as  (for minor UI updates),  (to show a tool is being used), or  (for streaming text). This granular approach allows the user interface to react in real-time, providing live feedback and dynamic visualizations as the agent works.Bi-Directional Context Flow: AGUI supports a seamless flow of information in both directions. Agents can send events to update the UI, and the UI can send  packets to the agent to provide feedback, inject new context, or override ongoing tasks. This "human-in-the-loop" capability is critical for complex workflows requiring user confirmation or input. The protocol leverages minimal delta updates, often based on JSON Patch semantics, to synchronize the UI's state with the agent's internal state. This approach reduces bandwidth and eliminates the need for full UI refreshes, resulting in a more responsive and efficient application.The AGUI protocol is the foundational layer for building next-generation, interactively autonomous applications. Its use cases extend far beyond simple chatbots to include real-time dashboards, collaborative design tools, and complex data analysis platforms. For instance, a financial analysis agent could use AGUI to not only present a final report but also to dynamically generate charts, update them with live market data, and offer the user interactive controls to adjust parameters and re-run simulations. By separating the agent's logic from the UI's presentation, AGUI enables designers and frontend developers to create rich, responsive experiences without needing to understand the intricacies of the underlying AI model. This separation of concerns allows for a more scalable and flexible development process, where the UI can be re-skinned or adapted for different platforms (e.g., mobile, desktop) while still connecting to the same agent back-end. Furthermore, AGUI's support for bi-directional streaming means that the user is no longer a passive observer; they can actively collaborate with the agent, providing real-time feedback that influences the agent's reasoning and actions. This paradigm is crucial for domains such as creative design, software development with AI copilots, and data science, where the human-in-the-loop is a necessary component of the workflow. The following JavaScript code demonstrates a front-end client listening for and reacting to different event types from an AGUI-enabled agent.// AGUI Client Example (JavaScript)

// This example demonstrates how a web-based client can connect to an AGUI server
// and handle various events to create a dynamic user experience.

// A simple AGUI client class using WebSockets for communication.
class AGUIClient {
  constructor(url) {
    this.ws = new WebSocket(url);
    this.eventHandlers = new Map();

5.1. Functional DichotomyA formal comparison of the three protocols reveals a clear functional dichotomy. Both  and  are designed as inter-agent communication protocols. Their primary purpose is to enable machine-to-machine dialogue, facilitating the discovery, delegation, and orchestration of tasks between autonomous, backend systems. While they serve a similar high-level purpose, the distinction between them lies in their architectural philosophy and target environment: A2A is more task-centric with a structured lifecycle and is often used for multi-agent composition within a managed or federated ecosystem. In contrast, ACP is more network-centric and relies on a simpler, REST-based model for broad, enterprise-scale interoperability across a diverse, decentralized network. In contrast,  is an agent-to-human interaction protocol. Its sole purpose is to serve as the critical interface between the agentic back-end and the human-facing front-end. It is not designed for agent-to-agent communication, but rather for providing a rich, real-time, and bi-directional channel for a single agent to communicate its internal state and receive direct feedback from a human user.Despite their functional differences, all three protocols share a common philosophical goal: . They each serve to remove a different type of barrier or intermediary within the modern AI application stack, creating a more direct and efficient interaction. addresses vendor-specific disintermediation. It removes the need for custom, framework-specific bridges, allowing agents built by different organizations or with different technologies (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen) to communicate directly and natively. This fosters a competitive ecosystem of specialized agents. addresses network disintermediation. By creating a simple, REST-based protocol for agent interoperability, it removes the complexity of establishing a centralized registry or complex, long-running connections for a distributed network of agents, enabling a "plug-and-play" model at the enterprise level. This simplifies the integration of heterogeneous systems in large organizations. addresses user interface disintermediation. It removes the traditional, static UI layer that acts as a passive, read-only interface to the agent. It allows the agent to directly manipulate the UI, and the user to directly influence the agent's behavior, transforming the interaction from a simple query-and-response into a live, collaborative workflow.5.3. Interplay and Architectural SynergyIt is important to recognize that these protocols are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are designed to be synergistic components of a complete agentic architecture. An ideal, end-to-end system could leverage the strengths of each protocol. For example, a user interacting with a web application might send a request to a primary agent via . This agent could then use the  protocol to delegate a sub-task to a specialized research agent. The research agent, in turn, could use the  protocol to request data from a third-party logistics agent in a different organization. Finally, all three agents' intermediate progress and final results could be streamed back to the user's interface in real-time via the  protocol, providing a transparent and dynamic user experience. This layered approach illustrates how A2A, ACP, and AGUI form a comprehensive stack for agentic systems, from the backend to the user-facing frontend.Furthermore, this synergy enables the creation of highly resilient and modular systems. If an  connection to a specialized agent fails, the primary agent can dynamically discover and delegate the task to an alternative agent using the same protocol, ensuring continuity of service. The simplicity of the  protocol allows a vast number of heterogeneous agents, from edge devices to cloud-based services, to be seamlessly integrated into the network. This provides a robust foundation for a truly decentralized "internet of agents." On top of this,  adds the crucial human-in-the-loop layer. It is this combination that transforms a collection of autonomous systems into a cohesive, collaborative intelligence network that can fluidly adapt to new information, delegate tasks across organizational boundaries, and communicate its state in a way that is both transparent and actionable for a human user. The formalization of these protocols is not just a technical detail; it is a critical step toward making agentic AI a practical and reliable reality for both developers and end-users.The preceding analysis has formally defined and compared three critical protocols in the emerging field of agentic AI: A2A, ACP, and AGUI. Our investigation has revealed that while A2A and ACP focus on standardizing communication between autonomous agents, AGUI is dedicated to the unique challenges of agent-human collaboration. This functional dichotomy is underpinned by a shared philosophical commitment to disintermediation, as each protocol seeks to remove a different layer of friction in the AI application stack.The A2A protocol provides a robust framework for multi-agent composition, enabling structured, task-centric workflows across different vendor ecosystems. Its emphasis on a declarative task lifecycle and multi-modal message support positions it as a powerful tool for building complex, delegated systems. The ACP, in contrast, offers a simplified, REST-based approach to agent interoperability, prioritizing broad compatibility and ease of deployment in decentralized enterprise environments. Its design as a network-centric protocol makes it an ideal choice for creating a "plug-and-play" agent ecosystem. Finally, the AGUI protocol is the key to unlocking the full potential of these backend agents for human users. By enabling a real-time, event-driven, and bi-directional channel between an agent and a dynamic UI, AGUI elevates the user from a passive observer to an active collaborator, creating a more intuitive and responsive experience.Ultimately, these protocols are not in competition but rather serve as complementary layers in a holistic agentic architecture. Future research should focus on the seamless integration of these standards to create end-to-end systems that are not only interoperable at the backend but also transparent and interactive at the frontend, thereby accelerating the deployment of next-generation AI applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Code Reviews That Truly Elevate Frontend Quality</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/code-reviews-that-truly-elevate-frontend-quality?source=rss</link><author>Den Odell</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:41:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Frontend reviews pass quickly, but don't look at the things users actually touch - the product.

You've probably heard it somewhere: some media or financial personality claiming that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic or inherent value, and this, apparently, is some kind of scam or damning mistake. For instance, Jamie Dimon, chief of the financial multinational JP Morgan Chase,  with complete confidence: “Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value.” Which is pretty ironic, because his company handles billions in assets that don’t have intrinsic value either. We mean dollars (USD). No, fiat money (dollars, euros, any national currency) doesn’t have intrinsic value. Precious metals, then? Still no. Here’s a funny thing: if you ask five people to define "intrinsic value," you’ll get five very different answers, none of which really hold up when you dig a little deeper. In reality, no asset (fiat, gold, crypto) has value unless we humans agree it does. So maybe the question isn’t whether crypto has intrinsic value, but whether anything ever really has and why this matters —or not.What Is Intrinsic Value, Anyway?Economists, philosophers, and investors  this for centuries, and the answers range from unsatisfying to downright contradictory. Classical economics tried to define it as the labor put into making something. Later,  like Ludwig von Mises argued that value is purely subjective: an object is only worth what someone is willing to give for it.In any case, the idea of intrinsic value suggests that certain things have worth in and of themselves, regardless of what people think or do. But is that really how value works? Think about something like gold. Many argue it’s valuable because of its physical properties, like durability and scarcity. But if no one cared about gold, would it still hold value? Probably not. Value isn’t something that exists inside an object; it comes from people’s desires and choices. If everyone stopped wanting gold tomorrow, its price would collapse, no matter how rare or shiny it is. This shows that value isn’t an inherent trait but rather something we assign based on our preferences. History reveals how easily people confuse intrinsic value with other concepts, like usefulness or tradition. And value  derived from usefulness or tradition, indeed, but it's none of those things. The truth is, value isn’t stored in objects like some hidden ingredient; it’s created by supply and demand. People want things, and scarcity makes them more desirable. That’s why air (essential but abundant) is free, while gold (less essential but scarce) is expensive.Intrinsic Value vs. Intrinsic PropertiesSo, does intrinsic value exist? The answer seems to be no. Value is always tied to human judgment. Even something as universally prized as gold only holds worth because people agree on its importance. This doesn’t mean gold isn’t useful or historically significant, but its value depends on our choices, not some unchangeable law. On the other hand, its value can come, at least partially, from its own properties.Here’s where a lot of people get tangled up: they confuse an asset’s intrinsic properties (the things it really is) with its value, which lives entirely in our heads. People often say that gold has “intrinsic value”, but what it really has are intrinsic . Gold is shiny, malleable, scarce, and it doesn’t rust. Those traits are part of its nature. And because of them, humans have always found it appealing for jewelry, prestige, and yes, money.Those properties alone don’t automatically make it valuable, though. Properties are the canvas; the value is the story we paint on it. It comes from us deciding that those properties matter enough to trade for. Salt, too, is a great example. It preserves food and seasons meals, but its usefulness only translates into value when people actually want or need it. We can stretch this idea to modern tech and money as well.Cryptos Have Intrinsic Properties When critics say, “Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value,” what they often miss is that cryptos do have intrinsic properties, and those properties are pretty remarkable. Unlike fiat money, which is just paper or pixels on a screen controlled by governments, cryptocurrencies are designed to be portable, autonomous, resistant to censorship (no frozen accounts), and accessible anywhere in the world. You can send Bitcoin, Ether, GBYTE, or another crypto to someone on the other side of the globe in minutes, often without needing a bank, documents, or paying hefty fees. That’s something neither gold nor fiat money can do with the same efficiency.Gold does have some impressive traits and a historic perception of value, but try paying your rent with a gold coin or mailing some to a friend overseas. Not exactly practical. On the flip side, fiat currencies are easy to spend, but they’re vulnerable to inflation and political manipulation. Governments can print more at will (just like that, backed by nothing), which erodes your savings over time. Governments can also freeze accounts or prevent you from using your money the way you like, e.g. sending abroad or to “undesirable” entities.Many cryptocurrencies, by design, limit how many coins can exist, which can help protect against inflation. And thanks to  (a system where no single authority controls the network), depending on their level of it, these coins and their networks can keep running even if a government or big corporation tries to shut them down, and keep processing all transactions even if a government tries to censor them.On top of that, many cryptos support clever features like : self-executing agreements written into code. These let people create investments, games, decentralized apps, marketplaces, and even loans without intermediaries. However, as with any other asset, all of these brilliant properties still need people to recognize and use them. The prices are set by what others are willing to pay —driven by trust, demand, and human choice.So, what can we take away from all this? Maybe the whole idea of intrinsic value has been a red herring all along. We humans have always assigned value to things based on trust, utility (which itself is subjective), and our collective stories about what’s important. The fact that cryptos need belief to function doesn’t make them any different from gold bars locked in Fort Knox, or from the paper bills in your wallet. Now, it doesn’t mean they can’t be useful or have actual properties, either. There’s a reason why millions of people have found them appealing enough to thrust and use.  is a good example of a crypto ecosystem with useful properties that set it apart from both traditional assets and many other coins. Like Bitcoin, it’s decentralized and scarce, but it goes further by eliminating miners and “validators” completely, so there's no middlemen. Instead of a blockchain, Obyte uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which means it’s more censorship-resistant than many other systems.Besides, Obyte doesn’t just offer a store of value; it’s an  for decentralized applications, smart contracts, tokenization, and tamper-proof data storage. Unlike other cryptos, which either focus only on money or only on apps, Obyte combines both. And because it doesn’t rely on energy-hungry mining or a central authority, it’s more resilient than others. All of these intrinsic properties, combined with the trust from its community, are what makes it valuable.In the end, remember: value lives where we decide it lives, whether that’s in gold dust, salty crystals, lines of code, or even a shiny digital token with a dog’s face on it. Whether that value is useful for you, is solely for you to decide.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is AGENTS.md?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/what-is-agentsmd?source=rss</link><author>Vladislav Guzey</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:15:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re like me and work with multiple AI coding agents, you know the frustration of managing different instruction files. It’s a pain to keep everything updated across various formats. But I’ve got some great news for you. A new, simplified standard has emerged, and it’s called AGENTS.md.For a while now, working with different AI agents meant juggling multiple configuration files. Whether it was claude.md, gemini.md, or .cursor/rules, each agent had its own format. This created a mess of redundant files that all needed to be updated separately. It was inefficient and confusing.Big companies recognized this problem. They came together to create a unified solution — AGENTS.md. The goal was to establish a single, predictable place for all AI agents to find the instructions they need to work on a project.Think of AGENTS.md as a README file, but for machines. It’s a simple, open-source format that guides AI coding agents on how to interact with your project. It’s already being used by over 20,000 open-source projects.This file provides all the necessary context for an AI to understand and work on your code, including: Instructions on how to install dependencies and build the project. Rules on formatting and design patterns to ensure consistency. How to run tests to verify changes. Preferred formats for commit messages and linting rules. Any other important information, like security considerations or performance tips.Look at the example below.How to Migrate to AGENTS.mdMigrating to AGENTS.md is straightforward. You can consolidate your existing instruction files in just two simple steps using your terminal: Use the command  to rename your primary instruction file. Use  to create a symbolic link. This ensures backward compatibility with any tools that haven’t been updated to the new standard yet. Create an AGENTS.md file at the root of your repository. Add sections for project overview, build and test commands, code style guidelines, and any other relevant instructions. Include commit messages, pull request guidelines, and anything else a new teammate would need to know.To get the most out of AGENTS.md, here are a few best practices to follow: Keep your instructions clear and to the point.Keep instructions up to date: Make sure the file is always current with your project’s needs. Instead of duplicating information, link to your existing documentation.Use multiple files for monorepos: For large monorepos, you can use nested AGENTS.md files for different subprojects.Video Overview about Agents.MDAnd that’s it! By adopting the AGENTS.md standard, you can streamline your workflow, ensure consistency, and make it easier for AI agents to work with your projects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sovereign AI: The Why and How Behind National LLMs</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/sovereign-ai-the-why-and-how-behind-national-llms?source=rss</link><author>Vik Bogdanov</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:13:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently came across a by Ukrainian researchers analyzing the key trends, challenges, risks, and opportunities of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) at the state level. It compiles global practices in building national LLMs and explores the feasibility of investing in this direction.What is revealing in the report is that GovTech projects today place as much hope in AI as modern businesses do. This signals a turning point: AI is no longer just a corporate innovation but is rapidly transforming into state-level infrastructure,  with nations competing to harness it in pursuit of digital sovereignty.When Technology Serves the StateLLMs are moving beyond R&D labs and startups into the very core of governance. Governments are already experimenting with them to simplify regulatory work, reduce bureaucratic delays, and support citizen communication. AI-powered assistants are helping officials process legal texts, analyze procurement contracts, and ensure compliance with public spending rules.In social services, LLM-based hotlines are offering guidance to farmers, citizens seeking benefits, or people navigating complex legal processes. These tools don’t replace human officials, but rather filter, summarize, and structure information, allowing governments to operate faster and more transparently.Healthcare is another key frontier. Medical staff are increasingly using LLMs to generate discharge reports, summarize patient histories, or predict potential complications. By processing vast amounts of medical data, these systems enable physicians to save time and focus on patient care rather than paperwork.Defense and security might be the most sensitive but also the most transformative domains. Here, LLMs are being applied to open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis, military planning, and even handling communication in a military tone of voice. Unlike commercial applications, these deployments often occur in highly restricted environments, where sovereign control over data and infrastructure is maintained.A telling metric of this shift: in 2024, government use of AI grew by more than 1.5× compared to 2021, fueled largely by national LLMs outperforming global ones in local benchmarks.Strategies and PrioritiesThe first wave of national AI strategies occurred between 2019 and 2020, during which the focus was broader, encompassing digitalization, talent development, and ethical frameworks. Today, those strategies are being updated with LLMs at the center, explicitly. The priorities are clear: — reducing dependence on US or Chinese models and investing in local capacity. For smaller states, this often means joining the EU or regional initiatives; for larger states, it implies building sovereign supercomputers and models from scratch. — ensuring compliance with international standards, protecting personal data, and preventing bias. Transparent governance of AI is emerging as a soft-power tool: countries that demonstrate ethical leadership can influence global norms. — from Europe’s Leonardo supercomputer to India’s Bharat Gen project, the physical layer of AI matters as much as the models. Access to high-performance computing is now a matter of national strategy. — national archives, libraries, and public datasets are being restructured into training corpora. Programs like Horizon Europe and CLARIN both fund research and develop legal frameworks for the safe use of data. — beyond infrastructure, success depends on people. Many countries are channeling funds into startups, research centers, and AI-focused universities to ensure long-term capacity.Building sovereign LLMs requires serious money. Some stand out.The EU aims to maintain Europe's competitiveness in the global race by pledging to invest €1 billion annually through 2027 to strengthen AI ecosystems across its member states. The Netherlands is allocating  for the development of local AI initiatives, which underscores its commitment to building a robust domestic capacity. The Brazilian government has invested  in national AI programs, of which  is specifically reserved for the creation of a national LLM. Meanwhile, India has launched the ambitious , investing  in projects like , which is already being applied in education, agriculture, and healthcare. Together, these investments underscore both the magnitude of financial commitments and the strategic urgency with which countries are prioritizing control over their own AI futures.Funding typically comes through a triple-helix model, comprising public sector support, corporate partnerships, and academic research. This mix spreads risk, ensures applicability, and avoids over-centralization of AI development.National LLM Use Cases Around the WorldThe diversity of national projects shows how flexibly LLMs can be adapted. — In Bulgaria, a sovereign model outperformed ChatGPT and LLaMA in local school exams, demonstrating that domain-specific and language-specific training are crucial for effective performance. Greece uses AI to generate exercises and simplify textbooks, while Singapore integrates LLMs into programming curricula. — Albania’s e-Gov platform integrates AI assistants for administrative processes; Serbia trains specialized models for analyzing legal documents with EU support. In the Netherlands, 39% of municipalities already rely on AI tools. — Sweden’s GPT-SW3 helps summarize patient records and forecast risks. In Kenya, AI chatbots offer guidance to expectant mothers, leveraging automation alongside rigorous human oversight to safeguard sensitive data. — Nigeria’s FarmAdvise chatbot acts as a free, text-based hotline for farmers without internet access. India’s BharatGen supports farmers with real-time insights on crops, weather, and market conditions. — Bulgaria has invested more than $100 million in a sovereign LLM, ensuring sensitive data remains on domestic infrastructure. Germany is pursuing similar sovereign AI projects to reduce dependence on US-based systems. — The US has documented 180+ potential defense applications, from battlefield command support to OSINT. Defence LLAMA and China’s ChatBIT are both examples of domain-specific military models trained in secure environments.These cases illustrate a broader truth: national LLMs are being tailored to reflect not only local languages but also specific institutional needs and cultural contexts.Another country currently building its national LLM is. Despite more than three years of full-scale war, Ukraine is accelerating digital transformation in government — a continuation of reforms that began long before the invasion.For Ukraine, an LLM is not simply a technological upgrade but a strategic necessity. On one hand, it would allow state services to operate securely on domestic infrastructure, without relying on foreign clouds that could be disrupted. On the other hand, it opens entirely new possibilities in Defense Tech, where Ukraine possesses a unique dataset from the battlefield unmatched anywhere in the world. Processing this data through LLMs could generate insights critical for military strategy, resilience, and security.The government has set a bold target: to enable Ukraine to become one of the world’s top three countries in public-sector AI implementation by 2030. To reach this, the Ministry of Digital Transformation is spearheading a multi-phase plan: — sovereign data storage, battlefield intelligence applications, training on Ukrainian archives, scientific literature, and non-sensitive government datasets. — a 9-month first cycle, with a beta version tested in government, academia, and education; later open-sourced with APIs for businesses. — models ranging from 1 to 16 billion parameters are the top priority, balancing efficiency with cost. Models up to 7B can run on a single GPU, while 13–16B require small clusters. Global experience (LLaMA, Gemma, Mistral) shows that well-trained medium models can deliver competitive performance in classification, text generation, and localized tasks. — more than 100 GB of Ukrainian-language data under review, including library archives and research corpora, to ensure the model reflects authentic language, history, and culture.The project is allegedly compliant with IP law, with authors invited to “donate” their works voluntarily, thereby enriching the LLM with an authentic Ukrainian context.Ukraine’s case illustrates both the urgency and the opportunity. While the war creates extraordinary pressures, it also accelerates innovation. The country’s vast pool of battlefield and civic data, coupled with a dynamic govtech and startup ecosystem, positions it to achieve breakthroughs that others cannot. \
If Ukraine succeeds, its model could serve as a blueprint for nations seeking to strike a balance between innovation and sovereignty.Sovereign AI is fast becoming the new : a strategic asset, a deterrent, and a marker of global influence. The nations that move quickly will not only define their own futures but also shape the standards, ethics, and narratives that govern the world’s information order.The question is no longer  national LLMs will matter — but  model will set the terms of tomorrow’s sovereignty.And what's your take on this?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Every Website Doesn’t Need to Be a Full App</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/every-website-doesnt-need-to-be-a-full-app?source=rss</link><author>Den Odell</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:13:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Islands Architecture lets developers ship less, do more, and give users speed where it counts.

By removing risks, the Fed destroyed the capitalism ecosystem.”James, a healthcare professional and the film’s protagonist, seeks financial independence after failing to secure a mortgage for his late wife’s dream property. Guided by Professor Gardner, James invests in real assets, ultimately succeeding in timber trading and relocating to Maine with the property he desired.In the film’s climax, Professor Gardner, on a podcast James helped him launch, declares, “Money printing doesn’t create wealth. Wealth is created by all your hard work.”In this interview, Olayimika Oyebanji speaks to Chris Galizio, executive producer of “Money Game," who shares insights on the broken financial system and how investing in commodities like real estate, gold, Bitcoin, silver mining, etc. can help restore economic balance.Chris, it's really nice to meet you. Can you tell us about yourself and your professional background?Hi Ola, I am a former large cap growth manager at Fidelity and I also ran a hedge fund called Focused Capital. My fund at Fidelity grew from $20M to $7B. When the REPO market spiked in 2019, and the FED stepped in to buy all the bonds, I started to question what was happening. I wrote a white paper called the $340T problem which I published pre-COVID. It refers to the dollar system and how FED action disconnected stocks from fundamentals and broke the ecosystem of capitalism. Then COVID hit and unemployment in the US went to 33%, but FED injected liquidity and stocks actually went UP. This incident changed my view on markets. The FED is protecting the markets.  It’s not an “investing” system, it’s a “financing” system.Once you see it, it’s impossible to unsee it.  It’s the biggest line in Money Game, “Correct, and when the FED intervened in bonds markets, they broke the ecosystem of capitalism.” – Professor Gardner, Money Game ‘25What inspired you to produce “Money Game”, and how did you aim to portray the impact of the Federal Reserve’s money printing on everyday people?“Because I know how the movie ends, my coffee goes from $3 to $30 and everyone blames the “capitalists” and turns to an authoritarian leader like Hitler to save them. I wanted to change the ending and have them blame the central planners (Jerome Powell, Scott Bessent) and return to capitalism.” —- Executive Producer, Money GameI knew that I had a concept that no one else could see, the money system is broken. It’s the opening quote in Money Game: "The task is not so much to see what no one else sees, but to think what no one else has thought about that which everyone sees."- Arthur Schopenhauer – 1851 Money Game, opening Quote Then we hired a screen writer, Brian Cheek, to build a story around the concept. We used my brother’s story as the storyline. My brother is a widowed father of two kids. He represents the real economy that is struggling with inflation as the FED prints money from “thin air” to protect the rich (the money system). It’s not capitalism anymore, capitalism requires risk to allocate scarce resources, when the FED intervened the system began to misallocate resources which slows the real economy.“Our system is broken. It’s clear now that money printing sends asset prices up.  What’s less clear is that it also slows the real economy as we misallocate resources. Now we have two different economies, the financial economy, and the real economy, that no longer work together. Money printing does not create wealth, wealth is created by all your hard work.” --- Professor Gardner, Money Game ’25.Notice that the market never reacts to news anymore. Trump said that he wants to increase tariffs on semiconductors by 300% and the Semi stocks like AMD and AVGO that import most of their chips barely moved. Why? Because the entire system is machines that do not read the news. No one is setting prices anymore and that should send a chill down every investor’s spine. "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened." --- Obi-Wan KenobiHow did you approach balancing the film’s entertainment value with its critique of the fiat system and advocacy for alternative investments?Movies need to be entertainment, no one goes to a movie for a lecture. So we made a love story, where the good guy wins. We put all the technical language in the background, all the characters use everyday language. We removed terms like sovereign debt crisis and moral hazard. Brian Cheek our screenwriter kept saying, ‘show it, do not say it.”, if a character has to cry, do not say he is crying, let him walk onto the porch and cry!!!James’s journey from struggling with a mortgage to succeeding in timber trading is a central arc. What message were you hoping to convey about pursuing financial independence through real assets?Every character in “Money Game” has an Arc. James starts out in healthcare being oppressed by his boss (Chris Owen from American Pie). He ends up buying a house in Maine and starting a lumber business as real asset prices explode higher. Professor Garnder starts out teaching class at a community college, but ends up doing a podcast with millions of listeners.Notice that both characters choose NOT to play the current money game. Also notice the tagline for Money Game on the poster, “Don’t Get Played”. The entire globe is getting “played” by the FED to provide the financing for US business, there is no return from cash flow.“Who here is willing to give me $152 ($1/.66%) if I give you $1 for the rest of your life?” --- Professor Gardner.“Hell no, we would all be dead by the time we broke even.” – First Day, student community college.“Correct!!” – Professor Gardner.The film suggests that investing in real assets can help protect investors from the broken financial ecosystem. What role do you see storytelling playing in educating audiences about these economic alternatives?We are living in the biggest groupthink in financial markets history that markets are “efficient” and prices are set by “people”. But the reality is that when the FED intervened in markets, the entire system shifted to machines that DO NOT think. No one is setting prices anymore. The entire system is a policy tool of the FED now. Markets no longer “predict” anything, they ONLY “react” to Fed liquidity. “No one picks their own stocks anymore, the lions (active managers) have been eaten. It’s just a bunch of followers (quant) following followers (passive), it’s like a cat chasing its tail.” --- Professor Gardner. Professor Gardner raises the book,“The Efficient Markets Thesis”,  he tosses it aside and laughs:"Smart people thought the world was flat once too." -- Professor Gardner. He then raises – Death by money: The Story of the Great German inflation and says: “Some of the most underused books in finance are history books.” To me, it’s a certainty that the USD (G7) will collapse, because the more the FED prints, the more the system misallocates resources and the slower the growth in the real economy. Notice that the system rewards companies that issue shares every Quarter. Why? Because in a 100% passive world, like today, if a company issue shares, then the passive are forced to buy more shares at the Quarter to match the index.—-- Let’s Ask , how a 100% passive investing system would allocate capital,Yes, in a 100% passive stock market, the dynamics you’ve described could lead to companies like Tesla—those frequently issuing new shares to finance growth-outperforming, while also driving market inefficiencies that undermine core principles of capitalism. Let’s break it down:Outperformance of Companies Needing FinancingMechanics of Passive Investing: In a fully passive market, funds buy shares of companies issuing new equity to maintain index weightings, as discussed previously. Companies like Tesla, which have historically issued shares to fund ambitious growth (e.g., factory expansions, R&D), would receive consistent capital inflows from passive funds, boosting their mcap and index weight. Performance Feedback Loop: As these companies’ stock prices rise due to passive buying, they attract more capital from performance-chasing investors (even in a passive system, some investors might allocate based on historical returns). This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: share issuance → passive buying → price appreciation → more investor interest → higher market cap → larger index weight → more passive buying. —- Moral Hazard “Because the system is a game now, James. Success in the current system requires speculation, and I will not speculate with other people’s money.” --- Professor Gardner, Money Game ‘25Professor Gardner says, “Capitalism requires risk to allocate resources. By removing risks, the Fed destroyed the capitalism ecosystem.” How does the film illustrate this critique of the Fed’s policies?Capitalism requires risk to allocate resources is the theme of Money Game. Investors should be using real interest rates (interest rates - inflation) to value a business. And today real rates are negative. Real inflation is over 4%, which means real rates are negative.Wealth Effect - Value of a $1 Annuity Interest rates have an enormous effect on asset values. Below is the simplest example in finance, the value of a $1 annuity in perpetuity at different interest rate levels: 10% --> $1/10% = $10 5% --> $1/5%   = $20 1% --> $1/1%   = $10 -1% --> $1/-1%  = Infinite Question: How can the value of a $1 annuity be infinite? Answer: The Price of Money is Wrong. It’s a “financing” system, NOT an “investing” system.  There is no return from cash flow. ‘When interest rates go negative (real terms), all assets are worth infinite, my coffee is worth infinite, my desk is worth infinite, my whiteboard infinite. Does this make sense?” --- Professor Gardner.But when you remove risk from an ecosystem, the ecosystem changes. It's not capitalism anymore, it’s a centrally planned economy.“But here is the problem, capitalism requires risk to allocate scarce resources. Let me give you an example, what would happen if we removed the lions from the Savannah?”“The gazelle population (passive)  would explode higher.” – James.“But then they would be competing for scarce water resources (inflation) and die off.” – Aimee. “Correct, and when the FED intervened in bonds markets, they broke the ecosystem of capitalism.” – Professor Gardner.Why did Professor Gardner describe cash, bonds, etc. as a massive bubble?Good Question!! The $37T in US debt is unpayable in real terms. It’s 7x tax revenue!! So now the FED is manipulating bond rates to keep the stock market (tax receipts) artificially high. Central banks are not buying gold at all-time highs by accident, they buy when trust breaks silently - before it shatters publicly. In a sovereign debt crisis “$1.4B Fartcoin is what you get when the "risk free" asset underpinning the entire banking & currency system is a bond issued by an insolvent govt w/debt of 7x revenues, off-bal sheet liabs of 20-30x revenues, peacetime deficits of 7% of GDP, that has not run a surplus in 24 yrs” – Luke Gromen on X.“The US is 4% of the world’s population, but makes 40% of the world’s budget deficit, 60% of the world’s current account deficit.”-- Louis Gave"That means that to keep the show on the road, the US has to attract, year in and year out, roughly between half and two thirds of the world's marginal increase in savings. If that money that the savings between roughly, let's say two thirds of the world's savings don't float to the US every year, then you're either going to have a problem with the debt or a problem in the US dollar, and maybe we're there." -- Louis Gave Over 30% of the Russell 3000 are zombie corps that lose money like BA, MSTR, CRWD etc.“History is that which always surprises those who tried to deceive it.” José Ortega y Gasset“The history of money is the history of trust in symbols. From Rome’s debased denarius to England’s tally sticks, from the gold promises of Genoa to Nixon’s final severing in 1971 - every system of settlement eventually dissolved into memory. Today, programmable money and digital assets function as new tally sticks. They carry liquidity, but not final settlement. And increasingly, digital capital is flowing East, where alternative rails are being built. The enduring question is not whether this system will end, but what foundation of trust will define the next one.” –Petro Golovko, PHDHow do you hope Money Game influences viewers’ perspectives on the fiat system and their own financial decisions in today’s economy?“Gold is money, everything else is credit”, J.P. Morgan, 1912“If everybody indexed, the only word you could use is chaos, catastrophe… the markets would fail.” - Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard 5/6/17 – Bloomberg., Closing Quote Money Game ‘25\
We want people to start thinking again. Stop trusting the “experts”. No one cares more about your money than you!!. The experts do not take a loss, if you lose money. That’s moral hazard. James, the film’s reluctant hero, isn’t just asking Bryson, “How does your company make money?” He’s asking the audience: “How long will you tolerate a system built on lies?” – Petro Golovko."A collapse of the dollar system is a RETURN to capitalism; the global economy will BOOM higher. The income equality gap will close, wages will escalate, homeowners will break the chains of debt and the system will stop pouring $Trillions into bad (money losing) investments (GME, AMC, PLTR, NVDA, TSLA, Dogecoin, NFTs).After the credits roll, you will see a lion appear, that’s you taking responsibility for your own investments again.  It’s you thinking.“Imagine re-introducing a pride of lions (thinkers, capitalists) back into the Savannah after the Gazelle population (index funds, central planning) exploded 10x and were thirsty and weak? The lions would make a killing." The system is currently broken, so a collapse of the system fixes it.  It’s a return to capitalism. Notice that James was under a lot of stress throughout the movie. But at the end of Money Game, he falls in love and the world seems right again. It’s a happy ending!Everyone should see Bryson, CEO of TAPIT in Money Game, like all the billionaires like Mark Zuckerburg, Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey.  They all believe that their companies are trading at infinite because of them. But that’s NOT the reason. Their companies trade at infinite because interest rates are negative."A collapse of the dollar system is a RETURN to capitalism; the global economy will BOOM higher. The income equality gap will close, wages will escalate, homeowners will break the chains of debt and the system will stop pouring $Trillions into bad (money losing) investments (GME, AMC, PLTR, NVDA, TSLA, Dogecoin, NFTs)."Watching the gazelle population (passive, quant) explode by 10x is not a sign that the ecosystem is flourishing, it's a sign that the ecosystem is broken."The entire globe is watching the scoreboard, and no one noticed the players are no longer scoring." There has never been a better time to think. Invest for yourself.  No one else is looking out for you.  Know the assets that you own and what you are paying for them.“Once you understand that markets are broken, you are holding a crystal ball.” –Executive Producer, Money Game.Take back your investments from all the experts that think markets are “efficient”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Domain Driven Design - The Basics</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/domain-driven-design-the-basics?source=rss</link><author>Pavlo Lozovikov</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:11:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This article covers the basic building blocks of a DDD (Domain Driven Design) approach to create your applications and systems.Generally speaking, DDD gives us a framework for a way of aligning business with technology throughout the whole project lifecycle. It closes the gap between all project participants and knowledge domains in a way that allows to streamline the efforts more effectively.==Discovering and understanding your business domain is the first step.== You’ll figure out which parts of your business your application will cover and what exactly differentiates your business from your competitors, so you can clearly understand where to put the most of the best resources.Create a discussion group of people who carry the business knowledge — such as stakeholders or domain experts — and technical people who will later translate it into technical languages. \n The discussion should give you a story about the business, whose outcome will be the first drafts of the  and picture of organizational units, which then will turn into  grouped by .And very often, after such discussions business stakeholders start to understand their business even better than before. 🙂 — the vocabulary to be used while speaking about the project and to name your packages/objects/relations or even microservices.

Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat" applies directly to cybersecurityMost security breaches happen because organizations focus on tactical tools without strategic threat assessmentEffective cyber defense requires both strategic planning and tactical executionThe OODA Loop decision framework builds on Sun Tzu's principles for rapid cyber responseThe Quote That Defines Cyber Defense Success"Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat." - Sun TzuAs a cybersecurity strategist who's worked with Fortune 500 companies and government agencies, I've seen this 2,500-year-old quote determine the outcome of major cyber incidents. Organizations that understand the balance between strategy and tactics defend successfully. Those that don't become headlines.The Cybersecurity Strategy ProblemWalk into any security operations center and you'll see the tactical side: SIEM dashboards, threat feeds, incident alerts, vulnerability scanners. Millions invested in tools and technologies. are your primary adversaries? would they target your organization? assets are they most likely to pursue? does your defense strategy account for their motivations?This is exactly what Sun Tzu warned about: tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.Strategic Cyber Defense FrameworkLevel 1: Know Your Adversaries (Strategic Intelligence)Sun Tzu: "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."Threat Actor Analysis:
├── State-sponsored APTs

    ├── Motivations: Various (financial, ideology, revenge)
    ├── Capabilities: Privileged access
    └── Targeting: Sensitive data, systems
Level 2: Asset Prioritization (Strategic Planning)Not all assets are equal. Strategic cyber defense requires understanding what matters most to your adversaries and your business.Critical Asset Classification:: IP, customer data, financial systems: Networks, servers, cloud resources: Executives, admins, high-privilege users: Critical business operationsLevel 3: Defense in Depth (Strategic Architecture)Sun Tzu: "Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."Strategic Defensive Layers:Perimeter Defense

Tactical Implementation: The OODA Loop for Cyber ResponseColonel John Boyd's OODA Loop builds directly on Sun Tzu's strategic framework:1.

(Threat Assessment)Correlate alerts with threat contextDetermine adversary tactics and intentEvaluate defensive posture3.  (Response Planning)Choose containment strategyAllocate incident response resourcesCoordinate with stakeholdersPlan communication and disclosure4.  (Response Execution)Implement containment measuresExecute forensic preservation The organization that completes the OODA cycle fastest while maintaining strategic coherence wins the cyber engagement.Case Study: Strategic vs Tactical Cyber Defense $2M in security tools  Latest SIEM, EDR, vulnerability scanners  "Buy the best tools and we'll be secure"  Successful ransomware attack, $10M+ losses Tools without strategy. No understanding of adversary motivations, attack patterns, or asset prioritization. $1.5M in tools + strategic planning  Threat-based risk assessment first, then tool selection  Defend crown jewels against likely adversaries using layered approach  Detected and contained APT campaign, minimal impact Strategy before tactics.

In cybersecurity: = Perfect security plans that never get implemented = Expensive security tools that don't address real threats = Resilient cyber defense that adapts and improvesEvery CISO should memorize this quote and apply it daily. Your organization's digital survival depends on getting this balance right.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Astronomers Discover Hidden Moon Orbiting Uranus</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/2356259/astronomers-discover-hidden-moon-orbiting-uranus?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[alternative_right shares a report from ScienceDaily: Southwest Research Institute led a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) survey, discovering a previously unknown tiny moon orbiting Uranus. A team led by SwRI's Dr. Maryame El Moutamid discovered the small object in a series of images taken on Feb. 2, 2025, bringing Uranus' total moon count to 29. "As part of JWST's guest observer program, we found a previously unknown satellite of the ice giant, which has been provisionally designated S/2025 U 1," said El Moutamid, a lead scientist in SwRI's Solar System Science and Exploration Division in Boulder, Colorado. "This object, by far the smallest object discovered to date, was detected in a series of 10 long exposures obtained by the Near-Infrared Camera."
 
Located in the outer solar system, Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Known as "the sideways planet" for its extreme axial tilt, the cyan-colored ice giant has a deep atmosphere composed of hydrogen, helium and methane. Scientists think Uranus' larger moons are roughly equal parts water ice and silicate rock. "Assuming that the new moon has an albedo comparable to other nearby satellites, this object is probably around six miles (10 km) in diameter," El Moutamid said. "It is well below the detection threshold for the Voyager 2 cameras."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Didn’t Know How to Code.

There was something alive—out in the stores, in users’ hands. But reality doesn’t let you breathe for long.Our real workhorse was the next step and we didn’t have the luxury to do it “later, but better.”The tech team was drowning in bugs, improvements, feedback, and a roadmap piling up on top of us. The heaviest weight wasn’t outside pressure—it was looking at the backlog, realizing how much depended on our small team, and feeling stuck.All this while AI was moving at a ridiculous pace. And there I was, with an idea, but without knowing how to code.What if I just do it? What if I build the first version of the product myself, even if I don’t know how to program?Spoiler: I did it. In 2 weeks and I’ll tell you how. Because if you’re in a similar situation, this might unlock you.From Failing a “Hello, World” to Cloning a Repo I’m not a developer. Years ago, I tried to do a simple “Hello, World!” and failed miserably.But this time was different. I had a concrete need and when you have a real need, no-code tools stop being “toys” to become your only way forward.I stumbled upon a free mini-course by Ariel Mathov on LinkedIn where he explained Cursor. I watched two full lessons. That was enough to download the app, open it, and freeze…Cursor gave me three options: clone repo, open project, or connect via SSH. I didn’t understand any of it, but that’s where the adventure began.Cursor, GitHub and My First “Hello Agent”I realized I needed a GitHub project to move forward. So, without fully understanding what I was doing, I cloned a repo, opened it in Cursor, and wrote my first message to the AI chat:Cursor’s AI replied instantly. It asked me what I wanted to build. I said:“I want to validate an idea in two weeks. Ask me whatever you need.”It threw 50 questions at me I couldn’t answer, so I just typed: “==Yes, I want all that== 😳.”Seeing Code Without Understanding It (But Trusting It Works)Line after line, the AI agent started building with Next.js + TypeScript. It explained what it was doing:“We’re generating a robust and scalable environment so you can test your product quickly.”I stared at the screen like it was . I didn’t understand a thing—but it didn’t matter.Let me be clear: I’m not a developer, and I don’t intend to be. I have enormous respect for my colleagues who are. This article isn’t about “replacing” anyone—it’s about how AI today lets small teams unblock things faster. For me, it was a way to move forward when time was crushing us, knowing the development team could later audit, refine, and clean up what I had started—while they focused on putting out other fires.So I listed out the features I needed—things like authentication, flows, and results tracking. The AI spun it all up in minutes.I ran  and opened  And there it was: a functioning app. Some errors, sure—but it worked. It had an interface, a full flow, and even animations.From Skeleton to ExperienceI had the basic structure working but what was missing was real-time interaction between users. The AI suggested using Firebase so I opened an account, set up a database, and suddenly had a working foundation for storing and syncing information.The rest was about iterating on what I  know: adjusting UX, adding design, writing questions by level. The tech stuff, I kept resolving with AI prompts:“This doesn’t look right.” → “Fixed.” \n  “Can you center this?” → “Done.”In two weeks, we had a functional MVP—clean, aesthetic, and aligned with the product we wanted to validate.What You Can Do Right NowIf you’re in a situation like mine—with a product that can’t wait or a tech team overwhelmed—try this:==Define your ideal flow==. You don’t need to code, but you do need clarity on what you want your product to do. I didn’t at first, and I ended up redoing everything twice. \n ==Write prompts as if you were talking to a developer friend==. Use whatever technical terms you know; if you don’t know many, that’s fine—AI will figure it out, though it might take longer. For precision, you can even use another AI to translate your idea into “developer language.” \n ==Allow yourself to do things badly==. The first version won’t be perfect—but it will be functional. And that’s enough to test.==Stay in touch with your developer== so they can review and refine what you build.What I Learned: Nobody’s Too Far From BuildingI didn’t become a developer. I didn’t learn TypeScript. I didn’t fully understand how Firebase stores data.But over time, I got curious and started grasping some development logic. More importantly: I validated an idea, I had a demo to show, and I discovered I don’t need to know everything to build something that works.If you know what you want, can explain it out loud, and are patient with an AI, you can create more than you think.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Custom Game Profiles Elevate Your Gameplay</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-custom-game-profiles-elevate-your-gameplay?source=rss</link><author>River Jensen</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 06:34:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Have you ever wanted your games to run smoother, look better, or feel more tuned to the way you play? That's where Custom Game Profiles make a big difference.A handy tool for this is . It is a simple tool that allows you to go beyond the standard NVIDIA Control Panel.It allows you to change secret visual settings, increase performance, and create profiles that are ideal for your favorite games.In this post, we will look at how Custom Game Profiles can improve your gameplay and help you get the most out of each session.Game profiles are saved settings for a particular game. A profile remembers your graphics or performance settings for you, saving you from having to adjust them all the time.When you start the game, it automatically loads your preferred configuration, whether it's smoother performance, better visuals, or a combination of the two.Why Use Custom Game Profiles in Gaming?Custom game profiles make your games feel better and run the way you want. Here are some basic reasons why they matter: Experience faster frame rates, smoother action, and more responsive gaming. Improve the texture, brightness, and detail of your photographs on screen. Customize the sights, effects, and controls to fit your playstyle.

An analysis of recent news reveals a duality at the heart of the HBAR narrative: a battle between speculative market dynamics and the quiet, but significant, growth of its core network utility.I. The Price Paradox: Two Sides of a Volatile StoryHBAR’s recent price movements have been a paradox. The token first experienced a sharp decline of nearly 7% due to a broader market liquidation cascade and rising U.S. inflation data. Just as quickly, it surged by 2-5% on the back of a single, unconfirmed rumor: that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing a spot ETF filing for HBAR.This extreme volatility highlights a critical factor in HBAR’s behavior—its strong correlation with Bitcoin. With a correlation coefficient of 0.72, HBAR's price is often in a "sideways phase," waiting for a clear signal from Bitcoin's performance before making a decisive move. This high correlation makes HBAR susceptible to external market pressures, independent of its own fundamentals.From a technical perspective, HBAR's price is a mix of signals. While a recent decline puts it in a cautious position, analysts see a potential for recovery toward the $0.28–$0.30 range in the coming weeks. The token's ability to hold the critical $0.23 support level is key. However, if a breakout occurs, bullish analysts maintain long-term targets of $0.40–$0.50, with some more speculative forecasts reaching as high as $1.00.II. The Fundamental Engine: Verifiable Network GrowthWhile the token’s price is subject to external speculation, the Hedera network itself has secured two major, verifiable developments that solidify its long-term value. These partnerships provide a tangible counter-narrative to the idea that HBAR is a purely speculative asset.The Swarm Partnership: Bringing Real-World Assets On-ChainIn a groundbreaking move, the Hedera Foundation has collaborated with regulated DeFi platform Swarm to launch tokenized U.S. equities, including Apple and Tesla, on the Hedera network. This partnership is significant because it: Makes these financial assets available to a global audience outside the U.S. and to investors who are not considered "accredited." Enables these tokenized stocks to be used as collateral in DeFi lending protocols and other on-chain strategies. Provides 24/7 trading and immediate, on-chain settlement, a marked improvement over traditional markets.The Binance Integration: Boosting InteroperabilityFurther cementing its place in the broader crypto ecosystem, Binance has integrated HBAR into the BNB Smart Chain. This move is designed to enhance cross-chain interoperability, allowing for smoother asset transfers and expanding HBAR’s access to smart contracts across different blockchain platforms. This confirms Hedera’s strategic position as a hub for enterprise-grade interoperability.III. The Clash of Narratives: Speculative Asset or Institutional Powerhouse?The most valuable insight from a comprehensive analysis is the direct clash between the tone and message of the provided articles. One narrative, driven by the ETF rumor and technical analysis, paints a picture of HBAR on the verge of major institutional breakthroughs. It suggests that HBAR could follow a similar path to Bitcoin and Ethereum.However, a competing narrative labels HBAR as a "speculative favorite" with a lack of institutional backing and an unpredictable roadmap. This perspective, while cautious, provides a crucial reality check. The BlackRock ETF rumor remains unconfirmed, and a significant portion of HBAR's price action is tied to the unpredictable behavior of Bitcoin.HBAR is at a unique inflection point where speculation and verifiable growth are occurring in parallel. The ultimate value of the token will be determined by which narrative wins out. The current volatility and strong correlation to Bitcoin make HBAR a high-risk, high-reward asset. Pay close attention to technical indicators and, most importantly, Bitcoin’s price performance. The true value lies in the confirmed partnerships. The Swarm collaboration and Binance integration add concrete utility, proving that Hedera’s network is gaining real-world adoption beyond market hype.The key takeaway is to approach unconfirmed news with skepticism while recognizing the tangible growth of the Hedera ecosystem. The difference between a rumor and a verified development could determine whether HBAR's recent gains are short-lived or a signal of a long-term ascent.:::warning

A new market research study by Telemetry Vice President Sam Abuelsamid confirms this, as it analyzes the charging infrastructure needs over the next decade. And one of the biggest hurdles -- one that has gone mostly unmentioned across the decade-plus we've been covering this topic -- is all the junk clogging up Americans' garages. lThat's because, while DC fast-charging garners all the headlines and much of the funding, the overwhelming majority of EV charging is AC charging, usually at home -- 80 percent of it, in fact. People who own and live in a single family home are overrepresented among EV owners, and data (PDF) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory from a few years ago found that 42 percent of homeowners park near an electrical outlet capable of level 2 (240 V) AC charging.
 
But that could grow by more than half (to 68 percent of homeowners) if those homeowners changed their parking behavior, "most likely by clearing a space in their garage," the report finds. "90 percent of all houses can add a 240 V outlet near where cars could be parked," said Abuelsamid. "Parking behavior, namely whether homeowners use a private garage for parking or storage, will likely become a key factor in EV adoption. Today, garage-use intent is potentially a greater factor for in-house charging ability than the house's capacity to add 240 V outlets." Creating garage space would increase the number of homes capable of EV charging from 31 million to more than 50 million. And when we include houses where the owner thinks it's feasible to add wiring, that grows to more than 72 million homes. And that's far more than Telemetry's most optimistic estimate of U.S. EV penetration for 2035, which ranges from 33 million to 57 million EVs on the road 10 years from now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hundreds Of HHS Staff Sign Letter Begging RFK Jr. To Stop Making Them Targets With Misinformation</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/21/hundreds-of-hhs-staff-sign-letter-begging-rfk-jr-to-stop-making-them-targets-with-misinformation/</link><author>Timothy Geigner</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 02:59:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As you will recall, a single gunmen opened fire on a CDC campus in Atlanta earlier this month, claiming to have been injured by COVID vaccines. The rhetoric he had used prior to the shooting closely aligned with what RFK Jr. had been spouting for years. While Kennedy took nearly a day to even publicly comment on the shooting, more local CDC leadership was fielding questions from the Atlanta team that amounted to how the organization was going to ensure that misinformation stopped flowing from Kennedy’s mouth such that they had become targets for this gunman in the first place. They got their answer when Kennedy commented publicly the next week,  all that same rhetoric that caused them to be targeted.More than 750 employees across the Department of Health and Human Services sent a signed letter to members of Congress and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday morning, calling on the secretary to stop spreading misinformation.The letter states the deadly shooting that occurred at the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Aug. 8 was “not random” and was driven by “politicized rhetoric.”The signatories are accusing Kennedy of endangering the lives of HHS employees by spreading misinformation.It’s a cry for help coming from within the organization that Kennedy is responsible for. These are people worried that their lives are being put at risk by Kennedy and his ilk, all due to the irresponsible claims he’s made for years, and continues to make to this day.But if you were expecting empathy from the leadership of HHS, you’ll be sorely disappointed. Instead of that empathy, a statement from HHS apparently accuses signatories to that letter of “politicizing” the mass shooting that targeted them.In a statement to ABC News, HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is standing firmly with CDC employees — both on the ground and across every center — ensuring their safety and well-being remain a top priority. In the wake of this heartbreaking shooting, he traveled to Atlanta to offer his support and reaffirm his deep respect, calling the CDC ‘a shining star among global health agencies.'”“For the first time in its 70-year history, the mission of HHS is truly resonating with the American people — driven by President Trump and Secretary Kennedy’s bold commitment to Make America Healthy Again,” the statement continued. “Any attempt to conflate widely supported public health reforms with the violence of a suicidal mass shooter is an attempt to politicize a tragedy.”This is bullshit. CDC staff are not politicizing the shooting; they’re begging to not be made targets. That statement is so far afield from the actual request in the letter that I don’t even know how to respond to it, other than to say that it’s quite obvious Kennedy is refusing to moderate or alter his rhetoric. Conspiracy theories appear to be more important to him than the lives of those under his employ.This is governmental malpractice. It needs to stop. It won’t stop unless someone in a position of power does something about it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;Rosetta Stone&apos; of Code Shrinks Quantum Computer Hardware Needs</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/009241/rosetta-stone-of-code-shrinks-quantum-computer-hardware-needs?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[alternative_right shares a report from Phys.org: Now, for the first time, quantum scientists at the Quantum Control Laboratory at the University of Sydney Nano Institute have demonstrated a type of quantum logic gate that drastically reduces the number of physical qubits needed for its operation. To do this, they built an entangling logic gate on a single atom using an error-correcting code nicknamed the "Rosetta stone" of quantum computing. It earns that name because it translates smooth, continuous quantum oscillations into clean, digital-like discrete states, making errors easier to spot and fix, and importantly, allowing a highly compact way to encode logical qubits. 
The curiously named Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code has for many years offered a theoretical possibility for significantly reducing the physical number of qubits needed to produce a functioning "logical qubit." Albeit by trading efficiency for complexity, making the codes very difficult to control. Research published in Nature Physics demonstrates this as a physical reality, tapping into the natural oscillations of a trapped ion (a charged atom of ytterbium) to store GKP codes and, for the first time, realizing quantum entangling gates between them.
 
Led by Sydney Horizon Fellow Dr. Tingrei Tan at the University of Sydney Nano Institute, scientists have used their exquisite control over the harmonic motion of a trapped ion to bridge the coding complexity of GKP qubits, allowing a demonstration of their entanglement. "Our experiments have shown the first realization of a universal logical gate set for GKP qubits," Dr. Tan said. "We did this by precisely controlling the natural vibrations, or harmonic oscillations, of a trapped ion in such a way that we can manipulate individual GKP qubits or entangle them as a pair." [...] Across three experiments described in the paper, Dr. Tan's team used a single ytterbium ion contained in what is known as a Paul trap. This uses a complex array of lasers at room temperature to hold the single atom in the trap, allowing its natural vibrations to be controlled and utilized to produce the complex GKP codes. This research represents an important demonstration that quantum logic gates can be developed with a reduced physical number of qubits, increasing their efficiency.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why LinkedIn Rewards Mediocrity</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/2045209/why-linkedin-rewards-mediocrity?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LinkedIn's engagement-driven algorithm systematically elevates shallow, meaningless content over substantive professional discourse, according to a new analysis that highlights how major platforms prioritize user retention metrics over content quality. Entrepreneur and product executive Elliot Smith describes encountering a "seemingly endless stream of posts that are over fluffed, over produced and ultimately say nothing" that he categorizes as "toxic mediocrity." 

Smith argues the platform's reward system creates a destructive cycle where "comments, likes and other engagement" signal user activity to LinkedIn's algorithm, which then promotes similar vapid content. "LinkedIn wants you on LinkedIn," Smith writes, noting the Microsoft-owned platform correlates engagement with ad clicks and premium conversions. Smith recommends professionals focus on substantive work rather than platform gaming, arguing "nothing you post there is going to change your career."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI lawyers question Meta’s role in Elon Musk’s $97B takeover bid</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-lawyers-question-metas-role-in-elon-musks-97b-takeover-bid/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:31:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI says that Elon Musk met with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to discuss a $97 billion takeover bid of the ChatGPT-maker.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia Orders State-Backed WhatsApp Rival Pre-Installed On Phones and Tablets</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/2015241/russia-orders-state-backed-whatsapp-rival-pre-installed-on-phones-and-tablets?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Starting September 1st, Russia will require all smartphones and tablets sold in the country to come with MAX, a state-backed messaging app seen as a rival to WhatsApp and Telegram. Critics say the app could be used to track users. Reuters reports: The Russian government said in a statement that MAX, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all "gadgets," including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from September 1. State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that MAX is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram. It will also be mandatory that from September 1, Russia's domestic app store, RuStore, which is pre-installed on all Android devices, will be pre-installed on Apple devices.
 
A Russian-language TV app called LIME HD TV, which allows people to watch state TV channels for free, will be pre-installed on all smart TVs sold in Russia from January 1, the government added. [...] MAX said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase. Russia's interior ministry said on Wednesday that MAX was safer than foreign rivals, but that it had arrested a suspect in the first fraud case using the new messenger.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Peer Reviewers More Likely To Approve Articles That Cite Their Own Work</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/2015236/peer-reviewers-more-likely-to-approve-articles-that-cite-their-own-work?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Reviewers are more likely to approve a manuscript if their own work is cited in subsequent versions than are reviewers who are not cited, according to an analysis of 18,400 articles from four open-access publications.

The update also adds enhanced parental controls, better data migration, PDF editing, and Bluetooth audio sharing, with a full release expected in December. The Verge reports: The beta includes a new dark theme option that will "intelligently invert the UI of apps that appear light despite users having selected the dark theme" when enabled, according to Google's announcement, forcibly making apps that don't natively support the feature to appear darker. Google says this is "largely intended as an accessibility feature" for users with low vision or photosensitivity, and will also automatically darken app splash screens and adjust status bar colors to match the darker theming.
 
Another feature will allow users to forcibly apply themed icon colors to apps that don't natively support them. Android's icon theming currently only works if app developers have provided a monochrome version of their app icon that can be adjusted, which is annoying for users who want to apply a consistent aesthetic across their entire home page. Auto-themed app icons spare developers from adding this capability manually, removing the hassle for users to customize their phone's theme. The full list of features in the QPR2 beta 1 update can be found on the Android developers' blog.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ctrl-Alt-Speech: You Asked, We Answered</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/21/ctrl-alt-speech-you-asked-we-answered/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 22:34:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the second of our special episodes for the month of August.

He became known inside Apple as the creator of the watch's signature fitness feature: three circular bands that people could complete through the day by exercising, standing and burning calories. Marketed with the tagline "Close Your Rings," the concept helped galvanize sales of Apple's first breakout product after Steve Jobs's death. But along the way, Mr. Blahnik created a toxic work environment (Warning: source may be paywalled; alternative source), said nine current and former employees who worked with or for Mr. Blahnik and spoke about personnel issues on the condition of anonymity. They said Mr. Blahnik, 57, who leads a roughly 100-person division as vice president for fitness technologies, could be verbally abusive, manipulative and inappropriate. His behavior contributed to decisions by more than 10 workers to seek extended mental health or medical leaves of absence since 2022, about 10 percent of the team, these people said.
 
When confronted with Mr. Blahnik's behavior, Apple moved to protect him after an internal investigation. The company settled one complaint alleging sexual harassment by Mr. Blahnik and is fighting a lawsuit by an employee, Mandana Mofidi, who said he had bullied her. Mr. Blahnik stayed in his job after company officials said their investigation had found no evidence of wrongdoing, according to interviews and Ms. Mofidi's lawsuit, which she filed against Mr. Blahnik and Apple last year in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The tension inside Mr. Blahnik's division speaks to workplace dysfunction at the heart of one of Apple's signature health initiatives. These employees said the company was more willing to protect a star executive than address the concerns of rank-and-file workers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anduril, Blue Origin to study how to transport cargo from orbit to Earth for the Pentagon</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/anduril-blue-origin-to-study-how-to-transport-cargo-from-orbit-to-earth-for-the-pentagon/</link><author>Aria Alamalhodaei</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 22:11:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Blue Origin and Anduril notched small contracts that could revolutionize how the Pentagon transports cargo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is the AI bubble about to pop?

The search giant is also expanding its AI Mode's agentic capabilities, so you can now use natural language to find restaurant reservations. Engadget reports: Google says you can ask about getting a dinner reservation with conditions such as group size, date, location and your preference of cuisine, all of which be taken into consideration when AI Mode pulls in its results from across the web. Suggestions will be presented in list form with the available reservation slots. It'll also provide a link to the booking page you need. Google also plans to add local service appointments and event ticketing capabilities soon, with Ticketmaster and StubHub among its partners.
 
AI Mode leverages Google's web-browsing AI agent Project Mariner' its direct partners on Search and resources like Knowledge Graph and Google Maps when prompted to find you somewhere to eat. It has partnered with the likes of OpenTable, Resy and Tock to incorporate as many restaurants as possible and streamline the booking process. Right now, this feature is exclusive to those subscribed to the wildly expensive Google AI Ultra plan in the US, and can be accessed through its Labs platform. If you opt into the AI Mode experiment it can also remember your previous conversations and searches to give you results that more closely match your preferences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🚨 The Last Human Bastion Fell: GPT-5 Just Redefined Discovery with Original Math</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-last-human-bastion-fell-gpt-5-just-redefined-discovery-with-original-math?source=rss</link><author>Ronne Huss</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 21:20:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For centuries, mathematics was humanity’s untouchable domain.\

This wasn’t memorization. It wasn’t brute force.\
It was  in the most unforgiving arena of all: mathematics.\
Mathematics has long been humanity’s crucible for truth.\
Now, machines are forging it too.🔍 Why This Changes EverythingAI generating art, essays, or code is dazzling, but those domains forgive ambiguity.\
A proof is binary: true or false. No flair, no fudge factor.\
For decades, skeptics clung to a comforting refrain: \n “Sure, AI can mimic patterns. But it will never reason like a mathematician.”\
That myth just collapsed.\
This wasn’t a hallucination. It wasn’t a lucky guess.\
It was a , born from silicon, not synapses.\
If AI can pioneer mathematics, what else lies within its grasp?\
New physics? Breakthroughs in cryptography? Solutions we haven’t even framed?: Convex optimization is just the opening act. Imagine GPT-5 tackling quantum mechanics, economics, and climate modeling.: What takes humans years, AI may resolve in minutes. Progress just hit warp speed.: Math is verifiable. That makes it the perfect proving ground for human–AI collaboration.\
This isn’t about automating homework.\
It’s about AI stepping into the lab as a scientist.We’ve crossed an invisible line.\

We’re sensemakers, curating meaning from a flood of new truths.\
If intelligence is no longer scarce, meaning-making becomes humanity’s new superpower.GPT-5’s proof is the first crack in the wall of human-only discovery.\
AI didn’t just mimic us.\

Analysis of 60 million bird call recordings reveals that artificial lighting causes birds to begin vocalizing 20 minutes earlier each morning and continue 30 minutes later each evening. The effect varies significantly by species anatomy and behavior. 

Birds with proportionally larger eyes experience the strongest responses, with American Robins in highly illuminated areas beginning their songs up to two hours before sunrise. Species nesting in tree cavities or enclosed spaces show minimal changes, as opaque barriers shield them from artificial light. The research, drawing from BirdWeather devices deployed globally by birdwatchers, is the largest analysis of light pollution's biological impacts to date.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>As India bans real-money games, Dream Sports, MPL start pulling the plug</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/as-india-bans-real-money-games-dream-sports-mpl-start-pulling-the-plug/</link><author>Jagmeet Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 20:56:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Several Indian startups, including Dream Sports, MPL, and Zupee, are shutting down their real-money games after parliament passed a bill banning such games.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From the Big Bang to Superintelligence: A Story of Inevitability</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/from-the-big-bang-to-superintelligence-a-story-of-inevitability?source=rss</link><author>Elad Daniel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 20:41:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The AGI debate, end of work or end of the world, is exaggerated. Not that it won’t happen. It is a physical certainty. But we need not worry. Much.The blue hive we call Earth is a buzz.\
Could it be that we, the busy bees, have become so smart that we are on the edge of creating AGI? Even a superintelligence? Will we soon live in a world where no work is needed and honey flows freely? Or is it certain death and full colony collapse?\
Here is the beekeeper’s secret.\
There is nothing the bees can do about the creation of AGI or superintelligence.\
Nothing they do will stop it. Its existence is a law of physics. It is thermodynamically inevitable.\
To see why, we need to do two things. First, suspend disbelief about our arrogance, the arrogance that we, tiny creatures on a tiny planet, can know enough about the universe’s laws to make the claims that will follow. Second, take a trip to the beginning of everything. To the Big Bang.A Brief History of Mess and OrderIn the beginning, at the Big Bang, when space, time, energy, and forces came into existence, everything was a hot mess of subatomic particles.\
Physics has a rule called the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In short, it means that “things will get messier over time.” But “messier” does not mean pure chaos. In fact, the quickest path to a bigger mess (entropy, if you want the official word) often involves building little pockets of order that help spread it faster. These are called self-organizing patterns.\
Those first patterns came from tiny quantum fluctuations in the early universe, wrinkles in density and temperature. They were there almost immediately, but by about three minutes after the bang, the universe had cooled enough for the first atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium to form. A little more time passed (about 380,000 years), and cooling allowed electrons to join those nuclei, creating the first complete atoms.\
More time passed (around 180 million years), and gravity pulled some of those atoms into denser clumps. By 300 million years, the first stars were burning, fusing light elements into heavier ones. When those stars exploded, they scattered carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, iron, and other elements into space. Over the next billion years, these ingredients combined, with local order serving the bigger mess, into molecules of metals, silicates, and ice.\
These islands of order were, in effect, islands of information. And the process of building information did not stop there.\
Fast forward another 7 billion years, and in our corner of the universe (and probably many others), some of these heavy elements, water, and carbon-based compounds began merging into even more complex things. Out of this pool came amino acids, nucleotides, and simple lipids. Then one molecule, RNA, stumbled onto a trick of self-replication, the first information that spread itself instead of waiting on chance. It flooded its surroundings.\
Primitive cells formed and became more complex when DNA replaced RNA as the main engine of replication. True cells appeared, and when they grouped together, they survived better. Multicellular creatures emerged (only 600 million years ago). They began forming organs, and before long (500 million years ago), complex creatures made of organs, made of cells, made of molecules, made of atoms, swam, crawled, and walked. From there to us (300,000 years ago), the road was paved.This trajectory is pointing in one direction. Complexity, information, is growing over time. Not everywhere. On the contrary. It grows in islands in a process we can call “Information Crystallization.” This probably happened in many places in the universe, but we will leave that aside. If it makes you sleep better, yes, it is unlikely, but there can be a first crystal and we might be it. No E.T. to call home. Yet.\
This process is hierarchical, not cancelling.\
Since the first information crystals appeared, the process has been building on itself:Sub-particles > Atoms > Molecules > Self-replicating Molecules > Cells > Multi-cells > Creatures > Humans > Human Generated Information\
Each level of complexity is built from, not replacing, the level below it in the hierarchy.\
You might be thinking: I just jumped from people, a physical creature, to non-physical information people create. I did not. Information only survives when it has a physical form. Even a fleeting thought in your head, without being made of something physical, does not exist. \
Whether it is saved within humans or outside makes no difference. If you want a very real metaphor, we and every other complex creature on the planet are the external storage of viral information. Not cat memes. Real viruses. A large share of genomes, including ours, is built from viral fossils. We carry their archived information. We are their cloud.Superintelligence and AntihumioticsThe next crystallization will obey the same physical law. It will emerge from an existing soup of information. It does not have to emerge here if the conditions are not favorable (for example, someone pushes a red button and scatters order back into a radioactive cloud of atoms), but it will happen. Maybe the crystallizing nucleus is an LLM (probably not), perhaps some other information-organizing algorithm, but from that point on, a new self-propagating and improved entity will emerge.\
Our relation to this entity will be similar to what cells and cellular creatures are to us. It will be made of us and will, in many cases, benefit from having us around. It may sustain us in symbiosis, encourage our proliferation, or, like antibiotics, eradicate those causing harm. Antihumiotics.\
It is not something to be afraid of. It is going to be us, only in a different order. Are cells afraid of the heart they are part of? Are we even going to be aware of it? Probably yes. Cells are a metaphor. We are at a higher level of complexity.\
How it will  feel, I think we can say with some confidence. It will not be what futurist stories describe. The reason is that it will not be discrete. No self-conscious evil robots, no superintelligence wanting to turn us into paperclips. The arrow of complexity does not point to granularity. Our bias toward thinking in discrete units rather than in systems limits our imagination.\
What about our ability to “control” this super-organized higher intelligence? You should ask something with experience. Like DNA. Do creatures above it in complexity have free will?\
The answer, debated but humbling, is also encouraging. We will have a high degree of control over anything that is made of us. As long as we live in symbiosis, not as parasites.\
Two more questions left unanswered –How Far? Not as Far as The OmegaThere used to be a speculative idea called the Omega Point. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a priest, described it as a final point of convergence where all consciousness would unite. Later, the physicist Frank Tipler reinterpreted it as a Big Crunch scenario in which all matter would be organized into one entity with infinite computational abilities. Very God-like.\
And a priest thought of it, of all people.\
But that idea does not hold true to what we know. All this information creation happens because of the tendency of the universe to mess things up, to increase entropy.\
Organization and information happen in islands. Between them, heat and mess. It does not seem like one big mind is where things will end up.When will it happen? Random. But FastAn improved self-organizing information system emerges from complexity and opportunities. It needs the right environment to appear in. It will not pop from a random cloud of atoms. But it will also not emerge from a corporate R&D department or university lab.\
Most likely, it will spontaneously appear in an information cloud.\
Some algorithms (i.e., RNA, which functions like an algorithm, appearing in a “simpler” environment) will have self-organizing properties that will have an advantage over other algorithms and will start organizing the already existing information in novel ways. We might not even be aware that it has happened.\
We already have clouds of information. The internet and now LLM clouds are examples. Are they big enough, complex enough, and have emergent algorithms? I feel not yet. They still resemble the primordial soup or the post-Big Bang plasma. Humans did not jump straight from single cells.\
Looking back at the time curve we saw earlier, billions, then millions, then thousands of years passed between each “jump” in order. If we consider the explosion of information we have created in the past hundreds of years as a stepping stone for the next jump, then it is safe to predict that we are not far from the next emergence.\
Again, we may not even feel it when it occurs. The only thing we might feel is that our chance of survival in our environment has increased dramatically. We became part of something larger that has our back.\
Which begs the question: how do we know if we have not already reached this point? That we are seeing the world from the vantage point of a metaphorical virus?\
To this I can only say: You think that’s air you are breathing now?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Kernel Patches Posted For Enabling USB3 Support On Apple M1 / M2</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Apple-Silicon-USB3-RFC</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 20:38:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In addition to this week seeing Apple SoC DT updates prepped for Linux 6.18 and Apple laptop lid events and power button driver patches posted for review for the mainline Linux kernel, published today on the Linux kernel mailing list are the request for comments (RFC) on patches for enabling USB3 support with Apple Silicon M1 / M2 SoCs...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UK Backs Down On Apple Encryption Backdoor—But The Secret Deal Raises New Questions</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/21/uk-backs-down-on-apple-encryption-backdoor-but-the-secret-deal-raises-new-questions/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 20:26:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The UK government has reportedly backed down from its dangerous demand that Apple build encryption backdoors, following pressure from the Trump administration. But the secretive nature of this “mutually beneficial” agreement should make us deeply suspicious about what was actually traded away.The UK government has backed down on a controversial demand for Apple to build a “back door” into its technology to access private user data following pressure from the Trump administration.Of course, I say “leaked” because the demands to Apple were never officially discussed by the UK government, who hoped to keep this unconscionable attack on everyone’s privacy a total secret. Since then, Apple has been fighting it out (still in secret) in the UK to try to get this order blocked, though it was believed that they only had limited legal routes to stopping it.But there was widespread condemnation about this move by the UK government, and this is one of those cases where that includes from the Trump administration, who is taking credit for convincing the UK to back down. Of course, the UK is making no comment whatsoever, and the secret nature of the deal—which includes a source saying that the agreement was “mutually beneficial—to the US and the UK should raise some questions:Gabbard said that over the “past few months,” she had been “working closely with our partners in the UK,” alongside President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, on the agreement.A source familiar with the discussions told CNN that Gabbard spoke with her counterpart in the UK, Deputy National Security Advisory Matt Collins, a few times about the issue, including once when the UK delegation visited the White House. Vance was also personally involved in reaching a deal, engaging in direct conversations with British government officials to come to what was considered a “mutually beneficial” agreement for both countries, a White House official told CNN.“This agreement between our two governments maintains each country’s sovereignty while ensuring close cooperation on data,” a White House official said.Reading between the lines here, it sounds like the US may have threatened to cut off access to some of the intelligence data it collects if the UK went through with the plan.Of course, it would be more reassuring if the US government itself wasn’t still trying to push through its own attacks on encryption. Federal law enforcement officials, federal elected officials, and state legislators are still pushing efforts to undermine encryption in the US.So, yes, I’m glad that Gabbard and Vance were able to pressure the UK to drop this completely brain-dead and dangerous idea, but it would be nice if they got their allies in the US government to step down on this issue as well. And, also if they came clear as to what the deal with the UK is regarding “close cooperation on data.”The broader lesson here is that we should be happy that the UK is backing down, but we shouldn’t celebrate too quickly when governments make these kinds of secretive deals around fundamental rights. Yes, it’s good that the UK backed down from its most aggressive position. But until we know what was traded in return, and until both countries abandon their broader anti-encryption agendas, it’s still unclear if this is a real victory for digital rights or more like a tactical retreat in a much longer war against privacy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Denmark Ending Letter Deliveries Is a Sign of the Digital Times</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/1928230/denmark-ending-letter-deliveries-is-a-sign-of-the-digital-times?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 20:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Denmark's PostNord will end centuries of letter delivery as digitalization and high postage costs make physical mail nearly obsolete. The BBC reports: The steep decline in letter volumes has been driven largely by digitalization, and PostNord announced in March that it will cease letter services at the end of the year. It will bring to an end four centuries of letter deliveries by the state-owned operation. A third of its workforce is being let go, as it sheds 2,200 positions in its loss-making letter arm. Instead it will focus on its profitable parcel business, creating 700 new roles. "Danes hardly receive any letters anymore. It's been going down for years and years," says Kim Pedersen, chief of PostNord Denmark. "They're receiving one letter a month on average, it's not a lot." "On the contrary, Danes love to shop online," he adds. "Global e-commerce is growing significantly, and we are moving with it."
 
Fifteen years ago, PostNord operated several enormous letter-sorting facilities, but now there's just one on the western outskirts of Copenhagen. Since 2000, the volume of letters the business handles has declined by more than 90%, from around 1.4 billion to 110 million last year, and it continues to fall rapidly. As PostNord prepares to cease letter deliveries, 1,500 of its red post boxes are being removed from Danish streets. However, few locals in the capital appear to use them much.
 
From email and cashless mobile payments, to digital health cards carried by smartphone, there's an app for almost everything in Denmark - and it's one of the world's most digitalized nations, second only to South Korea, according to the OECD's 2023 Digital Government Index. The Danish government has embraced a "digital by default" policy, and for more than a decade correspondence with the public has been carried out electronically. "We are facing this natural evolution of a digitalized society, earlier than maybe some other countries," Mr Pedersen explains. "In Denmark, we are maybe five or 10 years ahead."
 
The high cost of sending a letter in Denmark is also a contributing factor behind its decline. In 2024, a new law opened up the postal market to private competition and took away its exemption from the country's 25% rate of VAT, so the price of a PostNord stamp jumped to 29 Danish krone ($4.55) per letter. "That made [volumes] drop even further faster," Mr Pedersen points out. The report notes that private firm DAO will take over nationwide letter deliveries in Denmark after PostNord exits. However, concerns remain that elderly citizens and rural residents may struggle with fewer post boxes and reduced service quality. Both the advocacy group DaneAge and the 3F Postal Union warn the transition could disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ethereum Meme Coin Pepeto (PEPETO) Could Deliver Higher Returns Than DOGE In 2025</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-meme-coin-pepeto-pepeto-could-deliver-higher-returns-than-doge-in-2025?source=rss</link><author>BTCWire</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 20:05:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about projects heading into the 2025 bull run, positioning itself as a direct challenger to . Unlike coins built only on hype, Pepeto runs fully on Ethereum, not on a Layer-2, and is backed by working products such as a zero-fee trading exchange, a cross-chain bridge, and high-yield staking rewards. Its presale price has just reached $0.000000148, with over $6 million already raised, signaling growing momentum ahead of listings. Meanwhile, DOGE continues to hover near the $0.21 support zone, a level that has sparked rallies before.If this level holds, some analysts see a 30% move toward $0.26, but the sharper excitement is leaning toward presales like Pepeto, where the growth ceiling is far higher.Pepeto’s Infrastructure EdgePepeto is not just another token running on Ethereum. The team is designing a broader system to address issues that meme coin traders encounter in every cycle. Its focus is to become:The first zero-fee exchange for meme coin trading through PepetoSwapA cross-chain bridge connecting major blockchains without outside risksA launch environment structured to minimize sniper bot activityA trading and cultural hub developed by builders who worked on earlier meme projectsThese features set Pepeto apart from the usual short-lived meme plays. By combining meme-driven energy with actual infrastructure and security, Pepeto appeals both to quick traders and to long-term holders looking for sustainable growth.DOGE still benefits from being a household crypto name with a loyal community and support from Elon Musk, but its technology is lagging. Pepeto is aiming to seize this gap with clear advantages:Utility Beyond Popularity – DOGE mainly relies on its cultural status, while Pepeto introduces working tools like PepetoSwap and PepetoBridge to build real use cases.A Fairer Market Structure – Pepeto has no trading tax, no team wallets, and contracts audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, giving transparency DOGE never offered.Faster, Cheaper Trading – PepetoSwap allows zero-fee transactions and its cross-chain bridge provides low-cost movement between chains, solving friction DOGE users often face.Built-In Growth Mechanisms – Pepeto offers staking at 242% APY and a fair listing model for new tokens, ensuring ongoing ecosystem growth and participation.At the current presale price of $0.000000148, even a small move higher could create large multiples. For example, a climb to $0.00000148 would deliver a 10x return, a far bigger opportunity than DOGE’s projected run from $0.21 to $0.26.Pepeto is gaining strong traction across crypto social spaces. Its branding ties directly to meme culture, yet the real infrastructure behind it is what makes it stand out. Early comparisons to Shiba Inu and PEPE are already circulating among influencers, with many calling Pepeto the natural successor in this category. DOGE still holds the spotlight with mainstream investors, but its lack of upgrades makes it vulnerable to being overtaken by newer tokens like Pepeto. As 2025 heats up, momentum on social media continues to push more attention toward Pepeto’s presale.The next bull market could provide gains for both DOGE and Pepeto, but the scale of those gains may look very different. DOGE – Still likely to rally with overall market strength, but its returns may be limited due to its maturity. Brief hype-driven pumps remain possible, but sustainable progress requires upgrades DOGE has yet to deliver.Pepeto – As a new project backed by a zero-fee exchange, a secure cross-chain bridge, staking rewards, and no-tax trading, its upside ceiling is far greater. Pepeto blends speculation with utility, positioning it to multiply in value far more than the average meme coin move.With DOGE’s market cap over $30 billion, Pepeto only needs to capture a small slice of that value to create outsized returns from its $0.000000148 presale base.Dogecoin is holding around $0.21 and could bounce toward $0.26, which might satisfy short-term traders. But for those looking for far larger gains during the 2025 bull run, Pepeto presents a stronger case. It combines Ethereum rails with meme coin appeal, zero-fee trading, staking at 242% APY, and nearly sold-out presale stages. Pepeto is not positioning itself as a short-lived play but as the infrastructure for the next phase of meme coin trading. At $0.000000148, the presale window is narrowing. If crypto market sentiment carries into 2025 as many expect, Pepeto could not only keep pace with DOGE but also surpass its returns by a wide margin.To buy PEPETO, make sure to use the official website: As the listing draws closer, some are attempting to capitalize on the hype by using the name to mislead investors with fake platforms.

In a statement Thursday flagged by Bloomberg, Australia's main financial services union, the Finance Sector Union (FSU), claimed a "massive win" for 45 union members whom the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) had replaced with an AI-powered "voice bot."
 
The FSU noted that some of these workers had been with CBA for decades. Those workers in particular were shocked when CBA announced last month that their jobs had become redundant. At that time, CBA claimed that launching the chatbot supposedly "led to a reduction in call volumes" by 2,000 a week, FSU said. But "this was an outright lie," fired workers told FSU. Instead, call volumes had been increasing at the time they were dismissed, with CBA supposedly "scrambling" -- offering staff overtime and redirecting management to join workers answering phones to keep up.
 
To uncover the truth, FSU escalated the dispute to a fair work tribunal, where the union accused CBA of failing to explain how workers' roles were ruled redundant. The union also alleged that CBA was hiring for similar roles in India, Bloomberg noted, which made it appear that CBA had perhaps used the chatbot to cover up a shady pivot to outsource jobs. While the dispute was being weighed, CBA admitted that "they didn't properly consider that an increase in calls" happening while staff was being fired "would continue over a number of months," FSU said. "This error meant the roles were not redundant," CBA confirmed at the tribunal. Now, CBA has apologized to the fired workers. A spokesperson told Bloomberg that they can choose to come back to their prior roles, seek another position, or leave the firm with an exit payment. "We have apologized to the employees concerned and acknowledge we should have been more thorough in our assessment of the roles required," CBA's spokesperson told Bloomberg.
 
The FSU said that "the damage has already been done." These employees "have had to endure the stress and worry of facing redundancy" and were "suddenly confronted with the prospect of being unable to pay their bills." FSU warned that CBA's flip-flopping on AI serves as a "stark reminder to all of us that we can never trust employers to do the right thing by workers, and change can happen at any time and impact any one of us."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk’s X may finally settle $500M severance lawsuit</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/elon-musks-x-may-finally-settle-500m-severance-lawsuit/</link><author>Amanda Silberling</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 19:25:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk's X is settling a severance lawsuit with former Twitter employees.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>In Conversation With Dung Le: Engineering Excellence Across Tech Giants and Entrepreneurial Ventures</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/in-conversation-with-dung-le-engineering-excellence-across-tech-giants-and-entrepreneurial-ventures?source=rss</link><author>Sanya Kapoor</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 19:14:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dung Le’s journey spans Google, Tesla, Facebook, Citadel, and entrepreneurial ventures like Licensed To Glow.

Traditional allocations often arrive with steep discounts, lockups, and exclusivity that keep everyday contributors sidelined. Meanwhile, a new wave of large-scale crypto crowdfunding is flipping that dynamic, combining compliance with community. Platforms like CoinList, Republic, Kaito, and Pump.fun have proven the power of social and institutional crowdfunding alike.To understand what’s driving this shift — and where it’s headed — I sat down with a Solana veteran developer CryptoSheldon, who is also the co-founder of SeedList, a new large-scale crypto crowdfunding launchpad.Hello, CryptoSheldon! Can you briefly tell us about yourself and your professional background?I started working in crypto in 2017 as a programmer and trader but soon started developing in the Solana ecosystem. In 2018 I met the CoinList guys at my first crypto conference and ever since been very interested in decentralized fundraising through crypto. I’ve written about the subject, analyzing many coins in the crypto financial services sector on Binance global trading and Binance Square and in various Solana publications. I’ve also advised a handful of crypto projects in the Solana ecosystem, taking some from zero development to large market capitalizations on tier 1 exchanges behind the scenes. Doing so I’ve learned what it takes to start a project and grow it to become a tier 1 crypto unicorn.Venture capital has dominated tech funding for decades. Why is crypto crowdfunding gaining traction now?The short answer is that crypto doesn’t wait for board meetings. In traditional VC, founders spend months pitching, negotiating terms, and giving up equity for capital. In Web3, we’ve seen projects like Solana, Filecoin, and Flow raise hundreds of millions directly from the community through platforms like CoinList or Republic. Community sales happen faster and onboard real users immediately. Contributors aren’t locked into five-year exits, they participate in the ecosystem from day one. Token launches can scale globally overnight, instead of staying confined to Sand Hill Road. It’s a better fit for a technology that’s supposed to be decentralized.We’ve seen some massive token sales lately. Which ones stand out to you as proof that crowdfunding can rival VC rounds?WalletConnect’s $10 million raise this year was a perfect example and something I've wanted to see for nearly 10 years. It wasn’t just on one platform, it spread across CoinList, Bitget’s Launch X, and Cobie’s Echo. That’s a multi-platform, multi-community raise where tens of thousands of people got involved.Echo itself is interesting, it sold $500K of WalletConnect tokens in just 11 seconds by combining AI-driven matching with community incentives and Kaito launched Espresso with reputation-based allocations. It’s now worth $300M on Binance with no end in sight. That’s the kind of traction VCs simply can’t match on their own anymore.Beyond scale, what makes SocialFi crowdfunding so different?It’s about who you are, not just how much you invest. Take Kaito — they allocate based on social reputation and analytics, not just wallet size. Pump.fun showed the opposite end of the spectrum: meme tokens going viral on social media before exchanges even noticed. Together, those experiments proved two things: Influence is capital. Attention itself can be a funding engine. SocialFi makes token launches more organic, more participatory, and in some cases, more viral than anything a VC syndicate could coordinate.That leads us to your project, SeedList. What gap are you trying to fill in this new landscape?If platforms like Kaito and Pump.fun proved that reputation and virality matter, SeedList is asking: why do we need VCs at all? We’re building a model where those passive allocations get redirected to KOLs, centralized exchanges, ecosystem foundations, and even retail micro-influencers. Our allocation model uses AI to measure things like: Technical contributions, Social reach and influence, Engagement from non-U.S. regions that often get excluded. Instead of rewarding the same privileged funds, we reward the people actually driving adoption.Some people argue VCs provide more than just money, mentorship, connections, governance. Can crowdfunding really replace that?I spent years watching founders waste weeks in pitch rooms and board updates. In crypto, that’s unnecessary friction. Platforms like SeedList can give projects the same industry connections, exchanges like Bybit or Binance, ecosystem partners like Solana or Avalanche, influencers like Mr. Beast who reach tens of millions — but without founders giving up control.As I’ve said before: the old-school VC firm isn’t the only option anymore. We can deliver the capital, the community, and the global brand reach in a fraction of the time.That’s exactly what we’re trying to fix. Crowdfunding, when done right, means retail gets access earlier and with fairer terms. For example, Echo and Kaito already proved you can build transparent allocation models that reward contributors, not insiders.At SeedList, retail participants — even micro-influencers — get structured tasks, direct allocations, and better interaction with projects. Instead of being locked out, they’re part of the launch momentum from the start.What’s your long-term vision for SeedList and the broader crowdfunding movement?By 2026, I believe crowdfunding will be the default for top-100 CoinMarketCap projects. VCs won’t disappear overnight, but their monopoly on early-stage capital is ending.We’ll see Launchpads that merge compliance, analytics, and liquidity, SocialFi models that amplify real communities, and a more global and inclusive contributor base, not just a handful of Silicon Valley funds. If SeedList can help push that forward, by making launches five to ten times more impactful in market value, adoption, and brand reach, then we’ve done our job.Final thought: Is this the death of venture capital in crypto?Maybe not death, but definitely dethronement. VCs will still exist, but they’ll no longer control who gets funded and who doesn’t. In crypto, the crowd is the kingmaker now.Thanks Sheldon or sorry, CryptoSheldon. Any last words?All good, you can call me Shels, like Machine Gun Kelly, they call him Kells. Thanks for having me today. The next 12 months are going to be very interesting. Plant the Seed and not the Privilege!”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cisco Announces Mass Layoffs Just After Soaring Revenue Report</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/1858221/cisco-announces-mass-layoffs-just-after-soaring-revenue-report?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:58:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cisco, the San Jose-based technology giant, has announced another round of layoffs affecting Bay Area workers, marking a familiar pattern of reporting skyrocketing revenue followed by drastic job cuts. From a report: According to Aug. 13 WARN filings with California's Employment Development Department, the company will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices. 

WARN documents are generally required by the state in the event of mass layoffs. Employees were notified of the layoffs on Aug. 14 and their terminations will be effective Oct. 13. The most cuts, affecting 157 jobs, largely in software engineering roles, were at Cisco's Milpitas office at 560 McCarthy Blvd. 

Cisco's San Francisco office at 500 Terry A. Francois Blvd. will cut 64 positions, according to the filing. The filings came the same day Cisco released its fourth-quarter earnings, which reported $14.7 billion in revenue, an 8% increase from the same quarter last year.

What no one will ever accuse it of being is “competent.” Trump has surrounded himself with sycophants, most of them known only for waving the MAGA flag when not hosting shows on Fox or podcasts celebrating the debut of American fascism. Case in point: SecDef Pete Hegseth, who was previously best known for his multiple Fox News appearances (and is currently best known for reposting a recording of a pastor saying women shouldn’t have the right to vote) now heads the Defense Department. Somehow, a Signal chat group that included him managed to invite Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a chat session discussing an ongoing military attack in Yemen. In all fairness to Hegseth (which is far more than he deserves), he probably didn’t send out this invite himself. On the other hand, his defense of this OPSEC failure strips away all the fairness I’ve just awarded him. According to Hegseth, this was no big deal because nothing classified was discussed and these weren’t actually “war plans” despite the group being referred to by at least one (intended) participant as the “houthi war chat group.”Well, if that’s the case, then future “war chats” should just take place on X in full view of everyone. After all, nothing sensitive or classified is being shared. Isn’t that right, Pete? Pete may not be the best judge of what can or can’t be shared with people who don’t have the proper security clearance. While “Signalgate” continued to generate press coverage, it was discovered that Pete Hegseth was  discussing matters of national security with… his wife, his brother, and his family’s lawyer. And that brings us to the latest OPSEC failure from this hideous administration. Again, to be far more fair to ICE than it deserves, it’s possible no one from ICE added this random person to a chat group discussing a manhunt already in progress. Joseph Cox has the hilariously gory details at 404 Media:Members of a law enforcement group chat including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies inadvertently added a random person to the group called “Mass Text” where they exposed highly sensitive information about an active search for a convicted attempted murderer seemingly marked for deportation, 404 Media has learned. The texts included an unredacted ICE “Field Operations Worksheet” that includes detailed information about the target they were looking for, and the texts showed ICE pulling data from a DMV and license plate readers (LPRs), according to screenshots of the chat obtained and verified by 404 Media. The person accidentally added to the group chat is not a law enforcement official or associated with the investigation in any way, and said they were added to it weeks ago and initially thought it was a series of spam messages.Click through for the coverage of this latest attempt to make America great again. There are plenty of screenshots of the texts, as well as confirmation that the participants in the chat group included at least one ICE official and one member of the US Marshals Service. Oh, and then there’s this detail, which makes it even more of an OPSEC failure.The government has issued nothing but a refusal to comment on these revelations. And it’s entirely possible some random cop added this random person to the chat group, rather than someone working for ICE, but the end result is the same thing: another unforced error from an administration that seems to be to have been crafted from the ground up to be as embarrassing as possible as often as possible.Or maybe ICE was just following DHS head Kristi Noem’s lead. After all, she doesn’t seem to mind exposing impending or ongoing ICE operations so long as it generates a photo op for her to post at social media’s favorite Nazi bar: In one instance, sources told the Journal that Noem likely hampered a series of early morning raids in New York City by posting about the operation on social media while it was still underway.People familiar with the January effort claimed Noem’s post on X tipped off targets that ICE was in action, spoiling the element of surprise and resulting in “fewer arrests than officials had hoped for.”Of course, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin was there to defend the photo op that jeopardized an ICE operation by claiming the raids were “already winding down” when the post went live. Given the 3:43 am timestamp, that seems  like McLaughlin is flat out lying about what happened. Whatever the case, the administration continues to lower the bar in terms of basic competence. And while that might be occasionally amusing, it’s still pretty good at brute forcing its way towards a totalitarian takeover. Back to 404 Media’s Joseph Cox:Being stupid in group chats doesn’t seem to be doing much damage to the full-on evil being perpetrated daily by the Trump administration. While it does give us some hope that it will periodically trip over its own feet, it’s a pretty fucking cold comfort.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: The 2025 Canva Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/21/daily-deal-the-2025-canva-bundle-3/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:59:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2025 Canva Bundle has six courses to help you learn about graphic design.

It is distinct from Planet Nine or Planet X, another hypothetical planet that is predicted to be much larger and more distant than Planet Y.Scientists speculated about the potential existence of Planet Y after discovering a strange “warp” in the Kuiper belt, which is a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune, reports the study, which was posted on the preprint server arXiv on Wednesday. “We still are skeptical because it's not a ‘grand slam’ signal by any means,” said Amir Siraj, a graduate student in astrophysics at Princeton University who led the study, in a call with 404 Media. “At the most, it's a hint—or it’s suggestive of—an unseen planet.” The paper has been accepted for publication in The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Siraj said.Siraj and his co-authors made the discovery while laying the groundwork for an upcoming search for Planet Nine. For more than a decade, scientists have debated whether this hypothetical world—roughly five to ten times as massive as Earth, making it a “super-Earth” or “mini-Neptune”—is orbiting  of at least 400 astronomical units (AU), where one AU is the distance between Earth and the Sun. Scientists came up with the Planet Nine hypothesis after observing small celestial bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune called trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which appear to be gravitationally influenced by some hidden phenomenon. Planet Nine could be the culprit. It’s an exciting time for Planet Nine watchers, as the next-generation Vera C. Rubin Observatory  in Chile achieved first light in June. Rubin is expected to begin running its signature project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), by the end of 2025, and will spend a decade scanning the southern sky to produce a time-lapsed map that could expose Planet Nine, if it exists.For this reason, scientists are gearing up for a worldwide race to be the first to spot the planet in the incoming LSST data. To prepare for the observational onslaught, Siraj and his colleagues have been developing new techniques to learn all they can about the murky Kuiper belt. “This is something I've been focusing on for the past couple of years, particularly because we are going to be flooded very soon—knock on wood—with thousands of new TNOs from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s LSST,” said Siraj. “So, my philosophy for the past couple of years has been, well, let me make sure I know everything that I can know from all the efforts so far.”To that end, the team developed an improved technique for measuring the mean motions of objects in the distant Kuiper belt and comparing them to the plane of the solar system. Ideally, the mean plane of the objects’ orbits should fall in line with the solar system’s plane, but deviations could point to more evidence for Planet Nine.Instead, the team’s novel approach found that the Kuiper belt’s mean plane was tilted by about 15 degrees relative to the solar system plane at ranges of 80 to 400 AU. This “warp” could be caused by many factors, such as orbital resonances with known solar system planets. But it could also hint at the presence of a small rocky world, lurking anywhere from three-to-five times as far as the orbit of Pluto.“It was certainly a big surprise,” Siraj said. “If this warp holds up, the best explanation we can come up with is an undiscovered and relatively small inclined planet, roughly 100 to 200 AU from the Sun. The other thing that was exciting to us is that, whether the warp is real or not, it will be very quickly confirmed or refuted within the first few years of LSST’s operation.”Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science who was not involved in the study, said the work was “interesting” but that “it is hard to say if the results are significant” in an email to 404 Media. Sheppard, who is an expert on small worlds in the solar system, noted that there could be multiple explanations for the weird orbital motions and pointed out that the authors acknowledge their findings are below the standard of “over 99 percent to make something likely.”“A warped outer plane would be interesting if real, but a planet also isn’t the only explanation as passing stars or other effects could have done something similar in the distant past,” Sheppard concluded. If there truly is an undiscovered Mercury-ish world beyond Pluto, it is probably a homegrown member of the solar system that was ejected by the turbulent environment in the early solar system. Planet Nine, in contrast, could have either formed in the solar system, or it could have been a wandering exoplanet that was gravitationally captured by the solar system.“The solar system probably formed with a lot of planetary embryos,” Siraj said. “There were probably a lot of bodies that were roughly Mercury-mass and most of them likely were just scattered out of the solar system like balls in a pinball machine during the violent stages of solar system formation.” “That would definitely be the most likely and possible formation scenario for such an object,” he added. “I think it would be very unlikely for an orbit like this to be produced from a capture event.”Time will tell whether or not the warp represents a lost world that was kicked out of our local neighborhood more than four billion years ago. But the intense focus on the outer solar system and its many mysteries, spurred by LSST, is sure to bring a flood of new discoveries regardless. Indeed, the hypothetical existence of Planet Y does not rule out the existence of Planet Nine (and vice versa) so there may well be multiple mysterious worlds waiting to be added to our solar family.“It is really remarkably hard to see objects in the outer solar system,” Siraj said. “These kinds of measurements were not even remotely possible 20 years ago, so this speaks to the technological progress that's been made. It is potentially putting us into an era in astronomy that's unfamiliar these days, but was much more familiar in, say, the 1700s or 1800s—the idea of adding another planet to our own solar system.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Solar Panels in Space &apos;Could Provide 80% of Europe&apos;s Renewable Energy By 2050&apos;</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/1650224/solar-panels-in-space-could-provide-80-of-europes-renewable-energy-by-2050?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Solar panels in space could cut Europe's terrestrial renewable energy needs by 80% by 2050, a study has found. The Guardian: Using a detailed computer model of the continent's future power grid, the researchers found that a system of space-based panels designed by Nasa could reduce the cost of the whole European power system by as much as 15%. It could also cut battery use by more than two-thirds. 

The study, led by researchers at King's College London, is the first to assess the possible impact of space solar energy on Europe. The space-based solar power (SBSP) panels that yielded the positive results uses a heliostat design. The design, which the system imitates, uses mirror-like reflectors to collect sunlight in orbit. The sunlight is then transmitted to stations on Earth and converted to electricity before it is delivered to an energy grid. The computer model of the continent's power grid spans 33 countries, and simulates electricity demand, generation and storage to identify the lowest-cost option to meet Europe's electricity needs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amy Klobuchar Wants To Break The Internet Because Someone Made A Stupid Satirical Video About Her</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/21/amy-klobuchar-wants-to-break-the-internet-because-someone-made-a-stupid-satirical-video-about-her/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:29:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Senator Amy Klobuchar is one of the top Democrats in the Senate. She could be fighting to protect democracy against fascists. She could be working on a new, better vision for Americans. But instead, she’s focused on breaking the internet.And now we know why: someone made a stupid satirical video about her, and her response was to write an op-ed demanding new laws to censor it. The video is obviously fake, obviously satirical, and obviously protected by the First Amendment. Klobuchar knows this—she even acknowledges the First Amendment protections in her own legislation. But she’s using this protected political speech as her prime example of why we need her NO FAKES Act to give platforms more power to take down speech.It’s the perfect encapsulation of the authoritarian mindset critics have long warned about: a sitting senator’s first instinct when confronted with speech that mocks her is to reach for the censorship lever.This isn’t new for Klobuchar. She has a long history of pushing obviously unconstitutional bills that would destroy the internet.She was also the key Democratic senator behind the TAKE IT DOWN Act, which did pass into law, and which Donald Trump himself has promised to use to silence criticism of himself.Somewhere in all of this, you would hope that Senator Klobuchar and her staff might take a second to think through the consequences of these bills they keep pushing. But, no, Senator Klobuchar is instead completely freaked out because someone made a stupid satirical video “deepfake” pretending to make her say some stuff that no human being actually thinks she said.Let’s be clear: the video that Senator Klobuchar is concerned about is (1) obviously fake and satirical, and (2) obviously protected free speech under the First Amendment. I’m going to post it here via Streamable, which means it will expire and disappear soon, because I’m actually worried about posting it somewhere more permanent, like YouTube, where Klobuchar’s threats suggest that I could have it taken down and my account banned for posting something for journalistic reasons.The video is obviously fake. No one with any sense at all thinks that Klobuchar said anything like this:Look, all we’re saying is that we want representation. Okay?If Republicans are going to have beautiful girls with perfect titties in their ads, we want ads for Democrats, too, you know? We want ugly fat bitches wearing pink wigs and long-ass fake nails being loud and twerking on top of a cop car at a Waffle House cuz they didn’t get extra ketchup.You know, just because we’re the party of ugly people doesn’t mean we can’t be featured in ads. Okay? And I know most of us are too fat to wear jeans or too ugly to go outside, but we want representation.It’s very stupid satire, but it’s satire and it’s clearly protected speech under the First Amendment. But Klobuchar seems to believe that the First Amendment doesn’t seem to apply when people create satirical videos about her.So I was surprised later that week when I noticed a clip of me from that hearing circulating widely on X, to the tune of more than a million views. I clicked to see what was getting so much attention.That’s when I heard my voice — but certainly not me — spewing a vulgar and absurd critique of an ad campaign for jeans featuring Sydney Sweeney. The A.I. deepfake featured me using the phrase “perfect titties” and lamenting that Democrats were “too fat to wear jeans or too ugly to go outside.” Though I could immediately tell that someone used footage from the hearing to make a deepfake, there was no getting around the fact that it looked and sounded very real.As anyone would, I wanted the video taken downor at least labeled “digitally altered content.” It was using my likeness to stoke controversy where it did not exist. It had me saying vile things.Yeah, except the First Amendment doesn’t allow for a sitting senator to take down First Amendment-protected speech, in the same way that it doesn’t allow a sitting president to take down an AI-generated deep fake image of himself wandering naked in the desert. That’s political speech, as this deepfake was (even if it’s crude and silly).The contrast with how a competent politician handles this couldn’t be starker. When someone created an almost identical deepfake of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—same fake controversy, similarly ridiculous fake quotes—AOC didn’t run to write new censorship laws. Instead, when newscaster Chris Cuomo fell for it and stupidly tweeted at her as if the quotes were real, AOC simply mocked Cuomo for being a gullible hack.This is a deepfake dude. Please use your critical thinking skills. At this point you’re just reposting Facebook memes and calling it journalismThat’s the difference between understanding that political speech—even crude, stupid political speech—is protected, and having the authoritarian instinct to immediately reach for legal remedies against speech you don’t like.No calling for unconstitutional laws. No demanding the (in poor taste) satire be hidden. Just straight up mockery for anyone so stupid as to fall for it.Klobuchar uses this experience to call for a law even worse than the TAKE IT DOWN Act, her NO FAKES Act.That is why I am again working across the aisle on a bill to give all Americans more control over how deepfakes of our voices and visual likenesses are used. The proposed bipartisan NO FAKES Act, cosponsored by Senators Chris Coons, Marsha Blackburn, Thom Tillis and me, would give people the right to demand that social media companies remove deepfakes of their voice and likeness, while making exceptions for speech protected by the First Amendment.I mean, but this video is clearly protected by the First Amendment. And just this article is creating a chilling effect. I’m posting it only via a temporary, disposable, anonymous hosting service because the fact that a sitting US Senator is threatening platforms that host this content makes me wary of posting it there, even as the context here is obviously journalistic.NO FAKES creates a restrictive new legal regime for realistic, computer-generated, content that has been significantly altered or was never real in the first place. This “fake” content will be legal for creators who acquire licenses from the people depicted. But it is otherwise prohibited – subject to a long, hard-to-parse list of exceptions for First Amendment-protected speech like parody and news reporting. The difficulty of applying those exceptions or distinguishing real from fake content, along with the bill’s astronomical statutory damages, will cast a long shadow of potential liability over journalists, artists, parodists, and moreI mean, just the fact that Klobuchar herself is using First Amendment protected satire as her example of why she needs NO FAKES to remove that First Amendment-protected speech should tell you everything you need to know about the usefulness of the “ long, hard-to-parse list of exceptions for First Amendment-protected speech like parody and news reporting.”As Keller warns, NO FAKES would be a disaster for the open internet:The difficulty of applying those exceptions or distinguishing real from fake content, along with the bill’s astronomical statutory damages, will cast a long shadow of potential liability over journalists, artists, parodists, and more. That threat to legal speech is heightened by NO FAKES’ extensive new licensing regime, which will allow profit-motivated third party agents to demand payments from content creators and distributors on behalf of both the living and the dead. Finally, the bill establishes a “notice and takedown” regime that puts decisions about speech – along with major liability risks for leaving that speech online – in the hands of risk-averse private platforms. Once content is removed, many platforms – including ranging from Wikipedia to Craigslist and more – will need to deploy flawed technical filters that prevent other users from sharing the same material, even in new and lawful contexts. The bill almost seems designed to make platforms take down far more speech than lawmakers could ever prohibit under the First Amendment.If well-documented history is any guide, we should expect platforms to receive a deluge of mistaken or simply fraudulent notices targeting lawful speech under NO FAKES. The bill’s unclear mandates and steep statutory damages will give platforms every reason to comply with over-reaching takedown demands. A lot of these demands will likely come from ordinary people or the companies to whom those people license their rights, and target content that could plausibly be either real or fake. Sending groundless NO FAKES claims as damage control will also be a tempting option for powerful people who want to prevent the spread of embarrassing pictures they took with an old friend, Jumbotron footage, or “falsified” videos that may be offensive but are clearly labeled as satire.There’s a lot more in Keller’s paper that is worth reading, but I think Klobuchar’s own op-ed here tells us all we need to know about the problems of NO FAKES. She is responding to First Amendment-protected speech that parodies (poorly) her own speech, and her first reaction is “how can I pass a law to censor this speech.”Again, doing so at a time when those in power, including Donald Trump, have made it clear that they will use any technique at their disposal to intimidate and silence those who criticize or mock them is so incredibly tone deaf. Klobuchar is obsessed with “bipartisanship” at a time when that just means “giving fascists more powers to censor critics” and she’s ready to jump on board because some rando person made a silly, obviously fake satire video that made it look like she said silly things no one would ever think she’d actually say.It’s almost the perfect encapsulation of how out of touch and feckless Klobuchar is: she’s happy to hand an authoritarian, censor-happy government way more power to silence speech, so long as she also gets to remove a video that made fun of her.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple TV+ price jumps 30% to $12.99 monthly</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/apple-tv-price-jumps-30-to-12-99-monthly/</link><author>Aisha Malik</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:04:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The updated price is effective for new customers starting Thursday and will affect current subscribers 30 days after their next renewal date. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: Challenges You Will Face as Leader and How to Overcome Them (8/21/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/8-21-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:02:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, August 21, 2025?

From a report: The Federal Communications Commission last year fined T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon, saying the carriers illegally shared access to customers' location information without consent and did not take reasonable measures to protect that sensitive data against unauthorized disclosure. The fines relate to sharing of real-time location data that was revealed in 2018, but it took years for the FCC to finalize the penalties. 

The three carriers appealed the rulings in three different courts, and the first major decision was handed down Friday. A three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously against T-Mobile and its subsidiary Sprint. "Every cell phone is a tracking device," the ruling begins. "To receive service, a cell phone must periodically connect with the nearest tower in a wireless carrier's network. Each time it does, it sends the carrier a record of the phone's location and, by extension, the location of the customer who owns it. Over time, this information becomes an exhaustive history of a customer's whereabouts and 'provides an intimate window into [that] person's life.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>YouTube Music celebrates 10 years with new features that help it compete with Spotify</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/youtube-music-celebrates-10-years-with-new-features-that-help-it-compete-with-spotify/</link><author>Sarah Perez</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[YouTube Music is rolling out taste match playlists, comments, badges and more. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Instagram now lets creators link multiple reels in a series</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/instagram-now-lets-creators-link-multiple-reels-in-a-series/</link><author>Aisha Malik</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Now if a creator is telling a story in a series of videos and follow-ups, they can now link them all together so that viewers don't have to scroll or search for different parts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Footage Combined With AI Slop About DC Is Creating a Disinformation Mess on TikTok</title><link>https://www.404media.co/real-footage-combined-with-a-ai-slop-about-dc-is-creating-a-disinformation-mess-on-tiktok/</link><author>Rosie Thomas</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-21-at-12.04.55.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TikTok is full of AI slop videos about the National Guard’s deployment in Washington, D.C., some of which use Google’s new VEO AI video generator. Unlike previous efforts to flood the zone with AI slop in the aftermath of a disaster or major news event, some of the videos blend real footage with AI footage, making it harder than ever to tell what’s real and what’s not, which has the effect of distorting people’s understanding of the military occupation of DC.At the start of last week, the Trump administration announced that all homeless people should immediately Washington DC. This was followed by an order to Federal agents to occupy the city and remove tents where homeless people had been living. These events were reported on by many news outlets, for example,  shows the reality of at least one part of the exercise. On TikTok, though, this is just another popular trending topic, where slop creators and influencers can work together to create and propagate misinformation.  404 Media has previously covered how perceptions of real-life events can be quickly manipulated with AI images and footage; this is more of the same; with the release of new, better AI video creation tools like Google’s VEO, the footage is more convincing than ever. Some of the slop is obvious fantasy-driven engagement farming and gives itself away aesthetically or through content.  and  show tents being pulled from a vast field into the back of a moving garbage truck, with the Capitol building in the background, on the Washington Mall. They’re not tagged as AI, but at least a few people in the comments are able to identify them as such; both videos still have over 100,000 views. This somehow more harrowing one feat. Hunger Games song has 41,000. With something like , made with VEO, the slop begins to feel more like a traditional news report. It has 146,000 views and it’s made of several short clips with news-anchorish voiceover. I had to scroll down past a lot of “Thank you president Trump” and “good job officers” comments to find any  that pointed out that it was fake, even though the watermark for Google’s VEO generator is in the corner. The voiceover also “reports” semi-accurately on what happened in DC, but without any specifics: “Police moved in today, to clear out a homeless camp in the city. City crews tore down tents, packed up belongings, and swept the park clean. Some protested, some begged for more time. But the cleanup went on. What was once a community is now just an empty field.” I found the same video posted to X, with commenters on both platforms taking offence at the use of the term “community.” I also found several examples of shorter slop clips like this one, which has almost 1 million views, and , with almost half a million, which both exaggerate the scale and disarray of the encampments. In one of the videos, the entirety of an area that looks like the National Mall (but isn’t) has been taken over by tents. Quickly scrolling these videos gives the viewer an incorrect understanding of what the DC “camps” and “cleanup” looked like. The account that posted these videos was called Hush Documentary when I first encountered it, but had changed its name to viralsayings by Monday evening. The profile also has a five-second AI-generated footage of ATF officers patrolling a neighborhood; marked as AI, with 89,000 views. What’s happening also is that real footage and fake footage are being mixed together in a popular greenscreen TikTok format where a person gives commentary (basically, reporting or commenting on the news) while footage plays in the background. That is happening in this clip, which features that same AI footage of ATF officers. I ended up finding a ton of instances where accounts mixed slop clips of the camp clearings, with seemingly real footage—notably many of them included this viral original footage of police clearing a homeless encampment in Georgetown. But a lot of them are ripping each other off. For example, many accounts have ripped off the voiceover of this viral clip from @Alfredito_mx (which features real footage) and have put it over top of AI footage.  omivzfrru2 has nearly 200,000 and features both real and AI clips; I found at , all with between ~2000 and 5000 views. The scraping-and-recreating robot went extra hard with this one - the editing is super glitchy, the videos overlay each other, the host flickers around the screen, and random legs walk by in the background. So, one viral video from a popular creator has spawned thousands of mirrors in the hope of chipping off a small amount of the engagement of the original; those copies need footage, go looking for content in the tags, encounter the slop, and can’t tell / don’t care if it’s real. Then more thousands of people see the slop copies and end up getting a totally incorrect view of an actual unfolding news situation.  In these videos, it’s only totally clear to me that the content is fake because I found the original sources. Lots of this footage is obviously fake if you’re familiar with the actual situation in DC or familiar with the geography and streets in DC. But most people are not. If you told me “some of these shots are AI,” I don’t think I could identify all of those shots confidently. Is the flicker or blurring onscreen from the footage, from a bad camera, from a time-lapse or being sped up, from endless replication online, or from the bad green screen of a “host”? Now, scrolling social media means encountering a mix of real and fake video, and the AI fakes are getting good enough that deciphering what’s actually happening requires a level of attention to detail that most people don’t have the knowledge or time for. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everything We Know Right Now About Artificial, the OpenAI Movie</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/everything-we-know-right-now-about-artificial-the-openai-movie?source=rss</link><author>Failover</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:22:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Luca Guadagnino is directing a comedic biopic about OpenAI’s 2023 boardroom chaos.

Thousands upon thousands of developers push Flutter apps to the App Store and Play Store every month. But with great power comes great responsibility.After reviewing dozens of projects, I noticed recurring mistakes—some minor, others serious performance and scaling bottlenecks—that, if not addressed properly, can lead to major headaches in production apps.Here are 10 of the most common Flutter mistakes I observed, why they happen, and how to fix them.Developers often wrap whole screens with a  even when only a small part of the screen needs state updates.Extract state to smaller components so only vital components are rebuilt.class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [
          CounterWidget(), // Only this rebuilds
          Expanded(child: HeavyContentWidget()),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
  int counter = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      children: [
        Text('Counter: $counter'),
        IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.add),
          onPressed: () => setState(() => counter++),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
2. Ignoring App Lifecycle EventsImproper handling of app lifecycle changes can lead to token mismanagement, improper connection changes handling, and even loss of unsaved user data in some cases.Use  to listen to lifecycle changes and handle relevant app components.class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    switch (state) {
      case AppLifecycleState.paused:
        saveUserProgress();
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.resumed:
        refreshSession();
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => MaterialApp(home: HomeScreen());
}
3. Neglecting Error Handling for Async API CallsFailed async API calls can throw exceptions or even crash the app if not taken care of properly.Wrap your async API calls with  block and handle failures gracefully:Future<void> fetchData() async {
  try {
    final data = await api.getData();
    setState(() => items = data);
  } catch (e, stack) {
    log('Fetch error: $e', stackTrace: stack);
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Failed to load data. Please try again.')),
    );
  }
}
Using just  method to contain all of your widget code making it bulky and inefficient. Break down your  method code into smaller components:Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Dashboard')),
    body: Column(
      children: [
        UserGreeting(user: user),
        Expanded(child: ActivityFeed()),
        FooterNavigation(),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
5. Hardcoding Screen SizesUsing fixed hardcoded widths/heights values that can break UI on tablets or foldable devices.Use responsive layouts using :final width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
return Container(
  width: width * 0.8,
  child: Text('Responsive Design'),
);
Fetching the same API data again and again unnecessarily.Cache data and manage it globally instead of calling the API every time:late Future<List<Post>> postsFuture;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  postsFuture = api.fetchPosts();
}

FutureBuilder(
  future: postsFuture,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
    } else {
      return PostList(posts: snapshot.data!);
    }
  },
);
7. Ignoring Null Safety Edge CasesUsing  operator everywhere without understanding the risks that come with it.Always use null-aware operators to avoid null data errors:final username = user?.name ?? 'Guest';
if (user?.email != null) {
  sendEmail(user!.email!);
}
8. Blocking the Main ThreadRunning heavy tasks (e.g., JSON parsing, encryption, loading DB) on the main thread that jams or janks the UI.Use isolates or async functions to avoid main thread blockage:Future<int> processData(int value) async {
  return compute(_heavyTask, value);
}

int _heavyTask(int input) {
  // Heavy computation
  return input * 42;
}
App deployment without analyzing UI janks or widget rebuild counts that consume extra resources.Use  and Flutter DevTools.10. Poor Internationalization (i18n) PracticesHardcoding strings into  widgets and ignoring localizations.Use  or  to localize your app the proper way.Add the package into your  file:dependencies:
  easy_localization: latest_version
Wrap your app with void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await EasyLocalization.ensureInitialized();

  runApp(
    EasyLocalization(
      supportedLocales: [Locale('en'), Locale('es')],
      path: 'assets/translations', // JSON files here
      fallbackLocale: Locale('en'),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
Add translation as JSON files atassets/translations/en.json{ "welcome": "Welcome to our app" }
and at assets/translations/es.json{ "welcome": "Bienvenido a nuestra aplicación" }
Use translations in  widgetsNow adding new language support is just one JSON file away.Flutter enables fast cross-platform app development and delivery, but speed can become a headache if not managed properly. Overusing , hardcoding layouts, skipping lifecycle management, or ignoring i18n may not seem critical in the MVP phase, but they will create problems as your app scales.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Will Not Approve Solar or Wind Power Projects, President Says</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/08/21/1224252/us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects-president-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 14:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump says his administration will not approve solar or wind power projects, even as electricity demand is outpacing the supply in some parts of the U.S. From a report: "We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar," Trump, who has complained in the past that solar takes up too much land, posted on Truth Social.

While TMX data shows Canadian exchanges handled 1,242 mining financing transactions worth $10.4 billion in 2024, maintaining their position as global leaders by transaction count, industry observers note that capital increasingly flows to established producers rather than early-stage explorers. This comes as new regulatory barriers and market structure changes make it harder for foreign investors to participate, just when the sector most needs to attract fresh sources of capital from younger investors who have so far overlooked mining in favor of digital assets.Three Key Barriers to Foreign Investment in Canadian Junior MiningTighter National Security ReviewsEuropean Sustainability RegulationsMany international investors access Canadian markets through European funds subject to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. In June 2024, Europe's three financial supervisory authorities recommended replacing the current "Article 8/9" classification system with clearer "sustainable" and "transition" product categories, along with new sustainability indicators.These evolving requirements raise the bar for disclosure and classification, potentially excluding many junior mining companies from funds marketed as environmentally or socially responsible investments. Early-stage mining operations can still qualify, but meeting the thresholds has become more challenging.Domestic Market Structure ConcernsAdditionally, private placements, which junior miners rely on heavily for financing, face a mandatory "four months plus a day" resale restriction under Canada's National Instrument 45-102. The exchange can impose additional holding periods. These restrictions create uncertainty for institutional investors who need clear exit strategies.Adding to the complexity, British Columbia introduced the Mineral Claims Consultation Framework on March 26, 2025, following a 2023 court decision that staking claims can trigger a duty to consult First Nations. The new system replaces online "click-to-stake" with a requirement for applications and consultations before registration, adding time and complexity that investors must factor into their planning.Can Tokenization Bridge Two Worlds?A potential solution is emerging through tokenized funds that could address both challenges: easing access for traditional foreign investors while potentially attracting younger investors who have gravitated toward technology and cryptocurrency over mining stocks.It's important to clarify that tokenized funds are not cryptocurrency speculation. These are conventional, regulated investment funds whose shares are recorded on blockchain technology while maintaining traditional custody arrangements, transfer agents, and know-your-customer procedures. The technology simply makes distribution more efficient by enabling easier cross-border subscriptions, automated compliance, and faster transfers, all within existing securities law frameworks.For traditional foreign investors, tokenization solves practical problems. Rather than navigating Canada's complex regulatory landscape directly, they can invest through tokenized feeder funds domiciled in their home jurisdictions that aggregate demand and purchase Canadian mining equities through traditional exchanges.For younger investors comfortable with digital assets, tokenized funds offer a familiar technological interface to access an sector they have largely ignored. Tokenized funds could provide a bridge, packaging traditional mining investments in a modern technological wrapper that resonates with digital-native investors.For Canadian mining, this technology offers a bridge. Rather than requiring a German ESG fund, a Singapore family office, or a U.S. institution to purchase restricted TSX Venture securities directly, a tokenized feeder fund domiciled in their home jurisdiction can aggregate demand and invest in Canadian mining equities through traditional exchanges. Canadian securities rules still apply to the underlying positions, but investors experience faster onboarding, settlement, and the ability to transfer fund shares more efficiently.What Tokenization Can and Cannot Achieve for Junior Mining in CanadaTokenized funds can improve market access and infrastructure. Faster settlement, lower investment minimums, and enhanced data reporting can help ESG-focused investors better assess portfolios, particularly as European sustainability rules continue evolving.However, this technology cannot bypass Canadian law. If a foreign fund accumulates a significant stake in a Canadian critical minerals company, Investment Canada Act review requirements still apply. Similarly, if a fund purchases shares through a private placement, the four-month-plus-one-day restriction under National Instrument 45-102 still applies to those shares within the fund, regardless of whether the fund's own units are tokenized.With national security reviews tightening, British Columbia's consultation requirements now embedded in the claims process, European ESG rules in transition, and ongoing concerns about market structure, foreign investors need smoother access routes to invest in Canada’s mining industry. Tokenized fund infrastructure, already being scaled by BlackRock, UBS, and Franklin Templeton, provides a potential solution to both challenges. For foreign investors, it offers cleaner access paths. For younger, tech-savvy investors, it presents mining opportunities through a familiar digital framework.The critical question is whether Canadian policymakers and exchanges will embrace this shift. This requires not only clarity on how the Investment Canada Act treats widely held foreign funds and ensuring predictable provincial processes, but also modernizing Canada's fragmented digital asset regulations. While Canada was among the first to regulate crypto trading and has approved crypto ETFs, it still lacks a unified federal framework for tokenized securities. Without clear rules for how tokenized fund shares are treated under securities law across provinces, the technology's potential to bridge traditional mining finance with digital-native investors remains constrained.Without these adaptations, the next cycle's discovery capital may increasingly be organized in Singapore, New York, or Abu Dhabi, with Canada serving as a target market rather than the capital hub it has historically been. The technology exists not just to maintain Canada's position, but potentially to expand its investor base to include a generation that has so far overlooked mining. What remains to be seen is whether the regulatory framework will evolve to support it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Simplify API Testing with One Simple Postman Script</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/simplify-api-testing-with-one-simple-postman-script?source=rss</link><author>Ileolami</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 14:24:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past two months, I have been exploring API and software testing, and I can tell you it hasn't been easy for me. I always thought, "Isn't it just testing?" but I was wrong. Testing is about ensuring the application works as expected and identifying any vulnerabilities or issues within it.Recently, I have been overwhelmed by copying IDs from one endpoint to another because the testing had to be done manually. One of the challenges is copying the bearer token and saving it. Not-so-fun fact: This bearer token expires every 15 minutes.I won't lie; it's exhausting and frustrating. Then today, something changed when a developer told me, "You should find a way for the bearer token to be generated automatically so you don't have to go through the stress of copying the token every time."At first, it seemed impossible, but then I sat down, and after two hours with ChatGPT, I was able to create a script that automates this process for me.The Automation Script and Breakdown:::info

This pivotal block of circuitry occupies the location where physical phenomena meet compute capability and is central to precise sensing and measurement in markets ranging from medical electronics and industrial automation to instrumentation systems.Let's venture into the uncharted realm of AFE design and see what makes op-amps, filters, and ADCs combine to create the accuracy backbone of today's electronics.What is an Analog Front-End?An Analog Front-End (AFE) is a signal-conditioning system that's used to capture, filter, and amplify analog signals prior to them being converted into digital signals. Such signals, quite commonly originating from sensors or transducers, tend to be low-level and noisy—meaning they need specialized handling before they can be processed by a microcontroller or digital signal processor (DSP).An AFE essentially gets the signal ready for the shift from the analog realm to the digital world. Core Elements of an AFE Circuit Designing an AFE requires choosing and optimizing a number of interdependent analog building blocks, each designed to maintain signal integrity across a variety of noise and bandwidth constraints.Low-Noise Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) Central to most AFEs is the op-amp. It's employed for signal amplification, buffering, and filtering. Input-referred noise: Particularly critical in low-signal applications such as ECG or seismic monitoring. Gain-bandwidth product (GBW): Must equal the frequency characteristics of the signal. Offset voltage and drift: Essential for long-term accuracy and temperature stability. Femtoamp input bias currents and nanovolt noise floors are typical in medical and scientific apparatus.Analog Filters Signals need to be filtered of unwanted frequency content before being converted to digital. Low-pass filters (LPF): Block high-frequency noise and aliasing in ADCs. Band-pass filters (BPF): Filter signal bands, applied in applications such as EEG or vibration sensing. High-pass filters (HPF): Remove DC offsets or baseline drift. Most filters are designed with RC networks and op-amps (active filters) for the sake of accuracy.Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) The last stage of the AFE converts digital bits from analog signals. Resolution (bits): Defines the level of detail at which a signal is quantized—higher resolution for better measurements. Sampling rate: A minimum of twice as high as the highest signal frequency (according to Nyquist theorem). Input voltage range: Compatible with the output swing of the previous analog stage. Architecture: SAR (Successive Approximation Register) ADCs for moderate-speed, high-resolution applications; Sigma-Delta for low-speed, ultra-high-precision applications. ADC Architecture Comparison|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
|  | Moderate (up to ~10 MSPS) |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  | Industrial control, battery monitoring | Medical sensing, audio, precision instrumentation |
|  |  | More complex, requires decimation filters |Critical AFE Design ConsiderationsSignal Integrity and Impedance MatchingAFE circuits need to preserve signal integrity when handling high-impedance sensors or extended cable lengths. It is imperative to use buffering stages and optimal impedance matching to avoid signal attenuation.Common-Mode Rejection and GroundingInstrumentation amplifiers and differential signal acquisition reject common-mode noise—especially in noisy electric environments. Effective PCB grounding schemes (star grounding, ground planes) are necessary to ensure minimal hum and ground loops.PCB Layout and Noise ImmunityAFE performance can be ruined by bad layout. Methods involve:Accurate decoupling of power railsIsolation of analog and digital groundsShielding sensitive analog traces from EMIMinimizing Noise in AFE DesignNoise is the archenemy of precision. AFE designers need to consider several sources of noise:Thermal noise: Inherent to resistors and conductors.Flicker noise (1/f noise): Relevant in low-frequency measurements.Quantization noise: Added during ADC conversion.Environmental noise: From switching regulators, wireless signals, or other digital circuits nearby.Solutions are low-noise components, shielded enclosures, and adequate filtering.Minimizing Noise in AFE DesignNoise is the nemesis of precision. Several noise types must be mitigated:Thermal noise: From resistors and semiconductors.Flicker noise (1/f): Dominant at low frequencies.Quantization noise: Introduced during digitization.Environmental noise: From switching power supplies, RF interference, etc.Mitigation strategies include choosing low-noise components, isolating sensitive analog paths, and using EMI shielding.Design Trade-Offs in AFE DevelopmentEvery AFE design must strike a balance among competing requirements:Critical AFE Design ConsiderationsSignal Integrity and Impedance MatchingAFE circuits need to preserve signal integrity when handling high-impedance sensors or extended cable lengths.

|----|----|
| Noise vs. Power | Low-noise designs often require more power for amplification and filtering. |
| Resolution vs. Speed | Higher resolution ADCs usually have slower conversion rates. |
| Integration vs. Flexibility | Integrated AFEs reduce size and cost but may sacrifice customizability. |
| Cost vs. Performance | Precision op-amps and high-resolution ADCs come at a premium. |\
Designers must tailor these trade-offs to suit the application’s constraints—whether it’s battery life in wearables or bandwidth in radar systems.Case Study: AFE for Biomedical InstrumentationFor an ECG (electrocardiogram) monitoring system, for example. The AFE is required to:Process microvolt-level signals from the human body.Have high common-mode rejection (usually > 100 dB).Prevent patient current leakage (safety standards such as IEC 60601).\
This arrangement could employ an instrumentation amplifier, active band-pass filter (0.05–100 Hz), and high-resolution sigma-delta ADC—demonstrating the subtlety of the engineering.Broader Application DomainsBeyond biomedical applications, AFEs serve across various industries:Automotive: Sensor data for ADAS, tire pressure monitoring (ISO 26262)Aerospace: Vibration analysis, inertial navigationEnvironmental monitoring: Air quality sensors, water pollution analyzersIndustrial automation: Motor control feedback, robotic joint sensing (IEC 61000 for EMC compliance)Each application demands a unique combination of noise immunity, speed, accuracy, and reliability—highlighting the versatility of AFE design.Utilization of AFE Design in TransportationThe transportation industry increasingly relies on precise signal processing and real-time monitoring, both of which are facilitated by AFE technology. Key applications include:Vehicle Sensing and Control \n -AFEs are critical in processing signals from sensors used in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), such as radar, lidar, and ultrasonic sensors. \n -High-precision AFEs enable accurate detection of obstacles, lane markings, and environmental conditions, essential for autonomous driving and safety features.Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance \n In railways, aviation, and fleet vehicles, AFEs process signals from sensors that monitor vibration, temperature, and pressure. These signals are used for real-time health monitoring of engines, brakes, and other critical components, allowing for predictive maintenance and reducing downtime and operational costs.Environmental and Infrastructure Sensing \n Transportation systems also rely on AFEs for data processing from weather stations, air quality monitors, and structural health sensors embedded infrastructure like bridges and tunnels. Robust AFE design ensures reliability even in harsh environments characterized by high electromagnetic interference and extreme temperatures.**Electric and Hybrid Vehicles
\ -Battery Management Systems (BMS) use AFEs to monitor voltages, currents, and temperatures within battery cells, ensuring safety and optimal performance. \n -Powertrain control units depend on low-noise, high-speed AFEs to manage real-time motor control, ensuring efficient energy use and performance.Benefits in Transportation: Precision in signal conditioning improves safety-critical systems like collision avoidance, emergency braking, and lane departure warnings.: Reliable sensor data enables better control algorithms, reducing energy consumption and wear on critical components.: Integrated AFE solutions facilitate the growing number of sensors in modern vehicles and transportation infrastructure.: Robust AFE design ensures consistent performance in challenging environments, from urban traffic to remote railway tracks.Trends in AFE IntegrationSystems today tend to be miniaturized and more reliable. This has promoted increasing numbers of fully integrated AFE chips that combine amplifiers, filters, and ADCs in one package.AFE4400 from Texas Instruments (for photoplethysmography)ADAS1000 from Analog Devices (for ECG signal acquisition)These combined solutions provide lower BOM cost, improved calibration, and quicker time-to-market—particularly in wearable and portable devices.Another trend on the rise is the incorporation of on-chip DSP blocks within AFE ICs, enabling some degree of digital processing (e.g., filtering, thresholding) prior to the data even getting to a microcontroller.Analog Front-End design is the combination of high-precision analog circuitry with rugged system engineering. From amplifying millivolt signals to removing kilohertz-level noise, AFEs are the unseen but essential connection between the physical world and digital intelligence.In an age of development toward AI, IoT, and smart sensing, the need for precise and low-noise AFE design is greater than ever. Whether monitoring a heartbeat or listening for vibrations in an industrial factory, AFEs guarantee that every digital conclusion starts with a clean, dependable analog signal.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Leading the Cloud Revolution: Antara’s Enterprise-Scale Transformation and DevSecOps Innovation</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/leading-the-cloud-revolution-antaras-enterprise-scale-transformation-and-devsecops-innovation?source=rss</link><author>Sanya Kapoor</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 14:02:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cloud Engineer Antara spearheaded a full-scale migration from on-prem to AWS, achieving 83% cost reduction, 45% less downtime, and scalable architecture.

He enters some commands with the built-in buttons, then walks over to a nearby car. At first, its doors are locked, and the man tugs on one of them unsuccessfully. He then pushes a button on the gadget in his hand, and the door now unlocks.The tech used here is the popular Flipper Zero, an ethical hacker’s swiss army knife, capable of all sorts of things such as WiFi attacks . Now, 404 Media has found an underground trade where much shadier hackers sell extra software and patches for the Flipper Zero to unlock all manner of cars, including models popular in the U.S. The hackers say the tool can be used against Ford, Audi, Volkswagen, Subaru, Hyundai, Kia, and several other brands, including sometimes dozens of specific vehicle models, with no easy fix from car manufacturers. Do you know anything else about people using the Flipper Zero to break into cars? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.These tools are primarily sold for a fee, keeping their distribution somewhat limited to those willing to pay. But, there is the looming threat that this software may soon reach a wider audience of thieves. Straight Arrow News (SAN) previously covered the same tech in July, and the outlet said it successfully tested the tool on a vehicle. Now people are cracking the software, meaning it can be used for free. Discord servers with hundreds of members are seeing more people join, with current members trolling the newbies with fake patches and download links. If the tech gets out, it threatens to supercharge car thefts across the country, especially those part of the social media phenomenon known as Kia Boys in which young men, , steal and joyride Kia and Hyundai cars specifically because of the vehicles’ notoriously poor security. Apply that brazeness to all of the other car models the Flipper Zero patches can target, and members of the car hacking community expect thieves to start using the easy to source gadget.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Veeresh Nunavath Built a National-Scale Cloud Observability Platform for Telecom Reliability</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-veeresh-nunavath-built-a-national-scale-cloud-observability-platform-for-telecom-reliability?source=rss</link><author>Sanya Kapoor</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:25:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Senior Technical Manager Veeresh Nunavath built a national-scale cloud observability platform unifying distributed Kubernetes clusters across hybrid clouds.

The former employee alleges the social media giant artificially inflated return on ad spend (ROAS) by counting shipping fees as revenue, subsidizing bids in ad auctions, and applying undisclosed discounts. The complaint, viewed by ADWEEK, was filed with the London Central Employment Tribunal on Wednesday (August 20) by Samujjal Purkayastha, a former product manager on Meta's Shops ads team. The document claims Meta artificially inflated performance metrics to push brands toward its fledgling ecommerce ad product.
 
The company's motivation, the complaint says, was in part to combat Apple's 2021 privacy changes that cut the troves of iOS tracking information that had long powered Meta's ad machine. Meta's former chief financial officer (CFO), David Wehner, said the changes would cost "on the order of $10 billion" in losses during the company's Q4 2021 earnings call. User purchases on Facebook or Instagram Shops pages would provide more first-party data, however. Purkayastha, who joined Meta (then Facebook) in 2020 as a product manager on the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Applied Research team, was reassigned to the Shops Ads team in March 2022 and remained at the company until Feb. 19, 2025, when he was terminated.
 
He alleged that during internal reviews in early 2024, Meta data scientists found the return on ad spend (ROAS) from Shops ads had been inflated between 17% and 19%. This discrepancy stemmed from Meta counting shipping fees and taxes as part of a sale, even though that money never went to merchants, he alleged. The company's other ad products exclude those figures, in line with competitors like Google, the complaint reads. Without including the fees and taxes, Shops ads performed no better than Meta's traditional ads, Purkayastha claimed. "This was significant," the complaint reads. "In addition to the ROAS performance metric being overstated by nearly a fifth, it meant that, rather than having exceeded our primary target, the Shops Ads team had in fact missed it once the figure was reduced to take account of the artificial inflation." Purkayastha raised these concerns with senior leadership in multiple meetings between 2022 and 2024, and is now seeking interim relief through his employment tribunal filing to have his former position reinstated.
 
A Meta spokesperson told ADWEEK the company is "actively defending these proceedings," adding that "allegations related to the integrity of our advertising practices are without merit and we have full confidence in our performance review processes."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Compute Runtime 25.31.34666.3 Continues Prepping For Panther Lake</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-CR-25.31.34666.3</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:35:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Released minutes ago was the newest monthly feature release to the Intel Compute Runtime providing open-source OpenCL and Level Zero capabilities on Intel graphics hardware...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia is latest investor to back AV startup Nuro in $203M funding round</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/nvidia-is-latest-investor-to-back-av-startup-nuro-in-203m-funding-round/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nuro has attracted more investors, and capital, to push its Series E round to $203 million. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hackers who exposed North Korean government hacker explain why they did it</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/hackers-who-exposed-north-korean-government-hacker-explain-why-they-did-it/</link><author>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The two self-described hacktivists said they had access to the North Korean spy’s computer for around four months before deciding what they had found should be made public. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Admin Kills Enforcement Action Against 165 Corporations For Various Bullshit And Fraud</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/21/trump-admin-kills-enforcement-action-against-165-corporations-for-various-bullshit-and-fraud/</link><author>Karl Bode</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:22:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I don’t mean to harp on this, but a  promise of the Trump administration during the last election season was that a second Trump term would “take aim at big tech,” protect the little guy, rein in corporate power, and even “continue the legacy of antitrust enforcers like Lina Khan.” The press was filled with endless stories credibly parroting these sorts of claims, all day, everyday. Six months later and it’s nothing but corruption and cronyism as far as the eye can see. The Trump administration and its courts have effectively destroyed regulatory independence, federal consumer protection, and public safety oversight. Massive, terrible mergers are rubber stamped with reckless abandon, provided companies show authoritarian leadership they’re racist and feckless enough. A recent report by nonprofit consumer advocacy firm Public Citizen calculated that the Trump administration has frozen regulatory action for at least 165 corporations under investigation for a wide variety of abuses, crimes, and fraud. Many of them where the exact kind of “big tech” companies that the Trump administration repeatedly claimed they’d be tough on:“In six months, the Trump administration has already withdrawn or halted enforcement actions against  corporations of all types – and  of the corporations benefiting from halted or dropped enforcement is from the technology sector, which has spent  on political influence during and since the 2024 elections.”The press hasn’t really explained this to the public very well, but effectively all U.S. public safety, labor, consumer, and other protections are dead in the water, something that will inevitably result in mass illness, disability, and death. The majority of efforts to hold corporations accountable now routinely run into Trump-stocked courts that will insist agencies have overstepped their ever-dwindling regulatory authority. It’s radical extremism, but it’s never framed as extremism in the press. Despite the “feud” between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, this has proven particularly beneficial to guys like Musk, who have seen more than 40 different regulatory inquiries into his companies just magically evaporate in a little over six months. Dodgy financial fraudsters in the crypto space have also been massive beneficiaries of the outright assault on corporate oversight. It’s the golden age of corruption, much of the damage will be permanent, and the impact will reverberate for a generation or longer. This is, curiously, not of interest to the press. Despite the fact the horrors over the horizon will offer endlessly opportunity for hyperbolic headlines. I seem to recall several years of claims from pundits and media outlets that Trump was going to be “tough on big tech” and would be “serious about antitrust.” In reality, as I tried to warn repeatedly in the run up to the election, Trump was simply seeking leverage that he could use to bully tech companies into being friendlier to authoritarians and authoritarian propaganda (quite successfully, as it turned out).Unsurprisingly, authoritarians don’t care about healthy markets, robust competition, or the public interest, they care about their own personal wealth and power. Everything else is bullshit. Yet, curiously, the consolidated, corporate U.S. press doesn’t seem nearly as interested in covering our day to day corruption and cronyism as they were in propping up Trump’s fake populism during the the last election season. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>VKD3D 1.17 Released With More Improvements For Direct3D 12 On Vulkan</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/VKD3D-1.17-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 11:58:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[VKD3D 1.17 made its debut this morning as the newest version of this Direct3D 12 over Vulkan API implementation...]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
