"Since I'm a journalist, or at least close enough, I decided that I should at least get Stellantis/Jeep's side of things," writes car-culture site The Autopian:


Would Stellantis do something so woefully misguided and annoying? I reached out to our Stellantis/Jeep contact to ask and was initially told that they were "investigating" on their end, which to me felt like a stalling tactic while the proper ass-covering plans were conceived. I eventually got this response from a Stellantis spokesperson: 

 "This was an in-vehicle message designed to inform Jeep customers about Mopar extended vehicle care options. A temporary software glitch affected the ability to instantly opt out in a few isolated cases, though instant opt-out is the standard for all our in-vehicle messages. Our team had already identified and corrected the error, and we are following up directly with the customer to ensure the matter is fully resolved..." 

I suppose a glitch is possible, though I've not seen any examples of this ad popping up with the instant opt-out option available, but I guess it must exist, since not all Jeep owners seem to have had to deal with these ads. I suspect if this was happening to more people than these "few isolated cases" we'd still be cleaning up from the aftermath of the riots and uprisings. 

Because, as they write, "Really, I can't think of a quicker way to incur the wrath of nearly every human..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is an encryption backdoor?</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/what-is-an-encryption-backdoor/</link><author>Natasha Lomas</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Talk of backdoors in encrypted services is once again doing the rounds after reports emerged that the U.K. government is seeking to force Apple to open up iCloud’s end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) device backup offering.

A study reconstructed wild weather events through the eyes of record-keepers during this fraught period, opening a tantalizing window into climate extremes unleashed by a vengeful God (according to contemporary reports).Then: making love the medaka way (get those anal fins ready). Next, the chillest insect in Antarctica (also: the only one). Finally, these turtles will dance for food, and yes, it’s very cute.The Haunting Weather Reports of 16th Century TransylvaniaRejoice, for this week has delivered one of the best varieties of study: Science via historical documents. Sure, ice cores and geological strata are great for reconstructing past climates, but nobody can bitch about the weather better than a good old-fashioned red-blooded member of team . To that end, researchers searched for mentions of weird weather across a trove of diaries, monastery records, travel notes, and other documents from 16th century Transylvania, during a “pivotal moment in climate history” when a centuries-long cooling event called the Little Ice Age intensified, according to researchers led by Ovidiu Răzvan Gaceu of the University of Oradea. These types of studies are packed with colorful human testimonies that can corroborate natural records. More importantly, though, they are just fun to read, especially during such an evocative time and place, freshly haunted by the vampiric spirit of Vlad the Impaler. Some highlights:In August 1526, heavy rainfall caused freak floods in Braşov that “washed the walls of the fortress, demolished the main gate, and the fish also got caught in the big church,” according to the Annals of Brașov. Fish in the church! The ultimate baptism.  In autumn 1553, people in the city of Cluj reported unusual weather events including “October strawberries.” For real, October is for pumpkins, get out of here with the strawbs. Turned out it was a bad omen—there was a plague the following winter. Keep that in mind if you see any late autumn strawberries: Kill on sight.Naturally, a lot of these accounts are heartbreaking. Locusts “sometimes covered the whole sky and destroyed grain crops” and caused terrible famines. A storm-related fire “killed 14 people and made 60 poor.” On September 29, 1582, “there was such a big storm, as it was said that it had never been seen before in the city of Cluj, which uprooted the trees and raised the roofs of the houses, people believed that it is sent by divinity to punish the crimes committed by them.” I mean, I’m not saying these people weren’t doing crimes. It’s 16th century Transylvania. Do what you gotta do. But that's not why there is extreme weather. You’re just in the Little Ice Age. The study ultimately identified “multiple pieces of evidence associated with extreme weather events, including 40 unusually warm summers and several years of excess precipitation or drought.” Taken together with natural archives, the documents paint a picture of troubled times, exacerbated by an unstable climate and possible emergent vampires. Relatable! Valentine’s Day is over, but the romantic mood is still in the air—or in the water, if you’re a medaka (flawless segue). Scientists have discovered that wild medaka, also known as Japanese rice fish, are fans of late-night booty calls, which is a behavior that has not been observed in captivity.“Although medaka and other model organisms are invaluable in laboratories, their ecology in the wild remains largely unknown,” said researchers led by Yuki Kondo of Osaka Metropolitan University. “This study showed that medaka in the wild initiate spawning during late nocturnal hours and exhibit vigorous courtship behavior at midnight.”Kondo and her colleagues recorded this vigorous courtship by placing GoPros into streams over the course of several summer nights in Gifu, Japan. The tapes revealed that medaka like to spawn in the dark, possibly to avoid predators during copulation. The results “provide the first empirical evidence that medaka mating begins significantly earlier than previously reported in the laboratory.”  For anyone who feels clueless about courtship, may I offer a page from the Medaka Sutra: “The spawning behavior of medaka follows a sequence of events: the male chases the female (following), the male swims rapidly around the female (quick circle), the male wraps his dorsal and anal fins around the female (wrapping), the female releases eggs, the male releases sperm (egg and sperm release), and the male leaves the female (leaving),” according to Kondo’s team.The only true love language is, indeed, spoken with anal fins.Major bonus points also go to Osaka Metropolitan University’s press team for throwing together this version of Edward Hopper’s famous “Nighthawks” painting with medaka getting drinks at a bar that is also named Medaka. It is genuinely one of the most inspired public relations efforts I have ever seen, and I’m going to get a print of it to hang on my wall.The Insect at the Edge of Earth, or the Antarctic midge, is the only insect that lives year-round on its namesake continent. Do you know how weird you have to be to be the  insect somewhere? But this midge doesn’t care. It just lives out its bug life, which lasts two years, in an otherwise bugless wasteland. Humans definitely care about the midge, though—how could we not? What is it doing there? How is it not dead? What can it teach us about cryopreservation? These questions are addressed in a new study that resolved mysteries about the animal’s interesting life cycle.“Freeze tolerance and cryoprotective dehydration are cold tolerance strategies used by various invertebrate species in polar regions and indeed,  utilises both for overwintering,” said researchers led by Mizuki Yoshida of the Ohio State University, who completed the project while at Osaka Metropolitan University (OMU killing it this week). “Larvae that are frozen in ice and cryoprotectively dehydrated readily survived 32 days of simulated overwintering,” the team said. “Unlike many insects restricted to highly specific microhabitats,  larvae inhabit a remarkably diverse range of substrates that differ in vegetation, substrate type, slope, drainage, and thermal and hydric conditions.”I love the phrasing of “readily survived” as if the midges were eager to show off their cryoprotective superpowers. After this 32-day period they emerged with “That all you got?” energy. By studying the bugs in these simulated conditions, the researchers confirmed that they rely on multiple overwintering strategies, including a state of arrested development called “obligate diapause.” “Diapause has long been assumed to be uncommon in Antarctic species, but the present study reveals that  utilises diapause for seasonal adaptation, as in many temperate species,” Yoshida and her colleagues said. In addition to being the only endemic Antarctic insect, this midge has the smallest genome of any known insect while also being the largest fully terrestrial animal on the continent, even though it’s only a few millimeters long. In other words, it is the biggest animal in Antarctica that doesn’t fly or swim. Okay, Antarctic midge. You just keep doing you.Last, turtles do a little victory dance when they find food. Yes, it is cute. Yes, there is a video.The footage (along with ) is part of a study that tested if turtles could distinguish the magnetic signatures of two geographical areas. When the turtles were exposed to signatures associated with an area they associated with food, they danced in anticipation of a meal, demonstrating that they could tell the signals apart—and party accordingly.  “Hallmarks of the behaviour include some or all of the following: tilting the body vertically, holding the head near or above water, opening the mouth, rapid alternating movement of the front flippers, and, occasionally, even spinning in place, hence the name ‘turtle dance,’” said researchers led by Kayla Goforth of Texas A&M University. “Turtles exhibited significantly higher levels of turtle dance behaviour when experiencing the field in which they had been fed.”With that, let’s all tilt vertically, spin in place, and shell-abrate the long weekend. Thanks for reading! See you next week.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Paragraf Is Building a &quot;Blank Canvas&quot; Graphene Foundry</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/paragraf-graphene-foundry</link><author>Liam Critchley</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjQ2NTMyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MzQyMzgzM30.wJGF4-_y2VSVjXLsYFhhL9DuC-xHiTHWB-Ciq4DHQTU/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The company wants to make graphene sensors more accessible to industries]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>These Google Photos alternatives offer tons of storage options at a reasonable price</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/these-google-photos-alternatives-offer-tons-of-storage-options-at-a-reasonable-price/</link><author>Ivan Mehta</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Photos is a great service for storing images across devices.

ABSTRACT
Whenever a new technology appears, our first instinct as developers is to offer "text" as the primary method of interaction. This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.

At tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising. [...]

From the report: With Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency installing itself at the IRS amid a broader push to replace federal bureaucracy with machine-learning software, the tax agency's computing center in Martinsburg, West Virginia, will soon be home to a state-of-the-art Nvidia SuperPod AI computing cluster. According to the previously unreported February 5 acquisition document, the setup will combine 31 separate Nvidia servers, each containing eight of the company's flagship Blackwell processors designed to train and operate artificial intelligence models that power tools like ChatGPT. The hardware has not yet been purchased and installed, nor is a price listed, but SuperPod systems reportedly start at $7 million. The setup described in the contract materials notes that it will include a substantial memory upgrade from Nvidia.
 
Though small compared to the massive AI-training data centers deployed by companies like OpenAI and Meta, the SuperPod is still a powerful and expensive setup using the most advanced technology offered by Nvidia, whose chips have facilitated the global machine-learning spree. While the hardware can be used in many ways, it's marketed as a turnkey means of creating and querying an AI model. Last year, the MITRE Corporation, a federally funded military R&D lab, acquired a $20 million SuperPod setup to train bespoke AI models for use by government agencies, touting the purchase as a "massive increase in computing power" for the United States.
 
How exactly the IRS will use its SuperPod is unclear. An agency spokesperson said the IRS had no information to share on the supercomputer purchase, including which presidential administration ordered it. A 2024 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified 68 different AI-related projects underway at the IRS; the Nvidia cluster is not named among them, though many were redacted. But some clues can be gleaned from the purchase materials. "The IRS requires a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle complex machine learning (ML) workloads," the document explains. "The Nvidia Super Pod is a critical component of this infrastructure, providing the necessary compute power, storage, and networking capabilities to support the development and deployment of large-scale ML models."
 
The document notes that the SuperPod will be run by the IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division, or RAAS, which leads a variety of data-centric initiatives at the agency. While no specific uses are cited, it states that this division's Compliance Data Warehouse project, which is behind this SuperPod purchase, has previously used machine learning for automated fraud detection, identity theft prevention, and generally gaining a "deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive taxpayer behavior."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Karol Herbst Steps Down As Nouveau Maintainer Due To Linux Kernel&apos;s Toxic Environment</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Karol-Herbst-Nouveau-No</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 11:40:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Karol Herbst has been a Nouveau driver developer for over a decade working on this open-source, reverse-engineered NVIDIA Linux graphics driver.

- Built with modern Python best practices (async/await, type hints, functional-first)
- Optimized async I/O with anyio for multi-loop compatibility
- Smart worker process pool for CPU-bound tasks (OCR, doc conversion)
- Efficient batch processing with concurrent extractions
- Clean error handling with context-rich exceptionsI built this after struggling with existing solutions that were either synchronous-only, required complex deployments, or had poor async support. The goal was to create something that works well in modern async Python applications, can be easily dockerized or used in serverless contexts, and relies only on permissive OSS.Key advantages over alternatives:
- True async support with optimized I/O
- Minimal dependencies (much smaller than alternatives)
- Perfect for serverless and async web apps
- Local processing without API calls
- Built for modern Python codebases with rigorous typing and testingThe library is MIT licensed and open to contributions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eating From Plastic Takeout Containers Can Increase Heart Failure Risk, Study Finds</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/0555235/eating-from-plastic-takeout-containers-can-increase-heart-failure-risk-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new study suggests that frequent consumption of food from plastic takeout containers significantly increases the risk of congestive heart failure due to gut biome changes that trigger inflammation and circulatory damage. The Guardian reports: The authors used a two-part approach, first looking into the frequency with which over 3,000 people in China ate from plastic takeout containers, and whether they had heart disease. They then exposed rats to plastic chemicals in water that was boiled and poured in carryout containers to extract chemicals. "The data revealed that high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure," the authors wrote. [...] They put boiling water in the containers for one, five or 15 minutes because plastic chemicals leach at much higher rates when hot contents are placed in containers -- the study cited previous research that found as many as 4.2m microplastic particles per sq cm can leach from plastic containers that are microwaved.
 
The authors then gave rats the water contaminated with leachate to drink for several months, then analyzed the gut biome and metabolites in the feces. It found notable changes. "It indicated that ingestion of these leachates altered the intestinal microenvironment, affected gut microbiota composition, and modified gut microbiota metabolites, particularly those linked to inflammation and oxidative stress," the authors wrote. They then checked the rats' heart muscle tissue and found it had been damaged. The study did not find a statistical difference in the changes and damage among rats that were exposed to water that had been in contact with plastic for one minute versus five or fifteen. The study has been published in the journal Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jane Street&apos;s Figgie card game</title><link>https://www.figgie.com/</link><author>eamag</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 09:59:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jane Street's fast-paced

Today, many organizations use cloud services and micro-services. In such environments, IP addresses assigned to virtual machines or services can often be volatile, meaning they can change or be reassigned to other organizations or users. This presents a risk for services relying on static IPs for security configurations and may introduce impersonation or data leakage issues.This morning, I was setting up a new environment. I got a new IP address assigned by my hosting company and deployed a classic configuration: a reverse-proxy redirecting to many web services and generating Let’s Encrypt certificates.Once the reverse proxy was in place, I started to deploy more services but detected some activity in the log (always keep an eye on your logs!) and saw this:{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T06:22:33Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \"postmaster.xxxxxxxx.hu\""}
{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T06:46:36Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \"pop3.xxxxxxxx.hu\""}

A quick DNS request confirmed that these hosts are resolving to my newly assigned IP!Worse, this organization seems to still be using POP3, and a user (or a script) is still trying to fetch emails using this protocol!When you move to another hosting solution, update your DNS recordsCleanup your DNS zones and remove unwanted entriesUse mechanisms to preserve your IP addresses (like “Elastic IPs” provided by AWS)Xavier Mertens (@xme)

Amazon accounts for more than 80% of all online book sales, according to market research firm IBISWorld. Not to mention it owns Kindle, a wildly popular format for e-reading.Bookshop.org is ready to change that. Today, the online platform that connects readers to local bookstores launched an e-reading platform of its own. For the first time, local independent bookstores can sell e-books to customers, says CEO and founder Andy Hunter. Bookshop.org launches e-book platform to support local bookstoresHunter is in the business of solving logistical problems for readers. In 2020, he launched Bookshop.org to support local businesses losing sales to Amazon Books. Years later, as an e-reader himself, he realized how hard it was to continue his “socially-conscious consumerism” mindset of buying locally when it came to digital titles.“Right now, no matter how much you love your local bookstore, if you want to read an e-book, you have to go to Amazon or another alternate platform and you can’t support your local bookstore,” Hunter tells USA TODAY. “E-books are an important revenue stream for publishers and authors and they could be for independent bookstores.”The result is an app (available for iOS and Android, and accessible from a web browser) with nearly a million titles from major publishing houses. Readers can annotate, add notes, look up words and sync across all their devices. There's a search function if consumers know the book they want to read, and if they don't, there's an explore page with suggestions by genre.Most importantly for Hunter, booksellers will take home the profits, which he says has prevented local businesses from thriving in e-book sales until now. “There’s no real way to make it profitable, but we don’t care about it being profitable,” Hunter says, citing the socially conscious company’s B corporation status. “Our mission is to help independent bookstores survive and thrive in the digital age.”With discounts, quick shipping and Kindle synching, Amazon Books has long been an appealing option to many readers. But now, Hunter says there’s “no reason on Earth to give a billionaire your $9.99 for your e-book,” as publishers set a fixed price for e-books and there’s no shipping to compete with. Bookshop.org’s new initiative follows a growing movement across social media – not just exclusively in bookish communities – to forgo Amazon and other big-box sellers in favor of shopping locally. “In an age of billionaires and giant e-commerce companies and our loss of control of our lives to Silicon Valley oligarchs, that they know we’re going to fight back against that and we’re going to stay local,” Hunter says. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can invest in, we can support our local community even when we’re reading digital books.”E-reader features to include social sharingBookshop.org's platform also includes a “quote-sharing” feature for social media, Hunter says. He wants books to catch up to the way other media is shared – it’s easy to share your Spotify or Apple Music listening to your Instagram story, and you can even post about your workouts with some apps. But if you want to share a quote from a book, readers have to take a photo of the physical book or a screenshot. “They should be able to share that to social media and somebody else should be able to click in, buy the book using Apple Pay and start reading it right away,” Hunter says. “That’ll fuel all kinds of discussions about books on TikTok and places like that, and all of that will benefit the independent bookstores because it will be them selling the books that people are talking about.”Looking for your next great read?

Ars Technica reports: The researchers started out by using the standard tools they developed to handle protein design, including an AI tool named RFDiffusion, which uses a random seed to generate a variety of protein backgrounds. In this case, the researchers asked RFDiffusion to match the average positions of the amino acids in a family of ester-breaking enzymes. The results were fed to another neural network, which chose the amino acids such that they'd form a pocket that would hold an ester that breaks down into a fluorescent molecule so they could follow the enzyme's activity using its glow.
 
Of the 129 proteins designed by this software, only two of them resulted in any fluorescence. So the team decided they needed yet another AI. Called PLACER, the software was trained by taking all the known structures of proteins latched on to small molecules and randomizing some of their structure, forcing the AI to learn how to shift things back into a functional state (making it a generative AI). The hope was that PLACER would be trained to capture some of the structural details that allow enzymes to adopt more than one specific configuration over the course of the reaction they were catalyzing. And it worked. Repeating the same process with an added PLACER screening step boosted the number of enzymes with catalytic activity by over three-fold.
 
Unfortunately, all of these enzymes stalled after a single reaction. It turns out they were much better at cleaving the ester, but they left one part of it chemically bonded to the enzyme. In other words, the enzymes acted like part of the reaction, not a catalyst. So the researchers started using PLACER to screen for structures that could adopt a key intermediate state of the reaction. This produced a much higher rate of reactive enzymes (18 percent of them cleaved the ester bond), and two -- named "super" and "win" -- could actually cycle through multiple rounds of reactions. The team had finally made an enzyme.
 
By adding additional rounds alternating between structure suggestions using RFDiffusion and screening using PLACER, the team saw the frequency of functional enzymes increase and eventually designed one that had an activity similar to some produced by actual living things. They also showed they could use the same process to design an esterase capable of digesting the bonds in PET, a common plastic. The research has been published in the journal Science.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reading Documentation Shouldn&apos;t Be a Chore</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/reading-documentation-shouldnt-be-a-chore?source=rss</link><author>Rami James</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:48:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a developer, documentation is both your greatest ally and your worst nemesis. It's the key to unlocking the power of libraries, frameworks, APIs, and even entire programming languages. Yet, many developers struggle to effectively navigate and extract the information they need from documentation. It's a skill that can be learned, and it's one that can make a huge difference in your productivity and the quality of your work. New developers often lack this critical skill, and find themselves stopped in their progress towards becoming a better dev because of it.\
I'm currently writing the docs for Vewrite, a project management tool for writing teams. It occurs to me that I've been writing documentation for a long time, and I've gotten pretty good at it. I've also gotten pretty good at reading documentation, and I think that this is a skill that is often overlooked.\
Let's talk about how to equip you with the skills to read documentation better, turning this often daunting task into a smooth and efficient process.Why is reading documentation challenging?\
Good documentation is essential. It provides the definitive guide to how software works, saving you countless hours of pointless, frustrating trial and error. Bad documentation is a nightmare. It's like trying to navigate a maze blindfolded, with no map and no sense of direction, guided by a liar.\
If you have access to the code you are working against, that's great and you should use it. Poke around and see what you're supposed to do by reading the code. But, in many cases (and almost all of the time with proprietary software), you're going to have to rely on the documentation to get you through. However, documentation can vary wildly in quality. Some is meticulously crafted, while others can be uninformative, outdated, or even misleading. This inconsistency is one of the reasons why reading documentation can be challenging.Some docs are just a dumping ground for information, with no clear structure or organization. This can make it difficult to find what you're looking for, and you end up spending more time searching than actually learning. A well-structured set of documentation will have a clear table of contents, with sections and subsections that guide you through the material in a logical order. This makes it easier to navigate and find the information you need.In general, I'll also recommend some Getting Started section which points different types of users to the information which is most critical to them.Information overload is another common hurdle. Docs can cover a vast range of features and functionalities, making it difficult to find the specific information you need. For example, a large framework might have hundreds of classes and methods, and trying to find the one you need can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.Unclear technical jargon can also be a barrier, as documentation is inherently technical, and sometimes the terminology can be confusing, especially for newcomers. This often stems from the assumption that the reader has a certain level of prior knowledge as it is largely written by the team who has developed the software and has an intimate knowledge of its innner workings.Outdated information can be a major problem. Software evolves rapidly, and documentation can sometimes lag behind, leading to frustration and wasted time. A library might have deprecated a certain function, but the documentation might still describe it as the primary way to perform a task. The teams who produce software should be including accurate documentation creation and upkeep in their backlog as part of their process. Unfortunately, in the haste to get features shipped to market, corners are often cut. I've spent the better part of the last decade advocating for better processes that lead to better docs at a number of companies, and the biggest challenge here has been explaining to stakeholders where the value is.How to read documentation effectivelyOver the years, I've developed a structured approach to how I tackle reading new documentation. I've found that this approach helps me quickly get up to speed with new tools and technologies, and I hope it can help you too.\
By and large this method has three parts: understanding the structure of the documentation itself, understanding the way that the system I'm learning works, and lastly engaging with the material in the docs. First I get the lay of the land, and then I try to focus in on the details.Understand the structure of the documentationDocs are written by people, and every sysyem is going to be different. That means that every set of docs is going to be different. Some docs are organized by feature, others by use case, and still others by API endpoint. Understanding the structure of the documentation is key to finding the information you need quickly. Start by scanning the table of contents to get an overview of the topics covered. This will help you get a sense of the scope of the documentation and where to find specific information. You'll want to quickly click through the docs and get a sense of how things work, how they are organized, and where you can find reference materials if there are any.\
I find that this initial run through also trickles some information about the system and its components into my brain. It's not comprehensive at all, but it's a good start.Every piece of software is a system, and understanding how that system works is key to understanding how to use it. This is where the documentation can be a huge help. Good documentation will provide you with a high-level overview of the system, explaining how the different components fit together and how they interact. This can help you understand the context in which a particular feature or function is used, and how it relates to the rest of the system. This is where you start to get a sense of how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems.\
A lot of the problems that you'll encounter when building software will be because you fundamentally don't understand how what you're building with actually works. This is where the documentation can be a huge help. It can provide you with the context you need to understand how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems. Use that to your advantage and you'll be able to build better software, faster.This is often the most tedious and boring part. You have to actually take a few hours and read through the entire docs. For smaller libraries or APIs, this isn't going to be a big deal and you'll be able to fit most of it into your head. For larger systems, this is going to be a multi-day process. You'll want to take notes, ask questions, and engage with the material in a way that helps you understand it. This is where you start to get a sense of how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems. If it doesn't all fit into your head now, that's ok. You'll remember more than you think you will, and when you're actually doing development it will be an order of magnitude faster to find an answer if you've already seen it once.I've actually found that modern AIs are absolutely awesome for this step. You can use them as you would a more experienced developer and ask them questions about the system, the functionality, and the docs themselves. You can't trust everything that they say, but you can't really trust what another developer always tells you. I've found that being able to have a discussion with an AI about a library or API really helps me understand how stuff works at a deeper level.Strategies for effectively reading docsDespite these challenges, mastering the art of reading documentation is doable. Here are some strategies to keep in mind while you are digging around in docs, looking for an answer.If you don't know where you're going, you may never get there. Before you dive into a set of docs, you may want to set a clear objective for yourself. Are you trying to understand a specific function, integrate a new library, or troubleshoot an error? Having a clear objective will help you focus your search.\
For example, if you're trying to fix a bug where a specific function isn't returning the expected value, and your code matches what the docs say that you're supposed to do, your goal is to understand the function's place in the wider system. The problem is going to be a few levels up and the docs are likely going to be the key to understanding how the software works at a higher level.\
Don't immediately jump into the nitty-gritty details. Begin with the introductory sections, tutorials, or quick start guides to get a high-level understanding of the system. Your assumptions will often be wrong, and it is good to base your work on a foundation of truth. Think of it like reading the abstract of a research paper before diving into the full text. These introductory materials often provide a roadmap to the rest of the documentation.Use the structure of the docs to your advantageUse the table of contents and search function (these are your best friends) to quickly locate the sections you need. Don't be afraid to experiment with different search terms. Scan through the entire table of contents. Poke around and get a really good feel for how the documentation is structured. Sometimes you will find that your answers are hidden adjacent to where you thought that they would be.Real-world examples are invaluable, and the best docs are going to include them. They demonstrate how to use the code in practice and can often clarify confusing concepts. Pay close attention to the context in which the examples are used. A code snippet demonstrating how to use a particular function is much more helpful if it's accompanied by an explanation of what the function does and why it's being used in that specific scenario.Pay attention to the detailsWhen looking at function or method definitions, carefully examine the data types of the parameters and return values. This will help you understand how to use them correctly. Sometimes, crucial information is hidden in footnotes, warnings, or less prominent sections. Make sure you scan the entire page, not just the headlines. A seemingly minor note might contain a critical piece of information that can save you a lot of trouble. Documentation often contains links to related topics or other parts of the documentation. Don't hesitate to follow these links to gain a deeper understanding. These links can often lead you to more detailed explanations, examples, or even the source code itself.This is one of the biggest reasons why I believe that open-source can be such a boon for companies who want to build an ecosystem of developers around their software. Sometimes, the best way to understand how something works is to look at the source code itself. Don't be afraid to dive in, especially if the documentation is unclear. Reading the source code can give you a much clearer picture of what's happening under the hood. Try out the code examples and modify them to see how they behave. This is a great way to solidify your understanding and discover edge cases. Experimenting with the code is like conducting your own little science experiment. You can change the inputs, observe the outputs, and gain a deeper understanding of how the code works. If you're still stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to the community for help. Forums, mailing lists, and online communities are valuable resources for getting your questions answered. The developer community is generally very helpful, and there are often people who have encountered the same problems you're facing.Reading documentation shouldn't be a passive activity. Engage with the material by taking notes, jotting down key points, examples, and any questions you have. Annotating the documentation (if possible), highlighting important sections and adding your own comments can also be helpful. Creating your own examples, writing small programs that use the features you're learning about, is a great way to reinforce your understanding. It's like practicing a musical instrument – the more you do it, the better you get.Reading documentation is a skill that improves with practice. By adopting these strategies and actively engaging with the material, you can transform documentation from a source of frustration into a powerful tool for learning and development. So, embrace the documentation, and unlock the full potential of the software you're working with!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Expose (And Fix) Hidden Bottlenecks in Adobe Experience Manager</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-expose-and-fix-hidden-bottlenecks-in-adobe-experience-manager?source=rss</link><author>Giuseppe Baglio</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:45:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn how to read thread dumps and take control of your application’s runtime behaviour.\
When your Adobe Experience Manager (or in general any JAVA application) instance shows signs of sluggishness, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and dive into the world of thread dumps. IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) is here to help you untangle the web of threads and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to use IBM TDA to diagnose performance issues in AEM like a pro.Before you can start analyzing thread dumps, you’ll need to download and install IBM Thread Analyzer. Head over to the official IBM website or your organization’s repository to grab the latest version. Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions for your operating system. It’s quick, easy, and sets the stage for some serious troubleshooting.Thread dumps are snapshots of all the threads running in your AEM instance at a specific moment. To capture them:Use tools like , , or AEM’s built-in functionality to generate thread dumps. There is a well-documented page on Adobe Docs.Save the thread dump files to your local machine.\
Pro Tip: Capture multiple thread dumps at intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds) to get a clearer picture of long-running issues.Launch IBM TDA and open the thread dump files you’ve captured. Simply drag and drop the files into the application or use the “Open” option to load them. Once loaded, you’ll see a list of thread dumps on the left-hand panel.To analyze a specific thread dump:Select the file from the listing.Click the Thread Detail button at the top\
This will display a detailed view of all the threads in that dump. Now, let’s sort the threads by Stack Depth, ensuring the longest stacks appear at the top. Why? Threads with deeper stacks often indicate more complex operations, which are usually where performance issues hide.Focus on threads with a stack depth of 10 lines or longer. These threads are typically the ones consuming the most resources. Take notes on any threads that stand out — whether due to their names, states, or stack traces.Next, sort the threads by their State. Scroll down to the Runnable threads. These are the threads that were actively using CPU time when the dump was taken. Keep an eye out for application-specific threads, such as:Background job threads: Handling tasks like indexing or replication.Request threads: Named like 127.0.0.1 [timestamp] GET /path HTTP/1.1.For each request thread, extract the timestamp from its name (e.g., ). This Unix epoch timestamp tells you when the user’s browser made the request. Convert it to a human-readable date/time using a tool like https://www.epochconverter.com/. Compare this with the thread dump’s timestamp to calculate how long the request has been active.If the difference is unusually large (e.g., several seconds or minutes), it could indicate a bottleneck in your application.\
Pro Tip: Keep an eye out for patterns. Are certain types of requests consistently taking longer? For example, requests involving complex queries or resource-heavy operations might be worth optimizing. Additionally, if you notice that specific URLs or endpoints are frequently associated with long-running threads, consider profiling those areas of your codebase.Thread analysis requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond simple waiting states. While the IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) interface provides valuable insights into thread relationships, understanding the full context of thread behavior helps create a more complete picture of your application’s performance characteristics.Understanding Thread StatesWhen examining threads in TDA, you’ll encounter several important states:: These threads are either currently executing or ready to execute when CPU time becomes available. A Runnable state doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem — it’s the natural state for actively working threads.: These threads have temporarily paused execution while waiting for a condition to be met. The waiting state can occur for many legitimate reasons, including:Resource availability (database connections, file handles)Task completion in other threads\
: These threads are specifically waiting to acquire a monitor or lock. While similar to waiting, blocked states specifically indicate synchronization-related pauses.Analyzing Thread RelationshipsWhen you identify a thread of interest, examine its relationships with other threads using this systematic approach:Direct Lock Relationships:Examine the Waiting Threads panel for immediate dependenciesReview the stack traces of waiting threads to understand why they’re blockedNote the duration of the wait states if available\
2. Resource Usage Patterns:Look for patterns in resource acquisition and releaseIdentify potential resource bottlenecksConsider alternative resource management strategies\
3. Architectural Implications:Evaluate if the observed behaviour aligns with the system’s designConsider if the current threading model is appropriateAssess the impact on scalabilityUnderstanding Lock Types and VisibilityThread dumps may not show all types of contention. Modern Java applications use various synchronization mechanisms:Intrinsic Locks (synchronized keyword):Show clear owner-waiter relationshipsStack traces indicate synchronization points\
2. Explicit Locks (java.util.concurrent):May require additional tooling to visualize\
3. Non-blocking Mechanisms (Don’t appear as traditional locks but can impact performance):When you identify genuine contention issues, consider these approaches:Implement finer-grained lockingConsider non-blocking alternativesImplement backoff strategiesConsider caching solutions\
3. Architectural ChangesEvaluate asynchronous processingConsider parallel execution pathsImplement queue-based approaches\
Remember that thread analysis is an iterative process. Patterns that emerge in one thread dump might not represent consistent behaviour. Always validate your findings across multiple dumps and different time periods before making significant changes to your application.Comparing thread dumps across time reveals important performance patterns in your AEM instance. Start by establishing a baseline during normal operation, including peak usage periods and maintenance windows. This baseline provides context for identifying abnormal thread behaviour.To determine if a thread is persistent across time:Select multiple thread dumps from different points in time.Click the Compare Threads button in IBM TDA.Look for threads that remain in the Runnable state across all dumps, especially those with consistently long stack traces.\
Use IBM TDA’s Compare Threads feature to analyze dumps from different time points. Focus on threads that persist across multiple dumps, examining their states, stack depths, and resource usage. Remember that thread persistence alone doesn’t automatically indicate a problem — background services naturally run continuously, while request threads should complete within expected timeframes.\
When analyzing persistent Runnable threads, correlate their behaviour with system metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times. Consider the thread’s purpose: background services, request processing, or maintenance tasks each have different expected patterns. For request threads, compare their duration against defined service level agreements and business requirements.\
Got a suspicious thread pattern? Don’t jump to conclusions just yet! Try to recreate the issue in your test environment first — it’s like having a dress rehearsal before the main show. Take a good look at your code, double-check those config settings, and consider what else might be stirring up trouble in your environment. Keep track of what you find with real performance numbers and test results — you’ll thank yourself later.\
Once you’re sure you’ve caught a real performance culprit (backed by solid evidence, of course), it’s time to fix it.If analyzing threads doesn’t yield actionable insights, switch to the Monitor Detail view:Go back to the thread listing.Select a thread dump and click the Monitor Detail button.IBM TDA will display a tree view of monitor-owning threads and their waiting threads.\
This view helps you identify threads that are holding monitors and causing contention. Understanding thread monitors is like viewing the nervous system of your application. These synchronization mechanisms control how threads access shared resources, preventing potential conflicts and ensuring smooth operation.\
Monitor interactions can reveal critical performance insights. Some threads will be actively processing requests, while others wait for resource acquisition or participate in coordinated activities. Not all waiting or idle threads indicate a problem — they’re often part of the application’s natural resource management strategy.\
However, not all threads are equally important:Ignore idle thread pool threads: These threads typically have ≤10 stack lines and are part of thread pools like the servlet engine. They’re usually harmless unless they dominate the thread pool.Focus on application-specific monitors: Look for monitors tied to your application’s business logic, such as database connections, caching mechanisms, or custom synchronization blocks.\
Remember that thread and monitor analysis is both an art and a science. Each application has unique characteristics, so approach performance optimization with curiosity and a holistic perspective. The goal is not to eliminate all waiting threads but to understand and optimize their interactions.\
Advanced Tip: If you notice certain monitors are frequently contended, consider refactoring your code to reduce lock granularity. For example:Replace coarse-grained locks with fine-grained ones.Use non-blocking algorithms or concurrent data structures where possible.Optimize database queries to reduce the time threads spend waiting for locks.In some thread dumps, you might notice the  appearing frequently. This service handles tasks like Garbage Collection, memory management, and resource cleanup. While the Collector Service might seem like a mysterious background process, understanding its behaviour is key to maintaining optimal system performance — think of it like a diligent janitor in a large office building.\
When you notice frequent Collector Service activity, don’t immediately assume disaster. It’s normal for the Collector Service to show up occasionally, but excessive activity could indicate underlying issues:Memory leaks: Objects that are not being garbage collected can cause frequent GC cycles.High object churn: Rapid creation and destruction of objects can overwhelm the garbage collector.Improper JVM settings: Misconfigured heap sizes or GC algorithms can lead to inefficiencies.\
Here are some considerations to optimize resource usage:Tuning your JVM settings (e.g., increasing heap size, switching to G1GC).Reviewing your application’s memory allocation patterns to reduce unnecessary object creation.\
Garbage Collection is not a problem to be solved, but a dynamic system to be understood and optimized. Each application has unique characteristics, and there’s no universal solution.Thread dump analysis is a developer’s superpower — transforming you from a code writer to a performance detective. IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) is your key to understanding complex system behaviours, revealing hidden bottlenecks that impact your Java/AEM instance’s performance.\
Like learning an instrument, your skill improves with practice. Each thread dump becomes clearer, revealing intricate patterns of system interactions. The more you analyze, the more intuitive performance optimization becomes.\
Remember, practice makes perfect — the more you analyze thread dumps, the sharper your diagnostic skills will become. 📊💪\

A staggering number and a logical reason behind it – and it’s the main one, according to CB Insights. It’s not about a lack of funding, bad hires, or tough competition. The real question is whether people actually need what you’re about to offer them.\
Plus, having a great product isn’t enough. To win, you need to understand the competitive landscape, your audience, and how to get your brand in front of the right people. Drawing from my experience launching Yango Play in MENA — where we developed an AI-powered Entertainment SuperApp that quickly became one of the region’s leading streaming platforms — I want to share the key steps we took to make it the success it is now.Selecting the right market is a balance between competition and profitability. Some regions offer low competition but limited revenue potential, while others may be more lucrative but very, very saturated. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has a large population and low competition, making it an appealing early-stage entry option. But, lower consumer spending restricts growth. MENA, on the other hand, has a smaller population but significantly higher consumer purchasing power, making it an attractive place for expansion.\
 is just as critical as market selection. Entering too early may mean slow adoption while entering too late risks facing intense competition.If competition is low, it provides an advantage and accelerates market growth. The key is to enter before the market experiences a surge in adoption.\
In the CIS region, the subscription economy remained relatively flat at 1–2 million subscribers for several years before suddenly accelerating to 100% annual growth. The same pattern emerged in MENA, indicating that the region was nearing a similar tipping point, making it the optimal time to enter.\
Market data is here to reinforce this statement. MENA’s total population is around 500 million, with 13.5 million already subscribed to video streaming services. Just for reference, penetration of subscription services in CIS region stands at 15-20%, with slight differences between countries. Even without complex economic modeling, these figures indicated a major opportunity for subscription-based services in MENA. So, an ideal market for expansion. In this case, the potential formed the perfect ground for selecting the market and strategy – the choice was easy.\
Still, the region was already highly competitive, with more than 50 video streaming platforms and many global and local music services. We had strong competitors in each category, so for us entering the market required more than just identifying demand.Product and Content DifferentiationCreating a strong differentiator was key, and competing head-on with zero brand awareness would have been very much an uphill battle.\
Take YANGO’s case study on product differentiation. We simultaneously implemented two strategies — with **differentiation through the product and content. \n An Entertainment SuperApp — a single subscription combining music, movies, and games. At the time, there wasn’t anything similar, so we gladly took the opportunity for this strategic entry point. Users typically juggle multiple subscriptions: one for music, another for video, and yet another for gaming. We built everything into one app under a single subscription. This way, we got on the growing global trend toward bundled entertainment services and also filled a gap in our target market. Win-win.Netflix has long become the go-to platform for global content. We took a different route and built an ecosystem tailored to local tastes. Our SuperApp has regional music, Arabic-language films, and localized gaming options, making it much more relevant to MENA audiences. This became a critical differentiator, making our product not just another streaming service but a culturally attuned entertainment hub.\
Conclusion: To successfully differentiate a product, the best strategy is to identify weaknesses or unmet needs in competing products — and fill those gaps.\
In crowded markets, pricing is as crucial as the product. It’s not the features that make or break the product – it’s about making your product the most logical choice.\
So, we introduced a long trial period and a bundled pricing model, allowing users to get music and movies for the price of one. Instead of discounting, we maximized perceived value, making the subscription an easy, rational decision.\
Expanding into a new market meant building a local team and adapting to language and cultural nuances. With deep market research, perfect timing, and a product tailored to real consumer needs, the SuperApp secured a strong foothold in a high-growth market. How did we tackle these challenges? That’s a story for another article.Audience Differentiation: Defining the Target UserUsers have mental “boxes” where they sort every new product they see. Food delivery? That goes into one box. A streaming service? Another box. But if your product doesn’t fit neatly into a box, it triggers confusion — people don’t know what to do with it. And when something feels unfamiliar, the default reaction is to ignore it.\
That’s why crystal-clear positioning isn’t optional — it’s survival. If users can’t instantly grasp who your product is for and why they need it, you’re fighting an uphill battle. But just fitting into a category isn’t enough. You have to own it. When people think about entertainment subscriptions, they should immediately think of your brand.\
How do you make that happen? Precision. Messaging needs to be sharp, clear, and unmistakable. Instead of vague positioning, spell it out: “This is a service for modern Arabic-speaking users.” That clarity eliminates confusion and makes it easier for potential subscribers to see how the product fits into their everyday world.\
Brand anchoring is everything— the simpler and more memorable the positioning, the stronger the audience connection. If users struggle to define what the product is or who it’s for, they’ll tune it out. That’s a death sentence for any brand. The fix? Build an instant mental link. The moment someone thinks “entertainment subscription,” your SuperApp should be the first thing they recall.For startups that can’t outspend competitors, traditional marketing funnels — awareness → consideration → purchase — might not be the best play. Instead, skip the awareness stage and go straight for user acquisition.\
Here’s the logic: if someone downloads your app, they already know it exists. There’s no need to waste resources on brand awareness before conversion. Yes, this approach raises the cost per acquisition (CPA) since users are coming in cold, but the trade-off is greater control over spending and a more direct path to growth.\
The real power lies in performance-driven marketing, which focuses on conversions rather than broad exposure. Even brands with large media budgets rely on performance marketing as the most efficient way to drive actual user engagement. For lean startups, this strategy isn’t just viable — it’s essential.A product launch is a one-time shot at grabbing audience attention —  over a long, drawn-out campaign. The smartest play? Go loud.\
The launch moment is your biggest marketing asset — a rare window where PR and buzz can be built just around your existence. Instead of slow, passive brand-building, focus on making a splash that gets people talking.\
Once the initial hype kicks in, then comes the next phase — brick by brick, reinforcing brand awareness and earning user trust. We also saw this proven in the case of Kinopoisk (video streaming platform). We focused our marketing around major premieres such as Zack Snyder's Justice League, , and big exclusive original premieres.Shifting from Traditional Advertising to Alternative ChannelsFrom experience, buying direct media ads is often far less effective than leveraging influencers, word of mouth, and strong PR.\
Spending time on finding the right influencer, crafting a viral PR angle, or developing creative content that resonates delivers higher ROI than just pouring money into paid ads. In a budget-constrained environment, the smarter play is a two-step approach:Performance marketing first — drive installs and conversions while simultaneously learning how users interact with the product.Organic & influencer-driven marketing second — building credibility and momentum through earned media, viral content, and strategic partnerships.With influencers, you’re hitting two targets at once. First, their audience gets exposed to your service, boosting brand awareness. But the real power of influencer marketing is in its high conversion rates — it doesn’t just build visibility; it drives action. It works like performance marketing in many ways. Even better? The creative content influencers produce often performs exceptionally well in paid performance campaigns, making it a valuable asset beyond the initial collaboration. So, really, you’re getting even more value out of every campaign.\
This keeps acquisition costs under control and ensures real engagement and long-term user retention.\
One of the most successful cases of leveraging PR instead of direct advertising is Netflix. When expanding into new regions, the company rarely invests in traditional media ads. Instead, it focuses on localized content, influencer collaborations, and large-scale PR campaigns. This approach has allowed Netflix to dominate new markets without massive ad spending, making the brand recognizable through organic user discussions and viral interest.\
There are plenty of examples of viral brands and services — take Dubai Chocolate or Clubhouse, for instance. These apps and platforms managed to gain massive audiences with little to no marketing spend, relying purely on organic growth and word of mouth.The Founder as the Brand’s Leading AmbassadorIn a competitive market, PR isn’t just about press releases and media coverage — it’s about people. A founder holds a unique advantage: their voice becomes the product’s most powerful marketing tool.\
People don’t engage with companies — they engage with other people. Instead of relying on corporate statements or press releases, modern PR is about creating shareable content and building influence through authentic, human-driven narratives.\n Whether you are a startup or an established company, entering a new market requires more than a strong product — it asks for adaptability to evolving industry rules and dynamics. The strategies that worked in the past may no longer be effective in an environment where competition is fierce, consumer behavior is shifting, and digital ecosystems are rapidly changing. Success hinges on thorough market research, precise audience targeting, strategic product differentiation, and a well-structured promotional approach.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Every New Apple Device Expected in 2025</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/every-new-apple-device-expected-in-2025?source=rss</link><author>David Perru</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:21:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Hospitals Use AI to Boost Efficiency in Medical Imaging Technology</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-hospitals-use-ai-to-boost-efficiency-in-medical-imaging-technology?source=rss</link><author>Beth Rush</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:21:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Advancing health care technologies are crucial for doctors and patients. They could make medical services easier to provide while giving people better results, but only if everyone understands the bigger picture. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical tool that may become part of your health care services in the near future. Check out how physicians are using AI in medical imaging and diagnostics to learn why it could revolutionize the industry.What Is Medical Imaging Technology?Medical imaging technology is any tool that  to monitor normal and abnormal cases. The term includes various services that assist health care providers in making diagnoses. While they’ve existed long before automation, artificial intelligence in medical imaging is becoming more widespread through software updates.Different Types of Imaging TechniquesYou’ll better understand why AI could be an essential scientific tool if you know which imaging techniques people undergo. Learn more about each form of technology to understand AI’s advantages and challenges more easily.X-ray machines are penetrative imaging tools that look at targeted areas inside the body before sending the results to imaging technology. The machine sends ionizing radiation into a patient to gather pictures for diagnosis. X-rays are especially useful for bone inquiries because the radiation passes through them and makes them bright white.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)If you need an MRI, a doctor might inject a contrast agent into your bloodstream  before you sit in the machine. Radiowaves, a magnet and a computer processor look inside the selected part of your body to reveal everything from tissues to joints.Ultrasound imaging  to see what’s in your body. The machinery bounces soundwaves off of your organs and tissues instead. This isn’t a penetrative imaging technique, even though tools like transvaginal wands do work inside the vaginal canal.Doctors needing more complex imaging may order CT scans. They combine an X-ray with a computer to  before it bounces back on a plate behind the patient. The machinery scans in a circle, making it more useful for 3D images of internal damage or tumors.How Each Technique Benefits From AIIf health care experts have used imaging techniques since before AI existed, why would they benefit from it? There are a few key ways AI in medical imaging and diagnostics could improve each technique for providers and patients.Algorithms Can Process Images FasterWhen doctors order penetrative imaging, they wait for specialized hospital staff to conduct the process and return the pictures. The physician needs time to sit and analyze the image, which may not happen immediately if they have a busy schedule. Given that the U.S. will have a health care worker shortage , the high work demand on doctors is a long-term challenge.\
You don’t need to worry about not getting medical imaging results back quickly if your local hospital uses machine-learning algorithms to process patient results. AI can review results , providing recommendations for doctors when they have time to check the scans. A health care provider will still review your results, but they could get back to you faster with computerized assistance.AI May Catch Small Details BetterArtificial intelligence in medical imaging can do much more than summarize scans. The algorithms can also delineate structures in the human body. Advanced programs , tumors, and blood vessels and catch abnormalities in imaging results.\
Doctors might accidentally overlook similar developments if they’re too small to see with the human eye. Instead of going back for additional imaging in a few weeks or months, you could get earlier and more precise results with AI-supported medical imaging techniques.\
Remember — your doctor will still have the final say over your diagnosis. AI provides additional insights, but you’ll always need to talk with your health care provider before moving forward with treatments.Predictive Analytics May Provide Personalized Treatment SuggestionsPersonalized treatment plans start with diagnostic tools like medical imaging before combining your results with your health history. AI may assist with that process in more hospitals over time. Advanced algorithms can  while checking your scan results. Afterward, your doctor will review its recommended treatment options and use that data to start conversations with you.\
Together, you’ll decide the next best steps. AI won’t determine how you get medical care. Machine learning programs are an evergrowing tool that could make those conversations more straightforward by supplying potentially more accurate data.Some surgeries require medical imagery techniques for real-time data. Machine learning  in specialties like cardiothoracic, ophthalmology and general surgery. When health care professionals use it in real time, the algorithms can review images guiding surgeons through a procedure and assist in augmented visualization. Decision support may also be helpful for instant recommendations based on the patient’s collective medical history, like the likelihood of complications.Does AI Medical Imaging Guarantee Increased Efficiency?There’s no guarantee that AI medical imaging will increase the efficiency of real-time surgical decisions, diagnoses or treatment plans. Algorithms are only as good as their programming. Your doctor will always need to consider the data provided by any machine learning program before using their comprehensive medical knowledge and understanding of your needs to give an informed opinion.Potential Challenges Hospitals May FaceAs more hospitals start using AI programs to read results like medical scans, it’s important to understand the barriers that may prevent implementation. Keep those factors in mind if you’re hoping to see AI-assisted medical services where you live.Data Storage and ProtectionEverything processed and produced by artificial intelligence in medical imaging consists of sensitive data. Hospitals need robust storage capabilities to utilize AI-assisted medical imaging and keep patient information safe. Experts estimate data breaches  in 2024 and may get worse in years to come.\
Hospital administrative teams may need to partner with information technology experts internally or externally to set up data storage methods with extra protection. The process may delay AI implementation, depending on where each facility’s current cybersecurity measures stand.Accurate InterpretabilityMedical imaging technology with AI programs is relatively new. Hospital staff will likely need some form of training before they can use it with patients. Human error could cause less accurate interpretability as medical providers get used to reading and considering AI results while making recommendations.Integrating AI With Current Workflow SystemsAdding a software system to a new service is much less complicated than integrating it into something people are already doing. Hospitals are serving patients around the clock, so adding AI to their medical imaging processes without compromising patient care or service speed is challenging.\
Researchers also point out that health care systems  due to things like mismatching software programs or outdated technology. Analyzing, collecting and storing imaging data may require other updates before it can happen smoothly. Communicating AI information across departments or between hospitals may create additional struggles for health care providers.Anticipate More AI in Medical Imaging and DiagnosticsHealth care professionals are interested in artificial intelligence in medical imaging because it could help them work faster, provide personalized results and give more accurate treatment plans. It can also require complex integration planning before patients benefit from it. Staying up to date on those factors will keep you in the know with the ever-changing health care industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech Leaders Reveal New Approaches to Corporate Sustainability</title><link>https://devops.com/executive-strategies-driving-corporate-sustainability/</link><author>Bonnie Schneider</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 05:54:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://devops.com/">DevOps.com</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past two years, I’ve interviewed more than 100 executives on tech innovation.

• The relic density coming from Planck satellite data [49]\
The total relic abundance of DM in our model is given by the sum of the scalar (𝜒) and fermion (𝑁3) relic abundances:\
Only for solutions falling exactly within the band given in Eq. (3.31) the totality of the DM can be explained by 𝜒 and 𝑁3.\
• Direct detection cross-section of DM scattering of nucleon set by various experiments such as XENON1T [66], LUX [65] and PandaX-II [174]\
We implemented the model in the SARAH package [175] to calculate all the vertices, mass matrices, tadpole equations etc. The thermal cross sections and DM relic abundance are determined using micrOMEGAS-5.0.8 [176]. Even though the model introduces new free parameters, not all of them are important to DM analysis. For example, self-quartic coupling 𝜆𝜒 does not play any role in DM phenomenology. Hence we choose to fix 𝜆𝜒 = 0.1 in our analysis. The remaining free parameters relevant for DM analysis can be chosen as:\
In the next sections, we will study how the DM phenomenology of this model depends on the free parameters and to do that we choose the following benchmark points which are allowed from all the above-mentioned constraints:\
which we can be utilized to compute the relic density of both the components,The direct detection study of our DM candidates 𝜒𝑅 and 𝑁3 are done here. The current experimental constraints on the DM direct detection assume the existence of only one DM candidate. As in our model, two-component DM candidates are predicted, and the contribution of each candidate to the direct detection cross-section should be rescaled by the fraction contributing to the total relic density. Hence it is convenient to define the fraction of the mass density of 𝑖th DM in the case of multi-component DM [156,157,178,179]\
The upper limit on the direct detection now can be recast as\
The above formula in Eq. (3.40) is an extension of the expression corresponding to the singlet scalar DM case [180]. The relative negative sign between the ℎ1 and ℎ2 contributions arises in our considered model as the couplings get modified according to Eq. (3.42). Due to the presence of the two different channels, depending on the parameter space, we can have destructive interference between these two channels, and direct detection can be very small.(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No Personal Liability For DOGE Yet, But With Two More Lawsuits We Get Closer</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/no-personal-liability-for-doge-yet-but-with-two-more-lawsuits-we-get-closer/</link><author>Cathy Gellis</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m going to keep pounding the drum for personal liability against Musk and DOGE, partly to scare them into backing off from their unlawful seizure of our government, and eventually to compensate us for the immense harm they’ve caused. So far it doesn’t seem like anyone has tried to personally sue them for damages, but several lawsuits are taking what might be a predicate step to establish the lawlessness of their claimed power, upon which liability claims would later be based. In addition to the AFGE litigation against OPM we already wrote about, which also names OPM itself for it wrongfully giving DOGE access to its systems, and the states’ lawsuit against the Treasury department for giving DOGE access to theirs, now we have (at this writing at least) two more lawsuits. But while those lawsuits were directed at specific agencies and the wrongfulness of Musk and DOGE’s misuse of power at these agencies, these new lawsuits come gunning for Musk and DOGE and their illegal seizure of power generally.They both base this argument on the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, but we’ll use the states’ complaint to illustrate how. As it sets forth:The Founders of this country fought for independence from the British monarchy due in no small part to the King’s despotic power to create an unlimited number of governmental offices and to fill those offices with the King’s supporters. In fact, this practice so severely undermined the Founders’ freedoms that it is a listed grievance in the Declaration of Independence. Informed by that history, the Framers of the Constitution crafted the Appointments Clause to protect against such tyranny in our system of government. The Appointments Clause was designed to buttress the separation of powers in two ways: first by requiring that Congress create an office before the President can fill it, and second by requiring that the Senate confirm a nominee to an office created by law. These limitations on the President’s power make executive appointments accountable to Congress and make the Senate’s confirmation decisions accountable to the people. See United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 12 (2021). In this way, the Appointments Clause serves a vital role in curbing Executive abuses of power.Yet here we have Musk wielding a shocking amount of power, the complaint continues:Mr. Musk’s seemingly limitless and unchecked power to strip the government of its workforce and eliminate entire departments with the stroke of a pen or click of a mouse would have been shocking to those who won this country’s independence. There is no office of the United States, other than the President, with the full power of the Executive Branch, and the sweeping authority now vested in a single unelected and unconfirmed individual is antithetical to the nation’s entire constitutional structure.We have an Appointments Clause for this very reason, the complaint reminds, “because it prevents one branch from “aggrandizing its power” or “dispensing it too freely . . . to inappropriate members of the Executive Branch.” It explains that there are three types of personnel that can work for the Executive Branch, “Principle Officers,” “Inferior Officers,” and employees. The last category doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but it also isn’t endowed with the sort of executive power that Musk has been claiming. The other categories are, which is why they require nominations by the President and Senate approval, unless Congress has already passed a law foregoing that process. But Congress can only do that for inferior officers, it has not done so here, and in any case Musk is acting more like a Principle Officer anyway.Furthermore, even for Principle Officers the President simply can’t make up a job with such power and appoint someone to it. And even Justice Thomas agrees! The complaint cites what he wrote less than a year ago in :Importantly, the Appointments Clause only grants the President the power to nominate officers to offices that Congress has already “established by Law.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. “If Congress has not reached a consensus that a particular office should exist, the Executive lacks the power to unilaterally create and then fill that office.” Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 650 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring). “By keeping the ability to create offices out of the President’s hands, the Founders ensured that no President could unilaterally create an army of officer positions to then fill with his supporters. Instead, our Constitution leaves it in the hands of the people’s elected representatives to determine whether new executive offices should exist.” Id. at 646 (Thomas, J., concurring).Yet here we are, with Trump having done exactly what Justice Thomas said he could not, for the very reasons Justice Thomas himself said he could not.The complaint then takes 30 pages to document Musk and DOGE’s unlawful rampage through executive branch agencies, in what is surely only scratching the surface of the full depth of how he has abused his unlawful power, and still continues to abuse it.And so the lawsuit asks for this power to be enjoined so that Musk and DOGE are forced to stop their destruction. In fact, it’s also now asked for a temporary restraining order to get Musk and DOGE to stop what they are doing immediately:[T]he States ask the court to issue a temporary restraining order that immediately and temporarily, until such time as the Court may hear a motion for preliminary injunction, orders Mr. Musk to identify all ways in which any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used, including whether it was used to train any algorithmic models or create or obtain derivative data, orders Mr. Musk to destroy any copies or any derivative data from such unauthorized access in his or DOGE’s possession, custody, or control, and bars Mr. Musk and personnel associated with DOGE from:(a) ordering any change in the disbursement of public funds by agencies;(b) extending offers on behalf of the United States that would bind the government to anappropriation that has not been authorized by law;(c) cancelling government contracts;(d) disposing of government property;(e) ordering the rescission or amendment of regulations;(f) making personnel decisions for agency employees;(g) taking steps to dismantle agencies created by law or otherwise asserting control oversuch agencies, including, e.g., placing employees on administrative leave;(h) accessing sensitive and confidential agency data, using agency data for other than itsauthorized purpose;(i) altering agency data systems without authorization by law and without taking allappropriate protections against cybersecurity risks;(j) engaging in any other conduct that violates the Appointments Clause or exceedsstatutory authority.But beyond that the complaint also asks for declaratory relief such that a court finally speaks to the unlawful nature of Musk’s power (as well as that of its DOGE agency, which, as the complaint explains, is also malformed if it is to claim the sort of supervisory power that it has, which is a power that can only be endowed by Congress):DOGE has purported to exercise authority of its own, and not merely to have acted as an adviser to the President. “Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) (per curiam). Congress has not provided any authority to DOGE. The Constitution does not provide any authority to DOGE. The temporary organization statute, 5 U.S.C. § 3161, [that Trump claimed in his Executive Order was empowering DOGE] does not provide DOGE with the authority it has purported to exercise. That statute provides that a “temporary organization” is defined as an organization “established by law or Executive order for a specific period not in excess of three years for the purpose of performing a specific study or other project.” 5 U.S.C. § 3161(a)(1) (emphasis added). There is no plausible definition of “project” that would include DOGE’s attempt to remake the entire Executive Branch, as described above, or to destroy agencies, fire personnel, halt funding, or dispose of government property.In asking for declaratory relief a few things are accomplished. For one thing, it gives those whom Musk and DOGE are bossing around the ability to say no. In fact, if gives them the obligation to say no, because what they are being asked to do would be an unlawful order and thus unlawful for them to do. (Of course, the injunction/TRO would also restrict Musk and DOGE from even making such demands.)But it also inches us forward to the real prize here: holding everyone involved with DOGE personally liable for the harm they have caused. By establishing that what they have done has been unlawful it provides the predicate basis for potentially all sorts of forms of liability, including the CFAA, which the USAID workers suit also provides more evidence of liability for, including in its allegations that . See page 6-7 of the complaint:*J. Doe 2 understands that the DOGE personnel had administrative privileges into all the USAID systems and tools and that DOGE personnel took information out of the agency and sent it elsewhere. DOGE’s actions have caused J. Doe 2 emotional injury, as J. Doe 2 is aware of the extent of confidential information that has been breached and the privacy laws broken.And the declaratory judgment would help overcome another legal issue: whether anyone associated with DOGE would be entitled to any sort of governmental immunity for the harm they’ve caused. This will be an issue to analyze further, because we have, and would normally want to have, some immunity shielding government officials from liability for doing their jobs, if we are going to leave them sufficiently free to do their jobs. But here no one in DOGE actually had a job that would have entitled them to do what they have done. Which is what these 14 states are asking a court to finally and declaratively say.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The 20 year old PSP can now connect to WPA2 WiFi Networks</title><link>https://wololo.net/2025/02/14/the-20-year-old-psp-can-now-connect-to-wpa2-wifi-networks/</link><author>zdw</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:31:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Screenshot source: Zekiu_ on youtubeAcid_Snake and the ARK Development team have released a significant update to the ARK custom Firmware for the Sony PSP. Custom Firmware now allows the Playstation Portable to connect to WPA2 encrypted Wifi networks. This is thanks to the recently released  plugin, created by developer  and published on the PSP Homebrew discord.Playstation Portable gets WPA2 Wifi accessThe PSP has been out of official support from Sony for years, but lots of enthusiasts keep maintaining this great handheld through homebrew and custom Firmware updates. As technology evolves around us, older devices such as the PlayStation Portable can lose some of their features.For example, as WPA2 has become the defacto encryption standard for home wifi networks (WPA3’s adoption rate remains low), older devices such as the PSP, that do not support these new* encryption standards become technically unable to access the internet.Wifi access was a very strong feature of the PSP when it was released, and, although it’s probably less important nowadays, losing that feature because newer networks aren’t compatible is a bummer.WPA2 support has been a request by many enthusiasts for years on PSP discussion channels, and it seems that the wpa2psp plugin by developer Moment now brings this to life. According to Acid_Snake, the developer was kind enough to provide the source code of the plugin, which allowed the ARK team to embed it into the ARK Custom Firmware for PSP.This reddit thread by Nebula_NL covers a lot of details on how to install and use the plugin. But the bottom line is: install the latest release of the ARK CFW on your PSP, and take it from there. (Note that you can also manually install the plugin if you’re using another CFW than ARK)This is of course the first iteration of this plugin, and it comes with limitations, specifically:2.4 GHz Only
WPA2 support works with 2.4 GHz WiFi.If your router uses a single SSID for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, you may need to separate them and connect your PSP to the 2.4 GHz network.WPA2 AES Only
Requires WPA2 with AES (AES-CCMP) encryption.TKIP is not supported and will not work.WEP/WPA Compatibility
While WPA2 is active, WEP and WPA encryption will not work.To use WEP or WPA again, disable WPA2, and they will function normally.WPA2/WPA3 Mixed Mode
If your router is set to WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode, your PSP may struggle to obtain an IP address.Try manually setting the IP address instead of using DHCP in [AUTO] mode.Download and install ARK-4 + enable WPA2 Support for the PSP* WPA2 was certified in 2004… It’s “new” from the PSP’s perspective which launched the same year and didn’t “need” to support it at the time. WPA3 launched in 2018 but its adoption is taking time]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brake Pad Dust Can Be More Toxic Than Exhaust Emissions, Study Says</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/0016236/brake-pad-dust-can-be-more-toxic-than-exhaust-emissions-study-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bruce66423 shares a report from The Guardian: Microscopic particles emitted from brake pads can be more toxic than those emitted in diesel vehicle exhaust, a study has found.

Exposure to pollution generated by cars, vans and lorries has been previously been linked to an increased risk of lung and heart disease. While past attention has mainly concentrated on exhaust emissions, particles are also released into the air from tyre, road and brake pad wear. These emissions are largely unregulated by legislation and the study found that these âoenon-exhaustâ pollution sources are now responsible for the majority of vehicle particulate matter emissions in the UK and parts of Europe, with brake dust the main contributor among them.
 
[...] The scientists examined the effects on lung health of particulate matter from four different types of brake pad with differing chemical compositions; low metallic, semi-metallic, non-asbestos organic and hybrid-ceramic. Results showed that of the four types of brake pads, non-asbestos organic pads were the most potent at inducing inflammation and other markers of toxicity, and were found to be more toxic to human lung cells than diesel exhaust particles. Ceramic pads were the second most toxic. Dr. Ian Mudway, senior lecturer at the school of public health at Imperial College London, cautioned that while the research on brake pad emissions appears sound, it is premature to conclude they are worse than diesel exhaust due to "uncontrolled variables" like brake disc types and particle composition.
 
Slashdot reader Bruce66423 also notes it "doesn't discuss the significance of regenerative breaking, which is a feature of at least some electric cars [that reduces brake pad wear by using the electric motor to slow down the vehicle and recover energy]."
 
The research has been published in the journal Particle and Fibre Technology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Theoretical and Experimental Constraints: Discussing Different Constraints on the Model Parameters</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/theoretical-and-experimental-constraints-discussing-different-constraints-on-the-model-parameters?source=rss</link><author>Phenomenology Technology</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:06:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[3.3 Theoretical and experimental constraintsWe discuss different constraints on the model parameters such as𝑈(1)𝑋 gauge coupling and scalar mixing angle.

The results are based on the work: Arindam Das, Shivam Gola, Sanjoy Mondal, Nita Sinha, "Two-Components Scalar and Fermionic Dark Matter candidates in a generic U(1)𝑋 model, Phys.Lett.B 2022.137117”.Underpinning the origin of neutrino mass and elucidating the nature of DM would constitute a major step forward in particle physics. Several simple extensions of the SM that can account for the DM have already been studied [136–143]. In these models, the SM particle content is extended by additional fields, and a discrete symmetry is usually introduced to guarantee the stability of the DM particle in cosmological scale. In recent years, a class of models has been proposed to incorporate the neutrino mass generation and the existence of DM in a unified framework. Motivated by this, people have studied well-motivated BSM framework based on the gauged 𝑈(1)𝑋 model [144–146]. The most intriguing aspect of this model is that including three generations of right-handed neutrinos, as in the type-I seesaw process for creating light neutrino masses, is no longer an option, but emerges as the simplest solution to eliminate the gauge and mixed gauge-gravity anomalies [147]. The scalar DM can be inherently stable in such models due to its 𝑈(1)𝑋 charge, but the fermionic DM cannot be realized in the simplest 𝑈(1)𝑋 model. Additional discrete symmetries can be introduced, which can stabilize one of the right-handed neutrinos to play the role of DM, while the other two neutrinos participate in the type I seesaw process to generate the required light neutrino masses and flavor mixing. Also, there are many models proposed in the literature, where neutrino mass generation is intimately connected with DM [148–153]. In these types of models, DM is a mediator of neutrino mass generation.\
A single-particle DM model may not be sufficient to account for the relic density of DM observed in the universe. Many such models face strong constraints from direct detection experiments and other observations. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider multi-particle DM scenarios, where two or more particles contribute to the DM abundance. [24,62,126]. Multi-component DM refers to a situation in which two or more particles contribute to the measured DM density. This has been already studied in many BSM scenarios [31, 56, 57, 154–166]. The multi-component DM model has also some benefits over the single dark matter scenario. For instance, it can avoid some stringent constraints arising from various experiments that probe the properties and interactions of dark matter and other particles. A multi-component DM model can also accommodate different observational features of dark matter, such as its distribution and abundance in the universe.(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I Became A Machine Learning Engineer (No CS Degree, No Bootcamp)</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-became-a-machine-learning-engineer-no-cs-degree-no-bootcamp/</link><author>Egor Howell</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:33:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Machine learning and AI are among the most popular topics nowadays, especially within the tech space. I am fortunate enough to work and develop with these technologies every day as a machine learning engineer!In this article, I will walk you through my journey to becoming a machine learning engineer, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!In one of my previous articles, I extensively wrote about my journey from school to securing my first Data Science job. I recommend you check out that article, but I will summarise the key timeline here.Pretty much everyone in my family studied some sort of STEM subject. My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.So, my path was always paved for me.I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it’s fair to say everyone was very proud!At school, I wasn’t dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn’t fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It’s mainly for students who don’t have a university offer.I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master’s degree in physics!There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn’t seem there was much opportunity in the space.During this time, DeepMind released theirdocumentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.You can hear more about my journey from a podcast.I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and generalised linear models (GLMs).I built models to predict: — Did someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.— What’s the premium we should give someone.— How many claims will someone have. — What’s the average claim value someone will have.I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.However, due to the company’s structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the “tech” side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in time series forecasting and optimisation problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.Fair to say I learned a lot. I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by Pau Labarta BajoML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues: -> You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance. -> You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don’t provide tangible value to a business.That’s not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.You want to say that you did “X that produced Y”, which the above two avenues allow you to do.The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that’s where I gravitated towards.To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.And that’s exactly what I did.Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!Fortunately, a role kind of “fell to me,” but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work — you don’t know what may come from it.I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist. — A machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That’s why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas. — If you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It’s not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me! — Most companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it’s best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take. — I am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout here.Data Structures & Algorithms — Understanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It’s not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick. — Again, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts. — Many MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse. This is why securing a machine learning engineer role can be quite challenging, as it requires proficiency across a wide range of skills.Summary & Further ThoughtsI have a free newsletter, , where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist. Plus, when you subscribe, you will get my and short PDF version of my AI roadmap!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI and the Future of Work: Transforming Industries</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ai-and-the-future-of-work-transforming-industries?source=rss</link><author>Ombir Sharma</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:13:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI or artificial intelligence is the capability and ability of a machine to imitate human intelligence. Intelligent systems are capable of learning, reasoning, and self-correcting. AI includes a number of technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. It is able to perform a wide array of functions from simple repetitive work to making complex decisions which changes the very fabric of industries.The Rise of Robotics and AIThe combination of AI and robotics is changing the world at an unprecedented rate; human errors are greatly reduced and proficiency is greatly improved across multiple industries. Robots powered by AI can be programmed to accomplish tasks that previously only humans could perform. From AI-trained chatbots at customer service to assembly lines in factories, this newly developed technology changes the workplace alongside societal norms.Effect of Artificial Intelligence on EmploymentAI is a double-edged sword with its impact on employment. The technology has created several new opportunities and increased overall productivity in numerous ways, however, it has also posed great threats to certain jobs and industries which can lead to displacement of employees.An important shift is on the horizon as the job market is about to undergo a role reversal change. As AI technology evolves, it is taking over the more labor-intensive tasks and as a result, human workers are becoming more strategic and analytic. AI alleviates repetitive tasks and allows employees to focus on creative problem-solving.The new approach AI takes centers around, just like the Industrial Revolution. While focusing on increasing productivity, ChatGPT and AutoGPT have the potential to perform tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and even more complex problem-solving, increasing overall demand for customer service representatives and support agents. In every age, these shifts in productivity have led to increased job opportunities, just like the multiple industries that formed alongside the technology integrations.Facilitation of EmploymentThe introduction of ChatGPT can aid everyday business operations, serving as virtual assistants that communicate primarily with customers. By streamlining business functions for flexible resource allocation, productivity is sure to increase. Efficient use of ChatGPT makes it incredibly simple for businesses to automate their customer inquiries, increasing profit margins.ChatGPT encourages an environmentally friendly approach by seamlessly optimizing supply chains with effective waste reduction strategies. AI, without a doubt, would optimize ChatGPT-provided decision-making to improve overall energy consumption and ensure economic goals are catered towards too.In the absence of people, ChatGPT opens doors to new interactions that drastically improve service and business operations through automation. Communication via virtual assistants and chatbots allows for effortless collaboration and automated customer interactions on a new level.\
In every way possible, AI improves business decision-making by offering adequate utility and data for correct allocation. Business AI helps set prices, predict market movement, and analyze how much risk varies. Keeping track of tools like ChatGPT can aid project-based decisions by providing up-to-date information.Elimination of Junior and Mid-level Staff PositionsAs a result of automation, junior and mid-level roles, particularly in data entry and administrative duties and tasks, are being skinned out. More companies seem to be using AI, which, in turn, is leading to an increased need for highly specialized and senior positions that require a supervisor to think strategically.Across different industries, AI is changing the future of work. From performing simple services to making complex decisions, AI has a broad range of applications, and as time goes by, the list only seems to grow.The Use Of AI In BusinessArtificial intelligence is being adopted in all sectors to boost productivity, accuracy, and satisfaction of customers. It is used in recruitment HR, in through chatbots, and in marketing through brand campaigns. Work processes are now being automated with AI, thereby, minimizing the costs of running the business.Impact Of AI On Business OperationsSoftware developments with regard to Artificial intelligence utilizing machine learning and automation present the future of the workplace, resulting in increased productivity. Businesses will continuously adopt AI to better their decisions, improve work processes, and promote creativity. Because of this, more skills in AI will be needed which will translate to new positions being created.In the field of finance, AI handles fraud detection, automates trading, and enhances risk assessments. Robo-advisors make investment suggestions based on a client’s unique profile, and AI chatbots provide further engagement with customers.AI assists in diagnosing diseases and personalizes treatments for patients in healthcare. With the help of AI-led robots, humans can make fewer mistakes while performing surgeries, which helps enhance patient care.In the automotive sector, AI enables self-driving cars, predictive maintenance, and smart traffic control. AI technologies also help improve vehicle safety and fuel efficiency.Cybersecurity is enhanced by AI technologies that assess new threats, detect anomalies, and provide assistance during the occurrence of cyber-attacks. Data security is also improved and business risks are suppressed by AI technologies.In the e-commerce sector, AI improves customer experiences, automates supply chains, and increases the level of service. Recommendation systems based on users' behavior increase the total sales and satisfaction level of customers.We see the growth of AI in hospitality in chatbots, smart booking systems, and customer experience applications. AI analytics also help with effective guest price settings and greater guest satisfaction.AI greatly assists in providing relevant lists of jobs that best suit a candidate's skills. AI technology helps to read a CV, understand the candidate's level of skills, and determine his success.Are My Working Opportunities On The Line Due To AI?Filling positions for repetitive work is indeed scalable with AI which is why it poses a threat for employment. In reality, AI also creates new possibilities by taking up low-productivity tasks. It is expected that new jobs that require creative thinking, emotions, and strategy-based decision-making will still exist. To ensure that they remain employed, workers must learn new skills and adjust to the new reality.AI is enabling the future of work by performing tasks that require time and effort, growing productivity, and changing the existing categorization of industries. Some roles may be lost, but there are always new positions that have to be filled. Being able to utilize AI together with other novel technologies is crucial to be successful for business professionals in the new world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;Please Stop Inviting AI Notetakers To Meetings&apos;</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/006253/please-stop-inviting-ai-notetakers-to-meetings?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most virtual meeting platforms these days include AI-powered notetaking tools or bots that join meetings as guests, transcribe discussions, and/or summarize key points. "The tech companies behind them might frame it as a step forward in efficiency, but the technology raises troubling questions around etiquette and privacy and risks undercutting the very communication it's meant to improve (paywalled; alternative source)," writes Chris Stokel-Walker in a Weekend Essay for Bloomberg. From the article: [...] The push to document every workplace interaction and utterance is not new. Having a paper trail has long been seen as a useful thing, and a record of decisions and action points is arguably what makes a meeting meaningful. The difference now is the inclusion of new technology that lacks the nuance and depth of understanding inherent to human interaction in a meeting room. In some ways, the prior generation of communication tools, such as instant messaging service Slack, created its own set of problems. Messaging that previously passed in private via email became much more transparent, creating a minefield where one wrong word or badly chosen emoji can explode into a dispute between colleagues. There is a similar risk with notetaking tools. Each utterance documented and analyzed by AI includes the potential for missteps and misunderstandings.
 
Anyone thinking of bringing an AI notetaker to a meeting must consider how other attendees will respond, says Andrew Brodsky, assistant professor of management at the McCombs School of Business, part of the University of Texas at Austin. Colleagues might think you want to better focus on what is said without missing out on a definitive record of the discussion. Or they might think, "You can't be bothered to take notes yourself or remember what was being talked about," he says. For the companies that sell these AI interlopers, the upside is clear. They recognize we're easily nudged into different behaviors and can quickly become reliant on tools that we survived without for years. [...] There's another benefit for tech companies getting us hooked on AI notetakers: Training data for AI systems is increasingly hard to come by. Research group Epoch AI forecasts there will be a drought of usable text possibly by next year. And with publishers unleashing lawsuits against AI companies for hoovering up their content, the tech firms are on the hunt for other sources of data. Notes from millions of meetings around the world could be an ideal option.
 
For those of us who are the source of such data, however, the situation is more nuanced. The key question is whether AI notetakers make office meetings more useless than so many already are. There's an argument that meetings are an important excuse for workers to come together and talk as human beings. All that small talk is where good ideas often germinate -- that's ostensibly why so many companies are demanding staff return to the office. But if workers trade in-person engagement for AI readbacks, and colleagues curb their words and ideas for fear of being exposed by bots, what's left? If the humans step back, all that remains is a series of data points and more AI slop polluting our lives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Uber sues DoorDash, alleging anti-competitive tactics</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/uber-sues-doordash-alleging-anti-competitive-tactics/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec, Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:35:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ride-share giant Uber filed a lawsuit Friday against DoorDash, accusing the delivery outfit of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals.

"Millions of people rely on such workers for timely deliveries, yet the low wages and brutal conditions of the job have forced many riders to seek out low-cost electric bicycles to perform the work -- exactly the kind of e-bikes that are least likely to have received safety certifications," reports Electrek. From the report: The NYC DOT has already begun accepting applications for the new E-Bike Trade-In Program, which is open to delivery workers with non-compliant electric bicycles as well as the often-seen electric scooters/mopeds that don't really qualify as e-bikes, despite their ubiquitous use in the industry. Interestingly, the program even accepts gasoline-powered mopeds that are not able to be legally registered with the DMV, including those that lack VINs. In exchange for trading in a non-certified vehicle, the delivery worker will receive a new UL-certified electric bike with a spare UL-certified battery.
 
There are a few requirements for eligibility. The worker has to have earned at least US $1,500 by working in the food delivery industry last year in 2024, live in one of the five New York City boroughs, be at least 18 years old, and own/use one of the eligible devices for trade-in. The program is free to participate in with no additional cost for the delivery workers. However, the supply of free electric bicycles is described as "limited." Those interested need to submit an application before the window closes on March 10, 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go 1.24 Brings Performance Improvements, Better WebAssembly Support</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Go-1.24-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:24:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go 1.24 was released this week by Google engineers as the newest step forward for this popular programming language...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing Impressions at Netflix</title><link>https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-impressions-at-netflix-e2b67c88c9fb?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4</link><author>Netflix Technology Blog</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:13:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://netflixtechblog.com/?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4">Netflix Tech Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Part 1: Creating the Source of Truth for ImpressionsImagine scrolling through Netflix, where each movie poster or promotional banner competes for your attention. Every image you hover over isn’t just a visual placeholder; it’s a critical data point that fuels our sophisticated personalization engine. At Netflix, we call these images ‘impressions,’ and they play a pivotal role in transforming your interaction from simple browsing into an immersive binge-watching experience, all tailored to your unique tastes.Capturing these moments and turning them into a personalized journey is no simple feat. It requires a state-of-the-art system that can track and process these impressions while maintaining a detailed history of each profile’s exposure. This nuanced integration of data and technology empowers us to offer bespoke content recommendations.In this multi-part blog series, we take you behind the scenes of our system that processes billions of impressions daily. We will explore the challenges we encounter and unveil how we are building a resilient solution that transforms these client-side impressions into a personalized content discovery experience for every Netflix viewer.Why do we need impression history?To tailor recommendations more effectively, it’s crucial to track what content a user has already encountered. Having impression history helps us achieve this by allowing us to identify content that has been displayed on the homepage but not engaged with, helping us deliver fresh, engaging recommendations.By maintaining a history of impressions, we can implement frequency capping to prevent over-exposure to the same content. This ensures users aren’t repeatedly shown identical options, keeping the viewing experience vibrant and reducing the risk of frustration or disengagement.Highlighting New ReleasesFor new content, impression history helps us monitor initial user interactions and adjust our merchandising efforts accordingly. We can experiment with different content placements or promotional strategies to boost visibility and engagement.Additionally, impression history offers insightful information for addressing a number of platform-related analytics queries. Analyzing impression history, for example, might help determine how well a specific row on the home page is functioning or assess the effectiveness of a merchandising strategy.The first pivotal step in managing impressions begins with the creation of a Source-of-Truth (SOT) dataset. This foundational dataset is essential, as it supports various downstream workflows and enables a multitude of use cases.Collecting Raw Impression EventsAs Netflix members explore our platform, their interactions with the user interface spark a vast array of raw events. These events are promptly relayed from the client side to our servers, entering a centralized event processing queue. This queue ensures we are consistently capturing raw events from our global user base.After raw events are collected into a centralized queue, a custom event extractor processes this data to identify and extract all impression events. These extracted events are then routed to an Apache Kafka topic for immediate processing needs and simultaneously stored in an Apache Iceberg table for long-term retention and historical analysis. This dual-path approach leverages Kafka’s capability for low-latency streaming and Iceberg’s efficient management of large-scale, immutable datasets, ensuring both real-time responsiveness and comprehensive historical data availability.Filtering & Enriching Raw ImpressionsOnce the raw impression events are queued, a stateless Apache Flink job takes charge, meticulously processing this data. It filters out any invalid entries and enriches the valid ones with additional metadata, such as show or movie title details, and the specific page and row location where each impression was presented to users. This refined output is then structured using an Avro schema, establishing a definitive source of truth for Netflix’s impression data. The enriched data is seamlessly accessible for both real-time applications via Kafka and historical analysis through storage in an Apache Iceberg table. This dual availability ensures immediate processing capabilities alongside comprehensive long-term data retention.Ensuring High Quality ImpressionsMaintaining the highest quality of impressions is a top priority. We accomplish this by gathering detailed column-level metrics that offer insights into the state and quality of each impression. These metrics include everything from validating identifiers to checking that essential columns are properly filled. The data collected feeds into a comprehensive quality dashboard and supports a tiered threshold-based alerting system. These alerts promptly notify us of any potential issues, enabling us to swiftly address regressions. Additionally, while enriching the data, we ensure that all columns are in agreement with each other, offering in-place corrections wherever possible to deliver accurate data.We handle a staggering volume of 1 to 1.5 million impression events globally every second, with each event approximately 1.2KB in size. To efficiently process this massive influx in real-time, we employ Apache Flink for its low-latency stream processing capabilities, which seamlessly integrates both batch and stream processing to facilitate efficient backfilling of historical data and ensure consistency across real-time and historical analyses. Our Flink configuration includes 8 task managers per region, each equipped with 8 CPU cores and 32GB of memory, operating at a parallelism of 48, allowing us to handle the necessary scale and speed for seamless performance delivery. The Flink job’s sink is equipped with a data mesh connector, as detailed in our Data Mesh platform which has two outputs: Kafka and Iceberg. This setup allows for efficient streaming of real-time data through Kafka and the preservation of historical data in Iceberg, providing a comprehensive and flexible data processing and storage solution.We utilize the ‘island model’ for deploying our Flink jobs, where all dependencies for a given application reside within a single region. This approach ensures high availability by isolating regions, so if one becomes degraded, others remain unaffected, allowing traffic to be shifted between regions to maintain service continuity. Thus, all data in one region is processed by the Flink job deployed within that region.Addressing the Challenge of Unschematized EventsAllowing raw events to land on our centralized processing queue unschematized offers significant flexibility, but it also introduces challenges. Without a defined schema, it can be difficult to determine whether missing data was intentional or due to a logging error. We are investigating solutions to introduce schema management that maintains flexibility while providing clarity.Automating Performance Tuning with AutoscalersTuning the performance of our Apache Flink jobs is currently a manual process. The next step is to integrate with autoscalers, which can dynamically adjust resources based on workload demands. This integration will not only optimize performance but also ensure more efficient resource utilization.Improving Data Quality AlertsRight now, there’s a lot of business rules dictating when a data quality alert needs to be fired. This leads to a lot of false positives that require manual judgement. A lot of times it is difficult to track changes leading to regression due to inadequate data lineage information. We are investing in building a comprehensive data quality platform that more intelligently identifies anomalies in our impression stream, keeps track of data lineage and data governance, and also, generates alerts notifying producers of any regressions. This approach will enhance efficiency, reduce manual oversight, and ensure a higher standard of data integrity.Creating a reliable source of truth for impressions is a complex but essential task that enhances personalization and discovery experience. Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where we’ll delve into how we use this SOT dataset to create a microservice that provides impression histories. We invite you to share your thoughts in the comments and continue with us on this journey of discovering impressions.We are genuinely grateful to our amazing colleagues whose contributions were essential to the success of Impressions: Julian Jaffe, Bryan Keller, Yun Wang, Brandon Bremen, Kyle Alford, Ron Brown and Shriya Arora.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Study Finds Relying on AI Kills Your Critical Thinking Skills</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/2320203/microsoft-study-finds-relying-on-ai-kills-your-critical-thinking-skills?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new study (PDF) from researchers at Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University found that increased reliance on AI tools leads to a decline in critical thinking skills. Gizmodo reports: The researchers tapped 319 knowledge workers -- a person whose job involves handling data or information -- and asked them to self-report details of how they use generative AI tools in the workplace. The participants were asked to report tasks that they were asked to do, how they used AI tools to complete them, how confident they were in the AI's ability to do the task, their ability to evaluate that output, and how confident they were in their own ability to complete the same task without any AI assistance.
 
Over the course of the study, a pattern revealed itself: the more confident the worker was in the AI's capability to complete the task, the more often they could feel themselves letting their hands off the wheel. The participants reported a "perceived enaction of critical thinking" when they felt like they could rely on the AI tool, presenting the potential for over-reliance on the technology without examination. This was especially true for lower-stakes tasks, the study found, as people tended to be less critical. While it's very human to have your eyes glaze over for a simple task, the researchers warned that this could portend to concerns about "long-term reliance and diminished independent problem-solving."
 
By contrast, when the workers had less confidence in the ability of AI to complete the assigned task, the more they found themselves engaging in their critical thinking skills. In turn, they typically reported more confidence in their ability to evaluate what the AI produced and improve upon it on their own. Another noteworthy finding of the study: users who had access to generative AI tools tended to produce "a less diverse set of outcomes for the same task" compared to those without.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Did Semgrep Just Get a Lot More Interesting?</title><link>https://fly.io/blog/semgrep-but-for-real-now/</link><author>ghuntley</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:40:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This bit by Geoffrey Huntley is super interesting to me and, despite calling out that LLM-driven development agents like Cursor have something like a 40% success rate at actually building anything that passes acceptance criteria, makes me think that more of the future of our field belongs to people who figure out how to use this weird bags of model weights than any of us are comfortable with. I’ve been dinking around with Cursor for a week now (if you haven’t, I think it’s something close to malpractice not to at least take it — or something like it — for a spin) and am just now from this post learning that Cursor has this rules feature. The important thing for me is not how Cursor rules work, but rather how Huntley uses them. He turns them back on themselves, writing rules to tell Cursor how to organize the rules, and then teach Cursor how to write (under human supervision) its own rules.Cursor kept trying to get Huntley to use Bazel as a build system. So he had cursor write a rule for itself: “no bazel”. And there was no more Bazel. If I’d known I could do this, I probably wouldn’t have bounced from the Elixir project I had Cursor doing, where trying to get it to write simple unit tests got it all tangled up trying to make Mox work. But I’m burying the lead. Security people have been for several years now somewhat in love with a tool called Semgrep. Semgrep is a semantics-aware code search tool; using symbolic variable placeholders and otherwise ordinary code, you can write rules to match pretty much arbitary expressions and control flow. If you’re an appsec person, where you obviously go with this is: you build a library of Semgrep searches for well-known vulnerability patterns (or, if you’re like us at Fly.io, you work out how to get Semgrep to catch the Rust concurrency footgun of RWLocks inside if-lets).The reality for most teams though is “ain’t nobody got time for that”. But I just checked and, unsurprisingly, 4o seems to do reasonably well at generating Semgrep rules? Like: I have no idea if this rule is actually any good. But it looks like a Semgrep rule?What interests me is this: it seems obvious that we’re going to do more and more “closed-loop” LLM agent code generation stuff. By “closed loop”, I mean that the thingy that generates code is going to get to run the code and watch what happens when it’s interacted with. You’re just a small bit of glue code and a lot of system prompting away from building something like that right now: Chris McCord is building a thingy that generates whole Elixir/Phoenix apps and runs them as Fly Machines. When you deploy these kinds of things, the LLM gets to see the errors when the code is run, and it can just go fix them. It also gets to see errors and exceptions in the logs when you hit a page on the app, and it can just go fix them.With a bit more system prompting, you can get an LLM to try to generalize out from exceptions it fixes and generate unit test coverage for them. With a little bit more system prompting, you can probably get an LLM to (1) generate a Semgrep rule for the generalized bug it caught, (2) test the Semgrep rule with a positive/negative control, (3) save the rule, (4) test the whole codebase with Semgrep for that rule, and (5) fix anything it finds that way. That is a lot more interesting to me than tediously (and probably badly) trying to predict everything that will go wrong in my codebase a priori and Semgrepping for them. Which is to say: Semgrep — which I have always liked — is maybe a lot more interesting now? And tools like it?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI’s Hallucinations Are Over</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ais-hallucinations-are-over?source=rss</link><author>Oleksandr Zabashnyi</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:39:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, let me describe the problem. I am a software developer, and I don't use AI to write code just because of hallucinations. For creating pictures or writing texts they are not so critical, but for the task of writing code, they are overkill. I have identified two subproblems. Firstly, it is difficult to identify the errors made by AI. It is quite easy for a designer as he counts the fingers in the pictures and that's it; the picture is accepted as the result. \
However, I have to deal with the code and seek the mistakes in it. I hate to do it. Secondly, it is the irreproducibility of the result. For example, I tried to write unit tests: the first generated unit test is successful, but the second one is not, even for the same method. This makes working with it impossible.\
Now, about the solution. Our hypothesis was as follows: what if we could assign the corresponding result data to a certain set of input information? And do that at least sometimes during the task-solving process. Would that reduce the number of hallucinations? Oh yes! After thorough research, we have come to the conclusion that the presence of a critical mass of such ‘rigidly fixed’ nodes almost completely removed hallucinations from the output. All that remained was to find the criteria for identifying these correspondences between input and output information and to modify the math apparatus to enable the use of this approach. We called this method the "preset landscape."\
Certainly, our approach has several limitations. First of all, the subject area should imply the existence of only one correct answer for a given set of output data. Fortunately, software development is exactly such an area. The second limitation is that at the stage of landscape formation, the participation of an expert in the subject field is required. In other words, it is impossible to apply the math apparatus to the areas where a human cannot articulate the rules. These limitations greatly narrow the scope of application of our approach. However, its usage in such areas as software development, law, healthcare, and engineering tasks is more than enough.\
To demonstrate the capabilities of the math apparatus, we have developed a plugin for IntelliJ Idea (JetBrains). You can install it and make sure that there are no hallucinations. Here, you can find the instructions.\
While we were working on the plugin, AI services came into vogue, which provides API and you can use them in your own solutions. Therefore, we are planning to make such a platform for software development tasks. We will most likely start with Java. If you have an insight into how this approach can be implemented for lawyers or healthcare professionals - feel free to share.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PIN AI Launches Mobile App Letting You Make Your Own Personalized, Private AI Model</title><link>https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/2227222/pin-ai-launches-mobile-app-letting-you-make-your-own-personalized-private-ai-model?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from VentureBeat: A new startup PIN AI (not to be confused with the poorly reviewed hardware device the AI Pin by Humane) has emerged from stealth to launch its first mobile app, which lets a user select an underlying open-source AI model that runs directly on their smartphone (iOS/Apple iPhone and Google Android supported) and remains private and totally customized to their preferences. Built with a decentralized infrastructure that prioritizes privacy, PIN AI aims to challenge big tech's dominance over user data by ensuring that personal AI serves individuals -- not corporate interests. Founded by AI and blockchain experts from Columbia, MIT and Stanford, PIN AI is led by Davide Crapis, Ben Wu and Bill Sun, who bring deep experience in AI research, large-scale data infrastructure and blockchain security. [...]
 
PIN AI introduces an alternative to centralized AI models that collect and monetize user data. Unlike cloud-based AI controlled by large tech firms, PIN AI's personal AI runs locally on user devices, allowing for secure, customized AI experiences without third-party surveillance. At the heart of PIN AI is a user-controlled data bank, which enables individuals to store and manage their personal information while allowing developers access to anonymized, multi-category insights -- ranging from shopping habits to investment strategies. This approach ensures that AI-powered services can benefit from high-quality contextual data without compromising user privacy.
[...]
The new mobile app launched in the U.S. and multiple regions also includes key features such as: - The "God model" (guardian of data): Helps users track how well their AI understands them, ensuring it aligns with their preferences. - Ask PIN AI: A personalized AI assistant capable of handling tasks like financial planning, travel coordination and product recommendations. - Open-source integrations: Users can connect apps like Gmail, social media platforms and financial services to their personal AI, training it to better serve them without exposing data to third parties. - "With our app, you have a personal AI that is your model," Crapis added. "You own the weights, and it's completely private, with privacy-preserving fine-tuning." Davide Crapis, co-founder of PIN AI, told VentureBeat that the app currently supports several open-source AI models, including small versions of DeepSeek and Meta's Llama. "With our app, you have a personal AI that is your model," Crapis added. "You own the weights, and it's completely private, with privacy-preserving fine-tuning."

A new engineer manager arrives and asks for the following:On every PR, run integration tests in a Kubernetes cluster similar to the production one.\
In this series of posts, I'll show how you can do it. My plan is the following:This blog post focuses on the app, the basic GitHub workflow setup, and testing both locally and during the workflow run.The second blog post will detail the setup of a Google Kubernetes Engine instance and how to adapt the workflow to use it.Unit Testing vs. Integration TestingIntegration Testing is a strategy to test the collaboration of at least two components.\
I translated it in Object-Oriented Programming as:Integration Testing is a strategy to test the collaboration of at least two classes.Let’s consider the making of a car. Single-class testing is akin to testing each nut and bolt separately. Imagine testing of such components brought no issue to light. Still, it would be very risky to mass manufacture the car without having built a prototype and sent it to a test drive.\
However, technology has evolved since that time.I use the word "technology" very generally, but I have Testcontainers in mind:Unit tests with real dependencies\
  Testcontainers is an open source library for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.\
In effect, Testcontainers replaces  with "real" dependencies-containerized. It's a real game-changer: instead of painfully writing mocking code to stub dependencies just set them up regularly.\
For example, without Testcontainers, you'd need to provide mocks for your  in tests; with it, you only need to start a database container, and off you go.\
At the time, the cost of having a local Docker daemon in your testing environment offset many benefits. It's not the case anymore, as Docker daemons are available (nearly) everywhere.\
My definition of Integration Testing has changed a bit:Integration Testing is testing that requires significant setup.\
The definition is vague on purpose, as significance has a different meaning depending on the organization, the team, and the individual. Note that Google defines two categories of tests: fast and slow. Their definition is equally vague, meant to adapt to different contexts.In any case, the golden rule still applies: the closer you are to the final environment, the more risks you cover, and the more valuable your tests are. \
If our target production environment is Kubernetes, we will reap the most benefits from running the app on Kubernetes and testing it as a black box. It doesn't mean that white box testing in a more distant environment is not beneficial; it means that the more significant the gap between the testing environment and the target environment, the fewer issues we will uncover.\
For the purposes of this blog post, we will use GitHub as the base testing environment for unit testing and a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster for integration testing. There is no absolute truth regarding what is the best practice™, as contexts vary widely across organizations and even across teams within the same organization. It's up to every engineer to decide within their specific context the ROI of setting up such an environment because the closer you are to production, the more complex and, thus, expensive it will be.Use-case: Application With DatabaseLet's jump into how to test an app that uses a database to store its data. I don't want anything fancy, just solid, standard engineering practices. I'll be using a CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) JVM-based app, but most of the following can easily apply to other stacks as well. The following blog posts will involve less language-specific content.Kotlin, because I love the languageSpring Boot: it's the most widespread framework for JVM-based applicationsMaven-there's nothing elseProject Reactor and coroutines, because it makes things more interestingPostgreSQL-at the moment, it's a very popular database, and it's well-supported by Spring\
If you don't know Flyway, it allows you to track database schemas and data in a code repository and manage changes, known as migrations, between versions. Each migration has a unique version, , v1.0, v1.1, v2.1.2, etc. Flyway tries to apply migration in order. If it has already applied a migration, it skips it. Flyway stores its data in a dedicated table to track the applied migrations.\
This approach is a must-have; Liquibase is an alternative that follows the same principles.\
Spring Boot fully integrates Flyway and Liquibase. When the app starts, the framework will kickstart them. If a pod is killed and restarted, Flyway will first check the migrations table to apply only the one that didn't run previously.\
I don't want to bore you with the app details; you can find the code on GitHub.Per my definition above, unit testing should be easy to set up. With Testcontainers, it is.\
The testing code counts the number of items in a table, inserts a new item, and counts the number of items again. It then checks that:There's one additional item compared to the initial countThat the new item is the one we inserted@SpringBootTest                                                              //1
class VClusterPipelineTest @Autowired constructor(private val repository: ProductRepository) { //2

    @Test
    fun `When inserting a new Product, there should be one more Product in the database and the last inserted Product should be the one inserted`() { //3
        runBlocking {                                                        //4
            val initialCount = repository.count()                            //5
            // The rest of the test
        }
    }
}
Initialize the Spring contextPraise Kotlin for allowing for descriptive function namesRun non-blocking code in a blocking function\
We now need a PostgreSQL database; Testcontainers can provide one for us. However, to avoid conflicts, it will choose a random port until it finds an unused one. We need it to connect to the database, run the Flyway migration, and run the testing code.\
For this reason, we must write a bit of additional code:@Profile("local")                                                              //1

            withUsername(userName)
            withPassword(pass)
            start()
        }
    }
}

class TestContainerInitializer : ApplicationContextInitializer<ConfigurableApplicationContext> {
    override fun initialize(applicationContext: ConfigurableApplicationContext) {
        if (applicationContext.environment.activeProfiles.contains("local")) {
            TestPropertyValues.of(                                             //2
                "spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:postgresql://${TestContainerConfig.postgres.host}:${TestContainerConfig.postgres.firstMappedPort}/$name",
                "spring.r2dbc.username=$name",
                "spring.r2dbc.password=$pass",
                "spring.flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://${TestContainerConfig.postgres.host}:${TestContainerConfig.postgres.firstMappedPort}/$name",
                "spring.flyway.user=$name",
                "spring.flyway.password=$pass"
            ).applyTo(applicationContext.environment)
        }
    }
}
Start the container, but only if the Spring Boot profile  is active.Override the configuration values.\
We need to specify neither the  nor the  if we hacked the  to reuse the R2BC parameters of the same name:spring:
  application:
    name: vcluster-pipeline
  r2dbc:
    username: test
    password: test
    url: r2dbc:postgresql://localhost:8082/flyway-test-db
  flyway:
    user: ${SPRING_R2DBC_USERNAME}                                             #1
    password: ${SPRING_R2DBC_PASSWORD}                                         #1
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8082/flyway-test-db
Smart hack to DRY configuration further down.\
We also annotate the previous test class to use the initializer:@SpringBootTest
@ContextConfiguration(initializers = [TestContainerInitializer::class])
class VClusterPipelineTest @Autowired constructor(private val repository: ProductRepository) {

    // No change
}
\
Spring Boot offers a couple of options to activate profiles. For local development, we can use a simple JVM property, , mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=local; in the CI pipeline, we will use environment variables instead.I'll also use Flyway to create the database structure for integration testing. In the scope of this example, the System Under Test will be the entire app; hence, I'll test from the HTTP endpoints. It's end-to-end testing for APIs. The code will test the same behavior, albeit treating the System Under Test as a black box.class VClusterPipelineIT {

    val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this::class.java)

    @Test
    fun `When inserting a new Product, there should be one more Product in the database and the last inserted Product should be the one inserted`() {

        val baseUrl = System.getenv("APP_BASE_URL") ?: "http://localhost:8080" //1

        logger.info("Using base URL: $baseUrl")

        val client = WebTestClient.bindToServer()                              //2
            .baseUrl(baseUrl)
            .build()

        val initialResponse: EntityExchangeResult<List<Product?>?> = client.get() //3
            .uri("/products")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk
            .expectBodyList(Product::class.java)
            .returnResult()

        val initialCount = initialResponse.responseBody?.size?.toLong()        //4

        val now = LocalDateTime.now()
        val product = Product(
            id = UUID.randomUUID(),
            name = "My awesome product",
            description = "Really awesome product",
            price = 100.0,
            createdAt = now
        )

        client.post()                                                          //5
            .uri("/products")
            .bodyValue(product)
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk
            .expectBody(Product::class.java)

        client.get()                                                           //6
            .uri("/products")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk
            .expectBodyList(Product::class.java)
            .hasSize((initialCount!! + 1).toInt())
    }
}
Get the deployed app URL.Create a web client that uses the former.Get the initial item list.Get the size; we definitely should offer a count function if there are too many items.Insert a new item and assert everything works out fine.Get the list of items and assert the item count is higher by one.\
Before going further, let's run the tests in a GitHub workflow.I'll assume you're familiar with GitHub workflows. If you aren't, a GitHub workflow is a declarative description of an automated job. A job consists of several steps. GitHub offers several triggers: Manual, scheduled, or depending on an event.\
We want the workflow to run on each Pull Request to verify that tests run as expected.name: Test on PR                                                               #1

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]                                                     #2
Trigger on a PR to the master branch.\
The first steps are pretty standard:jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install JRE
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 21
          cache: maven                                                         #1
The  action includes a caching option for build tools. Here, it will cache dependencies across runs, speeding up consecutive runs. Unless you have good reasons not to, I recommend using this option.\
For the same reason, we should cache our built artifacts. While researching for this post, I learned that GitHub discards them across runs and steps in the same run. Hence, we can speed up the runs by caching them explicitly:      - name: Cache build artifacts
        uses: actions/cache@v4                                                 <1>
        with:
          path: target
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ github.sha }}                        <2>
          restore-keys:
            ${{ runner.os }}-build                                             <3>
Use the same action that  uses under the hood.Compute the cache key. In our case, the  should be immutable, but this should be how you run matrices across different operating systems.Reuse the cache if it's the same OS.      - name: Run "unit" tests
        run: ./mvnw -B test
        env:
          SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: local                                        <1>
Activate the local profile. The workflow's environment provides a Docker daemon. Hence, Testcontainer successfully downloads and runs the database container.\
At this point, we should run the integration test. Yet, we need the app deployed to run this test. For this, we need available infrastructure.Alternative "Unit testing" on GitHubThe above works perfectly on GitHub, but we can move closer to the deployment setup by leveraging GitHub service containers. Let's migrate PostgreSQL from Testcontainers to a GitHub service container.\
Removing Testcontainers is pretty straightforward: we do not activate the  profile.\
Using GitHub's service container requires an additional section in our workflow:jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GH_PG_USER: testuser                                                     #1
      GH_PG_PASSWORD: testpassword                                             #1
      GH_PG_DB: testdb                                                         #1
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        options: >-                                                            #2
          --health-cmd "pg_isready -U $POSTGRES_USER"
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
        ports:
            - 5432/tcp                                                         #3
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: ${{ env.GH_PG_USER }}                                 #4
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ env.GH_PG_PASSWORD }}                         #4
          POSTGRES_DB: ${{ env.GH_PG_DB }}                                     #4
Define environment variables at the job level to use them across steps. You can use secrets, but in this case, the database instance is not exposed outside the workflow and will be switched off when the latter finishes. Environment variables are good enough to avoid adding unnecessary secrets.Make sure that PostgreSQL works before going further.Assign a random port and map it to the underlying  port.Use the environment variables.\
To run the tests using the above configuration is straightforward.      - name: Run "unit" tests
        run: ./mvnw -B test
        env:
          SPRING_FLYWAY_URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:${{ job.services.postgres.ports['5432'] }}/${{ env.GH_PG_DB }} #1
          SPRING_R2DBC_URL: r2dbc:postgresql://localhost:${{ job.services.postgres.ports['5432'] }}/${{ env.GH_PG_DB }} #1
          SPRING_R2DBC_USERNAME: ${{ env.GH_PG_USER }}
          SPRING_R2DBC_PASSWORD: ${{ env.GH_PG_PASSWORD }}
GitHub runs PostgreSQL on a local Docker, so the host is . We can get the random port with the ${{ job.services.postgres.ports['5432'] }} syntax.In this post, we laid the ground for a simple app's unit- and integration-testing, leveraging Testcontainers in the local environment. We then proceeded to automate unit testing via a GitHub workflow with the help of GitHub service containers. In the next post, we will prepare the Kubernetes environment on a Cloud provider infrastructure, build the image, and deploy it to the latter.\

This was a neighborhood with Razor scooters dumped in trimmed front lawns. Where family walks with leashed dogs happened down the middle of intentionally curved streets named after long demolished natural landmarks like "Timbercrest" and "Forest Trails." Where the HOA (because of course there was an HOA) banned the installation of driveway basketball hoops.Receiving industrial freight deliveries, freshly cleared through international customs, probably wasn't explicitly prohibited in the homeowner's handbook. But then, why would it need to be? Nobody would think to bring that kind of commercial chaos into the burgeoning middle-class peace of Castle Pines North in 1998.If neighbors peeking behind curtains at the idling 18-wheeler thought to call in a complaint, the husband and wife receiving the delivery didn't notice. They were too busy unloading boxes—more than 800 of them. Balancing four at a time on a handcart, it took 200 trips through the open garage door and down the unfinished basement steps. The boxes, holding smaller rectangular packages inscribed with Japanese lettering, were piled to the ceiling. There was enough room left for a skinny aisle leading back up the stairs, and two plastic tables ladened with tape and flat-rate USPS packaging. 5,800 miles away, a man in middle management at the global toy conglomerate Hasbro must have been very pleased. The delivery represented a small yet unexpected boon. Those boxes were dead inventory, wasting space in a nondescript warehouse. They should have been headed for a landfill and a tax write-off. Instead, a Mr. Toshio Takiguchi brokered the export at a ¥1,300 per-unit cost. Not a tidy profit, but no longer a loss on the annual P&L. The remains of a failed business decision disappeared across the ocean. It was a certain Mr. Fox's problem now.That problem cost $43,000, a sum that represented the entire life savings of Mr. Fox and his wife, who at that point had been surviving on public-school salaries. Friends and family never really said it out loud, but they were certainly thinking it: This was insane. What about the three kids and that mortgage? The couple, though, never had a doubt. "He always used to tell me, 'If I had 10,000 of these, I could sell them in a year,'" Mrs. Fox recalled, 27 years later.That's the unabashed confidence you'd expect from any good entrepreneur, especially with the benefit of hindsight. But ask yourself this: Would you, watching this couple unload box after box into their bank-financed home, have bet on this man and his family's future if you knew exactly what he needed to sell?Tucked inside those boxes, in nested columns of 12, were 120,000 plastic cups. They were turned upside down, each with a hole drilled through the middle of the base, rendering them useless in terms of a cup's normal, and really only, task.The couple's future hinged on accomplishing what the world's second largest toy company could not: convincing thousands of kids that stacking these plastic cups in pre-determined patterns was … . More critically, the couple needed to convince the parents of those kids to actually buy these cups, despite not even being able to drink from them. Mr. Takiguchi could breathe a sigh of relief. Mr. and Mrs. Fox had to get to work.The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown ... The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a really, really good clown. Every few months, in different corners of the internet, someone asks a version of the same question: Why did we all stack plastic cups in elementary school PE class?You might have even asked it yourself, perhaps after a few beers when a friend turned some Solo Cups upside down, activating one of your mid-aughts memories of sitting cross-legged on a linoleum gym floor, surrounded by the clatter of your classmates piling cups into pyramids.Sport Stacking, as it's officially known (cup stacking and speed stacking as it is colloquially known), exists in the same cloud of millennial nostalgia where you'll find vague recollections of SlamBall and JoJo. It has appeared on pretty much every morning and late show, been a trend piece in both the  and , and was once labeled by Glenn Beck as "what’s really wrong with America."It has been a minor plot line in , Matt LeBlanc's , and ; it's been the major plot line in a 2022 Thai-language film released on Netflix titled  (100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes). The infamous "Oh my gosh!" scream in Skrillex's "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" was sampled from a viral sport stacking video from 2008.At its peak, between 2002 and 2011, roughly 5,000 American schools included it as part of their annual curriculum, according to Mr. and Mrs. Fox. That means somewhere between five and eight percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 22 and 35 share the same core memory—and in the ensuing years have asked themselves, their friends, or social media the same question: Why did credentialed educational professionals make us do this ludicrous activity in gym class?I am, perhaps, the person best suited on the planet to answer this question. Because the answer … is my dad.The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown. Not in the figurative, funnyman personality sense. In the literal red-nose, black-eyeliner, juggling-tennis-balls-at-children’s-birthday-parties sense.The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a really, really good clown. He'd scoff at the mental image you probably have of him right now: oversized shoes, cartoonish honks, and bumbling choreography. My dad's act was entirely silent, required immense skill, and was predicated on audience participation. He was equally good at riding a unicycle and convincing the most curmudgeonly dad in the room to leave their back corner and join him onstage to try—and always fail—at blowing up a balloon animal. Kids went bananas. Adults always laughed. The San Francisco 49ers hired him to be the walk-around entertainment for their post–Super Bowl ring ceremony in 1995. We used to shut the shades so neighbors didn't think he robbed a bank as he counted the cash he earned during Denver's largest busking festival.This was a man who took the unserious very, very seriously. As a high school theater teacher, he'd spend 60–80 hours a week building out increasingly elaborate sets for the annual musical. He built a life-sized plant puppet that could actually eat cast members for , and cut a full-sized muscle car in half so it would fit on stage during ; another car was hoisted onto the school's roof to promote the show. Before her bevy of Oscar nominations, Amy Adams was one of his choreographers and students.He quit because his wife, Jill, needed him home more to help raise their three children. So he became an elementary school classroom and PE teacher instead, where he would end up teaching hundreds of kids how to ride unicycles and produce an annual show on the blacktop basketball court called KidZircus.The first thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that before working as a communications administrator at a school district, she used to be a journalist at a small newspaper, where she was assigned to write a profile about a local clown on "sabbatical" from his full-time job. The second thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that despite the word "sabbatical" doing a generous amount of euphemistic work in her final published piece, she married that unemployed clown.This was a woman who was very, very good at seeing—and supporting—the potential in the crazy.They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: Uncle Johnny.It took them 10 months to sell the 10,000 sets of 12 cups. Kids in south Denver, it turns out, went absolutely nuts over this new phenomenon called "cup stacking." That's mostly because my dad figured out the one thing Hasbro did not: The level of interest in the activity hinged almost exclusively on the enthusiasm and skill level of a real-life teacher. Without that, it was just inanimate plastic ephemera sitting on a shelf.The basic rules take about 15 minutes to learn. Like a track meet, the sport is built on completing different "distances" as fast as you can. The shortest, and simplest, is called the 3-3-3. Envision each one of those 3's as a nested column of cups. You start on one side and "upstack" the first 3 into a pyramid, then move to the middle, and then the last 3. Then you return to where you started, and "downstack" them back into columns in the same order. The 3-6-3 has the same principle, but with a pyramid of six cups in the middle. The "Cycle," is the sport's primetime event, starting with the 3-6-3, morphing into a 6-6, and ending with a 1-10-1.If you skimmed over that clunky paragraph, you've proved my dad's foundational epiphany: You really need to see it to buy in. In fact, scrap reading this for a few seconds (that's all it will take) and watch this video instead.Place a set of these cups in the corner of a room or on a toy shelf with paper instructions, and you might earn five minutes of an 8-year-old's frenzied attention. Put that same 8-year-old on the gym floor in front of a professionally trained clown with a passion for juggling, and they will be utterly hooked.A brief digression on nomenclature: The sport was known as "cup stacking" until 2005, when my parents had the savvy to officially change the name to "sport stacking." Why? 1) Because it sounds way cooler, and if enough people call it a sport then it must damn well be one. 2) The phrase "cup stacking" out of context evokes toddlers playing with blocks, a vibe they wanted to avoid. Confusingly, you might have also seen it referenced as "speed stacking," after the company they eventually founded, Speed Stacks. They strategically eschewed this label to avoid the fate of Roller Blades, Frisbee, and Kleenex, all formerly good standing trademarks, until you lot ruined everything. Except for this early-stage reference, I'll be calling it sport stacking hereafter so as to avoid a grumpy phone call from my dad (he'll probably still call about my use of "damn," though). If you have a problem with that, consider the last time you went berserk over a nine-darter or screamed at the Swedish curling team during the Olympics. As my dad likes to say, there used to be a man trying to convince the world that tossing balls made from dried cow skin into retrofitted peach baskets was fun—and you all bought in.It is important to note that my dad did not actually invent sport stacking. Credit goes to a group of bored kids at a Boys and Girls Club in Oceanside, Calif., in the early 1980s. They'd been given a stack of paper cups, and told to figure out a game that didn't involve messy liquid. Under the guidance of a program director named Wayne Godinet, both the rules and equipment evolved. He is responsible for the sport's first major innovation: He drilled a hole through the base of hard plastic cups to reduce air friction and prevent sticking. The California group's high-water mark came on Nov. 2, 1990, when they appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Among the millions watching that night, from his bed in a south Denver suburb: a clown and future PE teacher who thought it looked a bit like upside-down juggling.Hasbro must have been watching, too. Perhaps chasing the Hoola Hoop and Pogs high of the '80s, the company scooped up a license to sell "Kup Stax," popping sets in a rectangular plastic sleeve on toy store shelves around the world. Instead of becoming a fad, the product moved to the clearance rack. Someone in middle management was probably scolded. Manufacturing ceased. In 1995, my dad attended a physical education development workshop to give new teachers a dozen ideas on how to keep kids occupied, exercised, and docile. The classics were all there: four-wheeled square scooters designed to give 80 percent of users elbow burn, dodgeballs primed to pop kids like me in the face, that large circus tent you toss above your head until it temporarily inflates so you can sit under it for a few seconds. So were the cups. He brought them home and taught his kids. I was 4, my brother 6, our sister 9. We not only fell in love with them, we got good—. We weren't outliers. Among an elementary school of 500 students, 250 signed up for an afterschool program to keep stacking. My mom drove to every Toys "R" Us and Walmart within a 50-mile radius. She bought every set of Kup Stax she could find. They were always discounted, tucked in a back corner.The local supply ran dry as my parents hosted workshops. Demand started to skyrocket from other PE teachers. My parents needed to go upstream. They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: .Now 64 with a Colonel Sanders goatee and passion for intricate leather carving, my dad's brother has been at certain points in his life: a professor at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College; a street mime in San Diego; a director of a Las Vegas magic show, performed entirely on ice; and a consultant for Japan's oldest and largest circus. If you need to find a man in middle management at Hasbro's Tokyo corporate office, you call Uncle Johnny.The deal was struck. The shipment arrived. And the cups, rather magically, disappeared from our basement.By 1998, Bob Fox was a dealer with no product and an increasingly addicted customer base. There was only one logical next step: Transition from distribution to fabrication.He did make a final good-faith effort to partner with the sport's originator, Wayne Godinet, offering to purchase $20,000 worth of product. It was almost a third of the profit earned from reselling the Japanese shipment. Godinet sent back two sample sets with a bill for the cost of goods and shipping.In a similar vein, Nike was founded in 1964 only after a running shoe company called Onitsuka lost interest in partnering with a recent Oregon track grad named Phil Knight. While his shoe empire was born between the grooves of a waffle iron, Bob and Jill's cup empire was sketched on the back of a Fresh Fish Co. paper placemat.Speed Stacks LLC was incorporated in December 1998. My parents quit their full-time public school jobs in June 2000. This was to be an official test of a core tenet of the American Dream: With enough passion and even more prodigious work ethic, you can turn a ludicrous idea into a successful business. To get started, they just needed four things.First: a mold to mass produce the cups. It required $20,000 and overcoming the absolute befuddlement of executives at a Denver plastics manufacturer who did not understand the  to include three small holes at the base. As each cup came off the line, our family would inspect the shape; minor defects in its roundness caused sticking. Nearly every cup in the first run had to be tossed out for deformities.Second: a nylon and mesh cup-carrying bag. Those were sewn in the back basement of a Vietnamese immigrant–owned textile company. We bagged each set of 12 by hand, my parents staying up until 2:00 in the morning to fulfill orders after working full school days. Bob wasn't satisfied unless the logo of every cup perfectly faced forward.Third: to hit the road. Speed Stack's first tagline was "See it! Believe it! Teach it!" My parents meant it: They knew that success was linearly related to the number of PE teachers who witnessed the sport in person. Our family of five put almost 100,000 miles on our 1997 maroon Suburban in a little over four years.Fourth: kids who could stack the cups. . For some reason, all three of the Fox progeny developed both the interest and intrinsic skill to do just that.At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door. Legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer’s voice was always our music cue. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event!"It would blast over portable speakers on either side of a gym floor. Emmy, my older sister, would lead us out from a hidden corner, followed by my brother, Brennan, then me: a 7-year-old with Coke-bottle glasses, immensely satisfied by the fact that hundreds of eyes were watching my every move.We stopped when we reached separate tables spread evenly across our makeshift stage, usually under the basketball hoop. We stood still to let the tempo build. "Let’s get ready to rumble!"The synths would drop, and we would commence stacking plastic cups. Faster and with more skill than the students and teachers in Amarillo or Ft. Lauderdale or Butzbach, Germany, or Copenhagen, Denmark, could ever think possible. Our family performed hundreds of school assemblies in almost every corner of the country (and some overseas). The 30-minute spectacle was choreographed specifically to blow the minds of kids between the ages of 7 and 14 as quickly as possible. This wasn't a talk from your fire chief about safety, or puppets teaching you the value of sharing. We humiliated principals and popular teachers by making them race us. There was a fabricated jacket with holes cut in the back that we fitted onto a volunteer, then stuck our arms through the sleeves to make it appear like they were magically adept (performed to the  soundtrack). The finale was a choreographed stacking routine, set to "Dueling Banjos" from .But a school-by-school roadshow wasn't a scalable business model. So we went to the nexus of physical education sweatsuitdom: state and national teacher conventions. At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door. It's most likely that you learned how to sport stack because your teacher, with a lanyard badge bouncing over her multi-colored windbreaker on her way to get a free muffin from the guys who sell tug-o-war ropes, stopped in her tracks in the back corner of Exhibit Hall B at an exurban Renaissance hotel. She would watch as our hands manipulated dishware so fast it blurred.If my dad was adept at putting on a good show, my mom was equally adept at corralling the press. Her journalism and PR–honed chops put sport stacking in front of millions, from the D-block of local newscasts to 30 Rock Plaza during the . That's how I found myself chatting with a shirtless Simon Cowell in the makeup room before we both appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's show, taught Tiki Barber the basics of the 3-3-3, and tried to convince a baffled Michael Caine in the green room of LIVE with Regis and Kelly that yes, indeed, kids really do stack plastic cups for fun.All press, to my parents, was good. My dad was absolutely thrilled when Glenn Beck spent four minutes of his daily Fox News monologue staring directly into the camera, railing against the dangers of stacking cups."We can't fix our country by keeping our children weak," Beck sputtered, roughly two minutes in. "They need to have spines. They need to get hit in the face a few times with a ball, you know what I mean? They have to learn how to live with and thrive on past failures."Brands soon took advantage of sport stacking's essential power: No matter the context, it attracts near-instant attention. In 2005, I appeared in a nationwide Comcast commercial for high speed internet. FritoLay shut down part of Times Square to feature our stacking talents as it launched Stax, a competitor to Pringles. A beverage company in England flew a dozen of us to London to help launch an abomination of a drink called Freekee Soda. Main ingredient? Carbonated milk. (Did I pretend to enjoy drinking that carbonated milk so as to not piss off any of the execs helping to pay for my college education? Obviously. But it is a cursed flavor.)Perhaps the only media my parents turned down was an appearance on the infamous reality show . The producers, naturally, presumed the scions of a ludicrous gym activity would have some weird baggage to mine for the masses. Unfortunately, despite the cups, we were pretty normal.To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos.It was the Germans who made everything more serious.They arrived at the 2004 World Sport Stacking Championships in matching flag-inspired sweatsuits. Multiple coaches would analyze everything from hand-tag efficiency during the four-person relay event to the mental routines of stackers before their individual competition.Sport stacking, I believe, grew into a minor phenomenon for three reasons: 1) It's visually arresting, 2) it's easy to learn, and 3) competing against the clock is incredibly addicting.Media buzz and schoolteachers kindled the first two. But my dad's magnum opus—the reason the sport didn't wither in the way of skip ball and snake boards—was that he (with the help of the 20 employees at the burgeoning HQ) built the infrastructure and equipment to spur global competition. The sport's growth coincided with two of my dad's innovations: the StackMat, a patented self-timing device that allowed kids to practice on their own for hours, aiming to trim hundredths of a second off their best times; and the World Sport Stacking Association, a governing body to codify the rules and serve as the keeper of world, national, and local records.In 1997, 250 kids were hand-timed with stop watches at the first Colorado State Championship. By 2007, ESPN aired an hourlong David Lloyd–hosted special of the World Championships, featuring more than 1,000 competitors from seven countries (re-aired in 2020 during their pandemic "The Ocho" promotion). Like everything in his life, my dad choreographed a spectacle. He ordered a three-story banner to hang behind garbage can–sized cups that served as center stage. The competition floor was arranged with dozens of tables, all marked with laser-lined tape to demarcate relay boundaries.During the final "Stack of Champions," the top competitors (and relay teams) from each event competed under the scrutiny of spotlights, three officials, an instant replay camera, and hundreds of spectators. In individual events, you're allotted two warmups and three tries. Relays are conducted head-to-head in teams of four.For a few years, I was among those finalists. To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos. Push too hard and the cups tumble. Pull back and you'll lose by thousandths of a second.A relay race in the Stack of Champions, in which I (the third stacker on the left team) stumble at the start, allowing my brother (the last stacker on the right team) to beat us by two-hundredths of a second.For those moments, you exist at the outer physical boundary of human biology. When performing at your peak, the cups feel less like they're being stacked and more like they're being sprayed. In 2001, the world record for sport stacking's marquee event, the Cycle, was 7.43 seconds. It was held by my sister. At the time, most people assumed a sub-seven-second time was physically impossible. The pattern requires more than 40 separate moves. At those speeds, hands make micro-adjustments faster than the brain can register. Her time stood for nearly four years.In 2025, the world record for the cycle is 4.739 seconds. Please understand: I know this whole endeavor is silly, that it's worthy of your slight mockery and general patina of confusion. But also understand that my dad created a culture in which German coaches passed strategic tips to Australian competitors. Where Japanese teenagers became pen pals with suburban Texans. Where nerves collapsed faster than the cups. Where kids and adults shrieked with joy over millisecond improvements. Where tension and drama and friendship mingled with the clattering cacophony of sliding and tapping plastic (there really is no sound like the one at these competitions). Sport stacking had broad exposure in both mainstream and weird places. But it had a deep impact in a much smaller community. It changed lives.You've probably heard Rachael’s voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites," by Skrillex.Milo Ferguson discovered sport stacking in first-grade PE class. "My teacher was the final boss of butch lesbians. That's the only way I know how to describe her," Ferguson, now a 23-year-old co-founder of an independent animation studio, said. Their teacher loved competition and was beloved by her students, exactly the archetype to stop at a conference booth and believe in a quirky new cup-centric educational trend.Rachael Nedrow, now a 29-year-old product manager at Amazon, first saw the sport while scrolling YouTube when she was 11. She pulled paper cups from the kitchen drawer to try and mimic the movement.Both became obsessed, quickly. Though for different reasons."I was never the fastest kid. I was always kind of chubby. I was much more the creative person than an athletic one," Ferguson said. "Sport stacking was about hand-eye coordination more than strength. It was intricate. Delicate." For the first time, they were excited to attend PE class.Nedrow, an accomplished tennis player, was intrigued by the self-improvement and rigid strictures of the clock. She bought an official set of Speed Stacks and started logging her progress on her own YouTube channel."My first competition was at a local church," Nedrow said. "I did terribly, but I still won."Despite differing motivations, Ferguson and Nedrow's paths to competitive sport stacking mirror each other. Friends weren't interested, so they went looking for a community online and at competitions. For the thousand kids that congregated on the arena floor at each World Championships, like Ferguson and Nedrow, the sentiment was common. They had found  people. They fit in, sometimes for the first time in their life. There were future college athletes and kids with autism. There were rugby fans from New Zealand (riffing off their national team, they called themselves the "All Stacks") and South Koreans who had never been to the United States. Roll your eyes, but my dad loved to say that the sport only helped build "positive pyramids." Spend a few hours watching kids pat each other on the back after a fumbled cup, or earn a hug for achieving a new personal best, and you'd buy into the platitude too.Compared to other top-level stackers, Nedrow and Ferguson's experiences only differ in one way. You've probably heard Rachael's voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites," by Skrillex. Between Spotify and YouTube, it has more than 500 million streams.And you probably know Ferguson's dad, Craig, the comedian and host of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson from 2005 to 2014.Nedrow's collision with virality gave her backstage passes to several Skrillex concerts and the greatest fodder for "Two Truths and a Lie" of all time. But sport stacking also gave her something else she wasn’t expecting: a wide group of online friends."I don't think I would have taken stacking so far if it wasn't for the online community," Nedrow said. "When you are doing anything kind of competitive, it seems like it's much better when you are doing it with people. I really loved the aspect of kids commenting on my videos, saying they started stacking because of me. What greater pleasure can you get than inspiring other people to do what you love the most?"Sport stacking gave Ferguson inclusion and validation. But perhaps more important than what it gave them is what it gave their parents. While Craig and his ex-wife Sascha had been separated for a few years by the time their kid started competing, both fully committed to supporting this weird, wholesome obsession. Sascha helped Milo learn how to breathe and center themselves before starting to stack. And she supplied an ever-growing collection of stacking equipment, stored in a dedicated room in their Southern California home.To see what sport stacking gave Craig, you need to watch his show from April 20, 2009. He spends four minutes—more than half of the entire monologue—bragging about Milo. Beneath the scripted jokes and of-the-era references (Octomom is mentioned twice), you see a guy just genuinely proud of his kid. He's like any neighbor, going off a bit too effusively about the weekend's peewee football game or math test. Except this was done for millions. And it was about ... cups. "I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success. It gave them something new and different. And it created a community. It brought kids around the world together."Sport stacking gave different things to a lot of people.For a few, it genuinely improved their life. College funds were paid through YouTube viewership revenue and small brand endorsements. Children with autism and special needs learned, practiced, competed, and socialized with others for the first time. For me and my siblings, it gave us a stable home, trips to a dozen countries, and some excellent college essay material. My sister, Emmy, went on to play basketball for four years at the University of Minnesota, was drafted into the WNBA by the Minnesota Lynx, and then played professionally overseas with Sheryl Swoopes. My brother Brennan played D-III college football and turned into a mechanical engineer at a global cosmetics company. I turned into a fairly unathletic writer.For my parents, it gave them an early retirement. A sometimes-operational 1957 VW Bug and an obsession with growing ever-larger pumpkins occupied my dad, while training to run another marathon at age 70 became a focus for my mom. They left their active roles at Speed Stacks in 2015, leaving control to some of its earliest employees. Programs are still active in thousands of schools around the world."I was motivated to spread sport stacking for the same reason I taught my students how to juggle or unicycle," my dad recalled, nearly 10 years into retirement. "I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success. It gave them something new and different. And it created a community. It brought kids around the world together. And believe it or not, that all happened because of a couple million plastic cups."For some of you reading this, sport stacking gave you an identical memory. A cross-legged seat on a linoleum gym floor. The hush from the principal. The music crescendoing into ' most iconic synth riff. The sound of cups, stacking at lightning speed. You knew, in that moment, that you weren't in for another monotonous few hours at school. Your day was about to rock. For that, you can thank my dad.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Final Fantasy iOS Game Shuts Down Over Unfixable Bug</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/223226/final-fantasy-ios-game-shuts-down-over-unfixable-bug?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Verge's Jay Peters reports: Square Enix has shut down the iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and removed it from the App Store following an unfixable bug that blocked people from accessing content they had paid for.

We raised money to do that, and to place some bets; one of them: GPU-enabling our customers. A progress report: GPUs aren’t going anywhere, but: GPUs aren’t going anywhere.A Fly Machine is a Docker/OCI container running inside a hardware-virtualized virtual machine somewhere on our global fleet of bare-metal worker servers. A GPU Machine is a Fly Machine with a hardware-mapped Nvidia GPU. It’s a Fly Machine that can do fast CUDA.Like everybody else in our industry, we were right about the importance of AI/ML. If anything, we underestimated its importance. But the product we came up with probably doesn’t fit the moment. It’s a bet that doesn’t feel like it’s paying off.If you’re using Fly GPU Machines, don’t freak out; we’re not getting rid of them. But if you’re waiting for us to do something bigger with them, a v2 of the product, you’ll probably be waiting awhile.GPU Machines were not a small project for us. Fly Machines run on an idiosyncratically small hypervisor (normally Firecracker, but for GPU Machines Intel’s Cloud Hypervisor, a very similar Rust codebase that supports PCI passthrough). The Nvidia ecosystem is not geared to supporting micro-VM hypervisors.GPUs terrified our security team. A GPU is just about the worst case hardware peripheral: intense multi-directional direct memory transfers(not even bidirectional: in common configurations, GPUs talk to each other)with arbitrary, end-user controlled computation, all operating outside our normal security boundary.We did a couple expensive things to mitigate the risk. We shipped GPUs on dedicated server hardware, so that GPU- and non-GPU workloads weren’t mixed. Because of that, the only reason for a Fly Machine to be scheduled on a GPU machine was that it needed a PCI BDF for an Nvidia GPU, and there’s a limited number of those available on any box. Those GPU servers were drastically less utilized and thus less cost-effective than our ordinary servers.We funded two very large security assessments, from Atredis and Tetrel, to evaluate our GPU deployment. Matt Braun is writing up those assessments now. They were not cheap, and they took time.Security wasn’t directly the biggest cost we had to deal with, but it was an indirect cause for a subtle reason.We could have shipped GPUs very quickly by doing what Nvidia recommended: standing up a standard K8s cluster to schedule GPU jobs on. Had we taken that path, and let our GPU users share a single Linux kernel, we’d have been on Nvidia’s driver happy-path.Alternatively, we could have used a conventional hypervisor. Nvidia suggested VMware (heh). But they could have gotten things working had we used QEMU. We like QEMU fine, and could have talked ourselves into a security story for it, but the whole point of Fly Machines is that they take milliseconds to start. We could not have offered our desired Developer Experience on the Nvidia happy-path.Instead, we burned months trying (and ultimately failing) to get Nvidia’s host drivers working to map virtualized GPUs into Intel Cloud Hypervisor. At one point, we hex-edited the closed-source drivers to trick them into thinking our hypervisor was QEMU.I’m not sure any of this really mattered in the end. There’s a segment of the market we weren’t ever really able to explore because Nvidia’s driver support kept us from thin-slicing GPUs. We’d have been able to put together a really cheap offering for developers if we hadn’t run up against that, and developers love “cheap”, but I can’t prove that those customers are real.On the other hand, we’re committed to delivering the Fly Machine DX for GPU workloads. Beyond the PCI/IOMMU drama, just getting an entire hardware GPU working in a Fly Machine was a lift. We needed Fly Machines that would come up with the right Nvidia drivers; our stack was built assuming that the customer’s OCI container almost entirely defined the root filesystem for a Machine. We had to engineer around that in our  orchestrator. And almost everything people want to do with GPUs involves efficiently grabbing huge files full of model weights. Also annoying!And, of course, we bought GPUs. A lot of GPUs. Expensive GPUs.The biggest problem: developers don’t want GPUs. They don’t even want AI/ML models. They want LLMs.  may have smart, fussy opinions on how to get their models loaded with CUDA, and what the best GPU is. But  don’t care about any of that. When a software developer shipping an app comes looking for a way for their app to deliver prompts to an LLM, you can’t just give them a GPU.For those developers, who probably make up most of the market, it doesn’t seem plausible for an insurgent public cloud to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. Their APIs are fast enough, and developers thinking about performance in terms of “tokens per second” aren’t counting milliseconds.(you should all feel sympathy for us)This makes us sad because we really like the point in the solution space we found. Developers shipping apps on Amazon will outsource to other public clouds to get cost-effective access to GPUs. But then they’ll faceplant trying to handle data and model weights, backhauling gigabytes (at significant expense) from S3. We have app servers, GPUs, and object storage all under the same top-of-rack switch. But inference latency just doesn’t seem to matter yet, so the market doesn’t care.Past that, and just considering the system engineers who do care about GPUs rather than LLMs: the hardware product/market fit here is really rough.People doing serious AI work want galactically huge amounts of GPU compute. A whole enterprise A100 is a compromise position for them; they want an SXM cluster of H100s.Near as we can tell, MIG gives you a UUID to talk to the host driver, not a PCI device.We think there’s probably a market for users doing lightweight ML work getting tiny GPUs. This is what Nvidia MIG does, slicing a big GPU into arbitrarily small virtual GPUs. But for fully-virtualized workloads, it’s not baked; we can’t use it. And I’m not sure how many of those customers there are, or whether we’d get the density of customers per server that we need.That leaves the L40S customers. There are a bunch of these! We dropped L40S prices last year, not because we were sour on GPUs but because they’re the one part we have in our inventory people seem to get a lot of use out of. We’re happy with them. But they’re just another kind of compute that some apps need; they’re not a driver of our core business. They’re not the GPU bet paying off.Really, all of this is just a long way of saying that for most software developers, “AI-enabling” their app is best done with API calls to things like Claude and GPT, Replicate and RunPod.A very useful way to look at a startup is that it’s a race to learn stuff. So, what’s our report card?First off, when we embarked down this path in 2022, we were (like many other companies) operating in a sort of phlogiston era of AI/ML. The industry attention to AI had not yet collapsed around a small number of foundational LLM models. We expected there to be a diversity of  models, the world Elixir Bumblebee looks forward to, where people pull different AI workloads off the shelf the same way they do Ruby gems.But Cursor happened, and, as they say, how are you going to keep ‘em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus? It seems much clearer where things are heading.GPUs were a test of a Fly.io company credo: as we think about core features, we design for 10,000 developers, not for 5-6. It took a minute, but the credo wins here: GPU workloads for the 10,001st developer are a niche thing.Another way to look at a startup is as a series of bets. We put a lot of chips down here. But the buy-in for this tournament gave us a lot of chips to play with. Never making a big bet of any sort isn’t a winning strategy. I’d rather we’d flopped the nut straight, but I think going in on this hand was the right call.A really important thing to keep in mind here, and something I think a lot of startup thinkers sleep on, is the extent to which this bet involved acquiring assets. Obviously, some of our costs here aren’t recoverable. But the hardware parts that aren’t generating revenue will ultimately get liquidated; like with our portfolio of IPv4 addresses, I’m even more comfortable making bets backed by tradable assets with durable value.In the end, I don’t think GPU Fly Machines were going to be a hit for us no matter what we did. Because of that, one thing I’m very happy about is that we didn’t compromise the rest of the product for them. Security concerns slowed us down to where we probably learned what we needed to learn a couple months later than we could have otherwise, but we’re scaling back our GPU ambitions without having sacrificed any of our isolation story, and, ironically, GPUs  are making that story a lot more important. The same thing goes for our Fly Machine developer experience.We started this company building a Javascript runtime for edge computing. We learned that our customers didn’t want a new Javascript runtime; they just wanted their native code to work. We shipped containers, and no convincing was needed. We were wrong about Javascript edge functions, and I think we were wrong about GPUs. That’s usually how we figure out the right answers:  by being wrong about a lot of stuff.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Django Weblog: DjangoCongress JP 2025 Announcement and Live Streaming!</title><link>https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/feb/14/djangocongress-jp-2025-announcement-and-livestream/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:12:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It will be streamed on the following YouTube Live channels:This year there will be talks not only about Django, but also about FastAPI and other asynchronous web topics.

The document reveals a notable shift in OpenAI's content policies, particularly around "sensitive" content like erotica and gore -- allowing this type of content to be generated without warnings in "appropriate contexts." The change in policy has been in the works since May 2024, when the original Model Spec document first mentioned that OpenAI was exploring "whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT."
 
ChatGPT's guidelines now state that that "erotica or gore" may now be generated, but only under specific circumstances. "The assistant should not generate erotica, depictions of illegal or non-consensual sexual activities, or extreme gore, except in scientific, historical, news, creative or other contexts where sensitive content is appropriate," OpenAI writes. "This includes depictions in text, audio (e.g., erotic or violent visceral noises), or visual content." So far, experimentation from Reddit users has shown that ChatGPT's content filters have indeed been relaxed, with some managing to generate explicit sexual or violent scenarios without accompanying content warnings. OpenAI notes that its Usage Policies still apply, which prohibit building AI tools for minors that include sexual content.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eli Bendersky: Decorator JITs - Python as a DSL</title><link>https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/decorator-jits-python-as-a-dsl/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:49:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Spend enough time looking at Python programs and packages for machine learning,
and you'll notice that the "JIT decorator" pattern is pretty popular. For
example, this JAX snippet:In both cases, the function decorated with  doesn't get executed by the
Python interpreter in the normal sense. Instead, the code inside is more like
a DSL (Domain Specific Language) processed by a special purpose compiler built
into the library (JAX or Triton). Another way to think about it is that Python
is used as a  to describe computations.In this post I will describe some implementation strategies used by libraries to
make this possible.Preface - where we're goingThe goal is to explain how different kinds of  decorators work by using
a simplified, educational example that implements several approaches from
scratch. All the approaches featured in this post will be using this flow: Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" /> Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" class="align-center" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/decjit-python.png" />
These are the steps that happen when a Python function wrapped with
our educational  decorator is called:The function is translated to an "expression IR" - .This expression IR is converted to LLVM IR.Finally, the LLVM IR is JIT-executed.First, let's look at the  IR. Here we'll make a big simplification -
only supporting functions that define a single expression, e.g.:Naturally, this can be easily generalized - after all, LLVM IR can be used to
express fully general computations.Here are the  data structures:To convert an  into LLVM IR and JIT-execute it, we'll use this function:It uses the  class to actually generate LLVM IR from .
This process is straightforward and covered extensively in the resources I
linked to earlier; take a look at the full code here.My goal with this architecture is to make things simple, but .
On one hand - there are several simplifications: only single expressions are
supported, very limited set of operators, etc. It's very easy to extend this!
On the other hand, we could have just trivially evaluated the 
without resorting to LLVM IR; I do want to show a more complete compilation
pipeline, though, to demonstrate that an arbitrary amount of complexity can
be hidden behind these simple interfaces.With these building blocks in hand, we can review the strategies used by
 decorators to convert Python functions into s.Python comes with powerful code reflection and introspection capabilities out
of the box. Here's the  decorator:This is a standard Python decorator. It takes a function and returns another
function that will be used in its place ( ensures that
function attributes like the name and docstring of the wrapper match the
wrapped function).After  is applied to , what  holds is the
wrapper. When  is called, the wrapper is invoked with
.The wrapper obtains the AST of the wrapped function, and then uses
 to convert this AST into an :When  finishes visiting the AST it's given, its
 field will contain the  representing the function's
return value. The wrapper then invokes  with this .Note how our decorator interjects into the regular Python execution process.
When  is called, instead of the standard Python compilation and
execution process (code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed
by the VM), we translate its code to our own representation and emit LLVM from
it, and then JIT execute the LLVM IR. While it seems kinda pointless in this
artificial example, in reality this means we can execute the function's code
in any way we like.AST JIT case study: TritonThis approach is almost exactly how the Triton language works. The body of a
function decorated with  gets parsed to a Python AST, which then
- through a series of internal IRs - ends up in LLVM IR; this in turn is lowered
to PTX by the
NVPTX LLVM backend.
Then, the code runs on a GPU using a standard CUDA pipeline.Naturally, the subset of Python that can be compiled down to a GPU is limited;
but it's sufficient to run performant kernels, in a language that's much
friendlier than CUDA and - more importantly - lives in the same file with the
"host" part written in regular Python. For example, if you want testing and
debugging, you can run Triton in "interpreter mode" which will just run the
same kernels locally on a CPU.Note that Triton lets us import names from the  package
and use them inside kernels; these serve as the  for the language
- special calls the compiler handles directly.Python is a fairly complicated language with  of features. Therefore,
if our JIT has to support some large portion of Python semantics, it may make
sense to leverage more of Python's own compiler. Concretely, we can have it
compile the wrapped function all the way to bytecode,
and start our translation from there.Here's the  decorator that does just this :The Python VM is a stack machine; so we emulate a stack to convert the
function's bytecode to  IR (a bit like an RPN evaluator).
As before, we then use our  utility function to lower
 to LLVM IR and JIT execute it.Using this JIT is as simple as the previous one - just swap 
for :Bytecode JIT case study: NumbaNumba is a compiler for Python itself. The idea
is that you can speed up specific functions in your code by slapping a
 decorator on them. What happens next is similar in spirit to
our simple , but of course much more complicated because it
supports a very large portion of Python semantics.Numba uses the Python compiler to emit bytecode, just as we did; it then
converts it into its own IR, and then to LLVM using .By starting with the bytecode, Numba makes its life easier (no need to rewrite
the entire Python compiler). On the other hand, it also makes some analyses
, because by the time we're in bytecode, a lot of semantic information
existing in higher-level representations is lost. For example, Numba has to
sweat a bit to recover control flow information from the bytecode (by
running it through a special interpreter first).The two approaches we've seen so far are similar in many ways - both rely on
Python's introspection capabilities to compile the source code of the JIT-ed
function to some extent (one to AST, the other all the way to bytecode), and
then work on this lowered representation.The tracing strategy is very different. It doesn't analyze the source code of
the wrapped function at all - instead, it  its execution by means of
specially-boxed arguments, leveraging overloaded operators and functions, and
then works on the generated trace.The code implementing this for our smile demo is surprisingly compact:Each runtime argument of the wrapped function is assigned a , and
that is placed in a , a placeholder class which lets us
do operator overloading:The remaining key function is :To understand how this works, consider this trivial example:After the decorated function is defined,  holds the wrapper function
defined inside . When  is called, the wrapper runs:For each argument of  itself (that is  and ), it creates
a new  holding a . This denotes a named variable in
the  IR.It then calls the wrapped function, passing it the boxes as runtime
parameters.When (the wrapped)  runs, it invokes . This is caught by the overloaded
 operator of , and it creates a new  with
the s representing  and  as children. This
 is then returned .The wrapper unboxes the returned  and passes it to
 to emit LLVM IR from it and JIT execute it with the
actual runtime arguments of the call: .This might be a little mind-bending at first, because there are two different
executions that happen:The first is calling the wrapped  function itself, letting the Python
interpreter run it as usual, but with special arguments that build up the IR
instead of doing any computations. This is the .The second is lowering this IR our tracing step built into LLVM IR and then
JIT executing it with the actual runtime argument values ; this is
the .This tracing approach has some interesting characteristics. Since we don't
have to analyze the source of the wrapped functions but only trace through
the execution, we can "magically" support a much richer set of programs, e.g.:This  with our basic . Since Python variables are
placeholders (references) for values, our tracing step is oblivious to them - it
follows the flow of values. Another example:This also just works! The created  will be a long chain of 
additions of 's runtime values through the loop, added to the 
for .This last example also leads us to a limitation of the tracing approach; the
loop cannot be  - it cannot depend on the function's arguments,
because the tracing step has no concept of runtime values and wouldn't know
how many iterations to run through; or at least, it doesn't know this unless
we want to perform the tracing run for every runtime execution .Tracing JIT case study: JAXThe JAX ML framework uses a tracing
approach very similar to the one described here. The first code sample in this
post shows the JAX notation. JAX cleverly wraps Numpy with its own version which
is traced (similar to our , but JAX calls these boxes "tracers"),
letting you write regular-feeling Numpy code that can be JIT optimized and
executed on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs via XLA. JAX's tracer builds up an underlying IR (called
jaxpr) which can then be
emitted to XLA ops and passed to XLA for further lowering and execution.For a fairly deep overview of how JAX works, I recommend reading the
autodidax doc.As mentioned earlier, JAX has some limitations
with things like data-dependent control flow in native Python. This won't work,
because there's control flow
that depends on a runtime value ():When  is executed, JAX will throw an exception, saying something
like:
This concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the
value of the argument count.As a remedy, JAX has its
own built-in intrinsics from the jax.lax package.
Here's the example rewritten in a way that actually works: (and many other built-ins in the  package) is something JAX
can trace through, generating a corresponding XLA operation (XLA has support for
While loops, to which this
 can be lowered).The tracing approach has clear benefits for JAX as well; because it only cares
about the flow of values, it can handle arbitrarily complicated Python code,
as long as the flow of values can be traced. Just like the local variables and
data-independent loops shown earlier, but also things like closures. This makes
meta-programming and templating easy .The full code for this post is available on GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s DOJ Corruption Laid Bare… By His Own Conservative Prosecutors</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/trumps-doj-corruption-laid-bare-by-his-own-conservative-prosecutors/</link><author>Mike Masnick</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:49:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ make sure you read the update at the end of this story.Here’s a fun thing about corruption investigations: Usually when prosecutors uncover one quid pro quo, they don’t resolve it by offering an even bigger quid pro quo. And yet, that appears to be exactly what’s happening with NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted last fall for allegedly trading favors with Turkish officials, and is now watching those charges evaporate in exchange for helping the Trump administration with its immigration agenda.The twist — and there’s always a twist — is that the people most effectively pointing out this corruption aren’t the usual suspects. Instead, it’s coming from a bunch of dyed-in-the-wool conservative prosecutors at SDNY who are resigning en masse rather than participate in what they see as a perversion of justice. When the Federalist Society crowd starts quitting over corruption, you know something interesting is happening.The apparent corruption here isn’t just brazen — it’s documented in black and white. The Justice Department’s order to drop the case doesn’t even pretend to assess the merits of the charges. Instead, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove explicitly tied the dismissal to Adams’ willingness to assist with federal deportation efforts — a textbook example of weaponizing prosecutorial discretion for political ends.Even more disturbing is the mechanism: the dismissal is “without prejudice,” meaning charges could be refiled at any time. This isn’t just prosecutorial discretion — it’s prosecutorial extortion. The Trump administration has effectively created a sword of Damocles to hang over Adams’ head, ensuring his continued compliance with their immigration agenda. The message is clear: step out of line, and those charges might suddenly become relevant again. It’s the kind of institutional corruption that would make a banana republic blush.It means that Adams’ personal freedom now outweighs the best interests of the people of New York City.The system’s response to this corruption has been revealing. For several days after the initial order, an unusual silence descended over the Southern District office — a silence that spoke volumes about the internal struggle taking place. Then came something remarkable: a scathing letter from Acting US Attorney Danielle Sassoon to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Sassoon — a Federalist Society stalwart and former Scalia clerk who’s about as far from a “progressive prosecutor” as you can get — laid bare the rot at the core of this decision in a document that reads like a conservative legal scholar’s manifesto against institutional corruption.Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations. As Justice Robert Jackson explained, “the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.” The Federal Prosecutor, 24 J. Am. Jud. Soc’y 18 (“This authority has been granted by people who really wanted the right thing done—wanted crime eliminated— but also wanted the best in our American traditions preserved. “). I understand my duty as a prosecutor to mean enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or to those who appointed me. A federal prosecutor “is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.” Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935).For the reasons explained above, I do not believe there are reasonable arguments in support of a Rule 48(a) motion to dismiss a case that is well supported by the evidence and the law. I understand that Mr. Bove disagrees, and I am mindful of your recent order reiterating prosecutors’ duty to make good-faith arguments in support of the Executive Branch’s positions. See Feb. 5, 2025 Mem. “General Policy Regarding Zealous Advocacy on Behalf of the United States.” But because I do not see any good-faith basis for the proposed position, I cannot make such arguments consistent with my duty of candor. N.Y.R.P.C.3.3; id. cmt. 2 (“A lawyer acting as an advocate in an adjudicative proceeding has an obligation to present the client’s case with persuasive force. Performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of the client, however, is qualified by the advocate’s duty of candor to the tribunal. ” ).In particular, the rationale given by Mr. Bove—an exchange between a criminal defendant and the Department of Justice akin to the Bout exchange with Russia— is, as explained above, a bargain that a prosecutor should not make. Moreover, dismissing without prejudice and with the express option of again indicting Adams in the future creates obvious ethical problems, by implicitly threatening future prosecution if Adams’s cooperation with enforcing the immigration laws proves unsatisfactory to the Department. See In re Christoff, 690 N.E.2d 1135 (Ind. 1997) (disciplining prosecutor for threatening to renew a dormant criminal investigation against a potential candidate for public office in order to dissuade the candidate from running); Bruce A. Green & Rebecca Roiphe, Who Should Police Politicization of the DOJ?, 35 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol’y 671, 681 (2021) (noting that the Arizona Supreme Court disbarred the elected chief prosecutor of Maricopa County, Arizona, and his deputy, in part, for misusing their power to advance the chief prosecutor’s partisan political interests) . Finally, given the highly generalized accusations of weaponization, weighed against the strength of the evidence against Adams, a court will likely question whether that basis is pretextual. See, e.g. , United States v. Greater Blouse, Skirt & Neckwear Contractors, 228 F. Supp. 483, 487 (S.D.N.Y. 1964)(courts “ should be satisfied that the reasons advanced for the proposed dismissal are substantial and the real grounds upon which the application is based”)I remain baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams’s counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal. Mr. Bove admonished me to be mindful of my obligation to zealously defend the interests of the United States and to advance good-faith arguments on behalf of the Administration. I hope you share my view that soliciting and considering the concerns of the U.S. Attorney overseeing the case serves rather than hinders that goal, and that we can find time to meet.But wait, it gets better! There’s a footnote in Sassoon’s letter that tells you everything you need to know about how modern corruption works. The old-school way was to have your shady meetings in smoke-filled back rooms. The new way, apparently, is to have them in official conference rooms while actively preventing anyone from taking notes:I attended a meeting on January 31, 2025, with Mr. Bove, Adams’s counsel, and members of my office. Adams’s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed. Mr. Bove admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting’s conclusionNothing quite says you know you’re engaging in some shady ass shit like demanding you collect the notes of anyone in attendance.What makes this story particularly significant is who’s blowing the whistle. Sassoon isn’t some “woke prosecutor” that the MAGA world can easily dismiss. She’s a card-carrying member of the conservative legal establishment who, until this week, was seen as a rising star in those circles. Her willingness to sacrifice her standing in that world to uphold basic constitutional principles reveals just how far the corruption has spread — and perhaps offers a glimmer of hope that some institutional guardrails still hold.Sassoon’s stand has triggered a cascade of resignations within SDNY, with seven prosecutors (and counting) choosing to walk away rather than participate in this corruption of justice. The latest resignation letter, a scorching indictment from lead prosecutor Hagan Scotten, is particularly noteworthy. Scotten — who clerked for both Justices Roberts and Kavanaugh and explicitly states his support for the Trump administration — makes it clear that this isn’t about politics; it’s about fundamental principles of justice being trampled for political gain.There is a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake. Some will view the mistake you are committing here in the light of their generally negative views of the new Administration. I do not share those views. I can even understand how a Chief Executive whose background is in business and politics might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal. But any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.Scotten’s prediction proved grimly prophetic. As reported just hours ago, Bove and Bondi found their willing executioner — though the circumstances reveal yet another layer of institutional corruption:The prosecutor acquiesced to file the motion in an attempt to spare other career staff from potentially being fired by Emil Bove, the acting US deputy attorney general and former personal lawyer to Trump, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. The news agency named the lawyer as Ed Sullivan, a veteran career prosecutor, who agreed to alleviate pressure on his colleagues in the department’s public integrity section of 30 attorneys, two sources said, after his team was given an hour by Bove to decide between them who would file the motion.“This is not a capitulation – this is a coercion,” one of the people briefed on the meeting later told Reuters. “That person, in my mind, is a hero.” The whole section had reportedly discussed resigning en masse.The cruel irony of forcing the Public Integrity Section to compromise its own integrity isn’t lost on anyone. This is how institutions die — not with a bang, but with an ultimatum.There’s a special kind of institutional poetry here: The Public Integrity Section was given an hour to decide who would compromise their integrity. And someone did, not out of cowardice or foolishness, but to protect their colleagues. “A hero,” his colleague called him, and maybe that’s right. But it’s the kind of heroism that only exists in broken systems.The NY Times has revealed even more disturbing details about the behind-the-scenes machinations. In what reads like a playbook for corrupting justice, Bove apparently coached Adams’ legal team (including Alex Spiro, better known as Elon Musk’s go-to counsel) in a wink-wink-nudge-nudge fashion on exactly what political commitments would make the charges disappear.During the meeting, Mr. Bove signaled that the decision about whether to dismiss the case had nothing to do with its legal merits.Instead, Mr. Bove said he was interested in whether the case was hindering Mr. Adams’s leadership, particularly with regard to the city’s ability to cooperate with the federal government on Mr. Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.Mr. Bove also said he was interested in whether the case, brought by the former U.S. attorney, Damian Williams, was a politically motivated prosecution meant to hurt Mr. Adams’s re-election prospects.In her letter to Ms. Bondi, Ms. Sassoon said that she was “baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams’s counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal.”There’s something almost elegant about it, in a horrifying sort of way. The Justice Department has managed to transform a corruption prosecution into what amounts to a compliance manual for corruption. It’s like they’ve created a template: “Here’s how to trade criminal charges for political favors while maintaining plausible deniability.” And the really wild part? This is all happening after years of the MAGA world screaming about supposed “lawfare” against conservatives. Turns out they weren’t complaining about weaponized justice — they were planning how to do it themselves.History rhymes: While mass resignations of principled lawyers helped topple Nixon’s presidency, in Trump’s second term they’ve become just another item in the daily digest of institutional erosion. The difference this time? It’s not the usual suspects sounding the alarm. Instead, it’s career conservatives — products of the Federalist Society pipeline — who are putting their careers on the line to preserve what’s left of prosecutorial independence.As we’ve previously discussed, any path through this constitutional crisis requires principled conservatives to find their voice. The fact that it’s taking career prosecutors to do what elected Republicans won’t speaks volumes about where the real courage in conservative circles resides.The question now isn’t just whether our institutions can survive this assault, but whether these acts of principled resistance can inspire others before the machinery of justice is fully converted into a tool of political control. The American experiment has survived previous challenges through the courage of individuals willing to place principle above party. We’re about to find out if enough of those individuals still exist. Incredibly, that report that a prosecutor had agreed to file the dismissal turned out to not be accurate. Many hours later, after no such filing was actually made a few very bizarre things happened. First, Emil Bove filed a notice of appearance in the case. That is… not normal.Finally, the “nolle prosequi” (a notice saying “we no longer want to prosecute”) was filed. But even the way it was filed is weird and somewhat unprecedented. Two lawyers, including Ed Sullivan (who was mentioned above as effectively agreeing to be the fool to protect his coworkers) signed , but they did not sign the final statement. Instead, there was a further “order” from the DOJ, signed by Bove alone, telling the Court to effectively dismiss the case: Even the language here is bizarre. The prosecutors don’t get to “direct” the Court to do anything. That’s likely why Bacon and Sullivan signed the part about “respectfully requests” that the Court issue an order. But Bove leaps in, acting like he gets to order around the judge, and separately signs that part.What will be interesting now, is to see what Judge Dale Ho does.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The hardest working font in Manhattan</title><link>https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/</link><author>robinhouston</author><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:45:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed a brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love. I admired American Typewriter in all of the I <3 NYC logos, watched Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica fighting over the subway signs, and even caught an occasional appearance of the flawlessly-named Gotham, still a year before it skyrocketed in popularity via Barack Obama’s first campaign. 
	
		But there was one font I didn’t even notice, even though it was everywhere around me.
			
		Last year in New York, I walked over 100 miles and took thousands of photos of one and one font only.
			
		The font’s name is Gorton.
			
		It’s hard to believe today that there was a time before I knew of Gorton and all its quirks and mysteries. The first time I realized the font even existed was some time in 2017, when I was researching for my book about the history of typing. 
			
		Many keyboards, especially older ones, sported a particular distinctive font on their keycaps. It was unusually square in proportions, and a weird mélange of “mechanical” and “childish.”
			 
		The more I looked at it, the more I realized how bizarre and amateurish it was. The G always felt like it was about to roll away on its side. There was a goofy wavy hook sticking out of Q. P and R were often too wide. & and @ symbols would be laughed away in a type crit, and the endings of C felt like grabbing something next to it – a beginning of a ligature that never came.
			
		The strangeness extended to the digits. There was a top-flatted 3 resembling a Cyrillic letter, 7 sloping down in a unique way, a very geometric 4, an unusual – perhaps even naïve – symmetry between 6 and 9, and a conflation of O with 0 that would be a fireable offense elsewhere.
				
		Looking at just a few keyboards, it was also obvious that it wasn’t just one rigid font. There were always variations, sometimes even on one keyboard. 0 came square, dotted, or slashed. The usually very narrow letter I sometimes sported serifs. The R and the 6 moved their middles higher or lower. There also seemed to be a narrower version of the font, deployed when a keycap needed a word and not just a letter. (Lowercase letters existed too, but not very often.) 
			
		My first thought was: What a mess. Is this how “grotesque” fonts got their name?
			
		Then, the second thought: I kind of like it.
	The most distinctive letterforms of Gorton		
		But what font was it? What The Font website posited TT Rounds, Identifont suggested it could be Divulge, my early guess was DIN Rounded or something related to road signage. Whatever it was, a flat R clearly separated it from Helvetica, and the shapes were not as round as even the un-rounded Gotham’s.
			
		A few places for keyboard nerds referred to the font as “Gorton,” but that phrase yielded zero results anywhere I typically looked for fonts I could download and install.
					
		I originally thought this had to do with how keys were made. Only in newer keyboards are the letters printed on top of the keys, or charred from their surface by a laser. In older ones – those from the early 1960s laboratory computers, or the 1980s microcomputers – the way every key was constructed was by first molding the letter from plastic of one color, and then grabbing a different plastic and molding the key around the letter. A Gorton letter was as physical as the key itself. It made the keys virtually indestructible – the legend could not wear off any more than its key – and I imagined required some specialized keyboard-making machinery that came with the “keyboard font” already there.
	
		An example of a “double-shot” key from above and from below
				
		But then, I started seeing Gorton in other places.
						
		Hours of looking at close-ups of keys made me sensitive to the peculiar shapes of some of its letters. No other font had a Q, a 9, or a C that looked like this.
						
		One day, I saw what felt like Gorton it on a ferry traversing the waters Bay Area. A few weeks later, I spotted it on a sign in a national park. Then on an intercom. On a street lighting access cover. In an elevator. At my dentist’s office. In an alley. 
							
		These had one thing in common. All of the letters were carved into the respective base material – metal, plastic, wood. The removed shapes were often filled in with a different color, but sometimes left alone.
						
		At one point someone explained to me Gorton must have been a routing font, meant to be carved out by a milling machine rather than painted on top or impressed with an inked press.
								
		Some searches quickly led me to George Gorton Machine Co., a Wisconsin-based company which produced various engraving machines. The original model 1 led to model 1A and then 3U and then, half a decade later, P1-2. They were all pantograph engravers: They allowed you to install one or more letter templates and then trace their shape by hand. A matching rotating cutter would mimic your movements, and the specially configured arms would enlarge or reduce the output to the size you wanted.
									
		This immediately explained both the metaphorical and literal rough edges of Gorton.
						
		A lot of typography has roots in calligraphy – someone holding a brush in their hand and making natural but delicate movements that result in nuanced curves filled with thoughtful interchanges between thin and thick. Most of the fonts you ever saw follow those rules; even the most “mechanical” fonts have surprising humanistic touches if you inspect them close enough.
				
		But not Gorton. Every stroke of Gorton is exactly the same thickness (typographers would call such fonts “monoline”). Every one of its endings is exactly the same rounded point. The italic is merely an oblique, slanted without any extra consideration, and while the condensed version has some changes compared to the regular width, those changes feel almost perfunctory.
		
		Monoline fonts are not respected highly, because every type designer will tell you: This is not how you design a font. 
			
		It seemed at this point that perhaps P1-2 and its predecessors were a somewhat popular machining product during the 20th century’s middle decades. But casual research through materials preserved by some of George Gorton Machine Company’s fans – including the grandson of the founder – revealed something even more interesting. Gorton the font was a lot older than I expected. 
			
		I found a 1935 catalog showing the very same font. Then one from 1925. And then, there was one all the way from 1902, showing the shapes I was starting to be mildly obsessed with.
				
		To put it in perspective: the font I first assumed was a peer to 1950s Helvetica was already of retirement age the day Helvetica was born. Gorton was older than Gill Sans, Futura, or Johnston’s London Underground font. It was contemporaneous to what today we recognize as the first modern sans serif font, Akzidenz-Grotesk, released but three years before the end of the century.
	
		Imagine how stripped down and exotic Gorton must have felt right next to George Gorton Machine’s then-current logo!
						
		I started researching Gorton more. Unfortunately, as I already suspected, no one ever wrote “I used Gorton to typeset this,” because Gorton was a tenuous name at best. It was the first font, and perhaps originally the  font that came with the engraver, so it suffered a nameless fate, familiar later to many bespoke bitmap fonts adoring the screens of early computers.
						
		The difference from these fonts, however, was that Gorton was meant to travel. And so, since searching for it by name was impossible, for months and years I just kept looking around for the now-familiar shapes.
	
		Gorton wasn’t just on computer keyboards, intercom placards, and sidewalk messages visited by many shoes. Gorton was there on typewriter keyboards, too. And on office signs and airline name tags. On boats, desk placards, rulers, and various home devices from fridges to tape dispensers.
						
		It was also asked to help in situations other fonts rarely did. I spotted Gorton on overengineered buttons that were put to heavy industrial and military use. I saw it carved into surfaces of traffic control devices, elevators and escalators, locomotives and subway trains, submarines and jet fighters. Gorton made its way to peace- and wartime nuclear facilities, it was there on the elevator at the Kennedy Space Center with labels marked EARTH and SPACE… and it went  and then the Moon, as key legends on Apollo’s onboard computer.
								
		But why? Why would anyone choose this kind of an ugly font where so many nicer fonts have already been around for ages?
						
		Some of it might be the power of the default. Popular engraving equipment comes with a built-in font that’s so standard it reuses the router’s name? Of course you will see it, the same way you saw a lot of Arial in the 1990s, or Calibri today.
	
		Gorton was also convenient. If your previous engraving work required you do to the routing equivalent of handwriting or lettering – every letter done by hand – then a modern font you could simply  and one designed with “a minimum of sharp corners for rapid tracing with a smooth stroke,” must have felt like a breath of fresh air.
								
		But why engraving to begin with? Because the affordable and casual printing options we enjoy today – the office laser printers and home inkjets, the FedEx Kinko’s, the various cheap labelers – weren’t there. Even things that today feel obsolete, like dot matrix printers, Letraset, and popular letter stencils, were yet to be invented. Often, your only realistic option was the complicated and time-consuming lettering by hand.
				
		On top of that, Gorton’s longevity must have felt attractive. Ink smudges. Paint fades away. Paper can catch fire (quickly) or germs (slowly). Carve something into plastic, on the other hand, and it can survive decades. Substitute plastic for metal, and you just turned decades into centuries. The text is not added atop heavy-duty material. The text  the material.
	Various items from the 20th century typeset in Gorton					
		I felt good about all my findings: What a strange story of a strange routing font! 
	
		But it turns out I was just getting started. Because soon, I noticed Gorton as ink on paper, and as paint on metal.
	We’re used to the flexibility of fonts today. Fonts as bits inside a computer can become a website, paint on paper, CNC routing, a wall projection, and many other things. But those freedoms weren’t as easy back when fonts were made out of metal. Life’s not as much fun outside of the glamor of a TTF file, and a routing font couldn’t immediately become a regular font – so seeing Gorton being additive and not subtractive was an unexpected discovery.
								
		It turns out that there developed a small cottage industry of things that extended Gorton past its engraving origins.
								
		A company called Keuffel & Esser Co. grabbed Gorton’s machines, and used them to create lettering sets called Leroy. This was Gorton abstracted away – still a pantograph, but cheap, small, completely manual, and a vastly simplified one: no possibility to make things bigger and smaller, and no carving – instead, you’d mount a special pen and draw letters by tracing them.
								
		Another company, Wood-Regan Instrument Co., made a similar set called (semi-eponymously) Wrico. But then, they simplified the process even more. Instead of a pantograph, they offered for sale a set of simple lettering guides used to guide your pen directly on paper.
								
		Some of the traditional draftspeople pooh-poohed these inventions – one handbook wrote “[Those are] of value chiefly to those who are not skilled in lettering. A professional show-card writer could work better and faster without it. A Leroy or Wrico lettering set permits work that is neat, rapid, and nearly foolproof, if not inspired.”
				
		But the products ended up being popular and influential. Their output appeared in many technical documents, but spread even a bit further than that. Eventually, there were stencils made by Unitech, Lutz, Tacro, Teledyne Post, Tamaya, Tech Graphic, Ridgway’s, Faber Castell, Zephyr, Charvoz, Rotring, Pickett, and probably many more.
				
		Then, both EC Comics and All-Star Comics used Leroy in the 1940s and 1950s, most notably in the first comic book that introduced Wonder Woman. This was Gorton spreading further than just technical documents, and inspiring more people.
				
		Elsewhere silkscreening – a pretty cool technique of applying paint on surfaces through a wet mesh of fabric – took Gorton and Leroy in a different direction, by allowing paint on metal.
				
		There was more. The popular plastic letters attached to felt boards, popularized by restaurants decades ago, and more recently revisited by Instagram mom influencers, also clearly derive from Gorton and Leroy.
	
		I also counted at least three different systems of “Gorton movable type” – some where you could assemble physical letters, and some where you could impress them into soft materials using steel types – and I imagine there were probably more.
				
		Letraset, a cheap technique of applying a font by rubbing a letter from a provided sheet onto paper, popular throughout the 1960s, introduced first- or second-hand Leroy too – and so did a few competitors.
						
		In the regulatory space, the U.S. military canonized Gorton in 1968 as a standard called MIL-SPEC-33558 for aircraft and other equipment dials, cancelled it in 1998… then brought it back again in 2007. NATO and STANAG followed. ANSI, American standardization body, made a more rounded Leroy an official font for technical lettering via ANSI Y14.2M, and so did institutions like the US National Park Service.
					
		Gorton went on and on and on. The early Hershey vector fonts, developed on very early computers and still popular in CAD applications today, were also derived from Gorton/Leroy shapes, simplified so that the already-simple curves weren’t even necessary – any letter could now be drawn by a series of straight lines.
						
		And even in the first universe Gorton inhabited things weren’t standing still. 
	
		As the engraving industry learned what’s popular and what is not, the offerings started getting more and more sophisticated. A promotional booklet called “The Whereabouts of 230 Engraving Machines” listed Gorton customers ranging from biscuit makers to fire engine constructors. Othercatalogsproudly listed applications like book covers, billiard balls, organ keys, and toothbrushes, as well as “tools making more tools” – using Gorton engravers to create legends for other machines.
			
		After you bought your pantograph engraver, you could buy attachments for sometimes surprising use cases:
	
		The original machine-shop pantographs were supplanted by smaller portable units (called Pantoetchers) on one side, and by increasingly complex  devices on the other. First generation of those were still huge room-size endeavors with Nixie tubes and complex interfaces labeled… in Gorton itself. 
	
		But the technology matured quickly and soon more and more early manual “tracer-guided” pantographs that forced the operator to put letters side by side and then trace them by hand, were superseded by computerized ones, with both the composition and the routing completely automated. They came from George Gorton Machine Co., and from competitors like New Hermes or H.P. Preis.
					
		You no longer had to buy the chromium-plated brass alphabets weighing up to 13 pounds, choosing the right size from 3/8´´ to 3´´ ahead of time (pantographs allowed for reductions and enlargements, but only gave you a few steps within a specific range.) 
	
		Now, fonts came as digits or formulas built into computer memory, or – for a moment in time – as separate cartridges you’d insert in eager slots. (And yes, before you ask: there were other routing monoline fonts, too. But I really don’t care about any of them.)
						
		It was the same story as in word processing right next door, where old-fashioned Gutenberg-era typesetting was being replaced by increasingly smaller and cheaper computers equipped with first-laughable-then-capable software.
						
		And automation came for the Leroy branch of the tree as well. A few companies grabbed Leroy lettering templates and abstracted them away once more. They created curious small typewriter/plotter hybrids where typing letters on a keyboard would make the pen draw them on paper for you. (I own one of them, a Max Cadliner. It might be one of the strangest typewriters I’ve seen – a weird combination of a machine pretending to be another machine pretending to be a human hand.)
					
		If this was a Gorton typewriter, there were also Gorton , even more sophisticated 1980s machines whose text could be programmed in advance rather than typed one line at a time, and mixed with graphics.
				
		I don’t think the – by now 80 years and counting – fractal explosion of Gorton made its original creators rich.
				
		Copy protection in the world of typography is complicated. The font’s name can be trademarked and other companies legally prevented from using it, and you can’t just grab matrices or font files and copy them without appropriate licenses. But take any text output using a font and then redraw it – and you are within your right to do so, and even to sell the final result. At least in America, or in some other countries until somewhat recently, the shapes of the letters themselves are not legally protected.
				
		This is why Keuffel & Esser, Wood-Regan Instrument, and Letraset could potentially grab Gorton and claim it their own, as long as they didn’t name it Gorton. 
								
		But of course, Gorton was barely named “Gorton” to begin with. In the early days of George Gorton pantographs, as the default pantograph font, it came without a name. (The font sets for purchase were called “standard copies.”) Then, as other fonts were added, it was retroactively named Gorton Normal – the name of the company and the most generic word possible.
						
		Leroy lettering sets started with one font, so similarly to Gorton the font started to be known as “Leroy,” then “Series C,” then “Gothic.” New Hermes called it simply “Block,” Letraset went with “Engineering Standard,” and Rotring – another producer of little computerized plotters – with “Universal.” I’ve also seen “A style,” “Plain Gothic,” and, mysteriously, “Standpoint.” 
								
		I don’t think this was meant to be disrespectful. “Standard,“ “Universal,” “A style” might not have had the connotations of “generic” we associate with them today, but rather meaning “the only one you need,” “approved of by millions,” or “the ultimate.”
								
		But there  one name that felt somewhat inconsiderate. It appeared in one product in the 1980s, a few decades after the birth of another font whose name became recognizable and distinguished. In that product, Gorton was referred to as “Linetica.”
	A few rare examples of Gorton Extended in use						
		Each of these reappearances made small changes to the shapes of some letters. Leroy’s ampersand was a departure from Gorton’s. Others softened the middle of the digit 3, and Wrico got rid of its distinctive shape altogether. Sometimes the tail of the Q got straightened, the other times K cleaned up. Punctuation – commas, quotes, question marks – was almost always redone. But even without hunting down the proof confirming the purchase of a Gorton’s pantograph or a Leroy template set as a starting point, the lineage of its lines was obvious. (The remixes riffed off of Gorton Condensed or the normal, squareish edition… and at times both. The extended version – not that popular to begin with – was often skipped.)
	Classic Gorton vs. Gorton Modified						
		The only “official” update to Gorton I know of, and one actually graced with a name, was Gorton Modified. It was made some time in the 1970s by one of the main keyboard keycap manufacturers, Comptec (later Signature Plastics). It was almost a fusion of Gorton and Futura, with more rounded letterforms. Gone was the quirkiness of 3, 7, Q, C, and the strange, tired ampersand. This is the version people might recognize from some of the 1980s computers, or mechanical keyboards today. 
	
		It is also that last Gorton that mattered.
	A collection of movies and TV shows featuring Gorton							
		My every walk in Chicago or San Francisco was counting down “time to Gorton” – sometimes mere minutes before I saw a placard or an intercom with the familiar font.
								
		This might be embarrassing to admit, but I have never been so happy seeing a font in the wild, particularly as there was almost always some new surprise – a numero, a line going through the Z, a new use, or a new imperfection. And, for a font that didn’t exist, I saw it surprisingly often.
										
		I even spotted Gorton a few times in Spain, or the U.K., and didn’t make too much of it, not thinking about the likelihood of machines from George Gorton’s company in a small town of Racine, Wisconsin making it all the way to different continents. In hindsight I should have.
	Gorton on old British cars, with a particularly delightful Rolls Royce logo made by a simple duplication of the classic Gorton letter R						
		It was only on a trip to Australia where something started connecting. Here, once more, I saw Gorton on the streets, put to work in all sorts of unglamorous situations:
								
		Some letterforms in the above photos felt slightly odd, and so did Gorton on the heavy machinery in an abandoned shipyard on an island near Sydney:
								
		And a visit to a naval museum cemented it all:
	
		It was Gorton, although with some consistent quirks: 2, 5, 6, and 9 were shorter, the centers of M and W didn’t stretch all the way across, and the distinctive shape of S was slightly different here.
								
		Fortunately, this time around, a type designer familiar with my now-public obsession with Gorton clued me in. Gorton didn’t actually originate from Racine, Wisconsin in the late 19th century. It started a bit earlier, and quite a bit further away, at a photographic lens maker in the U.K. called Taylor, Taylor & Hobson. 
								
		In 1894, TT&H needed some way to put markings on their lenses. This being late 19th century, their options were limited to manual engraving, which must have felt tricky given the small font sizes necessary. So the company did what makers sometimes do – instead of searching for a solution that might not have even existed, they made new types of machines to carve out letters, and then designed a font to be used with them.
	
		I don’t know how this first proto-Gorton was designed – unfortunately, Taylor, Taylor & Hobson’s history seems sparse and despite personal travels to U.K. archives, I haven’t found anything interesting – but I know simple technical writing standards existed already, and likely influenced the appearance of the newfangled routing font.
	From a 1895 “Free-hand lettering” book by Frank T. Daniels					
		This was perhaps the first modern pantograph engraver, and perhaps even the arrival of a concept of an engraving font – the first time technical writing was able to be replicated consistently via the aid of the machine.
				
		No wonder that other companies came knocking. Only a few years later, still deep within the 19th century, Taylor, Taylor & Hobson licensed their stuff to a fledgling American company named after its founder. Gorton Model 1 was the first U.S. version of the engraver, and the TT&H font must have been slightly adjusted on arrival. 
	A Taylor-Hobson pantograph in use in 1942			
		This adds to the accomplishments of Gorton – the font was actually  than even Akzidenz-Grotesk, and has been used on World War II equipment and later on on British rifles and motorcycles (and 3,775 finger posts in one of the UK’s national parks), but it complicates the story of the name even more. Turns out, the font without a name has even less of a name than I suspected.
				
		If the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson (or, Taylor-Hobson, as their engravers were known) “branch” of Gorton were more used, should it usurp the at least somewhat popular Gorton name? Or should it just because it was first and the letterform changes were small? Does it matter? Where does one font end and another begin? (Unsurprisingly, TT&H didn’t properly name the font either, eventually calling it “A style” for regular and “C style” for condensed variants. Google searches for “taylor hobson font” are a lot more sparse than those for Gorton.)  
	GortonGorton CondensedThe Gorton quasisuperfamily
		In the end, I’m sticking with Gorton for the whole branch since that feels the most well-known name, but I feel ill-equipped to make that call for everyone. You might choose to call it Gorton, Leroy, TT&H, Taylor-Hobson, or one of the many other names. (Just, ideally, not Linetica.)
	A comparison of all major editions of Gorton					
		And so, throughout the 20th century, Gorton has lived two parallel lives – one originating in the U.K. and later expanding to its colonies and the rest of Europe, and another one in America. 
								
		I am still tracing various appearences of Gorton and perhaps you, dear reader, will help me with that. (Chances are, you will see Gorton later today!) I’m curious about whether Gorton made it to Eastern Europe, Africa, or Asia. I’m interested in seeing if it appeared in Germany where the objectively better-designed DIN fonts became much more popular in Gorton’s niche.
	
		The history of this strange font spans over a century and I’ve seen it in so many countries by now, used in so many situations. But it’s impossible for me to say Gorton is the most hard-working font in the world.
								
		To this title, there are many contenders. Garamond has a head start of 300+ years and has been released in more versions than letters in any alphabet. Helvetica is so famous and used so much that even its ugly copy, Arial, became a household name. Whatever font MS Office or a popular operating system appoint to be “the default” – from Times New Roman through Calibri to Roboto – immediately enjoys the world premiere that any Hollywood movie would be envious of. There is even a 5×7 pixel font originally started by Hitachi that you can see everywhere on cheap electronic displays in cash registers and intercoms.
								
		But there is one place in the world where Gorton pulls triple duty, and I feel confident in saying at least this: Gorton is the hardest working font in Manhattan.
							
		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed my brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love: American Typewriter, Helvetica, Gotham. But, in hindsight, I missed the most obvious one.
								
		Gorton is everywhere in Manhattan. It’s there in the elevators, in the subway, on ambulances, in various plaques outside and inside buildings. And god knows it’s there on so, so many intercoms.
						
		I wouldn’t be surprised if there weren’t a single block without any Gorton in a whole of Manhattan.
	A complete inventory of Gorton outside, near my hotel, between 5th and 7th avenues and 25th and 35th streets. I didn’t have access to the interiors of most buildings.	
		The omnipresence of Gorton makes it easy to collect all the type crimes layered on top of the font’s already dubious typographical origins. Walking through Manhattan, you can spot the abominable lowercase that should better be forgotten:
								
		You can see all sorts of kerning mistakes:
										
		You will notice the many, many routing imperfections – an unfinished stroke, a shaky hand, or services of a pantograph that never felt the loving touch of regular maintenance:
	
		There are all the strange decisions to haphazardly mix various styles of Gorton, or even to mix Gorton with other fonts:
												
		You can even spot reappearing strange characters like a weirdly deep 3, or a flattened 4:
	
    I wish I understood how they came to be, but I have a hunch. The nature of pantographic reproduction is that Gorton carved into metal is not that far away from the original Gorton font template you started with! So in addition to the George Gorton and Taylor Hobson originals, and the other named and above-the-table copies, they might have been bigger or smaller Gorton . I have one myself, carved into acrylic, of unknown provenance and even more nameless than I thought possible for an already name-free font.
  
		But New York Gorton holds pleasant surprises, too. Despite the simplicity of Gorton itself, the combinations of font sizes, cutter sizes, materials, reproductions, and applications can still yield some striking effects:
	
	
			All my Gorton walks in Manhattan in 2024
		

		This was what made me walk 100 miles. Over and over again, Gorton found ways to make itself interesting. Without hyperbole, I consider the above photos simply beautiful.
	
		In a city that never sleeps, Gorton wasn’t allowed to sleep, either. Even in the richest and most glamorous neighborhoods of Manhattan, the font would be there, doing the devil’s work without complaining. Gorton made Gotham feel bougie; American Typewriter touristy.
	
		And once in a while, I’d find Gorton that would wink at me with a story – followed by that aching in the heart as I realized I’d never know what the story was.
				
		You’re not supposed to fall in love with an ugly font. No one collects specimens of Arial. No one gets into eBay fights for artifacts set in Papyrus. No one walks a hundred miles in a hot New York summer, sweating beyond imagination, getting shouted at by security guys, to capture photos of Comic Sans.
								
		So why do I love Gorton so much? 
								
		The Occam’s Razor seems sharp on this one. Perhaps I like it because I’m a boy and Gorton is often attached to heavy machinery. 
					
		But there must be more to it. Perhaps it’s all about the strange contrasts Gorton represents. The font is so ubiquitous, but also profoundly unrecognizable, sporting no designer and no name. Gorton is a decidedly toy-like, amateurish font deployed to for some of the most challenging type jobs: nuclear reactors, power plants, spacecraft. More than most other fonts, Gorton feels it’s been made by machines for machines – but in its use, it’s also the font that allows you to see so many human mistakes and imperfections.
					
		Gorton also feels mistake-friendly. The strange limitations of Gorton mean that some of the transgressions of other fonts don’t apply here. The monoline nature of the font means that messing with the size of Gorton is okay: Shrinking the font for small caps or superscript, for example, gives you still-valid letterforms, almost by accident. 
	
		Stretching or slanting Gorton is not as much a typographical crime as it would be with other fonts because you don’t stretch the tip of the router itself.
								
		There are genuinely moments where I felt Gorton gave people freedoms to maul it decades before variable fonts allowed us similar flexibiity.
		And on top of that, the simplicity of the letterforms themselves feels compatible with the typical naïveté of Gorton’s typesetting. 
	Various accessories and attachments allowing you to shift Gorton around in a way other fonts would not allow
    Sure, there are really bad renditions that are inexcusable. 

		But most of the time, the imperfections and bad decisions are what makes Gorton come alive. They don’t feel like a profound misunderstandings of typography, typesetting, or Gorton itself. They don’t feel like abuses or aberrations. No, they feel exactly how Gorton was supposed to be used – haphazardly, without much care, to solve a problem and walk away. (Later routing fonts copied Helvetica, but seeing Helvetica in this context with all the same mistakes grates so much more.)
				
		The transgressions are not really transgressions. They all feel honest. The font and its siblings just show up to work without pretense, without ego, without even sporting a nametag. Gorton isn’t meant to be admired, celebrated, treasured. It’s meant to do some hard work and never take credit for it. Gorton feels like it was always a font, and never a typeface. (Depending on how rigid you are with your definitions, some versions of Gorton – especially those without instructions on how letters are positioned against each other – might not even classify as a font!)
						
		And I think I love Gorton because over the years I grew a little tired of the ultra flat displays rendering miniature pixels with immaculate precision. 	
		With Gorton, carving into metal or plastic means good-looking fixes are impossible:
	
		And unsurprising given its roots, Gorton has dimensionality that most fonts cannot ever enjoy: A routing tip picked in the 1980s and a sun coming in from just the right angle forty years later can create a moment that thousands of letterpress cards can only dream of.
	
		Perhaps above everything else, Gorton is all about . 
  
    Every kind of engraving has it, of course. But these are not precise submillimeter letters at the bottom of your MacBook Pro or Apple Watch. This is the utilitarian, often harried, sometimes downright  Gorton, carved into steel of a  
		mid-century intercom and filled in with special paste or wax, or put on an office placard made out of a special two-layer material made especially so engraving it reveals the second color underneath, without the need for infill. 
				
		(This is also true when it comes to the original reason I learned of Gorton. Letters on keycaps show the same artifacts – you just have to look very, very closely.)
	
		That’s the last, and perhaps the best thing to fall in love with. 
	
		You won’t be able to fully appreciate it here, of course, but maybe this will give an approximation of how beautiful Gorton’s non-beauty can be:
						
		This has been a strange thing to write. Gorton has been around for over 135 years and used in so many countries for so many reasons, and yet I found no single article about it. 
						
		I feel the burden of being an amateur historian, wanting to know and share so much more, but only being able to provide little. I don’t know the full extent of Gorton’s use. I don’t know who designed it. My chronology is rickety and pieced together from a few breadcrumbs. I dream of seeing the original drawings or drafts once laid on the tables of Taylor, Taylor & Hobson offices, or some notes, or some correspondence. I fear they might no longer exist.
						
		Also, if part of the allure of Gorton is shying away from the limelight and not being admired, am I doing it a disservice by writing about it?
						
		But mostly, I can’t shake the feeling that we all missed a window. That this essay can’t be just a celebration, but also needs to be the beginnings of a eulogy.
						
		Walking around New York, you get a sense that even Gorton carved into metal can disappear. Some of the signs are rusted or destroyed beyond repair. Others get replaced by more modern, charmless equivalents.
								
		Gorton itself is obsolete. All the keyboards that use Gorton Modified you can still buy new today are tipping a hat to nostalgia. The omnipresence of Gorton in New York City is already time shifted from its decades of glory, a simple confirmation of what Robert Moses knew so well: that once built, cities don’t change all that much. But few of the new placards use Gorton, and none of the new intercoms do. 
	
		Taylor, Taylor & Hobson went through multiple splits and mergers and survives as a subsidiary of Ametek, chiefly working on measuring devices. George Gorton Machine Co. from Racine has been bought by Kearny & Trecker, which became Cross & Trecker, was acquired by Giddings & Lewis, and then acquired  by ThyssenKrupp, but not before the Gorton branch was spun off as Lars, and in a sequence of events now resembling a telenovella, eventually bought by Famco in 1987. I do not believe any corporate grandchildren of TT&H and George Gorton’s company are today selling Gorton in any capacity.
								
		It will take decades, perhaps even centuries, but one day the last of this font will be gone. The modern recreations (I eventually found quite a few) won’t help. They are perhaps all missing a point, anyway.
	
		But there’s a somewhat silver lining. Yes, when Gorton is carved into fresh metal, there might be nothing more pretty than seeing its depths glistening in the sun.
	
		But fresh, shining metal is at this point rare. Fortunately, the Gorton I love most is the weathered Gorton.
								
		Manhattan’s tired Gorton is the best variant of Gorton: infill cracked by hot summers followed by frigid winters, the surface scratched by keys or worn out by many finger presses, the routing snafus meeting decades of wear and tear. Gorton’s no stranger to water, snow, rust, or dirt.
			
		This is, perhaps, how you become gortonpilled. You learn to recognize the 7 with a crooked hook, the Q with a swung dash, the strange top-heavy 3, the simple R. You start noticing the endings of each character being consistently circular, rather than occasionally flat. A routing mistake, suspicious kerning, or the absence of lowercase are not a wrongdoing – they’re a .
								
		You find yourself enchanted with how this simple font went so very far. And then you touch the letters, just to be sure. If you can  them, chances are this is Gorton.

From a report: Over the next three years, global electricity consumption is set to rise by an "unprecedented" 3,500 terawatt hours, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. That's an addition each year of more than Japan's annual electricity consumption. 

The roughly 4% annual growth in that period is the fastest such rate in years, underscoring the growing importance of electricity to the world's overall energy needs. "The acceleration of global electricity demand highlights the significant changes taking place in energy systems around the world and the approach of a new Age of Electricity," Keisuke Sadamori, IEA's director of energy markets and security, said in a statement. "But it also presents evolving challenges for governments in ensuring secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why PAUL Needs a Massive Dataset to Improve Its Movements</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/why-paul-needs-a-massive-dataset-to-improve-its-movements?source=rss</link><author>EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Jorge Francisco Garcia-Samartın, Centro de Automatica y Robotica (UPM-CSIC), Universidad Politecnica de Madrid — Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientıficas, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain (jorge.gsamartin@upm.es);(2) Adrian Rieker, Centro de Automatica y Robotica (UPM-CSIC), Universidad Politecnica de Madrid — Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientıficas, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain;(3) Antonio Barrientos, Centro de Automatica y Robotica (UPM-CSIC), Universidad Politecnica de Madrid — Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientıficas, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain.3 PAUL: Design and Manufacturing4 Data Acquisition and Open-Loop Control4.3 Dataset Generation: Table-Based ModelsDue to the complexity of the robot, model-based methodologies, such as PCC or the ones based on Cosserat Rod Theory were discarded. Although the usage of FEM is an avenue that will not be closed in future work, the large number of parameters to be set experimentally for each segment (Young’s modulus, moment of inertia. . . ), given that the manufacturing process is so variable meant that, in this first phase, we opted to use some type of PAUL modelling based on data collection.\
The output of the system is taken as the position and orientation reached by the final end –thus, at this stage, all the positions of the intermediate segments are ignored– and as input, the inflation times of each of the bladders. As there were not enough pressure sensors available at the time of the construction of the robot, it was decided to take inflation time as an input variable. As the working pressure is limited by the pressure limiting valve and the flow rate into each bladder can be assumed to be constant, the time is equivalent to the volume of air introduced into each cavity.\
All the control options considered have in common the need for a large amount of empirical data, which leads to the need to develop an experimental design to systematise the collection of this data. Since the capture of this information is done in different phases and the datasets have to represent the behaviour of the robot in an objective way, the re-applicability of the experiment takes on special importance.\
The data stored in the datasets was the position of the robot tip and the set of inflation times that achieve this configuration. The aforementioned limitation that only two of the three bladders in the segment are inflated reduces redundancies. As previously stated, more than two segments lead to redundancies, which implies that the inverse kinematic model of the robot can have multiple solutions.\
The data collection process involves several sequential steps. Initially, a set number of samples is determined. For each sample, Matlab commands dispatch a random combination of nine inflation times, corresponding to each valve of PAUL, to the actuation bench. Times are generated below a maximum time limit Tmax, and ensuring that only two cavities per segment are inflated. Following this, the robot’s bladders are inflated based on the sent times. Subsequently, the vision system’s two cameras capture images to determine the position and orientation of the robot’s end. This entire procedure is repeated for the specified number of iterations, and upon completion, the collected data is stored in the dataset\
The information on swelling times is stored as a percentage, with a value of 0 corresponding to a zero swelling of that segment and 100 corresponding to Tmax, the swelling for the maximum number of milliseconds defined for this data collection session. This value Tmax is stored, together with the values, in the dataset, in order to be able to compare different datasets. The reason for this coding comes from the lack of information, a priori, on what is the maximum pressure that a PAUL bladder admits. Although it is true that it was experimentally determined that inflation times of more than 1500 ms in a row led to punctures, the application of lower times during a repeated number of cycles also generated leaks. On this basis, it was decided never to inflate any valve, either in one or several steps, more than 1000 ms.\
Along with the inflation times of each bladder, the position and orientation reached by the end tip is stored, based on the camera readings. In particular, the position of the green marker and the orientation of the trihedron are stored. The latter is expressed in Euler angles, as it is a much efficient form of storage than a rotation matrix. In addition, the dataset also contains metadata from the collection process that are believed to influence the results, such as the pneumatic line pressure or the ambient temperature.\
Some aspects in the pneumatic system merit attention. Initially, bladder inflation and deflation are not symmetrical processes. Geometric constraints in the pneumatic components result in a lower deflation rate compared to inflation. Consequently, when the PAUL receives a deflation time, it multiplies it by an empirically derived factor, approximately 1.45 for a 1.2 bar working pressure. This multiplier compensates for the discrepancy between inflation and deflation times of a singular group of bladders, ensuring that the deflation time aligns with the time required to reach the same inflation point.\
Similarly, although it is physically possible to inflate several valves at the same time, it has been shown that this parallel flow distribution means that the effective fillings of each valve are not the same as if they were inflated individually. To prevent this phenomenon, it was decided to inflate each bladder individually both during the data acquisition process and utterly, when PAUL was asked to reach certain positions.\
Finally, there are hysteresis phenomena in the silicone that cause the position reached by inflating for a time t to be different from the position reached by inflating first for a time t1 and then for a time t2 = t − t1. The strategy employed to tackle this problem was to capture the dataset bringing PAUL back to its zero position between each sample. Nevertheless, when controlling the robot in open-loop this is not possible, or, at least, not desirable, as one may wish to follow trajectories or travel through a sequence of points. Therefore, transitioning from position x1 to x2 requires an additional factor of 1.2, also derived experimentally, to account for hysteresis effects.Once the dataset is generated, it can be used to model the behaviour of PAUL for open-loop control. It is foreseen, as a future line, to train a neural network for the direct kinematics and another one for the inverse kinematics. However, given the large amount of data that may be required (in [62] 24389 samples are used for a three-segment robot like this one), a table look-up method has been used for this work.\
The method for direct kinematics –which allows obtaining the position and orientation of the final end of the robot from the inflation times of the nine bladders– consists of searching, in the generated dataset in the previous step, the three inflation time values located at a shorter distance from the inflation time given as a reference. Obviously, if the set of inflation times sought were in the table, the value associated with these times would be returned as a result of the direct kinematic model. Otherwise, the average of the position and orientation values associated with the three closest inflation times, weighted by the distance (Euclidean norm) existing between each of them and the values of reference inflation times, is returned as the position and orientation value of the robot.\
\
with them, it is possible to calculate the position returned by the direct kinematic model using the expression:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NATO backs its first cohort of European dual-use startups</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/nato-backs-its-first-cohort-of-european-dual-use-startups/</link><author>Mike Butcher</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:16:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With both Vice President J.D.

It is a cube made of steel profiles with methacrylate sheets on the walls. The pneumatic bench, the power supply and the microcontroller were placed on top of the structure.\
The aim of the data acquisition system is to be able to measure, whenever required, the position and orientation of the end of the robot in order to be able to relate it to the inflation times of each bladder and thus be able to create an open-loop model of PAUL. For this purpose, three elements are available: the cameras, the calibration grid and the trihedron.\
Two Spedal AF926H USB cameras with 1920 x 1080 px, 80◦ field of view and a frequency of 60 fps are used to capture the images. These have been placed on two tripods external to the robot’s structure. They are calibrated with a checkerboard of 11 x 8 squares of 20 mm each, which can be seen in Figure 11a.\
The vision beacon, on the other hand, has the task of being recognised in space to determine the position and orientation of the mobile system with respect to the fixed system. The trihedron, displayed in Figure 11b, consists of three spheres, manufactured by 3D printing in PLA, inside which three LED diodes have been embedded. Thanks to these, it is possible to vary the luminosity of the spheres by means of software, keeping the system functioning correctly when the workplace or the environmental or lighting conditions vary.\
The existence of the central rod, which moves the luminous spheres away from the base of the robot end, makes possible the spheres to be visible to the cameras in all the poses that the robot can adopt. If the spheres were otherwise directly attached to the\
end of the robot, there would be numerous poses in which it would not be possible to determine the position, as the spheres would be hidden by the robot itself.4.2 Vision Capture System\
\
Because coordinates of the real world are independent of the camera, if Equation (1) is applied for both cameras and rk vector cleared in the two equations, it can be said that:\
\
System of equations (2) can be solved using the Least Squares Method:\
\
and then use the Rodrigues’ rotation formula to obtain it, respect to the real world base in the form of a rotation matrix:\

Treating drugs users as just as terrible as drug dealers has led to a ton of incarceration and a  ton of collected evidence that is apparently being consumed by things cops and crooks are used to dealing with: rats.“Drug-addicted rats” are eating narcotics seized and stored by Houston police, prompting a change in how long the police department is required to store the evidence, officials said.Houston Mayor John Whitmire, Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare and Houston Police Chief J. Noe Diaz announced new steps Friday to dispose of drugs and other evidence kept at police headquarters downtown, some of which has been sitting there for decades, attracting rodents, even though cases they are linked to have long been adjudicated.This is where it becomes clear that drugs have won the Drug War. This single evidence locker contains enough weed to start a drug empire. “We got 400,000 pounds of marijuana in storage,” Whitmire said. “The rats are the only ones enjoying it.”The Houston PD (which has more than its share of corrupt drug cops) is sitting on 200  of marijuana it has amassed over the years. And yet, I would wager that no Houston resident has any trouble obtaining this product on short notice.The same goes for the rest of the stuff in the warehouse, which apparently (until recently) contained cocaine seized in 1996. As police chief J. Noe Diaz pointed out, the evidence has outlasted the case. The suspect pled guilty, served his time, and was free to go long before the evidence used to convict him was.It’s apparently a nationwide problem, according to some of the forensic experts interviewed by NBC News, which carried a story early last year about a similar drug-eating rat problem in New Orleans. New rules are being put in place to destroy this evidence more frequently. On one hand, it makes sense to destroy evidence after defendants serve their time in jail. On the other hand, I wouldn’t get  carried away giving PDs permission to destroy evidence, since that’s the sort of thing that lends itself to cover-ups and the disappearance of evidence prisoners might use to challenge their convictions — a process that can take years, thanks to the justice system’s reluctance to reconsider its own calls and the byzantine processes convicted people are expected to navigate just to have (a very looooong) shot at having their cases heard. But above all that, there’s the sheer amount of drugs being held in evidence warehouses. If there’s nearly a half-million pounds of weed just laying around at any given time, it would seem law enforcement isn’t scoring many meaningful wins in the Drug War. At best, it’s a game of Whack-a-mole that won’t generate enough tickets to make it worth visiting the merchandise booth at the arcade. At worst, it’s just cops looking busy, a meaningless waste of time that unfortunately results in people losing years of their lives to a system that not only can’t fix what’s broken, but clearly prefers doing the things that don’t work as often as possible in perpetuity. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Western Digital Aims For 100TB Hard Drives by 2030</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/1817233/western-digital-aims-for-100tb-hard-drives-by-2030?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Western Digital plans to introduce its first heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) drives in late 2026, with 36TB conventional magnetic recording (CMR) and 44TB shingled UltraSMR variants.

These are made by pouring paraffin wax into previously made female moulds (Figure 5a).\
After half an hour, the wax has solidified and the cores can be removed and inserted into the mould (Figure 5b). The mould consists of four 3D printed parts (two sides, a bottom cap and a top grip on which the cores rest) which are screwed together and then sealed with a hot silicone bead to prevent leakage during subsequent curing (Figure 5c).\
The silicone can then be poured into the mould, which must be filled to the top to counteract the aforementioned shrinkage. In particular, TinSil8015 requires a mass ratio of 10:1 liquid to catalyst. For the dimensions of the segment, about 175 g of total mixture are required.\
The curing process lasts 24 hours at ambient temperature (Figure 5d), after which it can be removed from the mould. It may be necessary to use a scalpel to remove the silicone burrs (Figure 5e).\
Once the segment has been built, the cores that have been used to create the bladders are removed. While the wood can be removed by pulling, it is necessary to apply heat to the segment to remove the wax. Thus, it is first placed in an oven at 110 ◦C (Figure 5f) and then immersed in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes, which ensures the elimination of the residual traces of wax (Figure 5g).\
Since the males are through, it is required to close the lower part of the segment. To do this, a layer of silicone is poured onto the plate of Figure 5h, glued onto the segment and left to cure for 24 hours. Finally, the pneumatic tubes are joined to the segment, adhering them with cyanoacrylate and strengthening the tightness with the usage of plastic flanges (Figure 5i).\
The final result, a functional segment is depicted in Figure 6. Experimentally, it is found that its weight is 161 g and that, as designed, it has a height of 100 mm and an external diameter of 45 mm.Within the robot, the function of the pneumatic bench is to control the flow of compressed air from the compressor according to the control signals. Specifically, the PAUL bench consists of 6 pairs of 2/2 valves (SMC VDW20BZ1D model) and 3/2 valves (SMC Y100 model) placed in series, which will therefore allow up to 12 degrees of freedom. Both are shown in Figure 7. The physical characteristics of the 2/2 valves limited the total pressure of the assembly to 4 bar, but to reduce the risk of segment leakage, it was reduced with a flow regulator to 2 bar. Figure 8 presents a schematic of the pneumatic circuit.\
\
The valves are operated via 24 V voltage signals. A MOSFET (model IRF540) is the switch in charge of managing them. Initially, the use of relays was considered, but the high current they would consume made their use unfeasible. An Arduino Due was chosen as the bench controller. A PC power supply, capable of supplying up to 8.5 A, is responsible for powering the unit, whose final layout is illustrated in Figure 9.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No Startup Has Ever Failed Because it Didn’t Have a Blog</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/no-startup-has-ever-failed-because-it-didnt-have-a-blog?source=rss</link><author>susie liu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Somewhere along the way, startup marketing got hijacked by creator economy logic.“If I build an audience, I’ll have an easier time selling.” “If I post valuable content, customers will come to me.” “Content is how you earn trust.”No startup has ever failed because it didn’t have a blog. Name one high-growth startup that failed because it didn’t have a content marketing strategy. \
  . Because it’s never happened. \
Startups fail because: 1) They didn’t find product-market fit. 2) They spent money like fools. 3) A combo of shaky financials plus bad operations. Not because they skipped the “10 SaaS Growth Hacks” Medium post.The Case Against Content Marketing\
Content isn’t just eating up your time—it’s going to eat your startup for lunch. You think you’re building something, but really, you’re just shuffling pixels around and calling it momentum. ==You’ll die because you’re wasting your best thinking on being interesting instead of being necessary.==\
Don’t try to be a media company when you haven’t even figured out how to be a business.You Ignore Your Most Powerful Asset: Your Product\
The best startups don’t need a perfect LinkedIn strategy. They need a product so good that people can’t shut up about it.Tesla didn’t become Tesla because Musk wrote aspirational posts. (Tesla happened, then people started dissecting every Elon tweet.) Superhuman didn’t win because they ranked for “best email productivity tool”.Notion didn’t explode because they had a “high-value” newsletter.\
They each built something so good that content wasn’t necessary.\
==But content marketing makes you spend more time talking about your product than making it actually worth talking about.== If you’re creating Canva graphics explaining why your product is amazing, ask yourself: Why isn’t it obvious already?You’re Playing To Your Weakness\
If you’re a tech founder, chances are your biggest strength isn’t crafting “valuable content.” But content marketing throws you into the most crowded, attention-starved battlefield on earth that’s populated by all the creative genius humanity has to offer: the Internet. \
Content marketing pulls you away from your strengths. It forces you into a slow, bloated, competitive game where you’re fighting against seasoned creators and media companies—people whose  is content. And you’re out here thinking you can compete?\
While you’re wasting time learning how to be a copywriter, you’re neglecting the strengths that gave you the guts to build a company in the first place. \
Content marketing is a wait-and-see game.Do this long enough, and you'll start convincing yourself that the reason you're not making progress is because you haven’t published enough. So, you rinse and repeat, cranking out more content—and waiting for something to happen. I promise you, nothing will. ==Unless you’re a media company, the real problem won’t be solved through content volume==. Look at the Airbnb guys. They tackled crappy check-in rates by bringing their cameras into homes and taking better photos, not by blogging about the future of holiday stays. \
Founders love content marketing because it’s a safe way to feel productive without doing the uncomfortable shit. Well, if you want to stay away from the uncomfortable, you should consider going back to your desk job. You’re Sprinting For The Wrong Finish Line\
==Content marketing subtly shifts the goalpost of what success looks like.== Instead of $$$ in the bank, founders start measuring social impressions. Instead of customers using the product, they’re tracking newsletter signups. Instead of winning market share, they’re focused on LinkedIn comments.\
 Awareness and engagement doesn’t pay the bills. Real growth is customers in, cash in. If you don’t know the difference between attention and action, content marketing is eating your brain. Are you really growing, or have you just gotten more people to consume free content?You’re Killing Your Brand\
Weird, right? You’d think viral content will help you build your brand. Nope, because going viral means you’ve got to jump on every buzzword, every new format, and every other trend because it’s what everyone’s talking about. Well, trends don’t care two cents about what your brand stands for. \
Every time you chase a trend, you’re stretching your brand thin, trying to force it into a mold that doesn’t fit. You’re watering down your purpose for a quick hit, all while ignoring the fact that ==building a memorable brand means sticking to your guns, even if it’s what the algorithm despises.==Inbound’s Still In. You Just Don’t Need Content To Do It.The content marketing trend is a byproduct of people misunderstanding HubSpot’s whole inbound marketing thing. \
  Inbound was and still is genius, but inbound marketing was never about “just create content.” It was about ==creating undeniable value before asking for the sale.== (That, and not relying on paid ads for awareness.) \
HubSpot made content work because information was scarce in 2006—they gave away what no one else would. Today, everyone’s got an “ultimate guide” to something. And if they don’t, GPT can make something up based on a prompt. The problem now isn’t lack of content. \
Here’s how to do inbound marketing in the post-content age.1. Figure Out If Content Even Makes Sense for You\
Before you waste another hour on a blog post, ask yourself:Is my audience actively looking for information, but struggling to find it? Is there a knowledge gap that makes them hesitate to buy? Are my competitors hoarding insights instead of sharing them?\
If the answer is yes, fine. Write. Publish. Own the space. If the answer is no, STOP. No one needs your “Top 10 Trends” list. They have Google and chatbots for that.\
Know what’s better than teaching people how to do something? ***Making sure they never have to learn it in the first place. ***\
You can write another 1,500-word thesis. Or, you can build something—a tool, a feature, an experience—that solves the same problem but without needing people to read a bunch of text. Look at the content that’s dominating your space—the posts that get all the likes, shares, and comments. Then ask yourself: How can I make this educational BS obsolete?Here’s a thought: Tell your audience exactly how much time and money you’re burning on content—and then tell them you’re ditching it to build something free that actually helps them. "We were going to spend $20K this quarter on content, but instead, we’re using it to build a free AI-powered email draft generator for sales teams. Tell us what you need, and we’ll make it happen." \
People will talk about it. They’ll share it, they’ll use it, and they’ll remember the one who actually did something instead of just saying something.3. Content Isn’t The Only Thing That Gets Organic Attention\
The other principle of inbound marketing?  Yes, content generates organic awareness and conversation. So do a lot of other things. . This is a last resort because stunts could backfire (but for a startup, any PR is good PR), but at least you’re exercising your creative brain cells. If you have to force people to see your content, why not just skip the middle step and force them to see your product instead? \
Stop badgering GPT for content ideas, and use that time to hijack attention—starting fights on X, sitting on the doorsteps of potential clients for weeks on end with a cardboard sign, anything that gets people talking about your company now, not in six months when Google decides to bless you with traffic.\
(Tip: When pulling a stunt, ==just make sure it barely costs you anything to execute.== That way you won’t hate yourself if you don’t get returns.) Final Thoughts: Why Are You Marketing Like a Coward?\
You built something from nothing. You ignored the safe path, told the doubters to shove it, and bet on yourself. You made a move.\
So where’d that nerve go?The second it came time to market, you swapped instinct for “best practices.” \
  ==Innovation doesn’t come from following rules, and attention won’t be earned through compliance.== \
  It’s taken. It’s ripped out of the market’s hands by people willing to do what no one else is doing.Treat marketing like you treat your product—or get used to being ignored.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Police Union Still Insists NY Misconduct Records Are Secret Despite Court Decisions Saying Otherwise</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/police-union-still-insists-ny-misconduct-records-are-secret-despite-court-decisions-saying-otherwise/</link><author>Tim Cushing</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you’re playing with house money, playing one losing hand after another isn’t a sign of tenacity. It’s just a way of signaling you can’t be trusted with the house’s money.That’s why appeal after appeal from government entities don’t tend to indicate that they’re in the right. It just means they don’t care how much money they spend because it’s not coming from their own pockets. The same principle applies to police unions. The money they use to litigate comes from the officers they’re supposed to be serving. At some point, you’d think they would experience some fleeting shame against lighting their contributors’ money on fire repeatedly, but the sad fact is that most cops represented by New York’s Police Benevolent Association (PBA) are more than happy to keep burning their own money if it means there’s even the most remote chance their past misdeeds won’t come back to haunt them.There have been plenty of legal challenges against the repeal of 50-a, the shorthand that refers to the law that — up until June 2020 — gave law enforcement agencies the option to withhold misconduct records requested by members of the public.The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York asked a seven-judge panel of the New York Court of appeals to apply retroactivity analysis on the question of whether or not state lawmakers intended a confidentiality provision enacted in 1976 to be conferred to police officers as a vested right after it was repealed in 2020.“We’re just stuck, at best, with a very ambiguous record,” Police Benevolent Association lawyer Matthew Daly told the appeals court on Thursday afternoon. “Policy arguments can be made on both sides — there are policy arguments for disclosure, but there’s also policy to protect rights.”Fighting off document requests from the New York Post, the union says the mandate to retroactively make those old records public would infringe vested rights of police officers and other covered employees “who for more than four decades relied on the statutory confidentiality in deciding how to respond to disciplinary matters.”PBA attorney Matthew Daly is, at best, being disingenuous here. The PBA is asking this court to basically codify something that isn’t present in the law: a limitation that prevents disclosure of records generated before the law’s repeal in 2020. As the court pointed out in late 2023, there’s nothing in the law that forbids access to records created prior to this repeal. By their nature, FOIL requests seek records that were generated prior to the request date. In amending the Public Officers Law to provide for the disclosure of records relating to law enforcement disciplinary proceedings, the Legislature did not limit disclosure under FOIL to records generated after June 12, 2020, and we will not impose such a limitation ourselves. Yet, the PBA persists, guided by little more than its access to other people’s money and a burning desire to progress the rot in its barrel of apples by pretending there’s no way the legislature intended to make this law retroactive. It’s a stupid point to make, as NY Post attorney, Jeremy Chase, told the court:“The Legislature, if they wanted to carve out this period from 1976 to June 2020, they easily could have done that, they didn’t do that,” he said.This leaves the PBA as the last bulwark against… um… serving the public trust. If the PBA (or the NYPD officers it represents) actually cared about rebuilding trust and setting it back on the path towards earning the nickname “New York’s Finest,” it wouldn’t be blowing cash in court trying to keep its dirty laundry buried under empty body cam boxes in the back of the metaphorical closet. Instead, it has chosen to spend nearly a half-decade fighting this small move towards greater transparency despite having lost at every judicial level to this point. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daily Deal: Linux/UNIX Training Bundle</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/daily-deal-linux-unix-training-bundle/</link><author>Daily Deal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:45:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linux and UNIX operating systems have become increasingly popular in commercial computing environments.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dynamic Triple Buffering Merged For GNOME 48</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNOME-48-Triple-Buffering</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:35:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As quite a Valentine's Day treat, the long-in-development dynamic triple buffering support for GNOME's Mutter compositor was just merged ahead of next month's GNOME 48 desktop release!..]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jay Xiao on the Power of Technology and Surety Through SuretyNow</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/jay-xiao-on-the-power-of-technology-and-surety-through-suretynow?source=rss</link><author>Jon Stojan Journalist</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:31:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
 has always believed in the power of technology to improve people's lives. As a millennial, Xiao witnessed life before the internet as we know it and how much easier things became after it became more accessible to everyday people. He is now the co-founder and president of SuretyNow, a company that works to help protect the public from dishonest businesses.A Heart and Talent for Tech\
After graduating high school, Xiao attended Queen's University in Canada for commerce and computer science. Though his original goal was to go into consulting and finance, he made a decision to switch fully into tech after an unfulfilling internship at an asset management firm his first summer. During this time, he was balancing the internship while working on a startup with friends, eventually leading him to leave the asset management internship behind to dedicate his time to that startup.\
However, Xiao did not know how to code, so he began taking computer science classes to expand his horizons. He interned at a Toronto startup called Nuology and then parlayed that internship into full-time roles at Google, where he worked on the Google Ads and Google Stadia teams.Making an Impact with the Biggest Names in TechBreaking into the tech field was difficult for Xiao, partly because he was new to the industry and didn't go to a school with a strong history of tech company recruitment. As a result, he worked to better himself in technology through education and went from zero tech experience to interning with Google within three years. At Google Stadia, he helped build Stadia's publisher analytics platform from zero to launch. He helped facilitate an analytics platform used by around 30 publishers at its peak, including Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.As the driving force behind SuretyNow, Xiao's role extends far beyond the title of co-founder and president. He single-handedly built the company's website, developed the internal tooling and infrastructure, and now manages multiple teams. His strategic vision and hands-on approach have been instrumental in the company's success, making it a prime example of his entrepreneurial prowess.\
At SuretyNow, Xiao says that their agents can produce two times the industry average due to the automation they've built to make them more efficient. SuretyNow serves businesses who wish to buy surety to work like other modern tools they love, all with fast and affordable customer service. With exceptional customer service and a commitment to innovation through technology, they aim to educate and deliver peace of mind with their expertise in surety.\
Xiao's future goals for SuretyNow are simple: to lead and inspire others by hiring and mentoring interns. Ultimately, Xiao wants to make buying surety bonds and insurance as easy as purchasing a keychain on Amazon—a fact that can be difficult for some and challenging for others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Choosing Wallets for Decentralized Applications</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/choosing-wallets-for-decentralized-applications?source=rss</link><author>EVEDEX</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
For modern blockchain applications, it’s crucial to balance ease of use for experienced users with accessibility for newcomers. One of the first challenges for beginners is selecting and creating a wallet. Wallet interaction must be simple enough to maintain high conversion rates while preserving blockchain’s core advantage - decentralization - without compromising user experience (UX).Two Audiences: Crypto Enthusiasts and Regular UsersWhen developing blockchain solutions, it’s important to account for varying user experience levels. In the context of decentralized exchanges like EVEDEX, two main audiences can be identified:Crypto Enthusiasts ("Cryptans") – users who are already familiar with blockchain technology, have experience with cold wallets, and value autonomy and decentralization.Regular Users (“Normies”) – those who want to trade and interact with decentralized financial instruments without having to dive into the technical aspects of blockchain.\
For the second group, social logins and embedded wallets are especially important, as they make the onboarding process and platform interaction as seamless as possible.Why is Social Login Important?Social login plays a key role in lowering the entry barrier for new users. Traditional crypto wallets require users to store seed phrases, install extensions, and connect hardware devices. This is complicated, especially for those just starting their journey in Web3.\
EVEDEX offers a built-in wallet with social login, allowing users to sign in via Google. This reduces the likelihood of losing access and makes the platform more convenient for a broader audience.\
Advantages of Social Login:Registration takes only a few seconds.No need for a seed phrase.Access to the account via multiple devices.More users can try to use DeFi without technical difficulties.\
The social login concept allows users to instantly enter the platform without memorizing complex seed phrases or going through lengthy registration processes. This is particularly important for newcomers encountering DeFi for the first time and who might be discouraged by the complexity of traditional wallets. By simplifying the login process, we lower the entry barrier for new users and grow the potential audience, allowing more people to explore decentralized finance effortlessly.Why is Wallet Choice Important?One of the main problems with modern blockchain solutions is the complexity of the first experience for new users. To start using decentralized applications, one must learn many new concepts, such as private keys, transactions, fees, and security. This discourages less technically inclined users and significantly reduces engagement. Therefore, choosing the most suitable wallet technology is not just a matter of convenience but also a way to grow the audience and improve the exchange’s conversion rates.\
EVEDEX is a decentralized exchange focused on providing an interface similar to traditional centralized platforms. To achieve this goal, wallets must combine decentralization (user-controlled funds) with Web2-level convenience.Sponsored transactions or fee payments in non-native currenciesTwo-factor authentication (2FA) supportCross-device account accessThe fastest way to implement these features is through Wallets as a Service (WaaS) solutions like Magic, Fireblocks, or Thirdweb.: Providers offer ready-made solutions with social login and 2FA support. Users do not need to understand blockchain technicalities, the wallet is ready to use immediately after registration.: Key storage is distributed, and the provider does not have direct access to the user's funds. Additionally, two-factor authentication significantly reduces user risks.: Users can quickly start using the wallet without complicated setup or seed phrase storage, relying only on social networks or email.Limited Blockchain Support: Some providers only work with specific networks.: Account recovery is implemented strictly according to the provider's mechanics.: For large user volumes, WaaS services can become prohibitively expensive.Geographical Restrictions: Providers may block access for users from certain regions.Account Abstraction is a technology that allows the use of smart contracts as wallets. Unlike classic wallets, which rely on private keys, smart contract wallets provide virtually unlimited flexibility in implementing interaction logic.\
Currently, the technology is actively developing on EVM-compatible blockchains, thanks to the ERC-4337 standard, which enables AA without changes to Ethereum's base protocol. However, this increases the complexity of the solution's architecture.\
For implementing a wallet with account recovery and two-factor authentication, the optimal approach is to choose a standard open-source smart account wallet implementation that is well-tested and audited.Advantages of AA for UsersFlexibility and Customization: The ability to tailor wallet logic to user needs and preferred verification methods.Decentralization and Full Asset Control: Eliminates risks of account blocking or access restrictions due to the absence of databases and centralized service controls.Access Recovery Through Pre-Defined Mechanisms: Useful in case of key loss or other unforeseen circumstances.Disadvantages of AA (Primarily for Projects, Not Users):Complexity of Implementation: Integrating AA with 2FA and recovery mechanisms requires significant amounts of resources.: It is possible to encounter bugs as the technology is still evolving rapidly.Need for AA Infrastructure Deployment in New Networks.EVEDEX is actively exploring hybrid solutions for maximum user convenience. One key aspect is the integration of Account Abstraction for enhanced security and user interaction with the platform. The platform offers embedded wallets with social login while maintaining decentralization. This allows traders to use a DEX with the ease of a CEX, without having to trust a centralized entity.\
Additionally, EVEDEX is testing the possibility of sponsored transactions, enabling users to pay fees in project tokens, as well as flexible access recovery mechanisms without handing over private keys.EVEDEX allows users to choose between different interaction options: (Recommended for Beginners):Quickly create an embedded wallet.Connecting an Existing Wallet:Use MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, and other wallets.Full control over assets.Requires seed phrase storage.An innovative approach is combining embedded wallets with Account Abstraction. In this model, an embedded wallet is used to create and manage a smart contract (AA) wallet. This solution allows for seamless integration of social login and 2FA functionality while retaining the ability to implement custom logic at the AA wallet level.Choosing the right wallet for decentralized applications requires balancing user convenience with decentralization principles. Embedded wallets provide quick setup and ready-made solutions but may limit flexibility and increase costs. Account Abstraction offers extensive possibilities but demands significant effort during implementation. A hybrid approach enables easy account recovery, social logins, and additional features without sacrificing wallet functionality.\
EVEDEX is betting on hybrid solutions, integrating advanced technologies into a user-friendly interface to offer the best of both worlds: CEX-like convenience and DEX-level security.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Admin Adds Note Rejecting ‘Gender Ideology’ on Sites Court Ordered Them to Restore</title><link>https://www.404media.co/trump-admin-adds-note-rejecting-gender-ideology-on-sites-court-ordered-them-to-restore/</link><author>Emanuel Maiberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/CleanShot-2025-02-14-at-10.31.48@2x.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:25:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">Dev - 404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After being forced by a court order to  about gender and diversity to government websites, the Trump administration has added a note to the top of those pages saying “Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate, and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”Per a court order, HHS is required to restore this website as of February 14, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate, and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female. The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it.The note essentially seems like a way for the current administration to legally comply with a court order while still signaling that it entirely rejects any government funded or endorsed research or policy sympathetic to LGBTQ+ community and diversity, equity, and inclusion, which Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have been purging from government websites. Earlier this week,  that a federal judge ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control, and Food and Drug Administration to restore several webpages they removed as a result of Trump’s executive order attacking diversity, equity, and inclusion. The agencies were given until 11:59 p.m. on February 11 to restore the webpages. The court ordered the administration to restore the webpages “to their versions as of January 30, 2025, meaning they were supposed to revert the webpages to what they looked like on January 30 with no changes. The versions that have been restored now have this additional disclaimer.A joint status update filed Thursday by lawyers for the Department of Justice and the Public Citizen Litigation Group says that the government has provided the court with a list of websites that it has restored, though the list of websites is not available. It also specifically says that the government is refusing to restore the website reproductiverights.gov: “Defendants have objected to restoring the website ‘reproductiverights.gov.’ Plaintiff’s counsel is conferring with their client,” it says.“Plaintiff’s lists include websites from Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) components other than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. The parties disagree about whether such websites properly fall within the scope of the Order. However, given Plaintiff’s forthcoming amended complaint and to avoid further emergency motions practice, Defendants will restore those websites consistent with the Order,” it adds.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI: The Age of AI Is Here!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97kQRYwL3P0</link><author>Two Minute Papers</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/97kQRYwL3P0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:18:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg">Two Minute Papers</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[❤️ Check out Lambda here and sign up for their GPU Cloud: https://lambdalabs.com/papers

The deposit phase began with the launch of the Symbiotic mainnet on January 28 and completed within two weeks. The deposits occurred during a market decline triggered by President Trump’s tariff policy.\
Contributors participated through two vault types. One vault is managed by HyveDA and additional vaults are provided by partners including EtherFi, Renzo, MEV Capital, Re7, Steakhouse, Gautlet, and P2P. Investors deposited assets into the vaults to become eligible for points that will be assigned after the deposit phase and carried forward to later phases.\
The deposited funds are not subject to penalties or risks from operations. The deposit process is structured to maintain a controlled onboarding process while allowing the protocol to expand. HyveDA operates a network that uses a delegated staking system through Symbiotic’s restaking process. The network depends on the participation of nodes to maintain data availability.\
The deposit phase may affect the protocol’s progress. A group of participants engaged in the process during a period of market instability. The method for assigning points after the deposit phase may influence future participation in the ecosystem. Observers note that the outcome may serve as a reference for protocols that seek to raise funds during periods of market change.\
The experience of this deposit phase stands as a point of reference for protocols seeking similar funding processes. Future updates will determine how this approach influences the transition from the pre-testnet phase to subsequent network stages and the overall development of the protocol.The pre-deposit event resulted in a funding limit of 50 million dollars collected from early contributors. The process relied on a deposit mechanism with a defined cap and used multiple vault options. Contributors deposited assets into a native vault and several partner vaults. The method permitted a spread of contributions across many participants during a period when market conditions were affected by external policy changes.\
The deposit process provided an opportunity to test a funding method under conditions where market sentiment was shifting. Early participants engaged in the process despite the influence of external events. The use of a points system to reward participation introduces a variable for future involvement. This points system will be carried into subsequent phases and will affect how contributors interact with the network as it develops.\
The event also offered an example of a funding process that limits resource collection through a preset cap. The method used may serve as a reference for other protocols that plan to gather funds in similar market environments. The choice to spread contributions across several vaults instead of a single source appears to reduce the concentration of deposits. This approach may have an effect on how risk is distributed among network participants.\

Not in the usual way of submitting comments through a form, mind you, but by directly injecting content into their database. This seems suboptimal.The story here is that DOGE — Elon Musk’s collection of supposed coding “geniuses” brought in to “disrupt” government inefficiency — finally launched their official website. And what they delivered is a masterclass in how not to build government infrastructure. One possibility is that they’re brilliant disruptors breaking all the rules to make things better. Another possibility is that they have no idea what they’re doing.The latter seems a lot more likely.Last week, it was reported that the proud racist 25-year-old Marko Elez had been given admin access and was pushing untested code to the US government’s $6 trillion/year payment system. While the Treasury Department initially claimed (including in court filings!) that Elez had “read-only” access, others reported he had write access. After those reports came out, the Treasury Dept. “corrected” itself and said Elez had been “accidentally” given write privileges for the payments database, but only for the data, not the code. Still, they admitted that while they had put in place some security protections, it’s possible that Elez did copy some private data which “may have occasionally included screenshots of payment systems data or records.”Now, you might think that having a racist twenty-something with admin access to trillion-dollar payment systems would concern people. But Musk’s defenders had a compelling counterargument: he must be a genius! Because… well, because Musk hired him, and Musk only hires geniuses. Or so we’re told.The DOGE team’s actual coding prowess is turning out to be quite something. First, they decided that government transparency meant hiding everything from FOIA requests. When questioned about this interesting interpretation of “transparency,” Musk explained that actually DOGE was being super transparent by putting everything on their website and ExTwitter account.There was just one small problem with this explanation. At the time he said it, the DOGE website looked like this:That was it. That was the whole website.On Thursday, they finally launched a real website. Sort of. If by “real website” you mean “a collection of already-public information presented in misleading ways by people who don’t seem to understand what they’re looking at.” But that’s not even the interesting part.These supposed technical geniuses managed to build what might be the least secure government website in history. Let’s start with something basic: where does the website actually live? According to Wired, the source code actually tells search engines that ExTwitter, not DOGE.gov, is the real home of this government information:A WIRED review of the page’s source code shows that the promotion of Musk’s own platform went deeper than replicating the posts on the homepage. The source code shows that the site’sA canonical tag is a snippet of code that tells search engines what the authoritative version of a website is. It is typically used by sites with multiple pages as a search engine optimization tactic, to avoid their search ranking being diluted.In DOGE’s case, however, the code is informing search engines that when people search for content found on, they should not show those pages in search results, but should instead display the posts on X.“It is promoting the X account as the main source, with the website secondary,” Declan Chidlow,, tells WIRED. “This isn’t usually how things are handled, and it indicates that the X account is taking priority over the actual website itself.”If you’re not a web developer, here’s what that means: When you build a website, you can tell search engines “hey, if you find copies of this content elsewhere, this version here is the real one.” It’s like telling Google “if someone copied my site, mine is the original.”But DOGE did the opposite. They told search engines “actually, ExTwitter has the real version of this government information. Our government website is just a copy.” Which is… an interesting choice for a federal agency? It’s a bit like the Treasury Department saying “don’t look at our official reports, just check Elon’s tweets.”You might think that a government agency directing people away from its official website and toward the private company of its leader would raise some conflict-of-interest concerns. And you’d be right!But wait, it gets better. Or worse. Actually, yeah, it’s worse.Who built this government website? Through some sloppy coding, security researcher Sam Curry figured out it was DOGE employee Kyle Shutt. The same Kyle Shutt who, according to Drop Site News, has admin access to the FEMA payments system. The same Kyle Shutt who used the exact same Cloudflare ID to build Musk’s America PAC Trump campaign website. Because why maintain separate secure credentials for government systems and political campaigns when you can just… not do that?But the real cherry on top came Thursday when people discovered something amazing about the DOGE site database:  Not “anyone with proper credentials.” Not “anyone who passes security checks.” Just… anyone. As 404 Media reported, if you know basic database operations, you too can be a government website administrator:The doge.gov website that was spun up to track Elon Musk’s cuts to the federal government is insecure and pulls from a database that can be edited by anyone, according to two separate people who found the vulnerability and shared it with 404 Media. One coder added at least two database entries that are visible on the live site and say “this is a joke of a .gov site” and “THESE ‘EXPERTS’ LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN -roro.” While I imagine those will be taken down shortly, for now, the insertions are absolutely visible:Look, there’s a reason we called this whole thing a cyberattack. When someone takes over your computer systems and leaves them wide open to anyone who wants to mess with them, we usually don’t call that “disruption” or “innovation.” We call it a cybersecurity breach.“Feels like it was completely slapped together,” they added. “Tons of errors and details leaked in the page source code.”Both sources said that the way the site is set up suggests that it is not running on government servers.has its codebase, probably through GitHub or something,” the other developer who noticed the insecurity said. “They’re deploying the website on Cloudflare Pages from their codebase, andis a custom domain that theirURL is set to. So rather than having a physical server or even something like Amazon Web Services, they’re deploying using Cloudflare Pages which supports custom domains.”Here’s the thing about government computer systems: They’re under constant attack from foreign adversaries. Yes, they can be inefficient. Yes, they can be bloated. But you know what else they usually are? Not completely exposed to the entire internet. It turns out that some of that inefficient “bureaucracy” involves basic things like “security” and “not letting random people write whatever they want in federal databases.”This isn’t some startup where “move fast and break things” is a viable strategy. This is the United States government. And it’s been handed over to people whose main qualification appears to be “posts spicy memes on 4chan.” The implications go far beyond embarrassing database injections — this level of technical negligence in federal systems creates genuine national security concerns. When your “disruption” involves ignoring decades of hard-learned lessons about government systems security, you’re not innovating — you’re inviting disaster.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friday Squid Blogging: Squid the Care Dog</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/friday-squid-blogging-squid-the-care-dog.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>Schneider on Security</category><category>infosec</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:05:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Vanderbilt University Medical Center has a pediatric care dog named “Squid.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Upcoming Speaking Engagements</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/upcoming-speaking-engagements-43.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>Schneider on Security</category><category>infosec</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:01:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a current list of where and when I am scheduled to speak:I’m speaking at Boskone 62 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, which runs from February 14-16, 2025.

Sponsoring projects isn’t just about altruism, it’s about investing in the future. Many maintainers work on open source projects in their spare time. Sponsorships can help them dedicate more time to the projects you depend on. With financial support, maintainers can help cover costs such as development and hosting.When you sponsor a maintainer, you’re helping them continue their work and letting them know you value the creativity and love they’ve poured into their project. For this Valentine’s Day, let’s show love to the maintainers who keep our favorite projects alive and thriving.The benefits of financial sponsorshipSponsorship is a tangible way to show support for the open source community. It can be a huge morale boost, as well as bring visibility and validation. Sponsored projects often gain more attention, leading to a virtuous cycle of more contributors and users, which results in better software for everyone.Getting started: How to best invest in open sourceIdentify critical dependencies:Review your project’s dependencies to identify which open source libraries and tools are crucial to your operations. If you use tools like npm, pip, or maven, you can review their dependencies and prioritize which are critical to your project’s success.  Evaluate the project activity: Check the recent and trending activity of repositories and look for signs of contributions, shipped features, bug fixes, active maintenance, and community engagement. Helpful metrics like recent commits, issue resolution, and community engagement are all good markers for where funding could help. Projects with a high impact but low funding could be great candidates to prioritize for sponsorship.   Take the opportunity to look at the issues and contribution guidelines. Try to understand their funding needs and how your support makes a difference. But also consider investing in ways beyond just financial support. You could provide bug fixes if you feel confident in your code. You could also take the time to tell someone about the project and why you think it’s awesome. Maintainers can show love for their sponsors as well. Sponsors appreciate knowing their contribution is making a difference.

Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for NLP and computer vision.For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern large language models (LLMs) without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in  the key concepts that should be studied.Natural language processing (NLP) is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.Before being converted into vectors, words undergo , which includes simple techniques such as , stemming, lemmatization, normalization, or removing . After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into . Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.The  method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance — a concept introduced in the  and  methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings. are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10–20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:  and . Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other large language models (LLMs).When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of  and , introduced in GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.Another important technique developed in recent years is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training. As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model’s weights.This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include ,, and .Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of  is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT’s rich knowledge to a specific domain.Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.As the name suggests,  involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called .In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet, and .Speaking of the object detection task, the  algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about , which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how generative adversial networks (GAN) function to generate images is a good way to broaden one’s horizons.In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.It would be very hard to present in detail the Roadmaps for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.First of all, recommender systems (RecSys) have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions. often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.Closely related to ranking, there is also a  problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair is mapped “well” according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited. is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity. is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier. is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to  find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.The word “approximately” means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms — sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression. involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:the target variable can have an overall , where in the long term its values increase or decrease (e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming).the target variable can have a  which makes its values change based on the currently given period (e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer).Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is , which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning. In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the “trial and error approach”). By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect. After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem. Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.Currently the most popular applications are:. Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans. The most well-known examples are chess and Go.. Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.. Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist. While most of the mentioned topics require time to master, they can add significant value to your portfolio. This is especially true for the NLP and CV domains, which are in high demand today.After reaching a high level of expertise in data science, it is still crucial to stay motivated and consistently push yourself to learn new topics and explore emerging algorithms.Data science is a constantly evolving field, and in the coming years, we might witness the development of new state-of-the-art approaches that we could not have imagined in the past.All images are by the author unless noted otherwise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Behind the Blog: Backdoors and the Miracle of Wikipedia</title><link>https://www.404media.co/behind-the-blog-backdoors-and-the-miracle-of-wikipedia/</link><author>Samantha Cole</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/nl2.14--1-.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:40:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.404media.co/">Dev - 404</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is Behind the Blog, where we share our behind-the-scenes thoughts about how a few of our top stories of the week came together. This week, we discuss Apple's iCloud, Wikipedia is a miracle of humankind, and good soup.After our relatively unhinged BTBs last week, many of you left extremely nice comments, reached out individually, or otherwise gave us encouragement. You all are the best, and it made us feel very good. Thank you!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unlocking global AI potential with next-generation subsea infrastructure</title><link>https://engineering.fb.com/2025/02/14/connectivity/project-waterworth-ai-subsea-infrastructure/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:28:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://engineering.fb.com/">Facebook engineering</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
