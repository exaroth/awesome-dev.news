This fragmentation is a known challenge that can create friction and slow down software development iteration. It’s especially problematic for cross-functional teams, where differences in roles, expertise, and work culture can further complicate collaboration.There is growing consensus that successful software product development requires continuous collaboration across functions, including design, engineering and operations.Tobias Dunn-Krahn is the CTO and Doug Peete is the Chief Product Officer of Atono, which is a software development lifecycle platform focused on cross-functional teams. They join the podcast with Kevin Ball to talk about the challenges of modern product development, the importance of low-friction UX, the role of AI in product tooling, and how to unify product, design, engineering, and operations in a single workflow.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Atono.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>#516: Accelerating Python Data Science at NVIDIA</title><link>https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/516/accelerating-python-data-science-at-nvidia</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/download/516/accelerating-python-data-science-at-nvidia.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://talkpython.fm/">Talk Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cursor’s problem isn&apos;t just Cursor&apos;s problem (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/157</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/157/changelog-news-157.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cursor has a big problem, Alireza Bashiri thinks plaintext beats todo apps, Manish built an offline AI workspace, OverType is a WYSIWYG markdown editor that’s just a textarea, and sshrc lets you bring your config with you to remote machines.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.
