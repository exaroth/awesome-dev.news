It used to be that the first step of data science was to get familiar with your data. However, as modern LLM datasets have gotten larger, dataset exploration tools have not kept up. Kenny makes the case that user interfaces have been under-appreciated in the Python-centric world of AI, and new tools are needed to enable advances in machine learning. Our conversation also dives into new methods of using LLM models themselves to assist data engineers in actually looking at their data.Kenny has been working in AI for over 20 years. First in academia as a ML Ph.D. student at USC (before it was cool). Kenny then co-founded Algorithmia to solve the problem of hosting and distribution of ML models running on GPUs (also before it was cool). Algortihmia was an early pioneer of the MLOps space and was acquired by DataRobot in 2021. Kenny is currently founder and CEO of Hyperparam, building new tools to make AI dataset curation orders of magnitude more efficient. ~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Docusign for Developers with Dan Selman and Larry Jin</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/18/the-docusign-developer-api-with-dan-selman-and-larry-jin/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-docusign-developer-api-with-dan-selman-and-larry-jin</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED7418083051.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:00:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Agreements and contracts are a fundamental innovation and govern everything from personal commitments to major financial decisions. They function as trusted artifacts to capture the nature of a commitment and provide clarity and accountability. Software has revolutionized many business functions, including the basic mechanics of digitally signing an agreement. However, the process of managing agreements systematically and at scale with type definitions, programmatic document creation, and storage schemas remains a complex and largely unsolved challenge.Dan Selman is the product architect at Docusign and was previously co-founder and CTO of the Smart Agreements Platform, Clause. Larry Jin is the VP of Product Management at Docusign and previously worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Docusign recently released a developer API focused on fully modernizing and scaling the agreements process. In this episode, Dan and Larry joined Sean Falconer to talk about the frontier of digital agreements.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored bySean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler.
