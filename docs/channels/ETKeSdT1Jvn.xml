It is a symptom of how complex workflow orchestration has gotten. Is it a dominant trend or will we cycle back to “DAG specifications”? At Stitchfix, we had our own DSL that “compiled” into airflow DAGs and at MicroByre, we used a external workflow langauge. Both had a batch task executor on K8s but at MicroByre, we had human and robot in the loop workflows.// BioDr. Milowski is a serial entrepreneur and computer scientist with experience in a variety of data and machine learning technologies. He holds a PhD in Informatics (Computer Science) from the University of Edinburgh, where he researched large-scale computation over scientific data. Over the years, he's spent many years working on various aspects of workflow orchestration in industry, standardization, and in research.// MLOps Swag/Merchhttps://shop.mlops.community/// Related LinksWebsite: https://www.milowski.com/ --------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------Join our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slackFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunitySign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/registerCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/Connect with Alex on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmilowski/]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Risky Biz Soap Box: Run your own open source IDP with Authentik</title><link>https://risky.biz/soapbox93/</link><author></author><category>infosec</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media3.risky.biz/soapbox93.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:24:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://risky.biz/">Risky Business blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_izoDLdUW0</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>infosec</category><category>video</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n_izoDLdUW0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Darknet diaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications

Spanning thousands of miles, they carry an estimated 95% of international internet, phone, and data transmissions.Critically, these cables are vulnerable to sabotage by state actors, as they form critical infrastructure for global communication and economic stability. Indeed, Russia and China have been implicated in activities targeting subsea cables as recently as November 2024, and experts warn that these networks are likely to be focal points in future conflicts, heightening geopolitical tensions.Josh Dzieza is a reporter for The Verge and has covered the subsea cable industry and the strategic importance of subsea cables.
