To achieve true compliance, MLOps teams need to access and analyse the internal reasoning of their models to achieve compliance with the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and other requirements.In this session, Mike introduces the company's patent-pending AI assurance technology that moves beyond statistical proxies. He will break down the architecture of the Synapses Logger, a patent-pending technology that embeds directly into the neural activation flow to capture weights, activations, and activation paths in real-time.Mike Oaten serves as the CEO of TIKOS, leading the company’s mission to progress trustworthy AI through unique, high-performance AI model assurance technology. A seasoned technical and data entrepreneur, Mike brings experience from successfully co-founding and exiting two previous data science startups: Riskopy Inc. (acquired by Nasdaq-listed Coupa Software in 2017) and Regulation Technologies Limited (acquired by mnAi Data Solutions in 2022).Mike's expertise spans data, analytics, and ML product and governance leadership. At TIKOS, Mike leads a VC-backed team developing technology to test and monitor deep-learning models in high-stakes environments, such as defence and financial services, so they comply with the stringent new laws and regulations.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~[00:00] Regulations as Opportunity[00:25] Regulation Compliance Fun[02:49] AI Act Layers Explained[05:19] Observability in Systems vs ML[09:05] Risk Transfer in AI[11:26] LLMs and Model Approval[17:17] Hyperbolic GPU Cloud Ad[18:16] Stakeholder Alignment and Tech[22:20] AI in Regulated Environments[28:55] Autonomous Boat Regulations[34:20] Data Compliance Mapping[39:11] Data Capture Strategy[41:13] EU AI Act Insights[45:45] Join the Coding Agents Conference!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DtSR Episode 690 - Defenders of the Internet Pipes</title><link></link><author></author><category>infosec</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/www.buzzsprout.com/2153215/episodes/18575950-dtsr-episode-690-defenders-of-the-internet-pipes.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogwh1t3rabbit.medium.com/">Down the Security Rabbit Hole Podcast</source></item><item><title>Production-Grade AI Systems with Fred Roma</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2026/01/27/production-grade-ai-systems-with-fred-roma/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=production-grade-ai-systems-with-fred-roma</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED9014126961.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:00:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Engineering teams around the world are building AI-focused applications or integrating AI features into existing products. The AI development ecosystem is maturing, which is accelerating how quickly these applications can be prototyped. However, taking AI applications to production remains a notoriously complex process. Modern AI stacks demand LLMs, embeddings, vector search, observability, new caching layers, and constant adaptation as the landscape shifts week to week. Increasingly, the data layer has become both the foundation and the bottleneck to AI app productionization.MongoDB has been expanding beyond its core document database into a full AI-ready database platform with integrated capabilities for operational data, search, real-time analytics, and AI-powered data retrieval. The company also recently acquired Voyage AI to provide accurate and cost-effective embedding models and rerankers to its users.Fred Roma is a veteran engineer and is currently the SVP of Product and Engineering at MongoDB. He joins the show with Kevin Ball to talk about the state of AI application development, the role of vector search and reranking, schema evolution in the LLM era, the Voyage AI acquisition, how data platforms must evolve to keep up with AI’s breakneck pace, and more.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by MongoDB.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Clawdbot triggers a run on Mac Minis (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/178</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/178/changelog-news-178.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Clawdbot drives Mac Mini sales, Swizec Teller on the future of software engineering being SRE, Daniel Stenberg decided to end curl’s bug bounty program, zerobrew takes some of the best ideas from uv and applies them to Homebrew, and Phil Eaton on LLMs and your career.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Tools like npm and Yarn have long been the core of the JavaScript ecosystem, enabling developers to install, update, and share code with ease. But as projects grow larger and the ecosystem more complex, this older infrastructure is beginning to show its limits with performance bottlenecks, dependency conflicts, and growing concerns around supply chain security.Darcy Clarke and Ruy Adorno are veterans of this ecosystem. Both spent years maintaining the npm CLI and helping guide the Node.js project, where they saw firsthand the technical debt and design tradeoffs that define modern JavaScript tooling. Now they’re building vlt, a new package manager and registry that rethinks performance, security, and developer experience from the ground up.In this episode, Darcy and Ruy join Josh Goldberg to discuss how vlt works, why they believe package management needs a server-side reboot, what lessons they’ve drawn from npm’s evolution, and how features like declarative querying, self-hosted registries, and real-time security scanning could reshape how developers build and share JavaScript in the years ahead.Josh Goldberg is an independent full time open source developer in the TypeScript ecosystem. He works on projects that help developers write better TypeScript more easily, most notably on typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. Josh regularly contributes to open source projects in the ecosystem such as ESLint and TypeScript. Josh is a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies and the author of the acclaimed Learning TypeScript (O’Reilly), a cherished resource for any developer seeking to learn TypeScript without any prior experience outside of JavaScript. Josh regularly presents talks and workshops at bootcamps, conferences, and meetups to share knowledge on TypeScript, static analysis, open source, and general frontend and web development.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
