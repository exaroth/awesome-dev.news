But, I also said that  the gap areas was much harder, and I shared a workaround.However, workarounds like using extra HTML elements, pseudo-elements, or borders to draw separator lines tend to come with drawbacks, especially those that impact your layout size, interfere with assistive technologies, or pollute your markup with style-only elements.Today, I’m writing again about layout gaps, but this time, to tell you all about a new and exciting CSS feature that’s going to change it all. What you previously had to use workarounds for, you’ll soon be able to do with just a few simple CSS properties that make it easy, yet also flexible, to display styled separators between your layout items.There’s already a specification draft for the feature you can peruse. At the time I’m writing this, it is available in Chrome and Edge 139 behind a flag. But I believe it won’t be long before we turn that flag on. I believe other browsers are also very receptive and engaged.Displaying decorative lines between items of a layout can make a big difference. When used well, these lines can bring more structure to your layout, and give your users more of a sense of how the different regions of a page are organized.Introducing CSS gap decorationsIf you’ve ever used a multi-column layout, such as by using the  property, then you might already be familiar with gap decorations. You can draw vertical lines between the columns of a multi-column layout by using the  property:article {
  column-width: 20rem;
  column-rule: 1px solid black;
}The CSS gap decorations feature builds on this to provide a more comprehensive system that makes it easy for you to draw separator lines in other layout types.For example, the draft specification says that the  property also works in flexbox and grid layouts:.my-grid-container {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2px;
  column-rule: 2px solid pink;
}No need for extra elements or borders! The key benefit here is that the decoration happens in CSS only, where it belongs, with no impacts to your semantic markup.The CSS gap decorations feature also introduces a new  property for drawing lines between rows:.my-flex-container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
  row-rule: 10px dotted limegreen;
  column-rule: 5px dashed coral;
}But that’s not all, because the above syntax also allows you to define multiple, comma-separated, line style values, and use the same  function that CSS grid already uses for row and column templates. This makes it possible to define different styles of line decorations in a single layout, and adapt to an unknown number of gaps:.my-container {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2px;
  row-rule:
    repeat(2, 1px dashed red),
    2px solid black,
    repeat(auto, 1px dotted green);
}Finally, the CSS gap decorations feature comes with additional CSS properties such as , , , , and , which make it possible to precisely customize the way the separators are drawn, whether they overlap, or where they start and end.Currently, the CSS gap decorations feature is only available in Chromium-based browsers.The feature is still early in the making, and there’s time for you all to try it and to provide feedback that could help make the feature better and more adapted to your needs.If you want to try the feature today, make sure to use Edge or Chrome, starting with version 139 (or another Chromium-based browser that matches those versions), and enable the flag by following these steps:In Chrome or Edge, go to .In the search field, search for Enable Experimental Web Platform Features.Using CSS gap decorationsLet’s build a simple web page to learn how to use the feature. Here is what we’ll be building:The above layout contains a header section with a title, a navigation menu with a few links, a main section with a series of short paragraphs of text and photos, and a footer.We’ll use the following markup:<body>
<header>
  <h1>My personal site</h1>
</header>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Links</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<main>
  <article>
    <p>...</p>

</footer>
</body>We’ll start by making the  element be a grid container. This way, we can space out the , , , and  elements apart in one go by using the  property:body {
  display: grid;
  gap: 4rem;
  margin: 2rem;
}Let’s now use the CSS gap decorations feature to display horizontal separator lines within the gaps we just defined:body {
  display: grid;
  gap: 4rem;
  margin: 2rem;
 
  row-rule: 1rem solid #efefef;
}This gives us the following result:We can do a bit better by making the first horizontal line look different than the other two lines, and simplify the  value by using the  syntax:body {
  display: grid;
  gap: 4rem;
  margin: 2rem;
 
  row-rule:
    1rem solid #efefef,
    repeat(2, 2px solid #efefef);
}With this new  property value, we’re telling the browser to draw the first horizontal separator as a  thick line, and the next two separators as  thick lines, which gives the following result:Now, let’s turn our attention to the navigation element and its list of links. We’ll use flexbox to display the links in a single row, where each link is separated from the other links by a gap and a vertical line:nav ul {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 2rem;
  column-rule: 2px dashed #666;
}Very similarly to how we used the  property before, we’re now using the  property to display a dashed  thick separator between the links.Our example web page now looks like this:The last thing we need to change is the  element and its paragraphs and pictures. We’ll use flexbox again and display the various children in a wrapping row of varying width items:main {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 4rem;
}


main > * {
  flex: 1 1 200px;
}


main article:has(p) {
  flex-basis: 400px;
}In the above code snippet, we’re setting the  element to be a wrapping flex container with a  gap between items and flex lines. We’re also making the items have a flex basis size of  for pictures and  for text, and allowing them to grow and shrink as needed. This gives us the following result:Let’s use CSS gap decorations to bring a little more structure to our layout by drawing  thick separator lines between the rows and columns of the layout:main {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 4rem;
  row-rule: 2px solid #999;
  column-rule: 2px solid #999;
}This gives us the following result, which is very close to our expected design:The last detail we want to change is related to the vertical lines. We don’t want them to span across the entire height of the flex lines but instead start and stop where the content starts and stops.With CSS gap decorations, we can easily achieve this by using the  property to fine-tune exactly where the decorations start and end, relative to the gap area:main {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 4rem;
  row-rule: 2px solid #999;
  column-rule: 2px solid #999;
  column-rule-outset: 0;
}The  property above makes the vertical column separators span the height of each row, excluding the gap area, which is what we want:There’s more to the feature and I mentioned a couple more CSS properties earlier, which lets you control which of the decorations, rows or columns, appear above the other ones. / , which sets the behavior of the decoration lines at intersections. In particular, whether they are made of multiple segments, which start and end at intersections, or single, continuous lines.Because the feature is new, there isn’t MDN documentation about it yet. So to learn more, check out:The Edge team has also created an interactive playground where you can use visual controls to configure gap decorations.And, of course, the reason this is all implemented behind a flag is to elicit feedback from developers like you! If you have any feedback, questions, or bugs about this feature, I definitely encourage you to open a new ticket on the Chromium issue tracker.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using CSS Cascade Layers With Tailwind Utilities</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/using-css-cascade-layers-with-tailwind-utilities/</link><author>Zell Liew</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:16:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adam Wathan has (very cleverly) built Tailwind with CSS Cascade Layers, making it extremely powerful for organizing styles by priority.@layer theme, base, components, utilities;
@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);The core of Tailwind are its utilities. This means you have two choices:The default choice is to follow Tailwind’s recommended layer order: place components first, and Tailwind utilities last.So, if you’re building components, you need to manually wrap your components with a  directive. Then, overwrite your component styles with Tailwind, putting Tailwind as the “most important layer”./* Write your components */
@layer components {
  .component {
    /* Your CSS here */
  }
}<!-- Override with Tailwind utilities --> 
<div class="component p-4"> ... </div>That’s a decent way of doing things.But, being the bad boy I am, I don’t take the default approach as the “best” one. Over a year of (major) experimentation with Tailwind and vanilla CSS, I’ve come across what I believe is a better solution.Before we go on, I have to tell you that I’m writing a course called Unorthodox Tailwind — this shows you everything I know about using Tailwind and CSS in synergistic ways, leveraging the strengths of each.Shameless plug aside, let’s dive into the Unorthodox Choice now.In this case, the Unorthodox Choice is to write your styles in an unnamed layer — or any layer after utilities, really — so that your CSS naturally overwrites Tailwind utilities.Of these two, I prefer the unnamed layer option:/* Unnamed layer option */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities; 

/* Write your CSS normally here */ 
.component { /* ... */ }/* Named layer option */
/* Use whatever layer name you come up with. I simply used css here because it made most sense for explaining things */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities, css; 

@layer css {
  .component { /* ... */ }
}I have many reasons why I do this:I don’t like to add unnecessary CSS layers because it makes code harder to write — more keystrokes, having to remember the specific layer I used it in, etc.I’m pretty skilled with ITCSS, selector specificity, and all the good-old-stuff you’d expect from a seasoned front-end developer, so writing CSS in a single layer doesn’t scare me at all.I can do complex stuff that are hard or impossible to do in Tailwind (like theming and animations) in CSS.Your mileage may vary, of course.Now, if you have followed my reasoning so far, you would have noticed that I use Tailwind  differently:Tailwind utilities are not the “most important” layer.My unnamed CSS layer is the most important one.Build prototypes with Tailwind (quickly, easily, especially with the tools I’ve created).Shift these properties to CSS when they get more complex — so I don’t have to read messy utility-littered HTML that makes my heart sink. Not because utility HTML is bad, but because it takes lots of brain processing power to figure out what’s happening.Finally, here’s the nice thing about Tailwind being in a utility layer: I can always  a utility to give it strength.<!-- !important the padding utility -->
<div class="component !p-4"> ... </div>Whoa, hold on, wait a minute! Isn’t this wrong, you might ask?Nope. The  keyword has traditionally been used to override classes. In this case, we’re leveraging on the  feature in CSS Layers to say the Tailwind utility is more important than any CSS in the unnamed layer.This is perfectly valid and is a built-in feature for CSS Layers.Besides, the  is so explicit (and used so little) that it makes sense for one-off quick-and-dirty adjustments (without creating a brand new selector for it).Tailwind utilities are more powerful than they seemTailwind utilities are not a 1:1 map between a class and a CSS property. Built-in Tailwind utilities mostly look like this so it can give people a wrong impression.Tailwind utilities are more like convenient Sass mixins, which means we can build effective tools for layouts, theming, typography, and more, through them.Thanks for reading and I hope you’re enjoying a new way of looking at (or using) Tailwind!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CSS Blob Recipes</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/css-blob-recipes/</link><author>Juan Diego Rodríguez</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 13:48:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[. You hate them. You love them. Personally, as a design illiterate, I like to overuse them… a lot. And when you repeat the same process over and over again, it’s only a question of how much you can optimize it, or in this case, what’s the easiest way to create blobs in CSS? Turns out, as always, there are many approaches.To know if our following blobs are worth using, we’ll need them to pass three tests:They can be with just a single element (and preferably without pseudos).They can be easily designed (ideally through an online tool).We can use gradient backgrounds, borders, shadows, and other CSS effects on them.Without further ado, let’s  right in.Just generate them onlineI know it’s disenchanting to click on an article about making blobs in CSS just for me to say you can generate them outside CSS. Still, it’s probably the most common way to create blobs on the web, so to be thorough, these are some online tools I’ve used before to create  blobs. Probably the one I have used the most since, besides blobs, it can also generate lots of SVG backgrounds. A dedicated tool for making blobs. It’s apparently part of Haikei now, so you can use both.Lastly, almost all graphic programs let you hand-draw blobs and export them as SVGs.For example, this is one I generated just now. Keep it around, as it will come in handy later.<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path
    fill="#FA4D56"
    d="M65.4,-37.9C79.2,-13.9,81,17,68.1,38C55.2,59.1,27.6,70.5,1.5,69.6C-24.6,68.8,-49.3,55.7,-56,38.2C-62.6,20.7,-51.3,-1.2,-39,-24.4C-26.7,-47.6,-13.3,-72,6.2,-75.6C25.8,-79.2,51.6,-62,65.4,-37.9Z"
    transform="translate(100 100)"
  />
</svg>While counterintuitive, we can use the  property to create blobs. This technique isn’t new by any means; it was first described by Nils Binder in 2018, but it is still fairly unknown. Even for those who use it, the inner workings are not entirely clear.To start, you may know the  is a shorthand to each individual corner’s radius, going from the top left corner clockwise. For example, we can set each corner’s  to get a bubbly square shape:.blob {
  border-radius: 25% 50% 75% 100%;
}However, what  does — and also why it’s called “radius” — is to shape each corner following a circle of the given radius. For example, if we set the top left corner to , it will follow a circle with a radius  the size of the shape..blob {
  border-top-left-radius: 25%;
}What’s less known is that each corner property is still a  towards its horizontal and vertical radii. Normally, you set both radii to the same value, getting a circle, but you can set them individually to create an ellipse. For example, the following sets the horizontal radius to  of the element’s width and the vertical to  of its height:.blob {
  border-top-left-radius: 25% 50%;
}We can now shape each corner like an ellipse, and it is the combination of all four ellipses that creates the illusion of a blob! Just take into consideration that to use the horizontal and vertical radii syntax through the  property, we’ll need to separate the horizontal from the vertical radii using a forward slash ()..blob {
  border-radius:
    /* horizontal */
    100% 30% 60% 70% /
    /* vertical */
    50% 40% 70% 70%;
}The syntax isn’t too intuitive, so designing a blob from scratch will likely be a headache. Luckily, Nils Binder made a tool exactly for that!This hack is awesome. We aren’t supposed to use  like that, but we still do. Admittedly, we are limited to boring blobs. Due to the nature of , no matter how hard we try, we will only get convex shapes.Just going off , we can try to minimize it a little by sticking more than one blob together:However, I don’t want to spend too much time on this technique since it is too impractical to be worth it. To name a few drawbacks:We are using more than one element or, at the very least, an extra pseudo-element. Ideally, we want to keep it to one element.We don’t have a tool to prototype our blobby amalgamations, so making one is a process of trial and error.We can’t use borders, gradients, or box shadows since they would reveal the element’s outlines.Multiple backgrounds and SVG filtersThis one is an improvement in the Gooey Effect, described here by Lucas Bebber, although I don’t know who first came up with it. In the original effect, several elements can be morphed together like drops of liquid sticking to and flowing out of each other:It works by first blurring shapes nearby, creating some connected shadows. Then we crank up the contrast, forcing the blur out and smoothly connecting them in the process. Take, for example, this demo by Chris Coyer (It’s from 2014, so more than 10 years ago!):If you look at the code, you’ll notice Chris uses the  property along the  and  functions, which I’ve also seen in other blob demos. To be specific, it applies  on each individual circle and then  on the parent element. So, if we have the following HTML:<div class="blob">
  <div class="subblob"></div>
  <div class="subblob"></div>
  <div class="subblob"></div>
</div>…we would need to apply filters and background colors as such:.blob {
  filter: contrast(50);
  background: white; /* Solid colors are necessary */
}

.subblob {
  filter: blur(15px);
  background: black; /* Solid colors are necessary */
}However, there is a good reason why those demos stick to white shapes and black backgrounds (or vice versa) since things get unpredictable once colors aren’t contrast-y enough. See it for yourself in the following demo by changing the color. Just be wary: .To solve this, we will use an SVG filter instead. I don’t want to get too technical on SVG (if you want to, read Luca’s post!). In a nutshell, we can apply blurring and contrast filters using SVGs, but now, we can also pick which color channel we apply the contrast to, unlike normal , which modifies all colors. Since we want to leave color channels (,  and ) untouched, we will only crank the contrast up for the alpha channel. That translates to the next SVG filter, which can be embedded in the HTML:<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" style="position: absolute;">
  <defs>
    <filter id="blob">
      <feGaussianBlur in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="12" result="blur" />
      <feColorMatrix in="blur" mode="matrix" values="1 0 0 0 0  0 1 0 0 0  0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 18 -6" result="goo" />
      <feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blob" />
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>To apply it, we will use again , but this time we’ll set it to , so that it pulls the SVG from the HTML..blob {
  filter: url("#blob");
}And now we can even use it with gradient backgrounds!That being said, this approach comes with two small, but important, changes to common CSS filters:The filter is applied to the parent element, not the individual shapes.The parent element must be transparent (which is a huge advantage). To change the background color, we can instead change the body or other ancestors’ background, and it will work with no issues.What’s left is to place the  elements together such that they make a blobby enough shape, then apply the SVG filters to morph them:This works well, but it has a similar issue to the blob we made by morphing several  instances: too many elements for a simple blob. Luckily, we can take advantage of the  property to create multiple shapes and morph them together using SVG filters, all in a single element. Since we are keeping it to one element, we will go back to just one empty  div:First, we will use  along with  to create a circle inside the element:body {
  background: radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000);
  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */
}Here is what each parameter does: Confines the shape to the element’s box farthest from its center. This way, it is kept as a circle. Fills the background shape from 0 to 100% with the same color, so it ends up as a solid color. After the shape is done, it makes a full stop to transparency, so the color ends.The next part is moving and resizing the circle using the  and  properties. Luckily, both can be set on  after the gradient, separated from each other by a forward slash ().body {
  background: radial-gradient(...) 20% 30% / 30% 40%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */
}The first pair of percentages sets the shape’s horizontal and vertical position (taking as a reference the top-left corner), while the second pair sets the shape’s width and height (taking as a reference the element’s size).As I mentioned, we can stack up different backgrounds together, which means we can create as many circles/ellipses as we want! For example, we can create three ellipses on the same element:.blob {
  background:
    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 20% 30% / 30% 40%, 
    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 80% 50% / 40% 60%, 
    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 50% 70% / 50% 50%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}What’s even better is that SVG filters don’t care whether shapes are made of elements or backgrounds, so we can also morph them together using the last  filter!While this method may be a little too much for blobs, it unlocks squishing, stretching, dividing, and merging blobs in seamless animations.Again, all these tricks are awesome, but not enough for what we want! We accomplished reducing the blob to a single element, but we still can’t use gradients, borders, or shadows on them, and also, they are tedious to design and model. Then, that brings us to the ultimate blob approach…Fortunately, there is a new way to make blobs that just dropped to CSS: the  function!First off, the CSS  function is used alongside the  property to cut elements into any shape we want. More specifically, it uses a verbal version of SVG’s  syntax. The syntax has lots of commands for lots of types of lines, but when blobbing with , we’ll define curves using the  command:.blob {
  clip-path: shape(
    from X0 Y0, 
    curve to X1 Y1 with Xc1 Yc1, 
    curve to X2 Y2 with Xc21 Yc21 / Xc22 Yc22
    /* ... */
  );
}Let’s break down each parameter: defines the starting point of the shape. starts the curve where  is the next point of the shape, while  defines a control point used in Bézier curves.The next parameter is similar, but we used  instead to define two control points on the Bézier curve.I honestly don’t understand Bézier curves and control points completely, but luckily, we don’t need them to use  and blobs! Again,  uses a verbal version of SVG’s  syntax, so it can draw any shape an SVG can, which means that we can translate the SVG blobs we generated earlier… and CSS-ify them. To do so, we’ll grab the  attribute (which defines the ) from our SVG and paste it into Temani’s SVG to  generator.This is the exact code the tool generated for me:.blob {
  aspect-ratio: 0.925; /* Generated too! */

  clip-path: shape(
    from 91.52% 26.2%,
    curve to 93.52% 78.28% with 101.76% 42.67%/103.09% 63.87%,
    curve to 44.11% 99.97% with 83.95% 92.76%/63.47% 100.58%,
    curve to 1.45% 78.42% with 24.74% 99.42%/6.42% 90.43%,
    curve to 14.06% 35.46% with -3.45% 66.41%/4.93% 51.38%,
    curve to 47.59% 0.33% with 23.18% 19.54%/33.13% 2.8%,
    curve to 91.52% 26.2% with 62.14% -2.14%/81.28% 9.66%
  );
}As you might have guessed, it returns our beautiful blob:Let’s check if it passes our requirements:Yes, they can be made of a single element.Yes, they can also be created in a generator and then translated into CSS.Yes, we can use gradient backgrounds, but due to the nature of , borders and shadows get cut out.Two out of three? Maybe two and a half of three? That’s a big improvement over the other approaches, even if it’s not perfect.So, alas, we failed to find what I believe is the perfect CSS approach to blobs. I am, however, amazed how something so trivial designing blobs can teach us about so many tricks and new CSS features, many of which I didn’t know myself.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Say hello to ECMAScript 2025</title><link>https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/742</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://javascriptweekly.com/">Javascript Weekly</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🚀 Build VueJS forms your way with Enforma — UI-agnostic (PrimeVue, Vuetify, Quasar), schema-ready, repeatable fields, powerful validation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KelpUI</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/kelpui/</link><author>Geoff Graham</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 16:42:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[KelpUI is new library that Chris Ferdinandi is developing, designed to leverage newer CSS features and Web Components. I’ve enjoyed following Chris as he’s published an ongoing series of articles detailing his thought process behind the library, getting deep into his approach. You really get a clear picture of his strategy and I love it.He outlined his principles up front in a post back in April:I’m imagining a system that includes…Base styles for all of the common HTML elements.Loads of utility classes for nudging and tweaking things.Group classes for styling more complex UI elements  a million little classes.Easy customization with CSS variables.Web Components to progressively add interactivity to functional HTML.All of the Web Component HTML lives in the light DOM, so its easy to style and reason about.I’m imagining something that can be loaded directly from a CDN, downloaded locally, or imported if you want to roll your own build.KelpUI is still evolving, and that’s part of the beauty of looking at it now and following Chris’s blog as he openly chronicles his approach. There’s always going to be some opinionated directions in a library like this, but I love that the guiding philosophy is so clear and is being used as a yardstick to drive decisions. As I write this, Chris is openly questioning the way he optimizes the library, demonstrating the tensions between things like performance and a good developer experience.Looks like it’ll be a good system, but even more than that, it’s a wonderful learning journey that’s worth following.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poking at the CSS if() Function a Little More: Conditional Color Theming</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/poking-at-the-css-if-function-a-little-more-conditional-color-theming/</link><author>Daniel Schwarz</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:33:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chrome 137 shipped the  CSS function, so it’s totally possible we’ll see other browsers implement it, though it’s tough to know exactly when. Whatever the case,  enables us to use values conditionally, which we can already do with queries and other functions (e.g., media queries and the  function), so I’m sure you’re wondering: What exactly does  do?To recap,  conditionally assigns a value to a property based on the value of a CSS variable. For example, we could assign different values to the  and  properties based on the value of :: : : Anything else
: :root {
  /* Change to fall back to the ‘else’ values */
  --theme: "Shamrock";

  body {
    color: if(style(--theme: "Shamrock"): hsl(146 50% 3%); else: hsl(43 74% 3%));
    background: if(style(--theme: "Shamrock"): hsl(146 50% 40%); else: hsl(43 74% 64%));
  }
}I don’t love the syntax (too many colons, brackets, and so on), but we can format it like this (which I think is a bit clearer):color: if(
  style(--theme: "Shamrock"): hsl(146 50% 3%);
  else: hsl(43 74% 3%)
);We should be able to do a crazy number of things with , and I hope that becomes the case eventually, but I did some testing and learned that the syntax above is the only one that works. We can’t base the condition on the value of an ordinary CSS property (instead of a custom property), HTML attribute (using ), or any other value. For now, at least, the condition must be based on the value of a custom property (CSS variable).Exploring what we can do with Judging from that first example, it’s clear that we can use  for theming (and design systems overall). While we could utilize the  function for this, what if the themes aren’t strictly light and dark, or what if we want to have more than two themes or light and dark modes for each theme? Well, that’s what  can be used for.First, let’s create more themes/more conditions::root {
  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */
  --theme: "Saffron"; /* ...I choose you! */

  body {
    color: if(
      style(--theme: "Shamrock"): hsl(146 50% 3%);
      style(--theme: "Saffron"): hsl(43 74% 3%);
      style(--theme: "Amethyst"): hsl(282 47% 3%)
    );
    background: if(
      style(--theme: "Shamrock"): hsl(146 50% 40%);
      style(--theme: "Saffron"): hsl(43 74% 64%);
      style(--theme: "Amethyst"): hsl(282 47% 56%)
    );
    transition: 300ms;
  }
}Pretty simple really, but there are a few easy-to-miss things. Firstly, there’s no “else condition” this time, which means that if the theme isn’t , , or , the default browser styles are used. Otherwise, the  function resolves to the value of the first true statement, which is the  theme in this case. Secondly, transitions work right out of the box; in the demo below, I’ve added a user interface for toggling the , and for the transition,  just  alongside the  functions: if theme-swapping is user-controlled, such as selecting an option, you don’t actually need  at all. You can just use the logic that I’ve used at the beginning of the demo (:root:has(#shamrock:checked) { /* Styles */ }). Amit Sheen has an excellent demonstration over at Smashing Magazine.To make the code more maintainable though, we can slide the colors into CSS variables as well, then use them in the  functions,  slide the  functions themselves into CSS variables:/* Setup */
:root {
  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */
  --theme: "Shamrock"; /* ...I choose you! */

  /* Base colors */
  --shamrock: hsl(146 50% 40%);
  --saffron: hsl(43 74% 64%);
  --amethyst: hsl(282 47% 56%);

  /* Base colors, but at 3% lightness */
  --shamrock-complementary: hsl(from var(--shamrock) h s 3%);
  --saffron-complementary: hsl(from var(--saffron) h s 3%);
  --amethyst-complementary: hsl(from var(--amethyst) h s 3%);

  --background: if(
    style(--theme: "Shamrock"): var(--shamrock);
    style(--theme: "Saffron"): var(--saffron);
    style(--theme: "Amethyst"): var(--amethyst)
  );

  --color: if(
    style(--theme: "Shamrock"): var(--shamrock-complementary);
    style(--theme: "Saffron"): var(--saffron-complementary);
    style(--theme: "Amethyst"): var(--amethyst-complementary)
  );

  /* Usage */
  body {
    /* One variable, all ifs! */
    background: var(--background);
    color: var(--color);
    accent-color: var(--color);

    /* Can’t forget this! */
    transition: 300ms;
  }
}As well as using CSS variables within the  function, we can also nest other functions. In the example below, I’ve thrown  in there, which basically inverts the colors for dark mode:--background: if(
  style(--theme: "Shamrock"): light-dark(var(--shamrock), var(--shamrock-complementary));
  style(--theme: "Saffron"): light-dark(var(--saffron), var(--saffron-complementary));
  style(--theme: "Amethyst"): light-dark(var(--amethyst), var(--amethyst-complementary))
); vs. Container style queriesIf you haven’t used container style queries before, they basically check if a container has a certain CSS variable (much like the  function). Here’s the exact same example/demo but with container style queries instead of the  function::root {
  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */
  --theme: "Shamrock"; /* ...I choose you! */

  --shamrock: hsl(146 50% 40%);
  --saffron: hsl(43 74% 64%);
  --amethyst: hsl(282 47% 56%);

  --shamrock-complementary: hsl(from var(--shamrock) h s 3%);
  --saffron-complementary: hsl(from var(--saffron) h s 3%);
  --amethyst-complementary: hsl(from var(--amethyst) h s 3%);

  body {
    /* Container has chosen Shamrock! */
    @container style(--theme: "Shamrock") {
      --background: light-dark(var(--shamrock), var(--shamrock-complementary));
      --color: light-dark(var(--shamrock-complementary), var(--shamrock));
    }

    @container style(--theme: "Saffron") {
      --background: light-dark(var(--saffron), var(--saffron-complementary));
      --color: light-dark(var(--saffron-complementary), var(--saffron));
    }

    @container style(--theme: "Amethyst") {
      --background: light-dark(var(--amethyst), var(--amethyst-complementary));
      --color: light-dark(var(--amethyst-complementary), var(--amethyst));
    }

    background: var(--background);
    color: var(--color);
    accent-color: var(--color);
    transition: 300ms;
  }
}As you can see, where  facilitates conditional values, container style queries facilitate conditional properties  values. Other than that, it really is just a different syntax.Additional things you can do with  (but might not realize)Check if a CSS variable exists:/* Hide icons if variable isn’t set */
.icon {
  display: if(
    style(--icon-family): inline-block;
    else: none
  );
}Create more-complex conditional statements:h1 {
  font-size: if(
    style(--largerHeadings: true): xxx-large;
    style(--theme: "themeWithLargerHeadings"): xxx-large
  );
}Check if two CSS variables match:/* If #s2 has the same background as #s1, add a border */
#s2 {
  border-top: if(
    style(--s2-background: var(--s1-background)): thin solid red
  );
} and : When the math isn’t mathingThis won’t work (maybe someone can help me pinpoint why):div {
  /* 3/3 = 1 */
  --calc: calc(3/3);
  /* Blue, because if() won’t calculate --calc */
  background: if(style(--calc: 1): red; else: blue);
}To make  calculate , we’ll need to register the CSS variable using  first, like this:@property --calc {
  syntax: "<number>";
  initial-value: 0;
  inherits: false;
}Although I’m not keen on the syntax and how unreadable it can sometimes look (especially if it’s formatted on one line), I’m mega excited to see how  evolves. I’d love to be able to use it with ordinary properties (e.g., color: if(style(background: white): black; style(background: black): white);) to avoid having to set CSS variables where possible.It’d also be awesome if  calculations could be calculated on the fly without having to register the variable.That being said, I’m still super happy with what  does currently, and can’t wait to build even simpler design systems.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
