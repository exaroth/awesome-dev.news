This one selects find-in-page text, which is the text that gets highlighted when you do a / + -type search for something on a page and matches are found.By default,  matches are yellow while the current target () is orange, but  enables us to change that.I’ll admit, I hadn’t really been following these highlight pseudo-elements. Up until now, I didn’t even know that there was a name for them, but I’m glad there is because that makes it easier to round them all up and compare them, which is exactly what I’m going to do here today, as it’s not super obvious what they do based on the name of the pseudo-element. I’ll also explain why we’re able to customize them, and suggest how.The different types of highlight pseudo-elements selects the current targetText fragments allow for programmatic highlighting using URL parameters. If you’re referred to a website by a search engine, it might use text fragments, which is why  is easily confused with .Incorrectly spelled wordsPretty much applies to editable content onlyPretty much applies to editable content onlyAnd let’s not forget about the  HTML element either, which is what I’m using in the demos below.What should highlight pseudo-elements look like?The question is, if they all (besides ) have default styling, why would we need to select them with pseudo-elements? The reason is accessibility (color contrast, specifically) and usability (emphasis). For example, if the default yellow background of  doesn’t contrast well enough with the text color, or if it doesn’t stand out against the background of the container, then you’ll want to change that.I’m sure there are many ways to solve this (I want to hear  in the comments), but the best solution that I’ve come up with uses relative color syntax. I took wrong turns with both  and backdrop-filter: invert(1) before realizing that many CSS properties are off-limits when it comes to highlight pseudo-elements:body {
  --background: #38003c;
  background: var(--background);

  mark,
  ::selection,
  ::target-text,
  ::search-text {
    /* Match color to background */
    color: var(--background);

    /* Convert to RGB then subtract channel value from channel maximum (255) */
    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) calc(255 - b));
  }
}Your browser might not support that yet, so here’s a video that shows how the highlighted text adapts to background color changes.What’s happening here is that I’m converting the container’s background color to RGB format and then subtracting the value of each channel (, , and ) from the maximum channel value of , inverting each channel and the overall color. This color is then set as the background color of the highlighting, ensuring that it stands out no matter what, and thanks to the new CodePen slideVars, you can mess around with the demo to see this in action. You might be able to do this with color formats besides RGB, but RGB is the easiest.So that covers the usability, but what about the accessibility?Well, the highlighting’s text color is the same as the container’s background color because we know that it’s the inverse of the  background color. While this doesn’t mean that the two colors will have accessible contrast, it seems as though they will most of the time (you should always check color contrast using color contrast tools, regardless).If you don’t like the randomness of inverting colors, that’s understandable. You can totally pick colors and write conditional CSS for them manually instead, but finding accessible colors that stand out against the different backdrops of your design for all of the different types of highlight pseudo-elements, while accounting for alternative viewing modes such as dark mode, is a headache. Besides, I think certain UI elements (e.g., highlights, errors, focus indicators)  be ugly. They  stand out in a brutalist sort of way and feel disconnected from the design’s color palette. They should demand maximum attention by intentionally not fitting in.Keep in mind that the different types of highlight pseudo-elements should be visually distinctive too, for obvious reasons, but also in case two different types overlap each other (e.g., the user selects text currently matched by find-in-page). Therefore, in the amended code snippet below, , , , and  all have slightly different backgrounds.I’ve left  unchanged, the  value of  as it was, the  value of  as it was, and the  value of  as it was, so those last three only have two channels inverted instead of all three. They’re varied in color now (but still look inverted), and with the addition of an alpha value at  ( for ), they also blend into each other so that we can see where each highlight begins and ends:body {
  --background: #38003c;
  background: var(--background);

  mark,
  ::selection,
  ::target-text,
  ::search-text {
    color: var(--background);
  }

  mark {
    /* Invert all channels */
    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) calc(255 - b) / 70%);
  }

  ::selection {
    /* Invert all channels but R */
    background: rgb(from var(--background) r calc(255 - g) calc(255 - b) / 70%);
  }

  ::target-text {
    /* Invert all channels but G */
    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) g calc(255 - b) / 70%);
  }

  ::search-text {
    /* Invert all channels but B */
    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) b / 70%);
    
    &:current {
      /* Invert all channels but B, but without transparency */
      background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) b / 100%);
    }
  }
} and  are excluded from all this because they have their own visual affordances (red underlines and green underlines respectively, typically contrasted against the neutral background of an editable element such as ).But , , , and new-to-Chrome ? Well, they can appear anywhere (even on top of each other), so I think it’s important that they’re visually distinctive from each other while being accessible at all times. Again though, even fully-inverted colors can be inaccessible. In fact, the inverse of  is , so test, test, test! Although, maybe  could come to the rescue once the CSS Color Module Level 5 version of it ships.In the meantime, , no more highlight-y elements!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ReliCSS</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/relicss/</link><author>Geoff Graham</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We all have a few skeletons in our CSS closets.

While testing the component, I discovered I could tab out of the  (in modal mode) and onto the address bar.And I was surprised — accessibility advice around modals have commonly taught us to trap focus within the modal. So this seems wrong to me.Upon further research, it seems like we no longer need to trap focus within the  (even in modal mode). So, the focus-trapping is deprecated advice if you use .Instead of asking you to read through the entire GitHub Issue detailing the discussion, I summarized a couple of key points from notable people below.Here are some comments from Scott O’Hara that tells us about the history and context of the focus-trapping advice:WCAG is  normatively stating focus must be trapped within a dialog. Rather, the normative WCAG spec makes zero mention of requirements for focus behavior in a dialog.The informative 2.4.3 focus order understanding doc talk about limiting focus behavior within a dialog – but again, this is in the context of a scripted custom dialog and was written long before  or  were widely available.The purpose of the APG is to demonstrate how to use ARIA. And, without using native HTML features like  or , it is far easier to trap focus within the custom dialog than it is to achieve the behavior that the  element has.Both the APG modal dialog and the WCAG understanding doc were written long before the  attribute or the  element were widely supported. And, the alternative to instructing developers to trap focus in the dialog would have been to tell them that they needed to ensure that all focusable elements in the web page, outside of the modal dialog, received a .Léonie Watson weighs in and explains why it’s okay for a screen-reader user to move focus to the address bar:In the page context you can choose to  out of the bottom and around the browser chrome, you can use a keyboard command to move straight to the address bar or open a particular menu, you can close the tab, and so on. This gives people a choice about how, why, and what they do to escape out of the context.It seems logical (to me at least) for the same options to be available to people when in a dialog context instead of a page context.Finally, Matatk shared the conclusion from the W3C’s Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group that okay-ed the notion that ‘s  method doesn’t need to trap focus.We addressed this question in the course of several APA meetings and came to the conclusion that the current behavior of the native dialog element should be kept as it is. So, that you can tab from the dialog to the browser functionalities.We see especially the benefit that keyboard users can, for example, open a new tab to look something important up or to change a browser setting this way. At the same time, the dialog element thus provides an additional natural escape mechanism (i.e. moving to the address bar) in, for example, kiosk situations where the user cannot use other standard keyboard shortcuts.From what I’m reading, it sounds like we don’t have to worry about focus trapping if we’re properly using the Dialog API’s  method!Hope this news make it easier for you to build components. 😉]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Community Stories, Code Samples, and Signal Forms!</title><link>https://blog.angular.dev/community-stories-code-samples-and-signal-forms-7d0294475610?source=rss----447683c3d9a3---4</link><author>Angular</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:37:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.angular.dev/?source=rss----447683c3d9a3---4">Angular official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, we’re sharing powerful stories and hands-on code!

It was the only technique that didn’t require media queries or JavaScript. It works with any number of items, allowing you to easily control the size and gap using CSS variables.I am using , , setting  equal to , etc. In 2026, this may sound a bit hacky and outdated. Not really since this method works fine and is well supported, but can we do better using modern features? In five years, many things have changed and we can improve the above implementation and make it less hacky!The CSS code is shorter and contains fewer magic numbers than the last time I approached this. You will also find some complex calculations that we will dissect together.Before diving into this new demo, I highly recommend reading my previous article first. It’s not mandatory, but it allows you to compare both methods and realize how much (and rapidly) CSS has evolved in the last five years by introducing new features that make one-difficult things like this easier.Let’s start with the hexagon shape, which is the main element of our grid. Previously, I had to rely on  to create it:.hexagon {
  --s: 100px;
  width: var(--s);
  height: calc(var(--s) * 1.1547);
  clip-path: polygon(0% 25%, 0% 75%, 50% 100%, 100% 75%, 100% 25%, 50% 0%);
}But now, we can rely on the new  property which works alongside the  property:.hexagon {
  width: 100px;
  aspect-ratio: cos(30deg);
  border-radius: 50% / 25%;
  corner-shape: bevel;
}Simpler than how we used to bevel elements, and as a bonus, we can add a border to the shape without workarounds!The  property is the first modern feature we are relying on. It makes drawing CSS shapes a lot easier than traditional methods, like using . You can still keep using the  method, of course, for better support (and if you don’t need a border on the element), but here is a more modern implementation:.hexagon {
  width: 100px;
  aspect-ratio: cos(30deg);
  clip-path: polygon(-50% 50%,50% 100%,150% 50%,50% 0);
}There are fewer points inside the polygon, and we replaced the magic number  with an  declaration. I won’t spend more time on the code of the shapes, but here are two articles I wrote if you want a detailed explanation with more examples:Now that we have our shape, let’s create the grid. It’s called a “grid,” but I am going to use a flexbox configuration:<div class="container">
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <!-- etc. -->
</div>.container {
  --s: 120px; /* size  */
  --g: 10px; /* gap */
  
  display: flex;
  gap: var(--g);
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.container > * {
  width: var(--s);
  aspect-ratio: cos(30deg);
  border-radius: 50% / 25%;
  corner-shape: bevel;
}Nothing fancy so far. From there, we add a bottom margin to all items to create an overlap between the rows:.container > * {
  margin-bottom: calc(var(--s)/(-4*cos(30deg)));
}The last step is to add a left margin to the first item of the even rows (i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, and so). This margin will create the shift between rows to achieve a perfect grid.Said like that, it sounds easy, but it’s the trickiest part where we need complex calculations. The grid is responsive, so the “first” item we are looking for can be any item depending, on the container size, item size, gap, etc.Let’s start with a figure:Our grid can have two aspects depending on the responsiveness. We can either have the same number of items in all the rows (Grid 1 in the figure above) or a difference of one item between two consecutive rows (Grid 2). The  and  variables represent the number of items in the rows. In Grid 1 we have , and in Grid 2 we have .In Grid 1, the items with a left margin are 6, 16, 26, etc., and in Grid 2, they are 7, 18, 29, etc. Let’s try to identify the logic behind those numbers.The first item in both grids (6 or 7) is the first one in the second row, so it’s the item . The second item (16 or 18) is the first one in the third row, so it’s the item . The third item (26 or 29) is the item . If you look closely, you can see a pattern that we can express using the following formula:…where  is a positive integer (zero excluded). The items we are looking for can be found using the following pseudo-code:for(i = 0; i< ?? ;i++) {
  index = N*i + M*(i - 1) + 1
  Add margin to items[index]  
}We don’t have loops in CSS, though, so we will have to do something different. We can obtain the index of each item using the new  function. The logic is to test if that index respect the previous formula.index = N*i + M*(i - 1) + 1…let’s express  using the index:i = (index - 1 + M)/(N + M)We know that  is a positive integer (zero excluded), so for each item, we get its index and test if  is a positive integer. Before that, let’s calculate the number of items,  and .Calculating the number of items per row is the same as calculating how many items can fit in that row.N = round(down,container_size / item_size);Dividing the container size by the item size gives us a number. If we ` it down to the nearest integer, we get the number of items per row. But we have a gap between items, so we need to account for this in the formula:N = round(down, (container_size + gap)/ (item_size + gap));We do the same for , but this time we need to also account for the left margin applied to the first item of the row:M = round(down, (container_size + gap - margin_left)/ (item_size + gap));Let’s take a closer look and identify the value of that margin in the next figure:It’s equal to half the size of an item, plus half the gap:M = round(down, (container_size + gap - (item_size + gap)/2)/(item_size + gap));

M = round(down, (container_size - (item_size - gap)/2)/(item_size + gap));The item size and the gap are defined using the  and  variables, but what about the container size? We can rely on container query units and use .Let’s write what we have until now using CSS:.container {
  --s: 120px;  /* size  */
  --g: 10px;   /* gap */
  
  container-type: inline-size; /* we make it a container to use 100cqw */
}
.container > * {
  --_n: round(down,(100cqw + var(--g))/(var(--s) + var(--g)));
  --_m: round(down,(100cqw - (var(--s) - var(--g))/2)/(var(--s) + var(--g))); 
  --_i: calc((sibling-index() - 1 + var(--_m))/(var(--_n) + var(--_m)));
  
  margin-left: ???; /* We're getting there! */
}We can use  to test if  is an integer. If it’s an integer, the result is equal to 0. Otherwise, it’s equal to a value between 0 and 1.We can introduce another variable and use the new  function!.container {
  --s: 120px;  /* size  */
  --g: 10px;   /* gap */
  
  container-type: inline-size; /* we make it a container to use 100cqw */
}
.container > * {
  --_n: round(down,(100cqw + var(--g))/(var(--s) + var(--g)));
  --_m: round(down,(100cqw - (var(--s) - var(--g))/2)/(var(--s) + var(--g))); 
  --_i: calc((sibling-index() - 1 + var(--_m))/(var(--_n) + var(--_m)));
  --_c: mod(var(--_i),1);
  margin-left: if(style(--_c: 0) calc((var(--s) + var(--g))/2) else 0;);
}This is a good use case for , but we can do it differently:--_c: round(down, 1 - mod(var(--_i), 1));The  function gives us a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the value we want.  gives us a value between -1 and 0.  gives us a value between 0 and 1, but this time it’s the 1 we need. We apply  to the calculation, and the result will be either 0 or 1. The  variable is now a Boolean variable that we can use directly within a calculation.margin-left: calc(var(--_c) * (var(--s) + var(--g))/2);If  is equal to 1, we get a margin. Otherwise, the margin is equal to 0. This time you don’t need to register the variable using . I personally prefer this method as it requires less code, but the  method is also interesting.Should I remember all those formulas by heart?! It’s too much!No, you don’t. I tried to provide a detailed explanation behind the math, but it’s not mandatory to understand it to work with the grid. All you have to do is update the variables that control the size and gap. No need to touch the part that set the left margin. We will even explore how the same code structure can work with more shapes!The common use case is a hexagon shape but what about other shapes? We can, for example, consider a rhombus and, for this, we simply adjust the code that controls the shape..container > * {
  aspect-ratio: cos(30deg);
  border-radius: 50% / 25%;
  corner-shape: bevel;
  margin-bottom: calc(var(--s)/(-4*cos(30deg)));
}.container > * {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  border-radius: 50%;
  corner-shape: bevel;
  margin-bottom: calc(var(--s)/-2);
}A responsive grid of rhombus shapes — with no effort! Let’s try an octagon:.container > * {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  border-radius: calc(100%/(2 + sqrt(2)));
  corner-shape: bevel;
  margin-bottom: calc(var(--s)/(-1*(2 + sqrt(2))));
}Almost! For an octagon, we need to adjust the  because we need more horizontal space between the items:.container {
  --g: calc(10px + var(--s)/(sqrt(2) + 1));
  gap: 10px var(--g);
}The variable  includes a portion of the size  and is applied as a row gap, while the column gap is kept the same ().From there, we can also get another type of hexagon grid:And why not a grid of circles as well? Here we go:As you can see, we didn’t touch the complex calculation that sets the left margin in any of those examples. All we had to do was to play with the  and  properties to control the shape and adjust the bottom margin to rectify the overlap. In some cases, we need to adjust the horizontal gap.I will end this article with another demo that will serve as a small homework for you:This time, the shift is applied to the odd rows rather than the even ones. I let you dissect the code as a small exercise. Try to identify the change I have made and what’s the logic behind it ( try to redo the calculation steps using this new configuration.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Open Props @custom-media Recipes</title><link>https://css-tricks.com/open-props-custom-media-recipes/</link><author>Geoff Graham</author><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I often forget the exact name of an  query or simply get tired writing something like @media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) over and over again.  will be a nice bit of relief to the ol’ muscle memory because it allows us to create aliases for queries.@custom-media --motionOK (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference);
