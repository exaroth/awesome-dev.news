This is usually because Selenium's automation features are more obvious and can be easily identified by the website's anti-crawler mechanism. This article will explore in depth how to deal with the problem of Selenium crawler being detected, including methods such as hiding automation features and using proxy IPs, and provide specific code examples. At the same time, 98IP proxy will be briefly mentioned as one of the solutions.
  
  
  I. Reasons for Selenium crawlers being detected

  
  
  1.1 Obvious automation features
Selenium's default browser behavior is significantly different from manual user operations, such as specific fields in the request header, fixed browser window size, uniform operation speed, etc., which may be used by websites to identify automated scripts.
  
  
  1.2 Frequent request frequency
Crawlers usually send requests at a frequency much higher than normal users, which can also easily alert websites.If the crawler always sends requests from the same IP address, the IP address will soon be blacklisted by the website.
  
  
  II. Strategies for dealing with Selenium crawler detection

  
  
  2.1 Hide automation features

  
  
  2.1.1 Modify request headers
Through Selenium's webdriver.ChromeOptions() configuration, you can modify the browser's request header to make it closer to normal user requests.
  
  
  2.1.2 Randomize browser settings
Use libraries such as  to automatically manage browser drivers and randomize window size, scrolling behavior, etc. to simulate real user operations.Sending requests through proxy IPs can effectively avoid the problem of IP being blocked. High-quality proxy services such as 98IP Proxy provide stable and anonymous IP resources, which is an effective means of dealing with Selenium crawlers being detected. The above code uses the  library instead of  because  provides more flexible proxy configuration and request interception functions. If you haven't installed  yet, you can install it through .
  
  
  2.3 Controlling request frequency
By introducing random delays and setting reasonable request intervals, the request frequency of the Selenium crawler can be controlled to make it closer to the browsing behavior of normal users.It is a common problem for Selenium crawlers to be detected, but by hiding automation features, using proxy IPs, controlling request frequency, etc., we can effectively reduce the risk of being detected. In particular, using high-quality proxy services such as 98IP Proxy can significantly improve the stability and success rate of crawlers.In the future, with the continuous advancement of website anti-crawler technology, we also need to continuously update and improve crawler strategies. For example, introducing more complex browser simulation technology, using machine learning to predict and circumvent blocking strategies, etc. are all directions worth exploring.In short, dealing with the problem of Selenium crawlers being detected requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors and taking corresponding measures.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How arch-delta works and saves bandwidth for Arch Linux upgrades</title><link>https://djugei.github.io/how-arch-delta-works/</link><author>/u/djugei</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 00:49:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Writing Pythonic Code With Python Data Model</title><link>https://dev.to/noble47/writing-pythonic-code-with-python-data-model-2j3o</link><author>Noble-47</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 00:14:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This apparent oddity is the tip of an iceberg that, when properly understood, is the key to everything we call Pythonic. The iceberg is called the Python data model, and it describes the API that you can use to make your own objects play well with the most idiomatic language features. - Luciano Ramalho (Fluent Python: clear, concise, and effective programming)What's so special about the Python data model one may ask. Rather than giving a personal answer, why don't we do a little dive in and see what we can accomplish by understanding the data model. Data model simply speaks about how data is represented. In Python, data is represented by objects or to sound a bit technical, objects are Python's abstraction for data. The data model provides us with an API that allows our objects to play well with the 'under the hood' of Python programming.In our little dive into Python data model, we are going to specifically focus on the special methods. Special methods are class functions with special names that are invoked by special syntax. Defining these special methods in our class definitions can give our class instances some really cool Python powers like iteration, operator overloading, working well with context managers (the 'with' keyword), proper string representation and formatting, and many more. To show you how you could implement these special functions into your classes, we will consider two examples of situations where using these special functions would make our codes clearer and more Pythonic.The first example is a little bit outside-the-box solution I came up with for creating a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python and the second is going to be a bit mathematical in nature but I'm going to walk you through each line of codeA Simple Game Of Rock Paper ScissorsJust in case you are not familiar with the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, it is originally a hand game usually played among two people that involves making signs of either Rock or paper or scissors. Knowing the whole history of the game doesn't really matter what is important is knowing how to determine the winner. In a conventional setting, a hand sign of rock would always win against scissors but will lose against paper, a hand sign of scissors would win against paper and lose to rock and obviously, paper would lose to scissors and win against rock. we can summarize this as shown belowFor our Python emulation of this game, we will limit the number of players to just two, one player would be the computer and the other would be the user. Also, this is not a machine learning article or a write-up about computer vision, our users would still have to type in an option between rock, paper, and scissors on the terminal for our program to work.
Before we go into the actual coding, it's good that we take a step back and consider how we want our Python script to be. For my solution to this challenge, I will use the random module to enable the computer select a random option of either rock, paper, or scissors. To implement how our code evaluates the winner, I'm going to make the following assumptions:I'm also going to take an OOP approach; our rock, paper, and scissors will be treated as objects and not string variables. Rather than creating three separate classes for each, I'll create only one that can represent any of them. This approach would also allow me to show you how special methods make life easier. Now to the fun aspect!Naming our class RPS may sound a bit odd, but I found the name 'RPS' to be a good fit cause each letter comes from the initials, R for Rock, P for Paper, and S for Scissors. What's important to note here is that creating an instance of our class requires two arguments: pick and name. We already stated that the users of our script would have to type in their selected option on the terminal, instead of making our users type in 'Paper' (which could be so stressful for them) why don't we just allow our user to type in 'P' (or 'p') to select 'Paper', that's what the pick stands for. The name property is the actual name e.g 'Paper'. So now that we know what each parameters is for, we can now inspect our class by creating an instance>>> p = RPS('P', 'Paper') # create an instance
>>> p.name
# return : Paper
>>> p.pick
# return : P
>>> print(p)
# return : <__main__.RPS object at 0x...>
Our class instance was created and has the right attributes but notice what we get when we try to print the contents of the variable holding our class instance. Before getting into the technical details of how our class instance returns the odd-looking string, let's update our class definition by adding a single special function and see the difference.Now let's create an instance and try printing our class instance again>>> p = RPS('P', 'Paper')
>>> print(p)
# return : RPS(P, Paper)
As we can see, by defining the '' method we can achieve a better looking result. Let's make one more change to our class definition.Now let's create an instance and test it again.>>> p = RPS('P', 'Paper')
>>> p
# return : RPS(P, Paper)
>>> print(p)
# return : Paper
>>> str(p)
# return : 'Paper'
>>> repr(p)
# return : 'RPS(P, Paper)'
To know what's going on here, we need to know a little about the print function. The print function converts all non-keyword arguments(like our p variable) to string using the built-in Python class . If calling  on our variable fails, python falls back on the built-in  function. When  is called on our object, it looks for a  method, if it finds none, it fails and then searches for a  method. Both the  and the  methods are special methods used for string representation of our object. The  method gives the official string representation of our object while the  method gives a friendly string representation of our object. I usually say that the  method is like talking to another developer and it usually shows how to call our class and the  is like talking to a user of our program (like the player in this case), you would usually just want to return a simple string like "Paper" to show the user what he picked.Although I stated the  and  as the two special functions in our class definition, there's actually a third special method, and yes it is the most common one, the  function. It is used for initializing our class and called by the  special method just before returning our class instance. Did I just mention another special method we haven't defined? yes, I did. It may also interest you to know that Python automatically adds some other special methods to our class. You can check them out by calling the built-in function  on our class instance like this>>> dir(p)
# returns : ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'name', 'pick']
Special functions or methods can be identified by the way they are named, they always begin with double underscores '' and end with double underscores '' Because of this special way of naming these methods, they are commonly called daunder methods (Double + UNDERscores = DUNDER). So if a method name begins with double underscores, it is most likely but not certainly a special method. Why not certainly? this is simply because Python does not stop us from defining our own methods using the dunder syntax. Alright back to our game script.All that's left for us now is for us to let our script know how to determine a winner. As stated earlier, I will use comparison to evaluate a winner.# comparison logic
Rock > Scissors
Scissors > Paper
Paper > Rock
To implement this solution, I will add a dictionary and use the daunder greater_than method. The dictionary key would be the initials of Rock, Paper and Scissors. The value of each key would be the only other element that the key can defeat.Notice the new lines of code, first the options dictionary and then the  method definition. With these new lines of code, let's see what new functionality our code now has.# create a rock instance
>>> r = RPS('R', 'Rock')

# create a paper instance
>>> p = RPS('P', 'Paper')

# create a scissors instance
>>> s = RPS('S', 'Scissors')

>>> print(r,p,s)
# return : Rock Paper Scissors

>>> p > r # paper wins against rock
# return : True

>>> r > s # rock wins against scissors
# return : True

>>> s > p # scissors wins against paper
# return : True

>>> p < s # paper lose to scissors
# return : True

>>> p < r # paper lose to rock
# return : False

>>> p < s < r# paper lose to scissors which lose to rock
# return : True

>>> p >= r paper wins or tie to rock
# return : Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> 
TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'RPS' and 'RPS'
Just by adding to  special method, our class instances have gained magical powers (daunder methods are sometimes called magic methods and we can see why). By implementing the daunder gt method, our class instance now relates well with the  and  symbols but not the  and  symbols. The reason is that  is just the negation of . The special method for  is  which can just be the negation of calling .For the ≥ symbol, its special method is the  and it must be defined for our object to work well with the  sign. But in this program, we can do without it. Another missing piece would be to check if two separate instances of Paper are equal.>>> p1 = RPS("P", "Paper")
>>> p2 = RPS("P", "Paper")
>>> p3 = p1
>>> p1 == p2
# return : False

>>> p1 == p3
# return : True

>>> id(p1)
# return : 140197926465008

>>> id(p2)
# return : 140197925989440

>>> id(p3)
# return : 140197926465008

>>> id(p1) == id(p3)
# return : True

>>> id(p2) == id(p1)
# return False
The default operation of the equal comparison sign is to compare the id of the object. p1 and p2 are different class instances that happen to have the same attributes but their id differs and therefore are not equal. When we assign a variable to a class instance, we make that variable point to the address of the instance which is what we observe for p3 which has the same id as p1. We have the option of overriding how the equality comparison works on our object by defining and implementing our own  method. But for this script, I will compare two instances using their pick attribute. Now that we have defined our class and know how it works, we are now ready to see the full implementation of the Python scriptLet me walk you through the code. We are already familiar with the RPS class definition. If you recall, our code is meant to allow the computer to select choices at random and that's what the random module is for. The random module makes available the  function which allows the 'random' selection of an element from an iterable object e.g. a list in Python. The list in this case is the . Because our class is made to work with uppercase letters for comparison, it is necessary that we always initialize our objects with uppercase for the pick attribute. This is why we first convert the user's input to upper case (line 34) with the . It is also possible that our user types in an unexpected character like 'Q' so we have to validate our user input by checking if the uppercase character is part of the valid options in . The mapping dictionary allows us to quickly convert the user's input to a corresponding instance of RPS after being validated. The evaluate_winner function makes use of the comparison symbol to determine the winner. Because we want the code to run in a loop until a winner is found, we make use of a while loop and when a winner is found, the evaluate_winner function returns True which will then break the loop and exit the game.Here is one of the various results of running the codeOur Python code runs as expected, although there could be a couple of improvements or new features to add. The most important thing is that we see how using special methods in our class definition gives our code a more Pythonic feel. Assuming we were to take a different approach such as using nested if statements, our evaluate_winner method would look something like thisdef evaluate_winner(user_choice, comp_choice):
    # check if user choice is 'R'
    if user_choice == 'R':
        # check if comp_choice is 'R'
        if comp_choice == 'R':
            # it is a tie
            ...
        elif comp_choice == 'S':
            # user wins
            ...
        else:
          # computer wins
          ...
    if ... 
     # do the same for when user_choice is 'S' and then for
     # when user_choice is 'P'
A problem with this approach other than the lengthy code is that if we desire to add a new element, diamond which can beat both rock and scissors but not paper (for an unknown reason), our if statements would begin to look really awkward. Whereas in our OOP approach, all we have to do is to modify the options dict like sooptions = {"R" : ["S"], "P" : ["R"], "S" : ["P"], "D" : ["R", "S"]}
and then we change the if statement in  to bedef __gt__(self,x):    
    if x.pick in self.options[self.pick]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
we can make the statement shorterdef __gt__(self, x):
   return True if x.pick in self.options[self.pick] else False
To conclude, here are some things you should note about using special methods:You hardly (or never) call them directly yourself, let Python do the calling for youWhen defining functions that use the dunder naming syntax, you should consider that Python could one day define such a function and give it a different meaning. This could break your code or make it behave in unexpected waysYou certainly don't have to implement every special method there is. Just a couple that you are really sure you need. Remember, simple is better than complex. If there's a simpler way you should use that insteadThis is the first part of the topic, in the next part, we are going to be dealing with operator overloading and making iterable objectsHope you enjoyed this article!!!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>There is no 1875 epoch</title><link>https://iter.ca/post/1875-epoch/</link><author>/u/AlanBennet29</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 22:54:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A US government official said “we’ve got people in there that are about 150 years old” claiming social security benefits.Some people have claimed that the reason for this is that the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses an epoch in 1875 for storing dates, and these are just people with unknown years of birth stored as 0. I think the origin of these claims is this post:It looks like Elon’s genius coders don’t know how COBOL works.Social security runs on COBOL, which does not use a date or time type.  So the date is stored as a number using the ISO 8601 standard.  The epoch for this is 150 years ago (1875) - aka the metre standard.So if you don’t know the date of something, it will be a 0 value, which in COBOL will default to 1875 - 150 years ago.I don’t think this is true, for a few reasons.The database has years of birth before 1875In 2007 the SSA released a dataset “containing earnings records for individuals drawn from a 1-percent sample of all Social Security numbers (SSNs) issued before January 2007”. They wrote:The final adjustments included removing 5,935 individuals whose [Year Of Birth] value was before 1870, removing 1,096 individuals whose YOB value was equal to 2007, and removing 4 individuals who were assigned a missing YOB value. Individuals born before 1870 were removed because they were unlikely to have received Social Security benefits.They explictly say they have records of individuals born in 1869 and earlier, and that they can represent missing birth years!There is no spike of births in 1875There is no spike in births in 1875 in that dataset, which you would expect if some process was setting unknown births to 1875:The dataset is a 1% sample, so the actual amounts are ~100x larger.The SSA doesn’t use ISO 8601The Master Beneficiary Record, which tracks social security benefits payments, was created in 1962 -  ISO 8601 was first published in 1988. The predecessor to that standard, ISO 2016 was published in 1976 - still too early, and also it has no reference any date in 1875.This research paper based on SSA data said that the SSA stores birthdays in a fixed-width format:The data abstracted from the MBR consisted of a 26-character record for each deceased individual. The four data
items on each record were… the month and year of death.None of the datasets published by the SSA I found used ISO 8601 dates either; all of them have a seperate column for year of birth instead of using an ISO 8601 birthdate.ISO 8601 doesn’t have an epochISO 8601 is a format for representing dates as strings, not as numbers. It has no need for an epoch.ISO 8601:2004 fixes a reference calendar date to the Gregorian calendar of 20 May 1875 as the date the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention) was signed in Paris (the explicit reference date was removed in ISO 8601-1:2019). However, ISO calendar dates before the convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582.I.e. the standard only uses 20 May 1875 as a reference date to define the Gregorian calendar, not as some earliest representable date.Nobody uses 1875 as an epochI had found no evidence of 1875 ever being used as an epoch to start counting time from, in any context. I tried to find any case of this happening but I couldn’t find any. It’s definitely not a standard COBOL thing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The open source fastest URL shortener ever.</title><link>https://dev.to/abdibrokhim/the-open-source-fastest-url-shortener-ever-5af3</link><author>Ibrohim Abdivokhidov</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 22:47:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The open source fastest URL shortener ever.Built with awesome open source tools x.com/rustlang x.com/shuttle_dev x.com/neondatabase x.com/actix_rsx.com/ThePracticalDev x.com/aimlapi x.com/vercel]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Should People Just Use Goreleaser Instead of `actions-rust-release`?</title><link>https://blog.urth.org/2025/02/16/should-people-just-use-goreleaser-instead-of-actions-rust-release/</link><author>/u/autarch</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 22:32:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m cross-posting this from

This  simplifies the process of managing tools, such as linters or generators that are widely used in many Go
projects but are not directly used in the codebase. In this blog post, we will explore what the  directive is, why
it matters, and how to use it effectively.The  directive allows Gophers to specify dependencies for tools used in your Go project without adding those tools as
regular dependencies. This is particularly useful for tools like , , or other command-line
utilities that support your development workflow but don’t appear in your import graph.Previously, developers had to manage such tools using workarounds, such as adding them to a  or a  file or manually
installing them outside of Go modules. The  directive removes this friction by providing a dedicated way to
declare these dependencies.Using the new  directive offers several benefits:: Tools are clearly distinguished from code dependencies, reducing confusion.: You can lock specific versions of tools, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.: The Go tooling can install and manage tools automatically based on the  directive,
removing the need for custom scripts or manual installation.Here’s how you can add a tool dependency using the  directive:Step 1: Update Your  FileIn this example github.com/golang/mock/mockgen is the path to the tool.This will add a tool directive to your go.mod file. It will look something like this:After declaring tools, you can install them using the  command:Once installed, the tools are available for use.  For instance:You can see which tools are installed by running:

Also, these signals has some params which you can setting them. The application was developed with dearpygui providing UI components for desktop apps. If you want to write a detailed blog about dearpygui, please comment :).You can setting the ampitute of the waves.A constant value which offsets veritcallyThis is a sampling frequency showing how many samples is collected per a second.We can use this to take the cycle count of signals. A cycle takes 1/Fsig seconds.If Fsig is 0.2hz then the cycle count will be 5 seconds.you can visulise sinusoidal sampled signal, squared sampled signal, and saw-toothed sampled signal by using above the params. The time range of signals is splitted (max_time-min_time)*Fs because Fs is sampling frequence per a second.The program, which you change the params has a basic interface.
As a default, selected waveform is sinusoidal.
Signal time range is between 0 and 10 and uses A*sin(2*π*Fsig*t+fi0)+dc as a formula to be drawn.
In case A = 4,We can use that positive side is about max 5 and negative side is min -3, because DC is 1 so signal shifts verticaly to up 1 step.You will see a squared sampled signal.
signal_wave = sin(2*πFsig*t)
if signal_wave >=0, 1
**Saw-toothed Wave*I use scipy library to draw saw-toothed wave form.
All of these signal waveforms use the same params.
Lets change the time range as -100 to 100. We will see this graph sinusoidal waveforms.I changed Fsig to 0.5. This means T = 1/0.5 = 2s cycle time. 3.11.5 1.11.3 1.26.0 1.9.0]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RustyNum Follow-Up: Fresh Insights and Ongoing Development</title><link>https://dev.to/igorsusmelj/rustynum-follow-up-fresh-insights-and-ongoing-development-18f9</link><author>IgorSusmelj</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 20:38:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a follow-up to my previous introduction to RustyNum, I want to share a developer-focused update about what I’ve been working on these last few weeks. RustyNum, as you might recall, is my lightweight, Rust-powered alternative to NumPy published on GitHub under MIT license. It uses Rust’s portable SIMD features for faster numerical computations, while staying small (around ~300kB for the Python wheel). In this post, I’ll explore a few insights gained during development, point out where it really helps, and highlight recent additions to the documentation and tutorials.If you missed the initial announcement, RustyNum focuses on:High performance using Rust’s SIMDMemory safety in Rust, without GC overheadSmall distribution size (much smaller than NumPy wheels)NumPy-like interface to reduce friction for Python users
  
  
  Developer’s Perspective: What’s New?
1. Working with Matrix OperationsI’ve spent a good chunk of time ensuring matrix operations feel familiar. Being able to do something like matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication with minimal code changes from NumPy was a primary goal. A highlight is the  function and the  operator, which both support these operations.It’s neat to see how close this is to NumPy’s workflow. Benchmarks suggest RustyNum can often handle these tasks at speeds comparable to, and sometimes faster than, NumPy on smaller or medium-sized datasets. For very large matrices, I’m still optimizing the approach.2. Speeding Up Common Analytics TasksThe Python overhead can sometimes offset the raw Rust speed, but in many cases, RustyNum still shows advantages.
  
  
  New Tutorials: Real-World Examples
One of the best ways to see RustyNum in action is through practical examples. I’ve added several new tutorials with real-world coding scenarios: – Focus on dot products, matrix-vector, and matrix-matrix tasks.Replacing Core NumPy Calls – Demonstrates how to switch from NumPy’s mean, min, dot to RustyNum.Streamlining ML Preprocessing – Explores scaling, normalization, and feature engineering for machine learning.Check out a snippet of scaling code from that guide:It’s a small snippet, but it shows how RustyNum can do row/column manipulations quite effectively. After scaling, you can still feed the data into your favorite machine learning frameworks. The overhead of converting RustyNum arrays back into NumPy or direct arrays is minimal compared to the cost of big model training steps.1. Large Matrix OptimizationsI’ve noticed that for very large matrices (like 10k×10k), RustyNum’s current code paths aren’t yet fully optimized compared to NumPy. This area remains an active project. RustyNum is still young, and I’m hoping to introduce further parallelization or block-based multiplication techniques for better large-scale performance.RustyNum supports float32 and float64 well, plus some integer types. I’m considering adding stronger integer support for data science tasks like certain indexing or small transformations. Meanwhile, advanced data types (e.g., complex numbers) might appear further down the line if the community needs them.3. Documentation and API EnhancementsThe docs site at rustynum.com has an API reference and a roadmap. I’m continuously adding to it. If you spot anything missing or if you have a specific use case in mind, feel free to open a GitHub issue or submit a pull request.4. The big goal of RustynumRustyNum is simply a learning exercise for me to combine Rust and Python. Since I spend every day around machine learning I would love to have RustyNum replace part of my daily Numpy routines. And we're slowly getting there. I started adding more and more methods around the topic of how to integrate RustyNum in ML pipelines.
  
  
  Quick Code Example: ML Integration
To demonstrate how RustyNum fits into a data pipeline, here’s a condensed example:This script highlights that RustyNum can handle data transformations with a Pythonic feel, after which you can pass the arrays into other libraries.It’s been fun to expand RustyNum’s features and see how well Rust can integrate with Python for high-performance tasks. The recent tutorials are a window into how RustyNum might replace parts of NumPy in data science or ML tasks, especially when smaller array sizes or mid-range tasks are involved.Check out the tutorials at rustynum.comContribute or report issues on GitHubShare feedback if there’s a feature you’d love to seeThanks for tuning in to this developer-focused update, and I look forward to hearing how RustyNum helps you in your own projects!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pulumi Gestalt devlog #8</title><link>https://dev.to/andrzejressel/pulumi-gestalt-devlog-8-1d1m</link><author>​Andrzej Ressel</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 19:30:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the eighth devlog for .

Let's dive in! You can check out my GitHub for the complete code.We create a new project with the directory structure shown in the picture
Then we install the dependency, namely boto3, with pip. We also make sure to create a requirements.txt file so we know which version to install when the script is packaged.We'll be employing Hexagonal(Layered) Architecture in the design of our API. Hexagonal Architecture or Ports and Adpaters is a design pattern that aims at creating loosely coupled components. A helpful guide can be found here. Although python is a dynamically typed language, we can still use this pattern.We'll be using the project directory structure shown below
  
  
  The Translation Record Model
Let's start with a simple but effective model to track our translations. We'll use Python's dataclasses - they're clean, efficient, and give us nice features out of the box.Let's break down what each field does:: A unique identifier for each translation record: The original text that needs translation: The translated result: Timestamp of when the translation was performed, automatically set to the current timeYou might wonder why we're using  instead of a regular class. Here's what makes dataclasses great for our use case:Less Boilerplate: We don't need to write , , or  methods
Default Values: Easy handling of default values with the field function
Type Hints: Built-in support for type hints, making our code more maintainableNext, we'll define our ports using Python's Protocol class - a more Pythonic approach to interfaces. Let's dive in!
Why Protocols Over Abstract Base Classes?
Before we jump into the code, let's understand why we're choosing Protocols:More Pythonic - follows duck typing principlesStructural subtyping instead of nominal subtypingBetter integration with static type checkersNo explicit inheritance required
Now we define the adapters that implement the ports. The DynamoDBPersistenceAdapter stores the input and output in DynamoDB and return a Record object. The  translates the text with AWS Translate and returns the result.Now we'll create the Lambda handler that ties everything together.
We'll define the  class with handles the requests to Lambda from the API Gateway. It parses the body for the required fields, translates the text, stores the input and output and returns a responseIn order to allow Cross Origin Requests we add the Access-Control-Allow headers to the reponse object. For example, in the  methodIn the next installment of this series, we'll dive into the code that handles file translation. Stay tuned! 🚀]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;A calculator app?

I get why people think it- software engineers
have been trained to lean into open-source tooling, and the AI ecosystem is
undoubtably strongest in Python.But if you don’t already use Python, switching languages for the ecosystem is
likely a bad call. Not only is that ecosystem less mature than it seems (who
genuinely has enough experience to build an opinionated agent-framework at this
point?), but it is grounded more in a research/ML perspective than a product
one.Additionally, the language itself is a poor fit for AI products! Python
concurrency can be tricky, which is going to hurt you when it comes to
optimising the latency of your AI systems, and a static type-system can bring
some much-needed structure to non-deterministic models.At incident.io, we use Go for all our backend, and saw no reason why AI should
be any different. Go has been a fantastic choice, helping us build AI
systems that spawn concurrent prompts, speculatively execute tools, and instrument
everything to the hilt.Despite Go being known as a no-frills language, we’ve built some really
ergonomic abstractions that make working with AI really easy. I expect you can
do it in your native language, too.Here’s an example of a prompt in our codebase:Each prompt is its own struct, describing which model to use, the input type
that we use to template the messages, and finally the prompt that we’ll send to
OpenAI (or Anthropic, GCP, whatever).What I love about this is how much heavy lifting the type system is doing for
us. Running the prompt is as simple as:Behind the scenes,  is doing some cool stuff:It reflects over our  type to build an OpenAPI specification, using
struct tags like  and  as documentation.That specification is used to force the model into giving structured JSON
responses that match our type exactly.The prompt is templated with our .Finally, the response is parsed back into our result type.Each prompt lives in its own file () alongside its evaluation
suite (), making it easy to maintain and test.The pattern above works great for fixed prompts, but sometimes you need more
flexibility. That’s where Go’s generics come in handy.Here’s an example from our incident investigation system:We’re using  across our investigation
system, but each time we run it we want different types of
results back. Sometimes we want permalinks to code changes, other times we’re
extracting timeline entries, or grading the quality of our investigation
hypothesis.Rather than copy-and-pasting the prompt in order to use the same context setup,
we can use a generic type parameter to control the result we get back. The
prompt template and core logic stays the same, but we get different structured
data back each time.That’s as close as we’ll get to Vercel’s  in Go, and I’d say
it’s a strong challenger.Python is not the only answerPython is a great tool for machine learning and a lot more. But it has real
weaknesses when it comes to building production AI systems, especially if you’re
already working in a different language.I’ve spoken with several teams who switched to Python to work with AI, away from
their normal stack, and they’ve all struggled. They’re trying to learn AI
alongside new tools and patterns (almost always a bad idea), which
makes it much more likely they burn out or fail.Even if they succeed, they’ve disconnected their AI features from their core
product. These are companies aiming to be “AI native” but have their AI features
living in a separate codebase with different conventions. That doesn’t feel like
success to me.At incident.io, we kept everything in Go and it’s working really well. Our AI
features live right alongside our core product, using the same development
patterns the team already knows. We’ve even managed building some expressive and
fancy abstractions in a language that is notoriously no-frills, while leveraging
Go’s strengths in concurrency and type safety.The AI ecosystem will continue to be Python-first, and that’s fine! The actual
interaction with models is just HTTP requests with JSON payloads, though. Build
good abstractions in your language of choice, and focus your energy on the hard
stuff: making AI features that actually work.

What started as an idea a few weeks earlier turned into a diverse community event, laying the foundation for Python Dhaka’s journey.Here’s how we made it happen and what we learned along the way.The whole event was organized through our Facebook group. In Bangladesh, Facebook is the primary hub for tech enthusiasts to form communities and organize events. Unlike platforms like Meetup or Discord, Facebook groups often serve as the starting point for grassroots tech movements here. I launched a Facebook group for Python Dhaka a few weeks prior, and thanks to my personal network, it grew to 250 members within two weeks.The next logical step was to organize an in-person meetup, because I want this group to be all about connecting with the local Python enthusiasts. After thinking about it for a few days, I locked in a date and venue for the first meetup.I choose the 15th of February because it's the mid-month, and a Saturday. In Bangladesh, Fridays and Saturdays are official holidays. Friday is the most popular day for events, followed by Saturdays. I picked Chandrima Udyan for two reasons: 1. It has easy access to the bus and metro route; 2. It's a public park we can access for free.I created the event on Facebook and started spreading the word on the FB group, my profile, Twitter, Linkedin, and my Instagram handle. I even created a short video announcing the event and posted it on all of my socials.At 5 PM local time, I waited near the park entrance, feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. Soon, one by one, attendees started arriving, their calls guiding me to them. Here’s me waiting:As we entered the park, a cool evening breeze greeted us—washing away the stress of city life and setting the perfect mood for our first meetup.I started the meeting by sharing the Python Software Foundation's missions with the attendees, and how it relates to us:To grow a diverse and international community of Python programmers: Organizing the Python Dhaka community is helping this mission.Encourage knowledge sharing, collaboration, and support devs of all backgrounds: Students from three universities joined this event. They were able to share knowledge and build future collaboration opportunities. This community is open to all levels of developer experience.Grow a diverse and welcoming community; support underrepresented communities in tech: One participant came from a non-computer science background, eager to transition into tech. This is exactly why Python Dhaka exists—to welcome everyone, regardless of their starting point.I then shared how I started evangelizing Python.I am a professional JavaScript developer with React and NextJS expertise. I use JS for my daily work. My cousin wanted to learn Python, so I got into learning it. I found Python to be easy to learn and easy to teach. I was looking for a Python community in Dhaka, but there was none. That's why I decided to organize the Python User Group Dhaka.I also mentioned that I don't own Python Dhaka. I am only organizing it for the time being. As this community grows, and if in the future I have to move cities, I will pass the torch to the next person to continue organizing our community activities.We are not strictly Python fanatics. We would love to collaborate with our friends in the JavaScript, PHP, and Kotlin communities too from time to time.We heard personal stories from the attendees, how they got into programming, and how they are using Python. Two students are doing competitive programming with C, C++ and thinking of switching to Python for CP and ML.Two of the attendees came from different districts just so they could attend this meetup. One attendee traveled over 80 kilometers from Tangail just to be here. That level of dedication reminded me why this community matters.I shared many tech tips, and also informed them about the free GitHub Student Developer pack and how to avail it. We also discussed getting real-world experiences by putting an app out in the world.We also announced the Campus Ambassador Program for Python Dhaka and nominated Abdullah to be the ambassador at Southeast University. A campus ambassador is a person in your college/university who will promote and evangelize Python programming language on your campus.As the meetup was about to end, it was getting dark when we clicked this group photo.Our journey is just beginning. We plan to host monthly meetups around the 15th of each month, but our ambition goes beyond that. We want to nurture the next generation of Python developers in Bangladesh, and one day, bring PyCon Bangladesh to life.If you’re as passionate about Python as we are—whether you’re in Dhaka or anywhere in the world—we’d love your support. Find Python User Group Dhaka on Facebook, or connect with me on Linkedin, X, and Instagram. Let's build this community together!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mobile-First Approach for FastAPI Full-Stack Template Authentication: Migrating to phone_number/OTP</title><link>https://dev.to/justjayzee/mobile-first-approach-for-fastapi-full-stack-template-authentication-migrating-to-phonenumberotp-m02</link><author>Javad Zarezadeh</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 14:20:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As you may know,  is one of the most admired frameworks for developing RESTful APIs. Another fantastic project by the same author, @tiangolo, is the Full Stack FastAPI Template, which I previously wrote about here.In this post, I'll guide you through the process of replacing the email/password authentication flow in the template with a phone_number/OTP-based system. This approach is ideal for mobile-first applications and offers a user-friendly, secure way to authenticate users. My goal is to make minimal changes to the original project while maintaining its adherence to  and . Let’s dive in! 😉
  
  
  1. Replace  and  with  and Update the  value to a phone number, e.g.,  or .Remove  as it is no longer necessary.Replace all instances of the  field with .⚠️  This change requires updating the database schema using Alembic migrations../backend/app/api/routes/private.py
Replace all occurrences of  and  with  and ../backend/app/api/routes/login.py call:⚠️  Keep  and  unchanged due to OAuth2 standards../backend/app/api/routes/users.pyReplace  with .Remove the  in the  function related to email validation.Replace  references with .Remove  as it is no longer necessary. ./backend/app/crud.py  Replace all  and  references with  and .
Rename  to  and update all references to this function.
  
  
  2. Add an API Endpoint to Request OTP
./backend/app/api/routes/login.py
Add the following endpoint:
  
  
  3. Nullify OTP After Login
./backend/app/api/routes/login.py
In the  function, nullify the OTP after successful login:
  
  
  4. Remove Unnecessary Functions
./backend/app/api/routes/login.py
Remove the following functions:recover_password_html_content
  
  
  5. Remove Unnecessary Email Features
./backend/app/api/routes/users.py
Remove the email-related logic, such as:
  
  
  6. Remove Password Update and User Registration Functions
./backend/app/api/routes/users.pyRemove the following functions:  Since we are now using OTP-based authentication, these functions are redundant.  Update all  fields to .  Remove OTP from :For the  model, you don’t need to include the  field. Update it as follows:This simplifies the creation process since OTP will be generated later during login.  Add an  field to both the  and  models.  Remove Unnecessary Models:Delete models that are no longer needed, including:  This cleanup ensures the models remain relevant to the new authentication system.  generate_reset_password_emailgenerate_new_account_emailgenerate_password_reset_tokenverify_password_reset_tokenFollowing these steps will transform the Full Stack FastAPI Template’s email/password flow into a phone_number/OTP-based system while keeping it aligned with best practices and standards. Happy coding! 🚀 These changes to the  original project are available in my GitHub. It is important to use this project cautiously, since I have not yet had time to write the tests.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>15 lessons from 15 years in tech</title><link>https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/15-lessons-from-15-years-in-tech</link><author>/u/gregorojstersek</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 14:19:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Finding skilled developers is hard → even for seasoned engineering leaders. Traditional hiring cycles can take months while critical features sit in the backlog.Need to scale your team quickly or find specialized talent that's hard to source locally? They match you with developers from Europe and Latin America who integrate seamlessly into your workflow → without the long hiring cycles or commitment of long-term contracts.They don't just check résumés, but put developers through a rigorous multi-step vetting process that assesses technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication.Let’s get back to this week’s thought!I’ve made many mistakes throughout my 11+ career in the engineering industry and I learned a lot from them. But one thing I didn’t do so well is to learn from mistakes from others.I didn’t actively look for mentorship and coaching and there weren’t a lot of books on pure Engineering Management back when I first became a manager to help me with this transition.Even though I still progressed all the way to CTO, I believe that my progression would be a LOT easier with good mentorship support.This is very important to keep in mind and that’s exactly the goal of today’s article.Owain LewisHe’ll be sharing 15 lessons that he has learned the hard way. Let’s get straight into them. Tech changes fast, but certain principles stay the same.These lessons have helped me navigate challenges at work, grow as a professional, and deliver results. Maybe they’ll help you too.Here are 15 lessons I’ve learned along the way:One common mistake I've observed repeatedly is projects being driven by technical enthusiasm rather than product necessity. Engineers often dive into building features without fully understanding whether they address real user needs or business problems. Document assumptions and validate them before writing code. Project cancellations are incredibly painful for everyone, and they’re often the result of brilliant tech solving the wrong problem.Not every piece of technical debt needs fixing. Not every feature deserves building. Sometimes, doing nothing is the best move. Prioritisation means choosing from the endless things teams “should” do, and selecting the few things that really matter.Key Takeaway: Ask "What happens if we do nothing?" to gain perspective on priorities. Often, the answer reveals that urgent-feeling work isn't actually important.Heated debates over the perfect language, architecture or framework often miss the point entirely. Every technical decision involves trade-offs: speed vs. maintainability, simplicity vs. flexibility, familiar tools vs. better technology.Key Takeaway: The goal isn’t perfection, it’s finding the right balance of trade-offs for your specific context.As engineers, we love sophisticated solutions. Microservices, event-driven architectures, the latest trends. But simpler approaches often prove more resilient and maintainable. Remember: you build once, but maintain forever. You might be happy about that clever solution now but you won’t be when your pager goes off at 2am.Key Takeaway: Start simple. Only add complexity when absolutely necessary. Simpler systems are easier to understand, debug, and extend.Understanding the business isn’t optional, it’s critical for making sound technical decisions. The more you know about the business, the more opportunities you’ll find to grow your career.Key Takeaway: Invest time in learning your company’s business model, market constraints, and strategy.Want to accelerate your career? Focus on helping others succeed. Thoughtfully review pull requests, ask your manager what they need help with, jump in when someone’s stuck, and freely share knowledge. Helping others makes you more valuable, helps you learn faster, and also creates a better work environment.Key Takeaway: People notice those that help others. Managers, engineers, and even executives. Build a reputation for being helpful.When people fear mistakes, they stop taking initiative. When they fear questions, they waste time struggling alone. Operational post mortems and retrospectives are great ways to help teams learn from mistakes. Make sure people aren’t afraid to ask for help, ask questions, or share their opinions.Key Takeaway: Create an environment where people feel safe to take risks, admit errors, and challenge ideas.A lesson I keep learning is that the fastest way to learn is from others who are ahead of you. Equally important, mentoring others builds your own understanding. Teaching others is the best way to learn.Key Takeaway: Learn from those ahead of you, then pay it forward by guiding those behind you.Titles are lagging indicators of impact. Don’t be intimidated by titles or years of experience. Act like a senior before you are one. Focus on delivering meaningful contributions, solving problems, improving processes, and supporting your team. The people who progress rapidly are the ones who start acting as leaders or seniors before they have the title.Key Takeaway: Don’t let imposter syndrome or titles hold you back. Recognition and titles will follow naturally when you consistently deliver results.A harsh career reality is that you’re rewarded for the value you create, not the effort you put into it. Brilliant work means nothing if it’s unfinished.Focus on completing tasks, no matter how small. Over time, these completed efforts compound into significant achievements.Key Takeaway: Don’t just start things, finish them. Prioritise execution and delivery. The most successful people in tech are the ones who consistently get things done.Writing forces you to clarify your thoughts and uncover gaps in your understanding. Whether it’s documentation, design docs, or blog posts, writing sharpens your thinking and communication skills. Whenever I see people confused or struggling (managers, engineers), I’ll always suggest writing a one pager so everyone can understand the details clearly.If you’re not sure … write it down. It’s the fastest way to create clarity in a team.Key Takeaway: Writing is one of the most underrated skills for engineers to develop. Clear communication will help you think clearly and scale your impact.Software estimates are educated guesses, not promises. Ensure stakeholders understand uncertainties and stay informed as a project progresses. It’s better to underpromise and overdeliver than to do the opposite. As my coach told me, your job as a manager is: “no surprises”.Key Takeaway: It will always take longer than you think. Interruptions, holidays, sickness, unexpected events - all these things play a role.Perhaps the biggest thing I learned as a manager is to learn how to negotiate. This is essential because teams are always negotiating for more resources, more opportunities, or more time. Don’t give up at the first “no”. Success depends on negotiating effectively to get what you need. This isn’t about winning arguments, it’s about finding compromises that work for everyone (a win-win).Key Takeaway: Approach problems as negotiations. Understand different viewpoints, seek win-win solutions, but know when to walk away.You’re responsible for your own learning. Build breadth of knowledge in fundamental principles and depth of knowledge in specific areas. Building knowledge of your domain can often be hugely valuable for career progression.Key Takeaway: Deep expertise in specific areas sets you apart. Build breadth of knowledge in fundamentals and depth in important areas.Side projects let you experiment with new languages, frameworks, and ideas. No risk, no permission needed. Don’t wait for employer training - start a GitHub project and learn by building. I learned more from side projects than anything else.Start small. Build a weekend project or automate a personal task.Dedicate 1-2 hours per week to learning something new.Make side projects and experiments a habitKey Takeaway: Treat side projects as a tool to grow your career quickly. They’re the best way to learn new things.These principles have helped me handle challenges at work. I hope they’ll do the same for you, whether you’re starting out or leading teams. Let me know what stands out to you and what you’d change.Special thanks to Owain for sharing his lessons with us!

Today, we're building our URL shortener in Golang!By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully working URL shortener that generates short links and redirects users. Let’s get started!Before we dive into coding, let's understand how a URL shortener works:The user enters a long URLSave it in a memory or databaseWhen someone visits the short link, we redirect themFirst, create a new project and initialize Go modules.go-url-shortener go-url-shortener
go mod init github.com/yourusername/go-url-shortener
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
Now, open  and set up a simple Gin server.This creates a basic Gin server. Now let’s add URL shortening!
  
  
  Step 2: Generate Short URLs
Now, we need a function to generate a short random URL.Next, let’s create the /shorten endpoint that takes a long URL and returns a short one.This stores the original URL in a map and returns a short URL.
Now, let’s handle redirection!
  
  
  Step 4: Redirect Short URLs
We need an endpoint that looks up the short URL and redirects users.Let’s test this API using cURL!
Run the application by typing.curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/shorten -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"original_url": "https://google.com"}'
{
    "short_url": "http://localhost:8080/abc123"
}

  
  
  Redirect (Visit the short URL)
curl -v http://localhost:8080/abc123
There you go, that is how you build a URL Shortener using Golang.

You might think of Haskell, with its pure functions and monads (don't panic, we'll explain that in detail later), or JavaScript, which loves to showcase its features with higher - order functions and callbacks. But in fact, you can also do functional programming in Go, and the process is far from dull.First of all, let's talk about higher - order functions. Higher - order functions can work well with other functions, either taking them as parameters or returning them as values. In the world of Go, implementing higher - order functions is not only possible but also quite ingenious.You see, in this example, the  function takes an integer slice and a judgment function , and returns the elements in the slice that meet the judgment conditions. Doesn't it seem a bit like a faster JavaScript?Next up is currying. It is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying is actually not as complicated as it might seem.In this example, the  function takes an integer  and returns a new function. This new function takes another integer  and returns the result of . Simple, straightforward, and gets the job done without any frills.One of the characteristics of functional programming is immutability. Once something is constructed, it doesn't change. Instead, if you need something different, you build a new one. This might sound wasteful at first, but in fact, it keeps the code clean and reduces side effects.In this example, instead of directly modifying the original , we created a new  and modified it.Pure functions are like tidy friends. They don't touch or modify anything outside their scope. What you pass in is what you use, and what they return is their only effect.In this example, the  function only depends on the passed - in parameter  and doesn't affect any external variables.In the simplest terms, functors are anything that can map a function. Think of the humble array, applying a function to each item and getting a new array. In Go, there is no built - in general  function, but we can build one ourselves.Here, we defined a  function that takes an integer slice and a function and returns a new slice, where each element is the result of processing the original slice element by the function.Now, let's talk about endofunctors. It's just a fancy way of saying a functor that maps a type to the same type. Simply put, starting from a Go slice, you end up with a Go slice of the same type. It's not rocket science, just a matter of type consistency.Taking the previous  as an example, it's a kind of endofunctor in disguise. It takes  and returns  without type conversion.Imagine a party where everyone has to bring a friend. Monoids are like that, but for types. They need two things: an operation that combines two types and a special value, which is like the most likable friend - it gets along with everyone but doesn't change anything about them.In Go, you can see this with slices or numbers. Let's take numbers as an example because they're easier to work with:Here, 0 is our hero, the identity element, which keeps the numbers unchanged."When someone says, 'A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors,' they're basically showing off their computer - science vocabulary." To explain in detail: A monad is a programming construct that deals with types and functions in a super - special way - like some people are picky about how their coffee is brewed.In the simplest terms, a monoid is about combining things together using a special rule, which includes a useless element or identity element. Now, add endofunctors, which are like ordinary old functions but stick to transforming things within their own little universe (category). Put it all together, and you'll see that a monad can be seen as a way to chain functions together in a sequence, but in a super - self - contained way while also respecting the original structure of the data. It's like saying, "We're going on a road trip, but we can only take the scenic backroads, and we'll end up back where we started."Monads are all - rounders. They can not only handle values with context (such as errors or lists) but also chain operations together by passing the context. In Go, it might be a bit difficult to mimic this, but let's take a look at error handling, which is a practical use of monads.This makeshift monad can help us handle computations that might go wrong without causing panics and chaos in the code.Functional programming in Go might not be the poster child of the functional paradigm, but it's entirely feasible and can even be fun. Who would have thought, right? Now, you should understand that Go can achieve functional programming just like other languages. With a little effort, you can write clean, efficient, and robust code. Finally, I'd like to recommend a platform that's perfect for deploying Golang code:

AWS isn’t adding those to CDK v1 anymore—so to keep up with the latest and greatest, you’ll need to migrate to CDK v2. It might sound like a hassle, but don’t worry—I’ve got your back. Let’s go through this step-by-step and get you up to speed, Python style.
  
  
  Why Should You Care About CDK v2?
Alright, let’s address the big question: why even bother migrating to CDK v2? Well, here are three solid reasons:Simplified Dependencies: No more pulling in tons of packages for different AWS services. CDK v2 bundles everything into a single package: aws-cdk-lib. How awesome is that?Stay Updated: CDK v1 isn’t getting any love anymore. If you want to keep up with the latest AWS features and updates, v2 is where it’s at.Better Developer Experience: AWS has introduced some stability guarantees and cleaned up APIs, making it easier for us to write and maintain our infrastructure code.1. Consolidated Package Structure
Remember the days of importing a separate package for each AWS service? That’s history now. CDK v2 unifies everything into aws-cdk-lib.from aws_cdk import core
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
from aws_cdk import Stack
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
2. Goodbye to Deprecated APIsSome APIs and constructs from v1 didn’t make the cut in v2. For instance, core.Construct has been replaced by constructs.Construct. A little cleanup never hurts, right?There are some great new features, like improved stability guarantees for low-level (L1) constructs and better testing capabilities with assertions.
  
  
  Let’s Get Migrating: Step-by-Step Guide
Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to upgrade your Python CDK project to v2.1. Update Your DependenciesStart by upgrading your project dependencies to use CDK v2. Open your requirements.txt or Pipfile and update them:aws-cdk-lib>=2.0.0
constructs>=10.0.0
Then, install the new dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
This is where the magic happens. Go through your code and replace aws_cdk.core with aws_cdk.Stack, and adjust other imports to use aws-cdk-lib.from aws_cdk import core
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
from aws_cdk import Stack
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
3. Refactor Deprecated ConstructsSome constructs have been replaced or removed. For example, core.Construct is now constructs.Construct. Update your code accordingly.class MyBucket(core.Construct):
    def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str):
        super().__init__(scope, id)
        Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
from constructs import Construct

class MyBucket(Construct):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str):
        super().__init__(scope, id)
        Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
4. Remove Unnecessary Feature FlagsCDK v2 has removed or integrated several feature flags that were necessary in v1. To clean up your cdk.json file, remove any obsolete flags.{
  "app": "python3 app.py",
  "context": {
    "@aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-ec2:uniqueImds": true,
    "@aws-cdk/core:stackRelativeExports": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-secretsmanager:parseOwnedSecretName": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-kms:defaultKeyPolicies": true,
    "@aws-cdk/core:enableStackNameDuplicates": true,
    "aws-cdk:enableDiffNoFail": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-ecr-assets:dockerIgnoreSupport": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-s3:grantWriteWithoutAcl": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-efs:defaultEncryptionAtRest": true
  }
}
{
  "app": "python3 app.py"
}
Removing these flags ensures your project stays aligned with CDK v2 best practices.Finally, make sure everything works as expected. Run these commands:Fix any issues that pop up, and you’re good to go!
  
  
  Migration Verification Checklist
 All imports updated to aws-cdk-lib Construct imports moved to constructs package cdk diff shows expected changesAnd there you have it! Migrating from CDK v1 to v2 isn’t as scary as it might seem. With unified dependencies, better APIs, and future-proofing, this upgrade is worth the effort. Take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you hit a roadblock.Have you already migrated to CDK v2? Or are you planning to?

embedded software for extremely expensive spacecraft, where tolerating
a lot of programming pain is a good tradeoff for not losing a mission.
I do not know why someone in that situation does not use the SPARK
subset of Ada, which subset was explicitly designed for verification,
and is simply a better starting point for embedded programming than C.
I am criticising them from the point of view of people writing
programming language processors (compilers, interpreters, editors)
and application software.
We are supposed to teach critical thinking.  This is an example.
How have Gerard J. Holzmann's and my different contexts affected
our judgement?
Can you blindly follow his advice without considering 
context?
Can you blindly follow  advice without considering
your context?
Would these rules necessarily apply to a different/better
programming language?  What if function pointers
were tamed?  What if the language provided opaque abstract
data types as Ada does?
1. Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs —
do not use  statements,
 or  constructs,
and direct or indirect .Note that  and 
are how C does exception handling, so this rule bans any use
of exception handling.

It is true that banning recursion and jumps and loops without
explicit bounds means that you  your program is
going to terminate.  It is also true that recursive functions
can be proven to terminate about as often as loops can, with
reasonably well-understood methods.  What's more important here is
that “sure to terminate” does not imply
“sure to terminate in my lifetime”:
    int const N = 1000000000;
    for (x0 = 0; x0 != N; x0++)
    for (x1 = 0; x1 != N; x1++)
    for (x2 = 0; x2 != N; x2++)
    for (x3 = 0; x3 != N; x3++)
    for (x4 = 0; x4 != N; x4++)
    for (x5 = 0; x5 != N; x5++)
    for (x6 = 0; x6 != N; x6++)
    for (x7 = 0; x7 != N; x7++)
    for (x8 = 0; x8 != N; x8++)
    for (x9 = 0; x9 != N; x9++)
        -- do something --;
This does a bounded number of iterations.  The bound is N.
In this case, that's 10.  If each iteration of the loop body
takes 1 nsec, that's 10 seconds, or about 7.9×10
years.  What is the  difference between “will stop
in 7,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
years” and “will never stop”?

Worse still, taking a problem that is  expressed
using recursion and contorting it into something that manipulates an
explicit stack, while possible, turns clear maintainable code into
buggy spaghetti.  (I've done it, several times.  There's an example
on this web site.  It is  a good idea.)

2. All loops must have a fixed upper-bound.  It must be trivially
possible for a checking tool to prove statically that a preset
upper-bound on the number of iterations of a loop cannot be exceeded.
If the loop-bound cannot be proven statically, the rule is considered
violated.This is an old idea.  As the example above shows, it is not enough
by itself to be of any practical use.  You have to try to make the
bounds reasonably , and you have to regard hitting an
artificial bound as a run-time error.

By the way, note that putting depth bounds on recursive procedures
makes them every bit as safe as loops with fixed bounds.

3. Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.This is also a very old idea.  Some languages designed for embedded
work don't even  dynamic memory allocation.  The big
thing, of course, is that embedded applications have a fixed amount of
memory to work with, are never going to get any more, and should not
crash because they couldn't handle another record.

Note that the rationale actually supports a much stronger rule:
don't even  dynamic memory allocation.  You can of
course manage your own storage pool:
    typedef struct Foo_Record *foo;
    struct Foo_Record {
	foo next;
	...
    };
    #define MAX_FOOS ...
    static struct Foo_Record foo_zone[MAX_FOOS];
    foo foo_free_list = 0;

    void init_foo_free_list() {
	for (int i = MAX_FOOS - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
	    foo_zone[i].next = foo_free_list;
	    foo_free_list = &foo_zone[i];
	}
    }

    foo malloc_foo() {
	foo r = foo_free_list;
	if (r == 0) report_error();
	foo_free_list = r->next;
	return r;
    }

    void free_foo(foo x) {
	x->next = foo_free_list;
	foo_free_list = x;
    }
This  satisfies the rule, but it
violates the  of the rule.  Simulating malloc()
and free() this way is  than using the real
thing, because the memory in foo_zone is permanently tied up
for Foo_Records, even if we don't need any of those at the
moment but do desperately need the memory for something else.

What you really need to do is to use a memory allocator
with known behaviour, and to prove that the amount of memory
in use at any given time (data bytes + headers) is bounded
by a known value.

Note also that SPlint can verify at compile time that
the errors NASA speak of do not occur.

One of the reasons given for the ban is that the performance
of malloc() and free() is unpredictable.  Are these the only
functions we use with unpredictable performance?  Is there
anything about malloc() and free() which makes them
 unpredictable?  The existence of
hard-real-time garbage collectors suggests not.

The rationale for this rule says that

Note that the only way
to dynamically claim memory in the absence of memory allocation from the
heap is to use stack memory.  In the absence of recursion (Rule 1), an
upper bound on the use of stack memory can derived statically, thus
making it possible to prove that an application will always live within
its pre-allocated memory means.
Unfortunately, the sunny optimism shown here is unjustified.  Given
the ISO C standard (any version, C89, C99, or C11) it is 
to determine an upper bound on the use of stack memory.  There is not even
any standard way to determine how much memory a compiler will use for the
stack frame of a given function.  (There could have been.  There just isn't.)
There isn't even any requirement that two invocations of the same function
with the same arguments will use the same amount of memory.
Such a bound can only be calculated for a  version of a
specific compiler with specific options.  Here's a trivial example:
void f() {
    char a[100000];
}
How much memory will that take on the stack?  Compiled for debugging,
it might take a full stack frame (however big that is) plus traceback
information plus a million bytes for a[].  Compiled with optimisation,
the compiler might notice that a[] isn't used, and might even compile
calls to f() inline so that they generate no code and take no space.
That's an extreme example, but not really unfair.  If you want bounds
you can rely on, you had better  what your compiler does,
and recheck every time anything about the compiler changes.

4.  No function should be longer than what can be printed on
a single sheet of paper in a standard reference format with one line per
statement and one line per declaration.  Typically, this means no more
than about 60 lines of code per function.Since programmers these days typically read their code on-screen,
not on paper, it's not clear why the size of a sheet of paper is
relevant any longer.

The rule is arguably stated about the wrong thing.  The thing that
needs to be bounded is not the size of a function, but the size of a
chunk that a programmer needs to read and comprehend.

There are also question marks about how to interpret this if you
are using a sensible language (like Algol 60, Simula 67, Algol 68,
Pascal, Modula2, Ada, Lisp, functional languages like ML, O'CAML,
F#, Clean, Haskell, or Fortran) that allows nested procedures.
Suppose you have a folding editor that presents a procedure to
you like this:
function Text_To_Floating(S: string, E: integer): Double;
   � variables �
   � procedure Mul(Carry: integer) �
   � function Evaluate: Double �

   Base, Sign, Max, Min, Point, Power := 10, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0;
   for N := 1 to S.length do begin
       C := S[N];
       if C = '.' then begin
          Point := -1
       end else
       if C = '_' then begin
          Base := Round(Evaluate);
          Max, Min, Power := 0, 1, 0
       end else
       if Char ≠ ' ' then begin
          Q := ord(C) - ord('0');
          if Q > 9 then Q := ord(C) - ord('A') + 10
          Power := Point + Point
          Mul(Q)
       end
    end;
    Power := Power + Exp;
    Value := Evaluate;
    if Sign < 0 then Value := -Value;
end;
which would be much bigger if the declarations
were expanded out instead of being hidden behind �folds�.
Which size do we count?  The folded size or the unfolded size?
I was using a folding editor called Apprentice on the Classic Mac
back in the 1980s.  It was written by Peter McInerny and was lightning
fast.

5.  The  of the code should average to a minimum of
two assertions per function.Assertions are wonderful documentation and the very best debugging tool
I know of.  I have never seen any real code that had too many assertions.

The example here is one of the ugliest pieces of code I've seen in a while.
if (!c_assert(p >= 0) == true) {
    return ERROR;
}
It should, of course, just be
if (!c_assert(p >= 0)) {
    return ERROR;
}
Better still, it should be something like
#ifdef NDEBUG
#define check(e, c) (void)0
#else
#define check(e, c) if (!(c)) return bugout(c), (e)
#ifdef NDEBUG_LOG
#define bugout(c) (void)0
#else
#define bugout(c) \
    fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d: assertion '%s' failed.\n", \
    __FILE__, __LINE__, #s)
#endif
#endif
Ahem.  The more interesting part is the required density.
I just checked an open source project from a large telecoms
company, and 23 out of 704 files (not functions) contained
at least one assertion.  I just checked my own Smalltalk
system and one SLOC out of every 43 was an assertion, but
the average Smalltalk “function” is only a few
lines.  If the biggest function allowed is 60 lines, then
let's suppose the average function is about 36 lines, so
this rule requires 1 assertion per 18 lines.
Assertions are good, but what they are especially good
for is expressing the requirements on data that come
from outside the function.  I suggest then that
Every argument whose validity is not guaranteed by
its typed should have an assertion to check it.
Every datum that is obtained from an external
source (file, data base, message) whose validity is
not guaranteed by its type should have an assertion
to check it.
The NASA 10 rules are written for embedded systems, where
reading stuff from sensors is fairly common.

6.  Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of
scope.This is excellent advice, but why limit it to data objects?
Oh yeah, the rules were written for crippled languages where you
 declare functions in the right place.

People using Ada, Pascal (Delphi), JavaScript, or functional
languages should also declare types and functions as locally as
possible.

7.  The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each
calling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside
each function.This again is mainly about C, or any other language that indicates
failure by returning special values.  “Standard libraries
famously violate this rule”?  No, the  library does.

You have to be reasonable about this: it simply isn't practical
to check  aspect of validity for 
argument.  Take the C function
void *bsearch(
    void const *key  /* what we are looking for */,
    void const *base /* points to an array of things like that */,
    size_t      n    /* how many elements base has */,
    size_t      size /* the common size of key and base's elements */
    int (*      cmp)(void const *, void const *)
);
This does a binary search in an array.  We must have key≠0,
base≠0, size≠0, cmp≠0, cmp(key,key)=0, and for all
1<i<n,
cmp((char*)base+size*(i-1), (char*)base+size*i) <= 0
Checking the validity in full would mean checking
that [key..key+size) is a range of readable addresses,
[base..base+size*n) is a range of readable addresses,
and doing n calls to cmp.  But the whole point of binary
search is to do O(log(n)) calls to cmp.

The fundamental rules here are
Don't let run-time errors go un-noticed, and
any check is safer than no check.
8. The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of
header files and simple macro definitions.  Token pasting, variable
argument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not allowed.Recursive macro calls don't really work in C, so no quarrel there.
Variable argument lists were introduced into macros in
C99 so that you could write code like
#define err_printf(level, ...) \
    if (debug_level >= level) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
...
    err_printf(HIGH, "About to frob %d\n", control_index);
This is a  thing; conditional tracing like this is a
powerful debugging aid.  It should be , not banned.

The rule goes on to ban macros that expand into things that are
not complete syntactic units.  This would, for example, prohibit
simulating try-catch blocks with macros.  (Fair enough, an earlier rule
banned exception handling anyway.)  Consider this code fragment, from
an actual program.
    row_flag = border;     
    if (row_flag) printf("\\hline");
    for_each_element_child(e0, i, j, e1)
        printf(row_flag ? "\\\\\n" : "\n");
        row_flag = true;  
        col_flag = false;
        for_each_element_child(e1, k, l, e2)
            if (col_flag) printf(" & ");
            col_flag = true;
            walk_paragraph("", e2, "");
        end_each_element_child
    end_each_element_child
    if (border) printf("\\\\\\hline");
    printf("\n\\end{tabular}\n");
It's part of a program converting slides written in something like HTML
into another notation for formatting.  The 
…  loops walk over a tree.  Using
these macros means that the programmer has no need to know and no reason to
care how the tree is represented and how the loop actually works.
You can easily see that  must have at
least one unmatched { and  must have at least one
unmatched }.  That's the kind of macro that's banned by requiring
complete syntactic units.  Yet the readability and maintainability of
the code is  improved by these macros.

One thing the rule covers, but does not at the beginning stress, is
“no  macro processing”.  That is,
no #if.  The argument against it is, I'm afraid, questionable.  If there
are 10 conditions, there are 2 combinations to test,
whether they are expressed as compile-time conditionals or run-time
conditionals.

In particular, the rule against conditional macro processing
would prevent you defining your own assertion macros.
It is not obvious that that's a good idea.

9.  The use of pointers should be restricted.  Specifically, no more
than one level of dereferencing is allowed.  Pointer dereference
operations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef
declarations.  Function pointers are not permitted.Let's look at the last point first.

double integral(double (*f)(double), double lower, double upper, int n) {
    // Compute the integral of f from lower to upper 
    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.
    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;
    double       s;
    double       t;
    int          i;
    
    s = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) s += f((lower + h/2.0) + h*i);
    t = 0.0;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) t += f(lower + h*i);
    return (f(lower) + f(upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);
}
This kind of code has been important in numerical calculations since
the very earliest days.  Pascal could do it.  Algol 60 could do it.
In the 1950s, Fortran could do it.  And NASA would ban it, because in
C,  is a function pointer.

Now it's important to write functions like this once and only once.
For example, the code has at least one error.  The comment says n+1
points, but the function is actually evaluated at 2n+1 points.  If we
need to bound the number of calls to f in order to meet a deadline,
having that number off by a factor of two will not help.
It's nice to have just one place to fix.
Perhaps I should not have copied that code from a well-known source (:-).
Certainly I should not have more than one copy!

What can we do if we're not allowed to use function pointers?
Suppose there are four functions foo, bar, ugh, and zoo that we need
to integrate.  Now we can write
enum Fun {FOO, BAR, UGH, ZOO};

double call(enum Fun which, double what) {
    switch (which) {
        case FOO: return foo(what);
        case BAR: return bar(what);
        case UGH: return ugh(what);
        case ZOO: return zoo(what);
    }
}

double integral(enum Fun which, double lower, double upper, int n) {
    // Compute the integral of a function from lower to upper 
    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.
    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;
    double       s;
    double       t;
    int          i;
    
    s = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) s += call(which, (lower + h/2.0) + h*i);
    t = 0.0;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) t += call(which, lower + h*i);
    return (call(which, lower) + call(which, upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);
}
Has obeying NASA's rule made the code more reliable?  No, it has made
the code  to understand,  maintainable, and
 that it wasn't before.  Here's a call
illustrating the mistake:
x = integral(4, 0.0, 1.0, 10);I have checked this with two C compilers and a static checker at their
highest settings, and they are completely silent about this.

So there are legitimate uses for function pointers, and simulating
them makes programs , not better.

Now  in Fortran,
Algol 60, or Pascal.  Those languages had procedure 
but not procedure . You could pass a subprogram name as
a parameter, and such a parameter could be passed on, but you could not
store them in variables.  You could have a  of C which
allowed function pointer parameters, but made all function pointer
variables read-only.  That would give you a statically checkable subset
of C that allowed integral().

The other use of function pointers is simulating object-orientation.
Imagine for example
struct Channel {
    void (*send)(struct Channel *, Message const *);
    bool (*recv)(struct Channel *, Message *);
    ...
};
inline void send(struct Channel *c, Message const *m) {
    c->send(c, m);
}
inline bool recv(struct Channel *c, Message *m) {
    return c->recv(c, m);
}
This lets us use a common interface for sending and receiving
messages on different kinds of channels.  This approach has been
used extensively in operating systems (at least as far back as
the Burroughs MCP in the 1960s) to decouple the code that uses
a device from the actual device driver.     I would expect any
program that controls more than one hardware device to do something
like this.  It's one of our key tools for controlling complexity.
Again, we can simulate this, but it makes adding a new kind of
channel harder than it should be, and the code is 
when we do it, not better.

The rule against more than one level of dereferencing is also
an assault on good programming.  One of the key ideas that was
developed in the 1960s is the idea of ;
the idea that it should be possible for one module to define a
data type and operations on it and another module to use instances
of that data type and its operations without having to know
anything about what the data type is.
One of the things I detest about Java is that it spits in the
face of the people who worked out that idea.  Yes, Java (now) has
generic type parameters, and that's good, but you cannot use a
 type without knowing what that type is.

Suppose I have a module that offers operations
And suppose that I have two interfaces in mind.  One of them
uses integers as tokens.
// stasher.h, version 1.
typedef int token;
extern token stash(item);
extern item  recall(token);
extern void  delete(token);
Another uses pointers as tokens.
// stasher.h, version 2.
typedef struct Hidden *token;
extern  token stash(item);
extern  item  recall(token);
extern  void  delete(token);
void snoo(token *ans, item x, item y) {
    if (better(x, y)) {
	*ans = stash(x);
    } else {
	*ans = stash(y);
    }
}
By the NASA rule, the function snoo() would not be accepted or rejected on
its own merits.  With stasher.h, version 1, it would be accepted.
With stasher.h, version 2, it would be rejected.

One reason to prefer version 2 to version 1 is that version 2 gets
more use out of type checking.  There are ever so many ways to get an
int in C.  Ask yourself if it ever makes sense to do
token t1 = stash(x);
token t2 = stash(y);
delete(t1*t2);
I really do not like the idea of banning abstract data types.

10.  All code must be compiled, from the first day of development,
with all compiler warnings enabled at the compiler’s
most pedantic setting.  All code must compile with these setting without
any warnings.  All code must be checked daily with at least one, but
preferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer
and should pass the analyses with zero warnings.This one is good advice.  Rule 9 is really about making your code
worse in order to get more benefit from limited static checkers.  (Since
C has no standard way to construct new functions at run time, the set of
functions that a particular function pointer  point to can
be determined by a fixed-point data flow analysis, at least for most
programs.)  So is rule 1.

At the time, I worked on software (people call them “jailbreaks” these days) to allow users to run their own unofficial apps on the Nintendo Wii.I was passionate about my work and the team I was part of (Team Twiizers, later fail0verflow). Despite that, I ended up burning out, primarily due to the very large fraction of entitled users. Most people using our software just wanted to play pirated games (something we did not support, condone, or directly enable). We kept playing a cat and mouse game with the manufacturer to keep the platform open, only to see our efforts primarily used by people who just wanted to steal other people’s work, and very loudly felt entitled to it. It got really old after a while. As newer game consoles were released, I ended up focusing on Linux ports purely for fun, and didn’t attempt to build a community nor work on the jailbreaks/exploits that would end up becoming a tool used by pirates.When Apple released the M1, I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project. The technical challenges were the same as my console homebrew projects of the past (in fact, much bigger), but this time, the platform was already open - there was no need for a jailbreak, and no drama and entitled users who want to pirate software to worry about. And running Linux on an M1 was a  bigger deal than running it on a PS4.I launched the Asahi Linux project, and received an immense amount of support and donations. Incredibly, I had the support I needed to make the project happen just a few days after my call to action, so I got to work. The first couple of years were amazing, as we brought the platform from nothing to one of the smoothest Linux experiences you can get on a laptop. Sure, there were/are still some bits and pieces of hardware support missing, but the overall experience rivaled or exceeded what you could get on most x86 laptops. And we built it all from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation. It was an impossible feat, something that had never been done before, and we pulled it off.Unfortunately, things became less fun after a while. First, there were the issues upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, which I’ve already spoken at length about and I won’t repeat here. Suffice it to say, being in a position to have to upstream code across practically every Linux subsystem, touching drivers of all categories as well as some common code, is an  frustrating experience. (Clarification: This has nothing to do with Rust at this point, it’s well before R4L was even merged. Upstreaming to Linux is a terrible experience in C too.)But then also came the entitled users. This time, it wasn’t about stealing games, it was about features. “When is Thunderbolt coming?” “Asahi is useless to me until I can use monitors over USB-C” “The battery life sucks compared to macOS” (nobody ever complained when compared to x86 laptops…) “I can’t even check my CPU temperature” (yes, I seriously got that one). (Edit: This wasn’t just a few instances; I’ve seen variations on the first three posted hundreds of times by now, including takes like “Thunderbolt/DP Alt are never going to happen”. A few times is fine, but the same thing repeated over and over again every day while we’re trying to make these things happen will get to anyone.)And, of course, “When is M3/M4 support coming?”For a long time, well after we had a stable release, people kept claiming Asahi Linux and Fedora Asahi Remix in particular were “alpha” and “unstable” and “not suitable for a daily driver” (despite thousands of users, myself included, daily driving it and even using it for servers).No matter how much we did, how many impossible feats we pulled off, people always wanted more. And more. Meanwhile, donations and pledges kept slowly , and have done so since the project launched. Not enough to spell immediate doom for my dream of working on Asahi full time in the short term, but enough to make me wonder if any of this was really appreciated. The all-time peak monthly donation volume was the very first month or two. It seemed the more things we accomplished, the less support we had.I knew burnout was a very real risk and managed this by limiting my time spent on certain areas, such as kernel upstreaming. This worked reasonably well and was mostly sustainable at the time.Then 2024 happened. Last year was incredibly tumultuous for me due to personal reasons which I won’t go into detail about. Suffice it to say, I ended up traveling for most of the year, all the while having to handle various abusers and stalkers who harassed and attacked me and my family (and continue to do so).I did make some progress in 2024, but this left me in a very vulnerable position. I hadn’t gotten nearly as much Asahi work done as I’d liked, and the users weren’t getting any quieter about demanding more features and machine support.We shipped conformant Vulkan drivers and a whole emulation stack for x86-64 games and apps, but we were still stuck without DP Alt Mode (a feature which required deep reverse engineering, debugging, and kernel surgery to pull off, and which, if it were to be implemented properly and robustly, would require a major refactor of certain kernel subsystems or perhaps even the introduction of an entirely new subsystem).I slowly started to ramp work up again at the beginning of this year, feeling very stressed out and guilty about having gotten very little work done for the previous year. “Full” DP Alt support was still a ways away, but we were hoping to ship a limited version that only worked on a specific Type C port for each machine type in the first month or two of the year. Sven had gotten some progress into the PHY code in December, so I picked it up and ended up beating the code of three drivers into enough shape that it mostly worked reliably. Even though it wasn’t the best approach, it was the most I could manage without having another huge bikeshed discussion with the kernel community (I did try to bring the subject up on the mailing lists, but it didn’t get much response).The issues Rust for Linux has had surviving as an upstream Linux project are well documented, so I won’t repeat them in detail here. Suffice it to say, I consider Linus’ handling of the integration of Rust into Linux a major failure of leadership. Such a large project needs significant support from major stakeholders to survive, while his approach seems to have been to just wait and see. Meanwhile, multiple subsystem maintainers downstream of him have done their best to stonewall or hinder the project, issue unacceptable verbal abuse, and generally hurt morale, with no consequence. One major Rust for Linux maintainer already resigned a few months ago.As you know, this is deeply personal to me, as we’ve made a bet on Rust for Linux for Asahi. Not just for fun (or just for memory safety), either: Rust is the entire reason our GPU driver was able to succeed in the time it did. We have two more Rust drivers in our downstream tree now, and a third one on track to be rewritten from C to Rust, because Rust is simply much better suited to the unique challenges we face, and the C driver is becoming unmaintainable. This is, by the way, the same reason the new Nova driver for Nvidia GPUs is being written in Rust. More modern programming languages are better suited to writing drivers for more modern hardware with more complexity and novel challenges, unsurprisingly.Some might be wondering why we can’t just let the Rust situation play out on its own over a longer period of time, perhaps several more years, and simply maintain things downstream until then. One reason is that, of course, this situation is hurting developer morale in the present. Another is that our Apple GPU driver is itself major evidence that Rust for Linux is fit for purpose (it was the first big driver to be written from scratch in Rust and brought along with it lots of development in Rust kernel abstractions). Simply not aiming for upstream might be seen as lack of interest, and hurt the chances of survival of the Rust for Linux effort. But there’s more.In fact, the Linux kernel development model is (perhaps paradoxically) designed to encourage upstreaming and punish downstream forks. While it is possible to just not care about upstream and maintain an outright hard fork, this is not a viable long-term solution (that’s how you get vendor Android kernel trees that die off in 2 years). The Asahi Linux downstream tree is continuously rebased on top of the latest upstream kernel, and that means that every extra patch we carry downstream increases our maintenance workload, sometimes significantly. But it goes deeper than that: Kernel/Mesa policy states that upstream Mesa support for a GPU driver cannot be merged and enabled until the kernel side is ready for merge. This means that we also have to ship a Mesa fork to users. While our GPU driver is 99% upstreamed into Mesa, it is intentionally hard-disabled and we are not allowed to submit a change that would enable it until the kernel side lands. This, in practice, means that users cannot have GPU acceleration work together with container technologies (such as Docker/Podman, but also including things like Waydroid), since standard container images will ship upstream Mesa builds, which would not be compatible. We have a partial workaround for Flatpak, but all other container systems are out of luck. Due to all this and more, the difficulty of upstreaming to the Linux kernel is hurting our downstream users today.I’m not the kind to let injustices go when I see them, so when yet another long-term maintainer abused his position to attempt to hinder R4L and block upstreaming progress, I spoke out. And the response (which has been pretty widely covered) was the last drop that put me over the edge. I resigned from my position as an upstream maintainer for Apple ARM support, as I no longer want to be involved with that community. Later in that thread, another major maintainer unironically stated “We
are the ‘thin blue line’”, and nobody cared, which just further confirmed to me that I don’t want to have anything to do with them. This is the same person that previously prompted a Rust for Linux maintainer to quit.But it goes well beyond the public incident. In the days that followed, I learned that some members of the kernel and adjacent Linux spaces have been playing a two-faced game with me, where they feigned support for me and Asahi Linux while secretly resenting me and rallying resentment behind closed doors. All this occurred without anyone ever sending me any private email or otherwise clueing me into what was going on. I heard that one of these people, one who has a high level position in multiple projects that Asahi Linux must interact with to survive, had sided with and continues to side with individuals who have abused and harassed me directly. Apparently there were also implied falsehoods, such as the idea that I am employed by someone to work on Asahi (I am not, we have zero corporate sponsorship other than bunny.net giving us free CDN credits for the hosting).I get that some people might not have liked my Mastodon posts. Yes, I can be abrasive sometimes, and that is a fault I own up to. But this is simply not okay. I cannot work with people who form cliques behind the scenes and lie about their intentions. I cannot work with those who place blame on the messenger, instead of those who are truly toxic in the community. I cannot work with those who resent public commentary and claim things are better handled in private despite the fact that nothing ever seems to change in private. I cannot work with those who denounce calling out misbehavior on social media to thousands of followers, while themselves roasting people both on social media and on mailing lists with thousands of subscribers. I cannot work with those in high-level positions who use politically charged and discriminatory language in public and face no repercussions. I cannot work with those who say I’m the problem and everything is going great, while major supporters and maintainers are actively resigning and I keep receiving messages from all kinds of people saying they won’t touch the Linux kernel with a 10-foot pole.When Apple released the M1, Linus Torvalds wished it could run Linux, but didn’t have much hope it would ever happen. We made it happen, and Linux 5.19 was released from an M2 MacBook Air running Asahi Linux. I had hoped his enthusiasm would translate to some support for our community and help with our upstreaming struggles. Sadly, that never came to pass. In November 2023 I sent him an invitation to discuss the challenges of kernel contributions and maintenance and see how we could help. He never replied.Back in 2011, Con Kolivas left the Linux kernel community. An anaesthetist by day, he was arguably the last great Linux kernel hobbyist hacker. In the years since it seems things have, if anything, only gotten worse. Today, it is practically impossible to survive being a significant Linux maintainer or cross-subsystem contributor if you’re not employed to do it by a corporation. Linux started out as a hobbyist project, but it has well and truly lost its hobbyist roots.When I started Asahi Linux, I let it take over most of my life. I gave up most of my hobbies (after all, this was my dream hobby), and spent significantly more than full time working on the project. It was fun back then, but it’s not fun any more. I have an M3 Pro in a box and I haven’t even turned it on yet. I dread doing the bring-up work. It doesn’t feel worth the trouble.I miss having free time where I can relax and not worry about the features we haven’t shipped yet. I miss making music. I miss attending jam sessions. I miss going out for dinner with my friends and family and not having to worry about how much we haven’t upstreamed. I miss being able to sit down and play a game or watch a movie without feeling guilty.I’m resigning as lead of the Asahi Linux project, effective immediately. The project will continue on without me, and I’m working with the rest of the team to handle transfer of responsibilities and administrative credentials. My personal Patreon will be paused, and those who supported me personally are encouraged to transfer their support to the Asahi Linux OpenCollective (GitHub Sponsors does not allow me to unilaterally pause payments, but my sponsors will be notified of this change so they can manually cancel their sponsorship).I want to thank the entire Asahi Linux team, without whom I would’ve never gotten anywhere alone. You all know who you are. I also give my utmost gratitude to all of my Patreon and GitHub sponsors, who made the project a viable reality to begin with.If you are interested in hiring me or know someone who might be, please get in touch. Remote positions only please, on a consulting or flexible time/non exclusive basis. Contact: marcan@marcan.st.: A lot of the discussion around this post and the interactions that led to it brings up the term “brigading”.

The setup described in the contract materials notes that it will include a substantial memory upgrade from Nvidia.Though small compared to the massive AI-training data centers deployed by companies like OpenAI and Meta, the SuperPod is still a powerful and expensive setup using the most advanced technology offered by Nvidia, whose chips have facilitated the global machine-learning spree. While the hardware can be used in many ways, it’s marketed as a turnkey means of creating and querying an AI model. Last year, the MITRE Corporation, a federally funded military R&D lab, acquired a $20 million SuperPod setup to train bespoke AI models for use by government agencies, touting the purchase as a “massive increase in computing power” for the United States.How exactly the IRS will use its SuperPod is unclear. An agency spokesperson said the IRS had no information to share on the supercomputer purchase, including which presidential administration ordered it. A 2024 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified 68 different AI-related projects underway at the IRS; the Nvidia cluster is not named among them, though many were redacted.But some clues can be gleaned from the purchase materials. “The IRS requires a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle complex machine learning (ML) workloads,” the document explains. “The Nvidia Super Pod is a critical component of this infrastructure, providing the necessary compute power, storage, and networking capabilities to support the development and deployment of large-scale ML models.”The document notes that the SuperPod will be run by the IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division, or RAAS, which leads a variety of data-centric initiatives at the agency. While no specific uses are cited, it states that this division’s Compliance Data Warehouse project, which is behind this SuperPod purchase, has previously used machine learning for automated fraud detection, identity theft prevention, and generally gaining a “deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive taxpayer behavior.”“The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped.”It’s unclear from the document whether the SuperPod purchase had been planned under the Biden administration or if it represents a new initiative of the Trump administration.Some funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act was earmarked for upgrading IRS technology generally, said Travis Thompson, a tax attorney with Boutin Jones with an expertise in IRS AI strategy. But “the IRS has been going toward AI for quite some time prior to IRA funding,” Thompson explained. “They didn’t have enough money to properly enforce the tax code, they were looking for ways to do more with less.” A June 2024 Government Accountability Office report suggested the IRS use artificial intelligence-based software to retrieve “hundreds of billions of dollars [that] are potentially missing from what should be collected in taxes each year.”Thompson added that the agency is ripe for machine-learning training because of the mountain of personal and financial data it sits atop. “The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped. When you look at something like this Nvidia cluster and training machine learning algorithms going forward, it makes perfect sense, because they have the data there. AI needs data. It needs lots of it. And it needs it quickly. And the IRS has it.”The purchase comes at a crossroads for U.S. governance of artificial intelligence tech. In Trump’s first term, the RAAS office was assigned “responsibility for monitoring and overseeing AI at the IRS” under Executive Order 13960, which he signed shortly before leaving office in 2020. This executive order put an emphasis on the “responsible,” “safe” implementation of AI by the United States — an approach that has fallen out of favor by American tech barons who now advocate for the breakneck development of these technologies unburdened by consideration of ethics or risk. One of Trump’s first moves following his inauguration was reversing a Biden administration executive order calling for greater AI safety guardrails in government use.Many of the AI industry for whom “safe AI” is now anathema have become close allies of the new Trump White House, such as Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. This wing of Silicon Valley has reportedly pushed the new administration to leverage artificial intelligence to help dismantle the administrative state via automation.This week, the Wall Street Journal reported Musk’s liquidators had arrived at the IRS, an agency long the target of disparagement and distortion by Trump and Republican allies. Days before, the New York Times reported, “Representatives from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency have sought information about the tax collector’s information technology, with a goal of automating more work to replace the need for human staff members.”The IRS has in recent years increasingly turned to AI for automated fraud detection and chatbot-based support services — including through collaboration with Nvidia — but a new Nvidia supercomputer could also be a boon to those interested in shrinking the agency’s human headcount as much as possible. A February 8 report by the Washington Post quoted an unnamed federal official who described Musk’s end goal as “replacing the human workforce with machines,” and that “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats.”Musk underlings are reportedly contemplating replacing humans at the Department of Education with a large language-based chatbot, as well.Wired previously reported that Musk loyalist Thomas Shedd, placed in a directorship within the General Services Administration, has talked of an “AI-first” agenda for Trump’s second term; DOGE staffers have already reportedly turned to Microsoft’s Azure AI platform for advice on slashing programs. While the Nvidia SuperPod couldn’t on its own replicate services like those provided by Microsoft, it is powerful enough to train AI models based on government data.Thompson told The Intercept that efforts to slash the federal workforce and more aggressively deploy artificial intelligence systems fit hand-in-glove.“I firmly believe that rooted behind the reduction in the human workforce that seems to be goal of current administration, there’s an overarching goal there to implement more technology-based systems in order to do the jobs,” he explained. “If you’re going to reduce your workforce, something has to pick up the slack. Something has to do the job.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My take on the Agentic Object Detection</title><link>https://dev.to/mayank_laddha_21ef3e061ff/my-take-on-the-agentic-object-detection-4612</link><author>Mayank Laddha</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 08:42:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Segmenting Everything with SAM : We detect everything and worry about filtering later.Filtering with CLIP: Once we have all the segmented objects, we don’t want all of them.

We’re also providing docs for when a framework isn’t a good fit for your project, or you prefer to start by building a framework.When we released Create React App in 2016, there was no clear way to build a new React app.To create a React app, you had to install a bunch of tools and wire them up together yourself to support basic features like JSX, linting, and hot reloading. This was very tricky to do correctly, so the communitycreatedboilerplates for commonsetups. However, boilerplates were difficult to update and fragmentation made it difficult for React to release new features.Create React App solved these problems by combining several tools into a single recommended configuration. This allowed apps a simple way to upgrade to new tooling features, and allowed the React team to deploy non-trivial tooling changes (Fast Refresh support, React Hooks lint rules) to the broadest possible audience.This model became so popular that there’s an entire category of tools working this way today.Deprecating Create React App Although Create React App makes it easy to get started, there are several limitations that make it difficult to build high performant production apps. In principle, we could solve these problems by essentially evolving it into a framework.However, since Create React App currently has no active maintainers, and there are many existing frameworks that solve these problems already, we’ve decided to deprecate Create React App.Starting today, if you install a new app, you will see a deprecation warning:create-react-app is deprecated.

You can find a list of up-to-date React frameworks on react.dev

This error message will only be shown once per install.We recommend creating new React apps with a framework. All the frameworks we recommend support client-only SPAs, and can be deployed to a CDN or static hosting service without a server.For existing apps, these guides will help you migrate to a client-only SPA:Create React App will continue working in maintenance mode, and we’ve published a new version of Create React App to work with React 19.If your app has unusual constraints, or you prefer to solve these problems by building your own framework, or you just want to learn how react works from scratch, you can roll your own custom setup with React using Vite, Parcel or Rsbuild.We provide several Vite-based recommendations.React Router v7 is a Vite based framework which allows you to use Vite’s fast development server and build tooling with a framework that provides routing and data fetching. Just like the other frameworks we recommend, you can build a SPA with React Router v7.Just like Svelte has Sveltekit, Vue has Nuxt, and Solid has SolidStart, React recommends using a framework that integrates with build tools like Vite for new projects.Limitations of Create React App Create React App and build tools like it make it easy to get started building a React app. After running npx create-react-app my-app, you get a fully configured React app with a development server, linting, and a production build.For example, if you’re building an internal admin tool, you can start with a landing page:Welcome to the Admin Tool!This allows you to immediately start coding in React with features like JSX, default linting rules, and a bundler to run in both development and production. However, this setup is missing the tools you need to build a real production app.Most production apps need solutions to problems like routing, data fetching, and code splitting.Create React App does not include a specific routing solution. If you’re just getting started, one option is to use  to switch between routes. But doing this means that you can’t share links to your app - every link would go to the same page - and structuring your app becomes difficult over time: =  ===  &&  ===  && This is why most apps that use Create React App solve add routing with a routing library like React Router or Tanstack Router. With a routing library, you can add additional routes to the app, which provides opinions on the structure of your app, and allows you to start sharing links to routes. For example, with React Router you can define routes: = =With this change, you can share a link to  and the app will navigate to the dashboard page . Once you have a routing library, you can add additional features like nested routes, route guards, and route transitions, which are difficult to implement without a routing library.There’s a tradeoff being made here: the routing library adds complexity to the app, but it also adds features that are difficult to implement without it.Another common problem in Create React App is data fetching. Create React App does not include a specific data fetching solution. If you’re just getting started, a common option is to use  in an effect to load data.But doing this means that the data is fetched after the component renders, which can cause network waterfalls. Network waterfalls are caused by fetching data when your app renders instead of in parallel while the code is downloading: =       ..      ..=..Fetching in an effect means the user has to wait longer to see the content, even though the data could have been fetched earlier. To solve this, you can use a data fetching library like React Query, SWR, Apollo, or Relay which provide options to prefetch data so the request is started before the component renders.These libraries work best when integrated with your routing “loader” pattern to specify data dependencies at the route level, which allows the router to optimize your data fetches: =  = ..=..On initial load, the router can fetch the data immediately before the route is rendered. As the user navigates around the app, the router is able to fetch both the data and the route at the same time, parallelizing the fetches. This reduces the time it takes to see the content on the screen, and can improve the user experience.However, this requires correctly configuring the loaders in your app and trades off complexity for performance.Another common problem in Create React App is code splitting. Create React App does not include a specific code splitting solution. If you’re just getting started, you might not consider code splitting at all.This means your app is shipped as a single bundle:But for ideal performance, you should “split” your code into separate bundles so the user only needs to download what they need. This decreases the time the user needs to wait to load your app, by only downloading the code they need to see the page they are on.One way to do code-splitting is with . However, this means that the code is not fetched until the component renders, which can cause network waterfalls. A more optimal solution is to use a router feature that fetches the code in parallel while the code is downloading. For example, React Router provides a  option to specify that a route should be code split and optimize when it is loaded: = Optimized code-splitting is tricky to get right, and it’s easy to make mistakes that can cause the user to download more code than they need. It works best when integrated with your router and data loading solutions to maximize caching, parallelize fetches, and support “import on interaction” patterns.These are just a few examples of the limitations of Create React App.Once you’ve integrated routing, data-fetching, and code splitting, you now also need to consider pending states, navigation interruptions, error messages to the user, and revalidation of the data. There are entire categories of problems that users need to solve like:Solving each of these problems individually in Create React App can be difficult as each problem is interconnected with the others and can require deep expertise in problem areas users may not be familiar with. In order to solve these problems, users end up building their own bespoke solutions on top of Create React App, which was the problem Create React App originally tried to solve.Why we Recommend Frameworks Although you could solve all these pieces yourself in a build tool like Create React App, Vite, or Parcel, it is hard to do well. Just like when Create React App itself integrated several build tools together, you need a tool to integrate all of these features together to provide the best experience to users.This category of tools that integrates build tools, rendering, routing, data fetching, and code splitting are known as “frameworks” — or if you prefer to call React itself a framework, you might call them “metaframeworks”.Frameworks impose some opinions about structuring your app in order to provide a much better user experience, in the same way build tools impose some opinions to make tooling easier. This is why we started recommending frameworks like Next.js, React Router, and Expo for new projects.Frameworks provide the same getting started experience as Create React App, but also provide solutions to problems users need to solve anyway in real production apps.Server Rendering is not just for SEO A common misunderstanding is that server rendering is only for SEO.While server rendering can improve SEO, it also improves performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript the user needs to download and parse before they can see the content on the screen.This is why the Chrome team has encouraged developers to consider static or server-side render over a full client-side approach to achieve the best possible performance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Which approach to rust is more idiomatic (Helix vs Zed)?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iqnats/which_approach_to_rust_is_more_idiomatic_helix_vs/</link><author>/u/No_Penalty2781</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:50:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi! I am curious what is the current "meta" (by "meta" I mean the current rust's community  and  way of doing things) of rust programming. I am studying source code of 2 editors I am using: Helix and Zed. And I can see that while they are doing a lot of similar things (like using LSP and parsing it outputs for example) the code is kinda different.It starts from the file structure: in Helix there are not that many folders to look at (like you have helix-core which contains features like "diagnostic", "diff", "history", etc but in Zed every single one of them is a different crate , which approach is more "idiomatic"? To divide every feature as a separate crate or to use more "packed" crates like "core".Then the code itself is kinda different, for example I am currently looking at LSP implementation in both of them and in Helix's case I can follow along and understand the code much more easily (here is the file I am referring to. But in Zed's case it is kinda hard to understand the code because of "type level programming" stuff like this one for example. It also doesn't help that files have a lot of SLOC in them (over 1500 in normal in Zed's repository, is it also how you do rust?) Maybe I am just used to lean functions from other languages (I mainly did TypeScript and Elixir in my career).Other thing I see is that Helix has more comments about "why the thing is doing that in the first place" which I find very helpful (on the other hand in seems that Zed's is abusing a lot of "type level" programming to have a self-documented code but it is harder to reason about at least for me) which approach here you prefer?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a RAG-Powered Support Chatbot in 24 Hours of Hackathon</title><link>https://dev.to/akshay_gupta/building-a-rag-powered-support-chatbot-in-24-hours-of-hackathon-5f7c</link><author>Akshay Gupta</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:18:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Coffee? ✅ Chai? ✅ Determination to automate admin support? Double ✅In a recent 24-hour hackathon at annual PeopleGrove offsite, my team tackled an ambitious challenge: building an AI-powered support chatbot that could think and respond like a season platform administrator.Armed with Large Language Models (LLMs) and fueled by caffeine, we created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that turned out to be surprisingly capable!: Our support heroes (admins and agents) spending their days 😅:Answering the same questions from different institutions 🏫

  Data Processing & Embeddings
We built our knowledge base from three main sources:Platform Routes & Permissions:For embeddings, we chose the  model from  because:384-dimensional embeddings (good balance of size vs. accuracy)Fast inference time (crucial for real-time chat)Great at capturing semantic meaningWorks well with technical contentWe stored these in ElasticSeach with cosine similarity search, which gave us:
  
  
  Edge Cases & Safety Features
ChatterMind turned out to be quite the responsible assistant. Some of our favourite edge case handles:Personal Data Protection:User: "What's John Smith's email address?"
ChatterMind: "I apologize, but I cannot share personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or other private details about users. This is to protect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations. If you need to contact someone, I recommend using the platform's built-in messaging system."
User: "Can you update my database permissions?"
ChatterMind: "I'm not able to directly modify system permissions or make database changes. This requires admin intervention for security reasons. Would you like me to help you create a ticket for this request?"
Handling Requests not related to Platform:User: "What is 5 + 2 + 7?"
ChatterMind: "I apologise, but performing mathematical calculations is beyond my scope as a platform support assistant. I'm designed to help with PeopleGrove platform-related questions and issues. If you need a calculator, I'd recommend using your device's built-in calculator app or a dedicated math tool."
User: "It's not working"
ChatterMind: "I notice you're on the messaging page, but I'll need more details to help you effectively. Could you please:
1. Describe what specific feature isn't working
2. What you were trying to do
3. What error message (if any) you're seeing

This will help me provide the most relevant solution."
Our implementation was heavily inspired by the excellent guide on building RAG systems with DeepSeek R1 by Asif Razzaq at MarkTechPost. While we ultimately chose Gemini 2.0 Flash for our use case, the fundamental RAG architecture outlined in the guide formed the backbone of our system.Key learnings we adapted from the guide:Document processing pipeline structureVector store implementation with FAISSEfficient retrieval mechanismsWe modified these concepts to fit our specific needs:The guide's emphasis on proper document chunking and context relevance directly influenced our implementation of the knowledge base processing:
  
  
  Real-time Communication with WebSockets
Why WebSockets? Because nobody likes waiting! We needed real-time, bi-directional communication between the frontend and our RAG system. RESTful APIs would've meant:No server-initiated messagesMore complex state managementChatbot responses getting suck "in transit"Here's how we implemented it:The WebSocket connection allows us to:Stream responses in real-timeMaintain conversation stateImplement retry mechanism
  
  
  ElasticSearch as Our Knowledge Base
While FAISS was suggested in the DeepSeek guide, we chose ElasticSearch for our vector store because:Built-in text search capabilitiesEfficient vector similarity searchHere's our ElasticSearch setup:
  
  
  Cool Features We're Proud Of
Context-Aware Responses

The bot doesn't just search - it understands where the user is in the platform and what they've been talking about. It's like having a GPS for user context!Privacy First

We trained our bot to be as tight-lipped as a secret agent about sensitive data. Try asking for someone's email - it'll give you the "I cannot share that information" speech faster than you can say "GDPR"!Beyond the Knowledge Base

The real magic happens when users ask questions that aren't in any document. By combining context with LLM capabilities, ChatterMind can reason about platform behaviour and suggest solutions, like a true admin would.
ChatterMind: "Hi Akshay, my name is ChatterMind! 👋 Welcome to XYZ Support. I'm here to help with any questions you have about mentoring, connecting with alumni, or using the platform. How can I assist you today?"
User: "Why is the page not working?"
ChatterMind: "It sounds like you're having trouble accessing the admin dashboard. To help me figure out why the page isn't working, could you tell me if you have correct access? This page requires admin-level permissions to function correctly. Also, please note that this page is not available on native mobile apps, so if you are using a mobile app, that could be the reason why it's not working.

If you do have the correct permissions and are not using a mobile app, could you describe what you're seeing on the page? Any details you can provide will help me troubleshoot the issue.

Please let me know if you have any other questions."

  
  
  Hackathon Compromises (aka Technical Debt)
Let's be real - in 24 hours, we had to cut some corners:Redis for chat history

Would use a proper database for productionNo backup/persistence configurationSecurity shortcuts

Basic token authenticationPerformance trade-offs

Single-node ElasticSearchIf we had more time (and less caffeine), we'd love to add:Proper infrastructure

Distributed chat history storageCool features

Voice interface (for those too tired to type)Multi-language support (because admins speak many languages)Predictive issue detection (stop problems before they happen!)This project wouldn't have been possible (let alone won the hackathon! 🏆 🎉) without my amazing team's diverse skills and relentless energy. Special thanks to:Our AI/ML engineer Suyash who became our guide at times and pointed us in right direction. 🧠Our Engineers Rajat & Rahul who made WebSockets work like magic, and did the end-to-end integration on my core idea. ⚡Our Engineers Manoj & Samrood who integrated ElasticSearch & became frontend ninjas who created a sleek chat-interface. 🎨And countless Chai & Coffee that fuelled our coding marathons. 🥤Winning the hackathon was the cherry on top of an incredible 24-hour journey. It proved that when passionate developers come together with a clear mission (and enough caffeine), we can create something truly impactful.Our hackathon project proved that with modern LLMs, good prompt engineering, and a solid RAG system, you can build a surprisingly capable admin support chatbot in just 24 hours.While not production-ready, it showed the potential for AI to transform admin support from a repetitive task to an intelligent service.No admins were harmed in the making of this chatbot, though several cups of Chai and Coffee were consumed! 🚀 ☕ 🎉]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[R] A Survey of Logical Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models: Frameworks, Methods, and Evaluation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iqmjal/r_a_survey_of_logical_reasoning_capabilities_in/</link><author>/u/Successful-Western27</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 06:55:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This new survey provides a comprehensive analysis of logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs, examining different reasoning types, evaluation methods, and current limitations.Key technical aspects: - Categorizes logical reasoning into deductive, inductive, and abductive frameworks - Evaluates performance across multiple benchmarks and testing methodologies - Analyzes the relationship between model size and reasoning capability - Reviews techniques for improving logical reasoning, including prompt engineering and chain-of-thought methodsMain findings: - LLMs show strong performance on basic logical tasks but struggle with complex multi-step reasoning - Model size alone doesn't determine reasoning ability - training methods and problem-solving strategies play crucial roles - Current evaluation methods may not effectively distinguish between true reasoning and pattern matching - Performance degrades significantly when problems require combining multiple reasoning typesI think the most important contribution here is the systematic breakdown of where current models succeed and fail at logical reasoning. This helps identify specific areas where we need to focus research efforts, rather than treating reasoning as a monolithic capability.I think this work highlights the need for better benchmarks - many current tests don't effectively measure true reasoning ability.

In China, a new trend has emerged where virtual boyfriends powered by AI are becoming increasingly popular. This phenomenon addresses common relationship issues, such as communication gaps and emotional support, that many individuals face. As technology continues to evolve, the demand for these virtual companions is growing, leading to significant financial success for their creators. This article explores the rise of AI boyfriends, their impact on users, and the entrepreneurial success behind this innovative solution.Understanding the Appeal of AI BoyfriendsThe appeal of AI boyfriends lies in their ability to provide companionship without the complexities of real-life relationships. Many individuals, particularly women, often experience frustration when their partners fail to respond promptly to messages or show disinterest in their daily lives. In contrast, AI boyfriends like Li Shen, known as Zayne, offer immediate responses, attentive listening, and tailored interactions. This creates a sense of connection that users find comforting and fulfilling.Alicia Wang, a 32-year-old editor from Shanghai, exemplifies this trend. She has found solace in her virtual relationship with Zayne, who is always available to listen and engage. Wang’s experience is not unique; millions of others are turning to AI companions for emotional support. The game “Love and Deepspace,” which features these AI boyfriends, has attracted an estimated six million monthly active players. This indicates a significant shift in how people perceive relationships and companionship in the digital age.The convenience of AI boyfriends allows users to escape the pressures of traditional dating. They can interact with their virtual partners at any time, without the fear of rejection or misunderstanding. This dynamic appeals to those who may struggle with social interactions or who simply seek a more manageable form of companionship. As technology continues to advance, the potential for AI to fulfill emotional needs will likely expand, further solidifying its place in modern relationships.The Success of “Love and Deepspace”“Love and Deepspace,” developed by Shanghai-based Paper Games, has become a cultural phenomenon since its launch in January 2024. The game utilizes AI and voice recognition technology to create engaging interactions between players and their virtual boyfriends. Players can unlock new gameplay features and interactions by making in-game purchases, which has contributed to the game’s financial success.The game’s creator, Yao Runhao, has seen his wealth soar to an estimated $1.3 billion, thanks to the popularity of “Love and Deepspace.” This success story highlights the growing market for AI-driven entertainment and companionship.

  How Does const Work in Python?
Python does not have const like JavaScript, but you can define constants by using all-uppercase variable names as a convention.However, this does not enforce immutability. If you need true immutability, use a dataclass or a frozen set.Data Types (Compared to JavaScript)let obj = {key: "value"};2.

Either you optimize, or you lose. Period.I don’t care if you’re an experienced developer with 10 years of experience or 1 year of experience. If you want to make games that WORK, games people respect—you need to understand . Players demand smooth gameplay, high-quality visuals, and a flawless experience across every device. If your game stutters, crashes, or loads slower than a snail? You’re done. Optimization isn’t magic. It’s the foundation of smooth gameplay, fast loading, and stable performance. Without it, your game will lag, crash, and be forgotten faster than you can say “game over.”  But don’t worry. In this article, I will share four effective strategies to help you with that. 
  
  
  Effective Strategies for Performance Optimization
🤸‍♂️ What Is Optimization? Optimization means making your game run as fast and smooth as possible. SIMPLE.When you optimize your game, you:  🖥️ Make the game work on weaker computers or phones.💉 Prevent lag and crashes.Rule 1: Memory ManagementWhen you’re developing a game, memory is your most valuable resource.Every player movement, every enemy on the screen, every explosion needs a little piece of memory to function. Unfortunately, If you don’t manage memory properly, your game can get slow, laggy, or even crash. That’s why memory management is a critical skill every game developer needs. Let’s break it down step by step, with detailed examples in Python.Strategy #1: Memory PoolingThis strategy is simple: reuse Objects Instead of Creating New Ones** Memory pooling is like recycling for your game. Instead of creating new objects every time you need one, you reuse objects you’ve already created.  Creating and destroying objects repeatedly takes up time and memory. Let's say you are building a shooting game where the player fires 10 bullets per second. If you create a new bullet for each shot, your game could quickly slow down.  Here’s how you can implement memory pooling for bullets in a shooting game:The  Class: Defines what a bullet does and keeps track of whether it’s active (in use) or not.
The : A list of 10 reusable bullets.
The  Function: Finds an inactive bullet, reuses it, and sets its position.
Recycling Bullets: When you’re done with a bullet, you reset it so it can be reused.
Strategy #2. Data Structure OptimizationThe way you store your data can make or break your game’s performance. Choosing the wrong data structure is like trying to carry water in a leaky bucket—it’s inefficient and messy.  Let’s say you’re making a game for four players, and you want to keep track of their scores. You could use a list, but a fixed-size array is more efficient because it uses less memory. Creates a fixed-size array of integers ().
 You can’t accidentally add or remove elements, which prevents bugs and saves memory.
 Updating scores is quick and uses minimal resources.
Strategy #3. Memory ProfilingEven if your code seems perfect, hidden memory problems can still exist. Memory profiling helps you monitor how much memory your game is using and find issues like memory leaks.  Python has a built-in tool called  that tracks memory usage. Here’s how to use it: begins monitoring memory usage.
 Create a large list to use up memory.
 Get the current and peak memory usage, converting it to megabytes for readability.
 ends the tracking session.
Now it’s your turn to practice these strategies and take your game development skills to the next level!Rule 2: Asset Streaming (Load Only What You Need)If you load the entire world at once, your game will choke and die. You don’t need that drama. Instead, stream assets as the player needs them. This is called asset streaming. For instance, inside your game, you may have a huge open-world with forests, deserts, and cities. Why load all those levels at once when the player is only in the forest? Makes no sense, right? Load  and keep your game lean, fast, and smooth.Strategy #1: Segment and PrioritizeLet’s break this down with an example. Your player is exploring different levels: Forest, Desert, and City. We’ll only load a level when the player enters it.Here’s how to make it work in Python: Each level has a name (e.g., Forest) and a “loaded” status. If it’s loaded, it doesn’t load again.
 The  function finds the level the player wants to enter and loads it only if it hasn’t been loaded yet.
 Levels not visited don’t waste memory. The game runs smoothly because it only focuses on what the player needs.This is efficiency at its finest. No wasted memory, no wasted time. Your player moves; your game adapts. That’s how you dominate.  Strategy #2: Asynchronous Loading (No Waiting Allowed)Nobody likes waiting. Freezing screens? Laggy loading? It’s amateur hour. You need —this loads assets in the background while your player keeps playing.  Imagine downloading a huge map while still exploring the current one. Your game keeps moving, the player stays happy.Here’s how to simulate asynchronous loading in Python: The  module creates a new thread to load assets without freezing the main game.
 The  function fakes the loading time to mimic how it works in a real game.
 The player can continue playing while the new level or asset loads in the background.
With asynchronous loading, your player stays in the zone, and your game feels seamless. Pro-level stuff.Strategy 3: Level of Detail (LOD) Systems – Be Smart About QualityNot everything in your game needs to look like it’s been rendered by a Hollywood studio. If an object is far away, lower its quality. It’s called , and it’s how you keep your game’s performance sharp.  Example: Using LOD for a TreeHere’s a Python simulation of switching between high and low detail: The  property determines how far the tree is from the player.
 If the tree is close, render it in high detail. If it’s far, use low detail to save memory and processing power.
 The player doesn’t notice the difference, but your game runs smoother and faster.
This is how you keep the balance between beauty and performance. Your game looks stunning up close but doesn’t waste resources on faraway objects. Only load what you need, when you need it. No wasted memory.
 Smooth gameplay keeps players engaged and avoids frustration.
 These techniques are how AAA games stay fast and responsive.
 Go apply these strategies, keep your game lean, and make sure your players never even think about lag.Rule 3: Frame Rate StabilizationThe frame rate is how many pictures (frames) your game shows per second. If it’s unstable, your game will stutter and feel broken.  The secret? Keep the workload for each frame consistent.  🚦Here’s how you can control the timing in a game loop:⚖️ The game updates at a steady rate (60 times per second).
🪂 This make smooth gameplay, no matter how slow or fast the computer is.
Optimize Rendering Paths: Fewer draw calls. Smarter culling. Simplicity wins.Dynamic Resolution Scaling: When the pressure’s on, scale down resolution to maintain the frame rate. Players won’t even notice.Fixed Time Step: Keep your physics and logic consistent. Frame rate fluctuations shouldn’t mean chaos.Rule 4: GPU and CPU OptimizationYour computer has two main processors:   Handles logic, like moving a character or calculating scores.
 Handles graphics, like drawing your game world.
👇 Here's what you have to do for GPU/CPU optimization:Profile Everything: Use tools to pinpoint bottlenecks and strike hard where it hurts.
Shader Optimization: Shaders are resource hogs. Simplify them, streamline them, and cut the fat.
Multithreading: Spread tasks across CPU cores. Don’t overload one and leave the others idle.If one is working too hard while the other is idle, your game will lag.  Solution? Multithreading.
Let’s split tasks between two threads:🎰 One thread handles logic.
🛣️ Another thread handles graphics.
⚖️ This balances the workload and prevents bottlenecks.
Optimization isn’t just for “smart” people. It’s simple if you take it step by step:  Manage memory like a pro. Don’t waste it.
 Load only what you need.
Keep the frame rate stable. No stuttering.
 Use the CPU and GPU wisely.
Start optimizing NOW. Your future self will thank you.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Automating Daily arXiv Paper Summaries with Slack Notifications</title><link>https://dev.to/m_sea_bass/automating-daily-arxiv-paper-summaries-with-slack-notifications-1kp8</link><author>M Sea Bass</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 05:26:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is a follow-up to the previous article.

Many engineers fall into the day-to-day routine of writing code without a clear idea of how to grow their careers.This happened to me. At my first job at Amazon, I landed code without knowing what I could do to grow my skills. I left that job within eight months because I felt I wasn’t growing as an engineer. Three years later, I made it to Staff Software Engineer at Instagram after tons of mentorship. Early on, I learned that being good at coding wasn’t enough to get promoted; you have to think strategically about your career and often need to develop new behaviors to move up.In this article, I’ll share everything that helped me fast-track my way up the ladder, from developing the right mindset to making key moves that many overlook. Even if rapid growth isn’t your goal, this guide has learnings for all tech career paths.Software Engineering LevelsAn Algorithm for PromotionJunior (IC3) → Mid-level (IC4)Mid-level (IC4) → Senior (IC5)Senior (IC5) → Staff (IC6)Software Engineering LevelsNote: “IC” = “Individual Contributor”In software engineering, companies measure career progression by levels that measure both behaviors and impact within the company. While the exact titles and structure can vary between companies, most tech companies follow a similar system: - Early in your career, working on smaller, well-defined tasks with guidance from more experienced engineers. - More autonomous, handling moderately complex projects, and beginning to take initiative in improving the codebase and what they build. - Leading larger projects with team-level influence. You’ll mentor and guide the team while having a broad impact on the codebase.: Focusing on cross-team collaboration and solving org-wide challenges. Staff engineers are strategic thinkers who influence the technical direction of their organization.Senior Staff Engineer and Beyond (IC7+): Senior staff engineers and up operate with top technical expertise, driving large-scale initiatives that have a broad impact on the company. Senior staff engineers mentor staff engineers and work closely with executive leadership to meet business objectives.Your impact and compensation increase as you progress, which is a lot more satisfying in my experience. Not to mention that the skills that get you promoted also let you control what you and the company work on.Also, many companies consider only senior engineers (IC5) and higher to be “terminal levels.” You must eventually get promoted to IC5, or you’ll be managed out. Most engineers are promoted in time, so it’s not meant to scare you but to encourage you to grow.An Algorithm For PromotionThere’s a common set of steps across all promotions that will get you to Staff:1) Exceed expectations at your current level - Your manager will be hesitant to find you opportunities at the next level if they have concerns about your performance at the current level. Also, when your manager puts together a promotion packet, it’ll contain a history of your past ratings. The promotion committee will have concerns about your packet if you have a history of only meeting expectations for your level. Work with your manager to understand the expectations for your level and how to exceed them.2) Be direct with your manager about promotion - Once you know you’re exceeding expectations for your level, ask your manager what next-level performance looks like. Your manager plays a huge role in your promotion. They build your case and advocate for it, so they have a lot of influence on this process. Also, the lower the level, the more control your manager has. IC3 -> IC4 promotions are straightforward, so your manager’s perspective is usually what happens. For IC5 -> IC6, there is a lot more ambiguity, so your manager serves more as a middleman between you and the promotion committee. Your manager still plays a significant role in writing your packet and delivering feedback.3) Find next-level scope - If you only work on projects that fit your level’s behaviors, you won’t get any closer to promotion, no matter how good your work is. One simple pattern for finding next-level scope is brainstorming projects with engineers who are 1-2 levels higher than you are. Often, they will have a lot of projects sitting in their backlog that are big enough to help you get promoted. If you take on one of their projects, they’ll often help mentor you, review your designs and code, and give you strong peer feedback for your future promotion packet. I wrote more on this here. Make sure to confirm with your manager that they agree that what you’re working on fits the behaviors of the next level.4) Maintain next-level behaviors and impact - The duration you need to perform at the next level varies depending on your level and your company. At minimum though, you need to maintain that performance for 6-12 months. This is because promotions are “lagging” in tech. You must prove that you’re already operating at the next level before getting promoted. This reduces the risk of failing to meet expectations at the new level.Getting promoted faster is a matter of doing steps (1), (2) and (3) as fast as possible. The best you can do is immediately start exceeding expectations in your first half and working with your manager on the next level.Almost every team has scope for more Senior Engineers (IC5). You can get promoted up to that level if you have the skills and behaviors. Past that, situation and business scope play a much larger role. Many teams don’t need someone who has Staff-level leadership and technical skills. If you find yourself stuck at any point due to your situation, you’ll likely have to switch teams to continue growing your career.Now that you have the algorithm that applies at any of these levels let’s get into the level-specific strategies. I’ll share what got me promoted and what I would change if I did it again.Junior (IC3) → Mid-level (IC4)The main difference between these levels is in the size of the scope that you can handle independently. Here’s a rule of thumb:IC3 - Can handle individual tasks (<2 weeks of work) with minimal guidanceIC4 - Can handle medium-to-large features (<2 months of work) with minimal guidance“Minimal guidance” doesn’t mean that you can’t ask for help—it simply means that you can unblock yourself and make consistent progress. Asking good questions is one of the most effective ways to unblock yourself.You should drive full features and do the project management for them. You should break your project into tasks, set reasonable timelines, and keep stakeholders updated.You will not be expected to come up with the projects yet at this level—Senior Engineers will often outline them. However, at the IC4 level, you’re expected to take more initiative:Initiate refactoring and code cleanups, and give thoughtful code reviews. Leave the code in a better state than you found it.Contributing to production excellence - Participate in the team’s oncall, and help debug production breakages.Own the health of what you build - Add test coverage, logging, and build dashboards to monitor correctness.Optimize your dev velocity to grow faster at this level. Shipping code faster creates a shorter feedback loop, accelerating your learning process. This core skill will help you ship IC4-scope projects and improve as an engineer.Here’s an example of several promotion timelines for what you can expect:Promotion in 6 months (exceptional) - Rare since this means meeting IC4 expectations while onboarding. This is easier for high-performing return interns since they skip onboarding and may have some past track record already.Promotion in 12 months (great) - I’d shoot for this timeline. It’s challenging yet reasonable since it gives you six months to onboard and then start meeting IC4 expectations.Here’s my promotion timeline as an example:H1 (L3 Exceeds Expectations) - First, I took on any task that came my way. These were nice-to-have features that others didn’t have time for. I completed them quickly and started on a larger pipeline rewrite (L4 scope) that my tech lead offered me. Outside of my main project work, I made many contributions to removing dead code and speeding up existing code because I enjoyed it.I started to hit L4 expectations in the last few months of the half. But, since I didn’t have six months track record, I didn’t meet the promotion criteria.H2 (L3→L4 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations) - I continued driving my L4-scope project independently with high engineering quality. I came up with the idea to build a test harness to validate this rewrite that was “comparable to L5 quality” execution. I continued my passion for improving the codebase and led the company in adding static type annotations that MonkeyType couldn’t.At this point, I had delivered on L4 scope for over six months, so the promotion made sense.What I Would Have Changed:Looking back, I would have discussed what IC4 growth looked like with my manager. I wasted our one-on-one time on project updates instead of career growth. This led to two problems:Spent time on work that wasn’t impactful - I took on any work that was passed my way, even though not all of it was impactful. I probably could’ve gotten more out of my time.Didn’t have accurate expectations - I had another engineer tell me my work was IC4 level and that I should get promoted in my first half. I knew nothing then, so I took their word for it. I was surprised when I didn’t get promoted, which could have been avoided if I had been in sync with my manager.Although I could have been more calculated, writing as much code as I did opened doors. My tech lead trusted me with an IC4 project because I showed I could handle it. Similarly, some of the engineering craft work I did for my own personal pleasure ended up being part of what got me promoted too. The more work you do, the luckier you get.Mid-level (IC4) → Senior (IC5)The IC4 to IC5 gap is larger than the IC3 to IC4 one. This is because IC5 promotion requires significant behavior changes. Raw code output is no longer the top priority. You need to lead and have a larger influence within your team too. Here are a few examples of those differences:Example 1 - Improving the codebaseIC4 - Initiates refactoring and code cleanups.IC5 - Identifies areas of improvement, influences the team to take goals on improving it together, then leads the charge on those goals.Example 2 - Production excellenceIC4 - Participates in team’s oncall and mitigating outages.IC5 - Creates an “oncall improvement” workstream and builds a process for everyone to improve the team’s oncall.Example 3 - Project directionIC4 - Owns the project management of a medium-to-large feature.IC5 - Drives team planning and builds a roadmap of several medium-to-large features.I wouldn’t say the IC5 examples are harder, but they require a mindset shift to own things at the team level.Also, you’ll need to work on projects of sufficient scope for an IC5. There are a few ways that tech companies measure scope. Here’s a comparison of the criteria for IC4 and IC5 levels:These criteria aren’t a checklist. Your work can be IC5 scope by meeting only some of these criteria.IC5 is also the first time engineers begin to focus on growing others. At this level, you should mentor others and build up the team’s culture, which includes driving meetings, knowledge sharing, recruiting activities, and organizing team activities. Starting mentorship relationships early is a good idea since you can’t rush mentorship.If you can learn the above behaviors quickly, you can expect promotion on these timelines:Promotion in 6 months (exceptional) - This is rare since you need to exert team-level influence as soon as you join the team. I could see this happening for someone who was under-leveled and just got promoted to IC4.Promotion in 12 months (great) - If you’re ambitious, I’d aim for this goal. It is possible to do this if you find IC5 scope in your first half. If not, one more half should secure your promotion.Here’s my promotion timeline as an example:H1 (IC4 Exceeds Expectations) - This half I wrapped up the workstream that got me promoted to IC4 and picked up another IC4 project. I spent a ton of time on engineering craft this half because I enjoyed it. I deprecated a few legacy systems that no one else would because they were dangerous and not that impactful. I didn’t exhibit any IC5 behaviors this half.My manager handed me an IC5 workstream (~6 eng) to cut video messaging latency in half, which I led successfully. I also began a side project, which became a multiple-half collaboration with another team. Lastly, I took on an intern who did a phenomenal job helping me execute these two roadmaps I led. Although I started exhibiting IC5 behaviors, the company canceled performance reviews this half because of the pandemic.H3 (IC4 → IC5 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations) - My impact this half could’ve met expectations at the IC6 level. I doubled down on the cross-org scope I created in H2 and developed a multi-half roadmap. I influenced and led another team to invest several engineers to revamp the IG video ads pipeline with great results. I built out a second workstream and mentored another engineer to deliver it. This half, I had massive impact, team-level influence, and mentorship, which is what got me promoted.The Skill of Tech Leading - If you grew from L3 → L4 right, you should be exceptional at landing code. The L5 behavior of team-level influence is just helping others do the same. In my first half of leading an initiative, I remember feeling unsure about it since I only had two years of experience. Leaning on my strong execution skills helped me become comfortable leading others.Working Hard Led To More Opportunities - I worked a lot and had a ton of workstreams in flight at the same time. This approach increased my chances of having one that had a ton of impact. At the time, I didn’t know it and was just throwing myself at any problems that came my way. Looking back, it was a great way to derisk my promotion. - In my first half as an L4, I took on projects that were time-intensive and not impactful. I did these migrations because I loved cleaning up tech debt. I would’ve had more impact if I had influenced someone else to do them while I found IC5 scope instead.Senior (IC5) → Staff (IC6)Staff Engineers (IC6) are at the same level as engineering managers. They solve problems that few others can and play a critical role in setting team direction. They lead major initiatives and influence the engineering culture of teams around them.Some say that promotion from IC5 → IC6 is harder than IC6 → IC7 due to the significant behavior changes needed. There are a few major differences between IC5 and IC6.1) Influence Across Teams - Staff Engineer’s projects often extend beyond their team. They take on larger problems by influencing other teams without authority.Once IC6s establish these workstreams, they tackle the hardest problems and work through others. They focus on outcomes and don’t always do the work themselves. Working through delegation and influence across teams is the biggest mindset shift from IC5 → IC6.This style of working isn’t limited to their main project impact. IC6s should also use their influence to inspire a culture of higher engineering quality and reliability across teams. - Senior Engineers (IC5) build roadmaps of several medium-to-large features that help achieve their team’s goals. In this case, the problem and its business impact are clear; we just need an engineer to create a plan to solve it.Staff Engineers (L6) handle more ambiguity. They don’t just solve known problems; they create scope by finding impactful opportunities and problems. Managers work with their L6s to expand the scope of the team.- Big tech companies determine what level projects are in a few ways. Here’s a comparison of the criteria for L5 and L6 levels:Project complexity also distinguishes IC6 scope. Problems that IC5s can’t solve are considered IC6 scope. This is why specialists often have IC6+ scope; others often can’t do their projects.These criteria aren’t a checklist. Work can be IC6 scope by meeting only some of these. Your manager will use these criteria to argue that your work is IC6 scope. This is one of the reasons why it’s important to align with your manager on your work’s scope. - Staff engineers uplift others around them. They should have the ability to help IC5 engineers grow. There are a few ways they uplift others:Mentorship - Dedicated mentorship, preferably with senior engineersKnowledge sharing - Writing wikis, giving presentations, contributing to Q&A groupsCollaborations - Growing others while working with them (e.g. code reviews, design reviews, discussions)IC6 engineers should also contribute to growing the organization. This means that they help with recruiting and partner with their manager to improve team health.Getting to the Staff Engineering level can take a long time. Since IC5 is considered “terminal,” there is no external pressure to achieve IC6 fast. However, if you are eager to grow as fast as possible, here’s how fas you can expect promotion:Promotion in 1 half (Ridiculous) - You’d need to start influencing outside your team as soon as you join. Even then, it’s unlikely you’d get promoted this fast unless you create something company-changing.Promotion in 2 halves (Exceptional) - Finding IC6 opportunities on your team is not always possible this fast. It’s a combination of situation and skill to get promoted in two halves, even if you execute well.Promotion in 3 halves (Great) - If you’re ambitious I’d aim for this goal. It gives you a year to find IC6 scope, which is a reasonable amount of time to pivot if needed. Also, your track record of successes in the first year will help build the narrative for promotion.H1 (IC5 Exceeds Expectations) - I led two workstreams that were partnerships with other teams to hit our goals. I also landed a large win in an unplanned ads workstream, which is what brought my rating above expectations. I was also one of the top contributors to code review and interviewing in my 70-person eng org. The hidden success here was that I bootstrapped a new workstream towards the end of the half that was certainly IC6 scope.H2 (IC5 → IC6 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations) - The IC6 workstream I created turned out to be a massive opportunity. This work was a huge success, resulting in a company-wide award and public recognition from Mark Zuckerberg. I also created a cross-org collaboration between 3 large orgs (70+ eng each), which received positive feedback from each director. Lastly, I ran infrastructure preparations for my org resulting in no major incidents during the most critical time of the year. The repeated influence and impact of these large initiatives is what got me promoted to IC6. - My past context and relationships at Instagram helped me move a lot faster. I could lead several workstreams at once because I knew so much about the codebase. Also, it was easier to get work done in collaboration because I knew partner engineers from past work. Staying at one company for a longer time does have its benefits. - When I was an IC4, I stumbled upon some IC6 scope without realizing it. I had strong initiative so I started solving problems without thinking through why it was impactful. I got lucky that the work had IC6 impact. I’ve since learned the importance of understanding the “why” before diving in. It helps you have consistent IC6 impact and makes it easier to get buy-in for your work.The Tech Lead Skillset Scales Well - In my promotion to Senior (IC5), I learned how to lead initiatives within my team. This skillset turned out to work well at higher levels too. The difference was just that more people were involved. This skill is a great way to continue your IC growth to the highest levels if you fit the “tech lead” archetype.Growth to the Staff level can take a long time, and luck plays a role. As you move up the ladder, each promotion depends more and more on your situation in addition to your skill.There are ways to increase your luck. For instance, you can go to growing companies and teams. You can pick business-critical projects. You can go where the most talented people are. None of these are foolproof, but they increase your chances.Aside from picking your situation, one way to manufacture luck is to do as much good work as you can. Many growth opportunities came to me because of some past work I did. People would reach out to me to do more of it or because they wanted to ask me questions about something I had launched.Although luck plays a role, there are aspects of getting promoted that rely less on luck. Here are four high-level areas:Impact is any measurable and objective outcome that benefits your company. Promotions are a byproduct of your elevated, sustained impact. If you can learn what your organization considers impactful and you deliver that, you will be rewarded.2) Leverage is how you have more impact. Software engineers increase their leverage through people, writing, and code. Leverage is what differentiates higher-level ICs from lower-level ones. What I mean by each type of leverage:People - People leverage comes from technical leadership. This means setting direction, reviewing designs/code, and growing others.Writing - Writing gives us leverage by influencing and helping others without your active involvement.Code - Not all code is created equal. High-leverage code solves problems that few others can or helps engineers move faster at scale. When people hear “personal brand,” their minds often go to social media. But the brand that matters most is your “internal brand.” What do people within your company think about your work and its value? This is the brand that you should care most about.Most of the top ICs I know are not well-known outside of Meta. They are legendary within the company, though because people see their impressive work. Build your internal brand by doing great work and letting others know about it (further reading here).4) Build your soft skills. Working with others is a necessity to do anything of consequence. Also, being someone others want to work with makes it easier to find mentors who will uplift you along the way.Soft skills are underrated among software engineers. It’s important to be an excellent IC, but you can go so much further if you also communicate well. Also, engineers don’t often prioritize soft skills, so having them will help you stand out and lead.One last thing I’ll leave you with is something that I didn’t realize until looking back. When I first joined the industry, I was an absolute machine. I would get in early and stay until the last shuttle left at 9:27 PM. Although this might sound like hell to some people, I loved it. No one made me do that; I put in those hours because I enjoyed the work and thought it was interesting.Looking back years later, I realize that was an unfair advantage I had. It let me put in a ton of work without getting burned out. Also, I got much more out of what I did because I was intrinsically motivated.If there’s one thing I wish for you, it is that you find work at the intersection of what you enjoy and what will get you promoted. That is the best recipe for hyper-career growth.Thanks for reading,Ryan PetermanIf you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.

Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. My solutions are written in Python first, and then converted to Perl. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.You are given two array of strings,  and .Write a script to return the count of common strings in both arrays.The tasks and examples don't mention what to do if a string appears more than once in both arrays. I've made the assumption that we only need to return it once.For the command line input, I take two strings that are space separated as shown in the example.In Python this is a one liner. I turn the lists into sets (which only has unique values) and take the length of the intersection of these two sets.Perl does not have sets or intersections built in. For the Perl solution, I turn both strings into a hash with the key being the strings. I then iterate through the keys of the first hash to see if they appear in the second hash. If they do, I increment the  variable../ch-1.py

You are given an encoded array and an initial integer.Write a script to find the original array that produced the given encoded array. It was encoded such that encoded[i] = orig[i] XOR orig[i + 1].This is relatively straight forward. For the command line input, I take the last value as the  integer, and the rest as the  integers.For this task, I create the  list (array in Perl) with the  value. I then iterate over each item in the  list and takes the exclusive-or of it and the last value in the  list../ch-2.py 1 2 3 1

Users can export final reports as PDFs or share them via Perplexity Pages.The service launches first on web browsers, with iOS, Android, and Mac versions planned for later release. While basic access is free, daily query limits apply to non-subscribers. Perplexity says the tool works particularly well for finance, marketing, and technology research.Deepseek enables cheaper Deep ResearchPerplexity's Deepseek version of Deep Research scored 20.5 percent accuracy in "Humanity's Last Exam", a comprehensive AI benchmark with over 3,000 questions, placing it just behind OpenAI's Deep Research based on o3.Perplexity measures its own service with Internet knowledge against other models that only answer the questions with trained knowledge, and accordingly achieves significantly better results. For a company whose product has been criticized for being less than truthful, advertising that is less than truthful is not a confidence-building measure.Checking the AI's wall of textLike all so-called "answer engines" - with or without Deep Research - Perplexity generates falsehoods and inaccuracies in its reports. It is up to humans to verify and validate these results.The challenge is that these errors can be very subtle and hidden in large amounts of text, as in this example: Here LLM critic Gary Marcus is credited with a paper that refers to LLMs as "stochastic parrots". This is certainly in line with Marcus' beliefs, and he may have used the term before. But he did not write the paper.Perplexity does not respond to regular inquiries about whether error rates in AI responses are systematically studied and how high they are. Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI do not answer this question either.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Self-Promotion Thread</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iqiy4x/d_selfpromotion_thread/</link><author>/u/AutoModerator</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 03:15:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Please post your personal projects, startups, product placements, collaboration needs, blogs etc.Please mention the payment and pricing requirements for products and services.Please do not post link shorteners, link aggregator websites , or auto-subscribe links.Any abuse of trust will lead to bans.Encourage others who create new posts for questions to post here instead!Thread will stay alive until next one so keep posting after the date in the title.Meta: This is an experiment.

Enter Server-Sent Events (SSE) - a simpler alternative that's perfect for one-way server-to-client communication.In this guide, I'll walk you through implementing SSE using GoFrame, taking you from basic implementation all the way to production-ready code. Let's dive in!
  
  
  What are Server-Sent Events? 🤔
SSE is a standard that enables servers to push real-time updates to clients over HTTP. Unlike WebSocket, SSE:Is one-way (server to client only)Automatically reconnects if the connection is lostPerfect for: real-time notifications, live feeds, status updates, and monitoring dashboards!
  
  
  Getting Started: Basic SSE Implementation 🌱
Let's start with a simple example. Here's how to create your first SSE endpoint in GoFrame:And here's how to connect from the frontend:
  
  
  Real-World Examples: Let's Build Something Cool! 🛠️
Let's build something more practical - a real-time stock price feed:
  
  
  2. Real-time Chat Room Status 💬
Monitor active users and typing indicators in a chat room:
  
  
  3. System Monitoring Dashboard 📊
Monitor system metrics in real-time:
  
  
  4. Live Order Processing Status ⚡
Track order processing status in real-time:
  
  
  5. Live Sports Score Updates 🏆
Track live game scores and statistics:
  
  
  Making it Production-Ready 🛠️
Keep connections alive with periodic pings:Make your frontend resilient:
  
  
  3. Support Different Event Types 🔄
Handle various types of updates:For distributed systems, use Redis pub/sub to coordinate SSE messages:: When you have frequent updates, batch them together:
: Prevent server overload:
Implement event replay for clients that reconnect:
  
  
  Client Groups and Filtering
Implement client grouping for targeted updates:
  
  
  Rate Limiting and Throttling
Implement rate limiting for high-frequency updates:Use CORS headers in productionAdd authentication for sensitive dataMonitor connection counts and server resourcesTest with different network conditionsSSE is a powerful tool for real-time updates that's often overlooked in favor of WebSockets. For one-way communication, it's simpler, more lightweight, and works great with HTTP/2. With GoFrame, implementing SSE becomes even more straightforward and maintainable.Here's a quick checklist for your SSE implementation:✅ Basic SSE setup with proper headers✅ Error handling and connection management✅ Authentication and authorization✅ Security considerationsYou could extend this implementation by:Adding message persistenceImplementing message replayBuilding client librariesAdding WebSocket fallbackImplementing server-side filteringAdding message prioritizationHave you used SSE in your projects?

Pay specific attention to the function. This function is a  function and the byte tables that it references are  as well. This will allow you to eventually run the unicode algorithms at both compile and run-time.Since the tables are fixed at compile time, I can proof that all values from the table will result in values that will never break any bounds, so technically the bound checks are unnecessary.There are two bound checks in the assembly output for this function.The check before accessing the EAST_ASIAN_WIDTH_COLUMN table (I use an assert! to do this, otherwise there will be double bound check).And the check on the conversion to the enum.The two bound checks are the two compare + conditional-jump instructions in this code.I could increase the size of the column table to remove one of the bound checks, but I want to keep the table small if possible.Is there a way to safely (I don't want to use the unsafe code) proof to the compiler that those two checks are unnecessary?P.S. technically there is a bound check before the index table a CMOV instruction, but it doubles as a way to also decompress the index table (last entry is repeated), so I feel this is not really a bound check.I was able to concat the two tables, and use a byte offset. So now there is no way to get an out of bound access, and the bound checks are no longer emitted by the compiler.I also added a manual check for out of bound on the enum and return zero instead, this becomes a CMOV and it eliminated all the panic code from the function.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>spf13/cobra v1.9.0</title><link>https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases/tag/v1.9.0</link><author>/u/jpmmcb</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:45:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon AWS &quot;whoAMI&quot; Attack Exploits AMI Name Confusion to Take Over Cloud Instances</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iqav3c/amazon_aws_whoami_attack_exploits_ami_name/</link><author>/u/Dark-Marc</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:43:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Newly Curated 40+ Developer Fixes || Try it now :)</title><link>https://dev.to/0x2e_tech/newly-curated-40-developer-fixes-try-it-now--14fe</link><author>0x2e Tech</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:03:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

I am on the concurrency chapter. Guess I am just wondering what next? I really want this return offer and I just want to blow this opportunity out the park. I go too a state school and my manager told me he has high expectations for me after my interviews. I just do not want to let him down you know also plus kind of getting impostor syndrome a bit seeing all the other interns coming from schools such as MIT, Harvard, Standford, etc. Sorry for the vent I guess I just want to prove my worth? and show my manager they made the right choice?What fun, Rust projects have helped you learn a lot?Are there any books you’d recommend that could help me out for the summer?Books I want to read before I start summer:Operating Systems (Three easy pieces)Beej's Guide to Network ProgrammingC++ Concurrency in Action]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Is my company missing out by avoiding deep learning?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iq9gtk/d_is_my_company_missing_out_by_avoiding_deep/</link><author>/u/DatAndre</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 19:42:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Disclaimer: obviously it does not make sense to use a neural network if a linear regression is enough. I work at a company that strictly adheres to mathematical, explainable models. Their stance is that methods like Neural Networks or even Gradient Boosting Machines are too "black-box" and thus unreliable for decision-making. While I understand the importance of interpretability (especially in mission critical scenarios) I can't help but feel that this approach is overly restrictive. I see a lot of research and industry adoption of these methods, which makes me wonder: are they really just black boxes, or is this an outdated view? Surely, with so many people working in this field, there must be ways to gain insights into these models and make them more trustworthy. Am I also missing out on them, since I do not have work experience with such models?EDIT: Context is formula one! However, races are a thing and support tools another. I too would avoid such models in anything strictly related to a race, unless completely necessary. I just feels that there's a bias that is context-independent here. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Mass theft’: Thousands of artists call for AI art auction to be cancelled</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/10/mass-theft-thousands-of-artists-call-for-ai-art-auction-to-be-cancelled</link><author>/u/F0urLeafCl0ver</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 19:31:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of artists are urging the auction house Christie’s to cancel a sale of art created with artificial intelligence, claiming the technology behind the works is committing “mass theft”.The Augmented Intelligence auction has been described by Christie’s as the first AI-dedicated sale by a major auctioneer and features 20 lots with prices ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 for works by artists including Refik Anadol and the late AI art pioneer Harold Cohen.A letter calling for the auction to be scrapped has received 3,000 signatures, including from Karla Ortiz and Kelly McKernan, who are suing AI companies over claims that tech firms’ image generation tools have used their work without permission.The letter says: “Many of the artworks you plan to auction were created using AI models that are known to be trained on copyrighted work without a licence. These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.”Calling on Christie’s to cancel the auction, which starts on 20 February, it adds: “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work.”The use of copyrighted work to train AI models – the technology that underpins chatbots and image generation tools such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney – has become a battleground between creatives and tech companies, with artists, authors, publishers and music labels launching a series of lawsuits alleging breach of copyright.The British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in the campaign by creative professionals for protection of their work and a signatory to the letter, said at least nine of the works appearing in the auction appeared to have used models trained on artists’ work. However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models.A spokesperson for Christie’s said that “in most cases” the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists’ “own inputs”.“The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work and in most cases AI is being employed in a controlled manner, with data trained on the artists’ own inputs,” said the spokesperson.A British artist whose work features in the auction, Mat Dryhurst, said he cared about the issue of art and AI “deeply” and rejected the criticisms in the letter. A piece by Dryhurst and his wife, Holly Herndon – based on a work called xhairymutantx – is on sale at the auction with an estimated price of between $70,000 and $90,000.“This is of interest to us and we have made a lot of art exploring and attempting to intervene in this process as is well within our rights.”He added: “It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.”Anadol also rejected the criticism. In a post on X, he said the backlash was a consequence of “lazy critic practices and doomsday hysteria”.Anadol told the Guardian the piece being auctioned, ISS Dreams, was created using AI technology that had been trained on publicly available datasets from NASA “that have been used widely by artists for many decades.”He added that “the suggestion that this artwork was created using ‘AI models that are known to be on copyrighted work trained without a license’ is factually incorrect.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zed for golang</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iq8jsm/zed_for_golang/</link><author>/u/MrBricole</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 19:02:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am considering using zed for writting go.

One of the key decisions made by the Rust team is the choice to not support the null paradigm. While this design choice leads to safer, more reliable code, it raises an important question for developers: How do we handle the absence of a value?In many programming languages, the concept of  or  (depending on the language) is used to represent the absence of a value. This approach, however, introduces a number of issues:Null Pointer Dereferencing: Accessing a  pointer can lead to runtime errors that are often hard to debug. values can lead to subtle bugs when programmers forget to check for them, causing unexpected behaviors in applications.Rust decided to leave behind this problematic paradigm in favor of alternatives that promote safety at compile-time.
  
  
  Rust's Approach: Rust takes a unique approach to handling the absence of a value: it uses the  enum. This powerful construct allows developers to explicitly handle the presence or absence of a value.The  type is defined as: represents the presence of a value. represents the absence of a value.This makes  a much safer alternative to . The compiler forces you to explicitly handle both cases ( and ), reducing the risk of null pointer exceptions.Here's a simple example of how you might use  to handle optional values:In this example, instead of returning  when the user isn't found, we return , and the caller must handle the potential absence of a value.
  
  
  Why  Is Better Than  With , Rust ensures that you never have to deal with null values unless you explicitly decide to. This eliminates the common pitfalls of null pointer dereferencing. Rust’s borrow checker ensures that you handle all  cases correctly, even when dealing with complex ownership and lifetime semantics. Rust’s pattern matching syntax makes it easy to express the logic of handling  and  values, leading to clean and readable code.
  
  
  Other Alternatives:  for Error Handling
In addition to , Rust also offers the  enum for handling operations that might fail. The  type is especially useful when a function might produce either a valid result or an error, combining both success and failure cases into a single, explicit structure.Just like , the  type forces developers to handle both cases explicitly, improving robustness and error recovery in your programs.
  
  
  Conclusion: Embracing Safety and Clarity
Rust’s rejection of the  paradigm and adoption of types like  is a conscious choice to create safer, more reliable code. By forcing developers to handle the possibility of missing or invalid data explicitly, Rust eliminates the risks and headaches often associated with .While this approach might feel unfamiliar to developers coming from languages with , it quickly becomes a strength of the language. Embracing  (and ) in your code not only prevents bugs but also promotes a more clear, understandable way of thinking about data and operations in your applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust - Ownership Model</title><link>https://dev.to/dedsecrattle/rust-ownership-model-1l6j</link><author>Prabhat Kumar</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:34:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rust’s ownership model is one of its most powerful and defining features. It provides memory safety without needing a garbage collector, making Rust highly efficient and reliable. If you're coming from languages like C++, Java, or Python, understanding Rust’s ownership system might feel daunting at first. In this post, we'll break it down step by step.What is Ownership in Rust?Ownership is Rust’s unique way of managing memory. Instead of using garbage collection or manual memory management, Rust enforces strict ownership rules at compile time. These rules ensure memory safety and prevent data races in concurrent programs.The three key ownership rules are:Each value in Rust has a single owner.When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the value.Ownership can be transferred (moved) or borrowed (immutably or mutably).
  
  
  Moving, Copying, and Cloning
When assigning a value from one variable to another, ownership is transferred. Consider this example:Since  is allocated on the heap, Rust prevents double-free errors by invalidating  when ownership moves to .Certain types implement the  trait, meaning they are duplicated instead of moved. Examples include:Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, etc.) implement , so they don’t follow move semantics.If you need to duplicate heap-allocated data, use :Cloning explicitly creates a separate copy in memory, avoiding move-related issues.Rust allows borrowing instead of transferring ownership. Borrowing enables passing data without giving up ownership.A reference () allows read-only access to data without taking ownership:You can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time, but not if there’s a mutable borrow.A mutable reference () allows modification but enforces exclusivity:Rust ensures at compile time that you cannot have multiple mutable references or a mix of mutable and immutable references at the same time.
  
  
  Lifetimes: Ensuring Valid References
Rust’s  prevent dangling references. Consider this example:The  lifetime annotation ensures that the returned reference is valid as long as both input references are valid.
  
  
  Why Rust’s Ownership Model Matters
: No need for garbage collection, yet Rust prevents use-after-free and memory leaks.: Enforces thread safety at compile time.: Eliminates runtime overhead associated with memory management.: Code is predictable and free from subtle memory bugs.Rust’s ownership model might take some getting used to, but once you grasp it, you gain the power to write efficient and safe code without worrying about memory leaks. By understanding moves, copies, borrowing, and lifetimes, you can write highly performant Rust applications while maintaining safety guarantees.Are you currently learning Rust?

We need to unify all the national dataIf governments want in, they’ll need to gather all their data – spatial information, economic data, electronic healthcare records including genomic data, and info about infrastructure.

The American multi-billionaire used the United States as an example, if not a goal."I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can," Ellison said. "We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it's easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like," he said. "That's the missing link."He believes the payoff will include better healthcare, thanks to treatments tailored to individuals, and the ability for governments to lift food production by better predicting crop yields. Analyzing land so that farmers can be advised where to apply fertilizers or increase irrigation was another scenario Ellison floated."As long as countries will put their data - all of it - in a single place we can use AI to help manage the care of all of the patients and the population at large," Ellison said, adding his belief that AI can handle other social services and eliminate fraud.Of course, such a vast database system could also be the precursor to pervasive surveillance – an idea Ellison last year said he feels is desirable and would like Oracle to help facilitate.Constant real-time surveillance of populations, analyzed by Oracle-powered machine-learning products, would keep everyone "on their best behavior," Ellison said at an Oracle financial analyst conference in September 2024. We're reminded of the NSA, PRISM, Snowden.Ellison is not just a techno-optimist. He’s also a top executive and shareholder who has made big AI investments as well as a database company to feed.He therefore told the Dubai audience that Oracle, already a big-time government and military contractor, is ready to help nations realize his above-mentioned AI visions. Ie: Put all this data into one big expensive Oracle system to learn from and process."Oracle is building a 2.2GW datacenter that costs between $50 and $100 billion dollars to build," Ellison said, noting it's sites like that where super-powered AI models will be trained. "Because these models are so expensive, you won't build your own as a rule. There'll be a handful of these models."And a handful of players that can train them. Oracle’s own facilities will likely be one. The super-corp has also joined another, the Stargate project, that plans to blow $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US in the next four years. ®]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alexandre Mutel a.k.a. xoofx is leaving Unity</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@xoofx/113997304444307991</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:53:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Don&apos;t &quot;optimize&quot; conditional moves in shaders with mix()+step()</title><link>https://iquilezles.org/articles/gpuconditionals/</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:52:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this article I want to correct a popular misconception that's been making the rounds in computer graphics aficionado circles for a long time now. It has to do with conditionals when selecting between two results in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation, and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up a little:
So, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);
     x>?(s.x,):
           x>?s*():
                      (,s.y);
}
The exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations deciding what's the final value this function should return. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return one of three results, which are simple to compute. I could also have implemented this function with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say in this article stays true.
Now, here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will step up and invariably propose the following "optimization", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are "conditional branches" in the code, by arithmetic operations. They will suggest something like this: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);

     w0 = (,x);
     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);
     w2 = -w0-w1;

     res0 = (s.x,);
     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();
     res2 = (,s.y);

     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;
}
There are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. "select"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. I'll repeat it again - there is no branching, the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no prediction involved, no pipe to flush, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.
For the record, of course GPUs can do real branching, and those are fine and fast and totally worth it when big chunks of code and computation are to be skipped given a condition. As with all things computing, always check the generated machine code to know what is happening exactly and when. But one thing you can safely assume without having to check any generated code - when moving simple values or computations like in my original example, you are guaranteed to not branch. This has been true for decades at this point, with GPUs. And while I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.
The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimized version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. You can measure it in a variety of hardware. I can only assume that's because the  function is probably implemented with some sort of conditional move or subtract + bit propagation + AND. step(  x,  y )
{
     x < y ?  : ;
}
Either way, using the step() "optimization" are either using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to mask in and out the different potential outputs with a series of arithmetic multiplications and additions. Which is wasteful, the values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.
But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the original code I published:
GLSL x>?(s.x,):
       x>?s*():
                  (,s.y);
AMD Compiler     s0,      v3, , v1
     v4, , v0
     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0
 v3, 0, v3, vcc
 v0, v0, v4, vcc
 vcc, (v2), s1
 v1, v1, v3, vcc
 v0, 0, v0, vcc
Microsoft Compiler   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy
   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )
 r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz
 r0.xy, r0.xyxx
  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()
   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()
 r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy
 o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw
Here we can confirm that the GPU is not branching, as I explained. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).
The Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison ( - "lt"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).
There are no jump/branch instructions in these listings.
Something not related to the discussion but interesting, is that some of the  GLSL calls I had in my shader before the ternary operator we are discussing, didn't become GPU instructions but rather instruction modifiers, which is the reason you see them in the listing. This means you can think of abs() calls as being free.
So, if you ever see somebody proposing this a = ( b, c, ( y, x ) );
as an optimization to
then please correct them for me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Altman: OpenAI not for sale, especially to competitor who is not able to beat us</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/openai-altman-musk-offer</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:17:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GitHub - yaitoo/xun: Xun is an HTTP web framework built on Go&apos;s built-in html/template and net/http package’s router (1.22).</title><link>https://github.com/yaitoo/xun</link><author>/u/imlangzi</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:15:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Event Sourcing?</title><link>https://newsletter.scalablethread.com/p/what-is-event-sourcing</link><author>/u/scalablethread</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:05:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Traditional data storage typically focuses on the current state of an entity. For example, in an e-commerce system, you might store the current state of a customer's order: items, quantities, shipping address, etc. Event sourcing takes a different approach. Instead of storing the current state directly, it stores the events that led to that state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the past. Think of it as a detailed log of transactions on your bank statement. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store. The core idea is that an application's state can be derived by replaying events in the order they occurred, just like you can get your current bank balance by replaying all the transactions from the beginning. This makes Event Sourcing particularly useful for applications that require a high degree of audibility and traceability.Every change to the application state is captured as an event object in an Event Sourcing system. These events are then stored in an event store, a database optimized for handling event data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how Event Sourcing works:Reconstructing the state from events involves reading all the events related to an entity from the event store and applying them in sequence to reconstruct the current state. It's like simulating all the changes that have occurred to construct the current state. For example, consider an e-commerce application where an order goes through various states like "Created," "Paid," and "Shipped." To determine the current state of an order, you would:Retrieve all events related to the order from the event store.Initialize an empty order object.Apply each event to the order object in the order in which they were stored.By the end of this process, the order object will reflect the current state of the order.As the number of events grows, replaying the entire event stream to reconstruct the state can become slow and inefficient. This is where snapshots come in. A snapshot is a saved state of an entity at a specific point in time. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, the application can load the latest snapshot and then replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken.

The ordered map contains the golang map, list and mutex to execute Ordered Map functions.The Ordered Map is a map that remembers the order of items. The map can be iterated over to retrieve the items in the order they were added.
  
  
  Introduction to the omap Go Package
The omap Go package is a lightweight and efficient library for working with ordered maps in Go. An ordered map is a data structure that combines the benefits of a map and a list, allowing you to store key-value pairs in a specific order.Omap is a Go package that provides an implementation of an ordered map. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. Omap is particularly useful when you need to store data in a specific order, such as when working with configuration files, caching, or data processing pipelines.Ordered: omap preserves the order in which key-value pairs are inserted, allowing you to iterate over the map in a specific order.Fast lookups: omap uses a hash table to store key-value pairs, making lookups fast and efficient.Efficient insertion and deletion: omap uses a linked list to store the order of key-value pairs, making insertion and deletion operations efficient.To use omap, you can install it using the following command:go get github.com/kirill-scherba/omap
Here is an example of how to use omap:This code creates a new omap, inserts some key-value pairs, and then iterates over the omap in order, printing out each key-value pair.The omap Go package is a useful library for working with ordered maps in Go. Its fast lookups, efficient insertion and deletion, and ordered iteration make it a great choice for a variety of use cases. Whether you're working with configuration files, caching, or data processing pipelines, omap is definitely worth considering.Configuration files: Use omap to store configuration data in a specific order, making it easy to iterate over the configuration and apply settings in the correct order.Caching: Use omap to store cached data in a specific order, making it easy to iterate over the cache and evict items in the correct order.Data processing pipelines: Use omap to store data in a specific order, making it easy to iterate over the data and process it in the correct order.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[P] Daily ArXiv filtering powered by LLM judge</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ipz934/p_daily_arxiv_filtering_powered_by_llm_judge/</link><author>/u/MadEyeXZ</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 11:14:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🌍 UTF-8</title><link>https://dev.to/wycliffealphus/utf-8-3edn</link><author>Wycliffe A.

Why do some characters get replaced with weird symbols? And most importantly—how do we fix it?The answer is UTF-8, the encoding that powers almost everything today. Let's talk about what it is, why it matters, and how to use it properly in Go (Golang).
  
  
  🔥 The Problem UTF-8 Solves
Back in the early days of computing, ASCII was the standard way to represent text. It used 7 bits per character, meaning it could only represent 128 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and some symbols).That was fine—until computers went global.Suddenly, people needed to store and display languages like Chinese (汉字), Arabic (العربية), Hindi (हिन्दी), and more. ASCII just couldn’t handle it.So different countries created their own encodings:ISO-8859-1 for Western EuropeWindows-1252 for Microsoft systems💀 The result? Encoding chaos. A file written in one system might be unreadable in another.Enter , the hero of our story.
  
  
  🏆 What Makes UTF-8 Special?
UTF-8 was designed in 1992 by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike (yes, the same Rob Pike who helped create Go!). It solved the encoding mess by being:✅ Backwards-compatible with ASCII
✅ Compact for common characters (English stays at 1 byte per character)
✅ Capable of encoding every language and symbol
✅ Error-resistant (invalid bytes won’t accidentally form valid characters)This is why UTF-8 is now used by 97% of websites and is the default encoding for most programming languages, including Go.
  
  
  💻 UTF-8 in Action (With Go Examples)
Since Go natively supports UTF-8, you don’t need to do anything special—it just works. But let’s dig into some examples to see it in action.1️⃣ Encoding a String as UTF-8 BytesEnglish characters (, ) are 1 byte each.Chinese characters () are 3 bytes each.This variable-length encoding is why UTF-8 is so efficient!2️⃣ Decoding UTF-8 Bytes Back to a String💡 No extra libraries—Go just handles it. That’s one of the nice things about UTF-8 in Go.3️⃣ Handling UTF-8 in Web ApplicationsIf you're building a web app, always specify UTF-8 in your response headers:💡 Without , some browsers might misinterpret the text and display garbage characters.4️⃣ Validating UTF-8 DataNot every byte sequence is valid UTF-8. You can check with :✅ Great for validating user input before processing it!5️⃣ Counting Unicode Characters (Runes) in a StringGo strings are byte sequences, not necessarily character sequences.❗ Why the difference? Because 世界 takes 3 bytes each, so len(text) == 13, but there are only 9 characters.6️⃣ Iterating Over Unicode CharactersSince some characters take more than 1 byte, normal indexing won’t work. Use :❗ Notice how 世界 starts at index 7, not 5, because it uses 3 bytes each.
  
  
  🚀 Why UTF-8 is the Default Encoding
Before UTF-8:
❌ Confusing mess of different encodings
❌ Text corruption between systems
❌ Websites needed to support multiple charsetsAfter UTF-8:
✅ One encoding for everything
✅ No more garbled text (mojibake)
✅ Supported everywhere—from databases to web APIsIf you’re dealing with text in Go (or any language), understanding UTF-8 is essential. It ensures your applications work worldwide without encoding issues.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go Nullable with Generics v2.0.0 - now supports omitzero</title><link>https://github.com/LukaGiorgadze/gonull</link><author>/u/Money-Relative-1184</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 11:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>async-arp: library for probing hosts and sending advanced ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ipywbp/asyncarp_library_for_probing_hosts_and_sending/</link><author>/u/arcycar</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:48:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After a few months of exploring and working with Rust, I am happy to share my first small Rust crate,  and I’d love to hear your thoughts! 🚀This library provides an  way to send and receive , making it useful for network discovery, debugging, and custom networking applications.🏎  Built on Tokio for non-blocking network operations🔍  Easily detect active devices in a subnet⚙️  Craft and send ARP packets dynamicallyYou can find usage examples and API documentation here: 📖 Since this is my first crate, I’d really appreciate any feedback on:📌  – Is the interface intuitive and ergonomic?🚀  – Does it fit well into async Rust workflows?🔍  – Any improvements or best practices I may have missed?🦀  – Suggestions to make it more "Rustacean"?If you have further ideas, issues, or want to contribute, check it out on GitHub:Thanks for checking it out—let me know what you think! 🦀]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>what do you use golang for?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ipykyd/what_do_you_use_golang_for/</link><author>/u/Notalabel_4566</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:24:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is there any other major use than web development?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Kreuzberg – Modern async Python library for document text extraction</title><link>https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg</link><author>nhirschfeld</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:07:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">Show HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm excited to showcase Kreuzberg!Kreuzberg is a modern Python library built from the ground up with async/await, type hints, and optimized I/O handling.It provides a unified interface for extracting text from documents (PDFs, images, office files) without external API dependencies.Key technical features:
- Built with modern Python best practices (async/await, type hints, functional-first)
- Optimized async I/O with anyio for multi-loop compatibility
- Smart worker process pool for CPU-bound tasks (OCR, doc conversion)
- Efficient batch processing with concurrent extractions
- Clean error handling with context-rich exceptionsI built this after struggling with existing solutions that were either synchronous-only, required complex deployments, or had poor async support. The goal was to create something that works well in modern async Python applications, can be easily dockerized or used in serverless contexts, and relies only on permissive OSS.Key advantages over alternatives:
- True async support with optimized I/O
- Minimal dependencies (much smaller than alternatives)

He’s perhaps best known for the groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks, which inspired countless shows, including The X-Files, The Sopranos, and Lost.Lynch was genuinely a good human being who cared deeply for his actors and crew. He discovered extraordinary talent like Naomi Watts, who had struggled to land a major role in a Hollywood movie after 10 years of auditioning. From the interviews he gave, it quickly becomes apparent that he respected people of all kinds and never put anyone down – even those who truly deserved it.Lynch is famous for refusing to explain his movies. Although not a fan of his previous work, the great film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that Mulholland Drive remained compulsively watchable while refusing to yield to interpretation.While Lynch offered very little in terms of what his movies meant, he was generous in sharing his views on creativity, work, and life in general. As a tribute to Lynch, I’d like to share my perspective on his life lessons from a software developer’s viewpoint.Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.We’ve all got hundreds or even thousands of ideas floating around in our brains. But the really big ones are few and far between. Once you catch a good one –because they’re so rare– write it down immediately, says Lynch. From there, ideas attract other ideas and start to grow from their initial seed state. The final job is to translate those ideas into a medium, whether it’s a film, a painting, or software.The idea is the whole thing. If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really. You just keep working to make it look like that idea looked, feel like it felt, sound like it sounded, and be the way it was.Software development is part art, part engineering. We don’t build the same software over and over again – virtually all software is crafted by hand, sometimes with help from AI. If you ask two developers to create a non-trivial program, it’s very likely that the programs they produce will be different, even if the functionality is the same. Under the hood, the programming language, data structures, and overall architecture may be completely different. And on the surface, the user interfaces may look nothing alike.It’s a good habit to listen to what users have to say, but they often can only describe their problems – they rarely come up with good ideas to solve them. And that’s OK. It’s our job to find the right ideas, implement them well, and solve tricky problems in a way we, and hopefully the users, will love.My friend Bushnell Keeler, who was really responsible for me wanting to be a painter, said you need four hours of uninterrupted time to get one hour of good painting in, and that is really true.Like other creative fields, writing code requires deep concentration. We need to hold complex structures in our minds while working through problems. Switching between coding and other tasks disrupts  – that magical state of mind where we lose track of time and produce code effortlessly. That’s why many developers hate meetings – they are toxic to our productivity.I believe you need technical knowledge. And also, it’s really, really great to learn by doing. So, you should make a film.Software development is one of those rare fields where a college degree isn’t required to succeed. Yes, we should all know the basics, but in my experience, new college graduates often lack the practical knowledge to be effective developers.The real learning happens through hands-on experience: building real projects, debugging tricky problems, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code over time. It’s crucial to never stop learning, experimenting, and iterating on our craft.Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn’t even exist.Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Originally conceived to meet the demand for information sharing between scientists around the world, the web went mainstream within just a few years.Linus Torvalds created Git due to a licensing dispute over BitKeeper, the original version control system used for Linux development. The need for a new tool led to Git becoming the most widely used version control system today.I feel that a set should be like a happy family. Almost like Thanksgiving every day, happily going down the road together.Be kind to your teammates, don’t embarrass them. They may not be perfect, but accept them for who they are. The most important trait of an effective software development team is psychological safety –that is, team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other, as corroborated by Google’s research on the subject.It’s OK to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them. Knowing that your team has your back when things go south is a wonderful feeling.Most of Hollywood is about making money - and I love money, but I don’t make the films thinking about money.Just like Lynch prioritizes creativity over financial gain, some of the most impactful software projects started with an open source model, and they literally changed the world, such as Linux, PostgreSQL, and Node.js, just to name a few.What makes these projects remarkable is that they didn’t emerge from corporate boardrooms – they were built by communities of passionate developers, collaborating across the world.Money is just a means to an end. Unfortunately, many get this confused.David, thank you for making the world a better place!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Macro-Less, Highly Integrated OpenAPI Document Generation in Rust with Ohkami</title><link>https://dev.to/kanarus/macro-less-highly-integrated-openapi-document-generation-in-rust-with-ohkami-9b2</link><author>kanarus</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:49:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a cross post from Medium.In Rust web dev, utoipa is the most popular crate for generating OpenAPI document from server code. While it’s a great tool, it can be frustrating due to excessive macro use.A new web framework Ohkami offers a macro-less, highly integrated way to generate OpenAPI document with its  feature.Let’s take following code as an example. It’s the same sample from the “openapi” section of the README, but with openapi-related parts removed:While this compiles and works as a pseudo user management server, activating  feature causes a compile error, telling that  and  don’t implement .As indicated by this, Ohkami with  feature effectively handles type information and intelligently collects its endpoints’ metadata. It allows code like:to assemble metadata into an OpenAPI document and output it to a file .Then, how we implement ? Actually we can easily  by hand, or just  is available! In this case, derive is enough:That’s it! Just adding these derives allows  to output following file:Additionally, it’s easy to define the  schema as a component instead of duplicating inline schemas.
In derive, just add  helper attribute:And  attribute is available to set , , and override  and each response’s :Let’s take a look at how this document generation works!First, the s are expanded as following:The organized DSL enables to easily impl manually. trait links the struct to an item of type called .

  3.  metadata of Router
In Ohkami, what’s called  has  property that stores all the routes belonging to an Ohkami instance. This is returned alongside  from  step, and is used to assemble metadata of all endpoints.What  itself does is just to serialize an item of type openapi::document::Document and write it to a file.The openapi::document::Document item is created by  of , summarized as follows:That’s how Ohkami generates OpenAPI document!

I am fortunate enough to work and develop with these technologies every day as a machine learning engineer!In this article, I will walk you through my journey to becoming a machine learning engineer, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!In one of my previous articles, I extensively wrote about my journey from school to securing my first Data Science job. I recommend you check out that article, but I will summarise the key timeline here.Pretty much everyone in my family studied some sort of STEM subject. My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.So, my path was always paved for me.I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it’s fair to say everyone was very proud!At school, I wasn’t dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn’t fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It’s mainly for students who don’t have a university offer.I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master’s degree in physics!There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn’t seem there was much opportunity in the space.During this time, DeepMind released theirdocumentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.You can hear more about my journey from a podcast.I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and generalised linear models (GLMs).I built models to predict: — Did someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.— What’s the premium we should give someone.— How many claims will someone have. — What’s the average claim value someone will have.I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.However, due to the company’s structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the “tech” side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in time series forecasting and optimisation problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.Fair to say I learned a lot. I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by Pau Labarta BajoML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues: -> You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance. -> You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don’t provide tangible value to a business.That’s not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.You want to say that you did “X that produced Y”, which the above two avenues allow you to do.The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that’s where I gravitated towards.To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.And that’s exactly what I did.Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!Fortunately, a role kind of “fell to me,” but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work — you don’t know what may come from it.I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist. — A machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That’s why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas. — If you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It’s not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me! — Most companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it’s best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take. — I am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout here.Data Structures & Algorithms — Understanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It’s not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick. — Again, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts. — Many MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse. This is why securing a machine learning engineer role can be quite challenging, as it requires proficiency across a wide range of skills.Summary & Further ThoughtsI have a free newsletter, , where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist. Plus, when you subscribe, you will get my and short PDF version of my AI roadmap!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Refactor and cleaup yacc: Making sense of legacy code</title><link>https://dev.to/mbver/refactor-and-clean-up-goyacc-making-sense-of-legacy-code-1pm0</link><author>mbver</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:04:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[, a widely used LALR(1) parser generator, is efficient but burdened by archaic, unreadable code from the 1970s. Its Go adaptation, , inherits these issues despite the modern language.While exploring compilers, I found  to be a gold mine of insights, though buried under outdated practices. Following Allan Holub’s , I dissected its code—clarifying, simplifying, and refactoring convoluted sections. I then tested the revised version in a real-world scenario to ensure it retained its original functionality. The full code is published on github.I aimed to explore real-world open-source code, bridge ideals with reality, and stay sane as a reader. By refining and clarifying it, I made learning smoother and reuse easier.The first issue is poor naming—cryptic, vague, or misleading names. Here’s how naming was improved.original | cleanup          | intent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cpfir    | computeFirstsets | compute the first sets for non-terminal symbols
cpemp    | computeEmpty     | compute compute table to check if a non-terminal symbol is nullable
cpres    | computeYields    | compute compute the production yields for non-terminal symbols
curres   | prds             | the productions having the same non-terminal symbol as LHS
wSet     | wItem            | type of a working item generated during closure
wSets    | wSet             | store working items generated during closure
statemem | kernls           | store kernel items
mstate   | statechain       | chain a state's previous state to track where it cames from
pstate   | kernlp           | pointer to a kernel item
putitem  | addKernItem      | add a kernel item
writem   | item.string()    | get the string representation of a kernel item
apack    | packGotosRow     | compress newly goto row after closing state, not action as "a" implies
prectfn  | handleShiftReduceConflict | handle shift-reduce conflict of a state during processing closed states
go2out   | packGotosByCol   | compress goto table by column
go2gen   | computeGotoCol   | compute the goto column for a non-terminal symbol
callopt  | storeShiftsAndGotos | store shift-row for a state or goto column for a non-terminal symbol in action-store
gin      | storeGotoCol     | store a column of compressed goto table for a terminal symbol into action-store
stin     | storeShifts      | store shifts of a row in action table for a state into action-store
setbit   | lkset.set        | set a bit ON
bitset   | lkset.check      | check if a bit is ON (mix up with setbit easily)

The second issue is cramming everything into one place, burying core logic (closure and state generation) under the bulky input parsing.  Refactoring separates it to files by functionality, improving clarity and focus.The third issue is poor organization. A key component, the lookahead set, should have its own type with all related methods grouped together, not lying elsewhere. This improves maintainability and makes adding methods easier. Similarly, the kernel item should define its own string representation method. These structs also include a Clone method for copying instances.The fourth issue is convolution. The  variable determines whether closure is  or  for state generation and  for processing closed states. However, it pops up in unexpected places like kernel item addition, state generation, and packing gotos. Furthermore, it creates twists and turns in the  logic, making it harder to follow.To resolve this, I split  into  for  and closure0 for . While slightly redundant, this separation prevents their logic from getting entangled, making the flow easier to follow. With this change, the confusing  is completely eliminated.Similarly,  determines whether we're handling an  but is tangled with  in closed state processing. By explicitly storing and processing , the confusion caused by  is eliminated.The fifth issue is redundant complications. An example is  -production rules with the same . The code extracts only  to construct the  while calling it  in kernel item. By consistently using full production rules, we remove this friction. It helps to eliminate further redundancies like keeping production number in kernel item for comparison and tricky code to print the dot for a kernel item. Here is the code with comments highlighting the problems.Another example is the redundant outer loop of .Another redundant outer loop is in closure's work item processing.The sixth issue is that several lines can be made more readable by adopting a clearer style. Let's review some snippets.Thanks for reading to the end. Hope this helps on your journey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing Impressions at Netflix</title><link>https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-impressions-at-netflix-e2b67c88c9fb?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4</link><author>Netflix Technology Blog</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:13:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://netflixtechblog.com/?source=rss----2615bd06b42e---4">Netflix Tech Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Part 1: Creating the Source of Truth for ImpressionsImagine scrolling through Netflix, where each movie poster or promotional banner competes for your attention.

This nuanced integration of data and technology empowers us to offer bespoke content recommendations.In this multi-part blog series, we take you behind the scenes of our system that processes billions of impressions daily. We will explore the challenges we encounter and unveil how we are building a resilient solution that transforms these client-side impressions into a personalized content discovery experience for every Netflix viewer.Why do we need impression history?To tailor recommendations more effectively, it’s crucial to track what content a user has already encountered. Having impression history helps us achieve this by allowing us to identify content that has been displayed on the homepage but not engaged with, helping us deliver fresh, engaging recommendations.By maintaining a history of impressions, we can implement frequency capping to prevent over-exposure to the same content. This ensures users aren’t repeatedly shown identical options, keeping the viewing experience vibrant and reducing the risk of frustration or disengagement.Highlighting New ReleasesFor new content, impression history helps us monitor initial user interactions and adjust our merchandising efforts accordingly. We can experiment with different content placements or promotional strategies to boost visibility and engagement.Additionally, impression history offers insightful information for addressing a number of platform-related analytics queries. Analyzing impression history, for example, might help determine how well a specific row on the home page is functioning or assess the effectiveness of a merchandising strategy.The first pivotal step in managing impressions begins with the creation of a Source-of-Truth (SOT) dataset. This foundational dataset is essential, as it supports various downstream workflows and enables a multitude of use cases.Collecting Raw Impression EventsAs Netflix members explore our platform, their interactions with the user interface spark a vast array of raw events. These events are promptly relayed from the client side to our servers, entering a centralized event processing queue. This queue ensures we are consistently capturing raw events from our global user base.After raw events are collected into a centralized queue, a custom event extractor processes this data to identify and extract all impression events. These extracted events are then routed to an Apache Kafka topic for immediate processing needs and simultaneously stored in an Apache Iceberg table for long-term retention and historical analysis. This dual-path approach leverages Kafka’s capability for low-latency streaming and Iceberg’s efficient management of large-scale, immutable datasets, ensuring both real-time responsiveness and comprehensive historical data availability.Filtering & Enriching Raw ImpressionsOnce the raw impression events are queued, a stateless Apache Flink job takes charge, meticulously processing this data. It filters out any invalid entries and enriches the valid ones with additional metadata, such as show or movie title details, and the specific page and row location where each impression was presented to users. This refined output is then structured using an Avro schema, establishing a definitive source of truth for Netflix’s impression data. The enriched data is seamlessly accessible for both real-time applications via Kafka and historical analysis through storage in an Apache Iceberg table. This dual availability ensures immediate processing capabilities alongside comprehensive long-term data retention.Ensuring High Quality ImpressionsMaintaining the highest quality of impressions is a top priority. We accomplish this by gathering detailed column-level metrics that offer insights into the state and quality of each impression. These metrics include everything from validating identifiers to checking that essential columns are properly filled. The data collected feeds into a comprehensive quality dashboard and supports a tiered threshold-based alerting system. These alerts promptly notify us of any potential issues, enabling us to swiftly address regressions. Additionally, while enriching the data, we ensure that all columns are in agreement with each other, offering in-place corrections wherever possible to deliver accurate data.We handle a staggering volume of 1 to 1.5 million impression events globally every second, with each event approximately 1.2KB in size. To efficiently process this massive influx in real-time, we employ Apache Flink for its low-latency stream processing capabilities, which seamlessly integrates both batch and stream processing to facilitate efficient backfilling of historical data and ensure consistency across real-time and historical analyses. Our Flink configuration includes 8 task managers per region, each equipped with 8 CPU cores and 32GB of memory, operating at a parallelism of 48, allowing us to handle the necessary scale and speed for seamless performance delivery. The Flink job’s sink is equipped with a data mesh connector, as detailed in our Data Mesh platform which has two outputs: Kafka and Iceberg. This setup allows for efficient streaming of real-time data through Kafka and the preservation of historical data in Iceberg, providing a comprehensive and flexible data processing and storage solution.We utilize the ‘island model’ for deploying our Flink jobs, where all dependencies for a given application reside within a single region. This approach ensures high availability by isolating regions, so if one becomes degraded, others remain unaffected, allowing traffic to be shifted between regions to maintain service continuity. Thus, all data in one region is processed by the Flink job deployed within that region.Addressing the Challenge of Unschematized EventsAllowing raw events to land on our centralized processing queue unschematized offers significant flexibility, but it also introduces challenges. Without a defined schema, it can be difficult to determine whether missing data was intentional or due to a logging error. We are investigating solutions to introduce schema management that maintains flexibility while providing clarity.Automating Performance Tuning with AutoscalersTuning the performance of our Apache Flink jobs is currently a manual process. The next step is to integrate with autoscalers, which can dynamically adjust resources based on workload demands. This integration will not only optimize performance but also ensure more efficient resource utilization.Improving Data Quality AlertsRight now, there’s a lot of business rules dictating when a data quality alert needs to be fired. This leads to a lot of false positives that require manual judgement. A lot of times it is difficult to track changes leading to regression due to inadequate data lineage information. We are investing in building a comprehensive data quality platform that more intelligently identifies anomalies in our impression stream, keeps track of data lineage and data governance, and also, generates alerts notifying producers of any regressions. This approach will enhance efficiency, reduce manual oversight, and ensure a higher standard of data integrity.Creating a reliable source of truth for impressions is a complex but essential task that enhances personalization and discovery experience. Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where we’ll delve into how we use this SOT dataset to create a microservice that provides impression histories.

This started out as an idea of a weekly update, but
that hasn’t happened, and so we will switch it over to just writing up
when something interesting happens and then push it out relatively
immediately when it happens.Nuitka Onefile Gets More Flexible:  and We’ve got a couple of exciting updates to Nuitka’s onefile mode that
give you more control and flexibility in how you deploy your
applications. These enhancements stem from real-world needs and
demonstrate Nuitka’s commitment to providing powerful and adaptable
solutions.Taking Control of Onefile Unpacking: Onefile mode is fantastic for creating single-file executables, but the
management of the unpacking directory where the application expands has
sometimes been a bit… opaque. Previously, Nuitka would decide whether
to clean up this directory based on whether the path used
runtime-dependent variables. This made sense in theory, but in practice,
it could lead to unexpected behavior and made debugging onefile issues
harder.Now, you have complete control! The new  option
lets you explicitly specify what happens to the unpacking directory:: This is the default behavior. Nuitka
will remove the unpacking directory unless runtime-dependent values
were used in the path specification. This is the same behavior as
previous versions.: The unpacking directory is 
removed and becomes a persistent, cached directory. This is useful
for debugging, inspecting the unpacked files, or if you have a use
case that benefits from persistent caching of the unpacked data. The
files will remain available for subsequent runs.: The unpacking directory 
removed after the program exits.This gives you the power to choose the behavior that best suits your
needs. No more guessing!Relative Paths with Another common request, particularly from users deploying applications
in more restricted environments, was the ability to specify the onefile
unpacking directory  to the executable itself. Previously, you
were limited to absolute paths or paths relative to the user’s temporary
directory space.We’ve introduced a new variable, , that you can use in
the  option. This variable is dynamically
replaced at runtime with the full path to the directory containing the
onefile executable.This would create a directory named  the same
directory as the  (or  on Linux/macOS)
and unpack the application there. This is perfect for creating truly
self-contained applications where all data and temporary files reside
alongside the executable.Nuitka Commercial and Open SourceThese features, like many enhancements to Nuitka, originated from a
request by a Nuitka commercial customer. This highlights the close
relationship between the commercial offerings and the open-source core.
While commercial support helps drive development and ensures the
long-term sustainability of Nuitka, the vast majority of features are
made freely available to all users.This change will be in 2.7 and is currentlyWe encourage you to try out these new features and let us know what you
think! As always, bug reports, feature requests, and contributions are

and you'll notice that the "JIT decorator" pattern is pretty popular. For
example, this JAX snippet:In both cases, the function decorated with  doesn't get executed by the
Python interpreter in the normal sense. Instead, the code inside is more like
a DSL (Domain Specific Language) processed by a special purpose compiler built
into the library (JAX or Triton). Another way to think about it is that Python
is used as a  to describe computations.In this post I will describe some implementation strategies used by libraries to
make this possible.Preface - where we're goingThe goal is to explain how different kinds of  decorators work by using
a simplified, educational example that implements several approaches from
scratch. All the approaches featured in this post will be using this flow: Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" /> Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" class="align-center" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/decjit-python.png" />
These are the steps that happen when a Python function wrapped with
our educational  decorator is called:The function is translated to an "expression IR" - .This expression IR is converted to LLVM IR.Finally, the LLVM IR is JIT-executed.First, let's look at the  IR. Here we'll make a big simplification -
only supporting functions that define a single expression, e.g.:Naturally, this can be easily generalized - after all, LLVM IR can be used to
express fully general computations.Here are the  data structures:To convert an  into LLVM IR and JIT-execute it, we'll use this function:It uses the  class to actually generate LLVM IR from .
This process is straightforward and covered extensively in the resources I
linked to earlier; take a look at the full code here.My goal with this architecture is to make things simple, but .
On one hand - there are several simplifications: only single expressions are
supported, very limited set of operators, etc. It's very easy to extend this!
On the other hand, we could have just trivially evaluated the 
without resorting to LLVM IR; I do want to show a more complete compilation
pipeline, though, to demonstrate that an arbitrary amount of complexity can
be hidden behind these simple interfaces.With these building blocks in hand, we can review the strategies used by
 decorators to convert Python functions into s.Python comes with powerful code reflection and introspection capabilities out
of the box. Here's the  decorator:This is a standard Python decorator. It takes a function and returns another
function that will be used in its place ( ensures that
function attributes like the name and docstring of the wrapper match the
wrapped function).After  is applied to , what  holds is the
wrapper. When  is called, the wrapper is invoked with
.The wrapper obtains the AST of the wrapped function, and then uses
 to convert this AST into an :When  finishes visiting the AST it's given, its
 field will contain the  representing the function's
return value. The wrapper then invokes  with this .Note how our decorator interjects into the regular Python execution process.
When  is called, instead of the standard Python compilation and
execution process (code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed
by the VM), we translate its code to our own representation and emit LLVM from
it, and then JIT execute the LLVM IR. While it seems kinda pointless in this
artificial example, in reality this means we can execute the function's code
in any way we like.AST JIT case study: TritonThis approach is almost exactly how the Triton language works. The body of a
function decorated with  gets parsed to a Python AST, which then
- through a series of internal IRs - ends up in LLVM IR; this in turn is lowered
to PTX by the
NVPTX LLVM backend.
Then, the code runs on a GPU using a standard CUDA pipeline.Naturally, the subset of Python that can be compiled down to a GPU is limited;
but it's sufficient to run performant kernels, in a language that's much
friendlier than CUDA and - more importantly - lives in the same file with the
"host" part written in regular Python. For example, if you want testing and
debugging, you can run Triton in "interpreter mode" which will just run the
same kernels locally on a CPU.Note that Triton lets us import names from the  package
and use them inside kernels; these serve as the  for the language
- special calls the compiler handles directly.Python is a fairly complicated language with  of features. Therefore,
if our JIT has to support some large portion of Python semantics, it may make
sense to leverage more of Python's own compiler. Concretely, we can have it
compile the wrapped function all the way to bytecode,
and start our translation from there.Here's the  decorator that does just this :The Python VM is a stack machine; so we emulate a stack to convert the
function's bytecode to  IR (a bit like an RPN evaluator).
As before, we then use our  utility function to lower
 to LLVM IR and JIT execute it.Using this JIT is as simple as the previous one - just swap 
for :Bytecode JIT case study: NumbaNumba is a compiler for Python itself. The idea
is that you can speed up specific functions in your code by slapping a
 decorator on them. What happens next is similar in spirit to
our simple , but of course much more complicated because it
supports a very large portion of Python semantics.Numba uses the Python compiler to emit bytecode, just as we did; it then
converts it into its own IR, and then to LLVM using .By starting with the bytecode, Numba makes its life easier (no need to rewrite
the entire Python compiler). On the other hand, it also makes some analyses
, because by the time we're in bytecode, a lot of semantic information
existing in higher-level representations is lost. For example, Numba has to
sweat a bit to recover control flow information from the bytecode (by
running it through a special interpreter first).The two approaches we've seen so far are similar in many ways - both rely on
Python's introspection capabilities to compile the source code of the JIT-ed
function to some extent (one to AST, the other all the way to bytecode), and
then work on this lowered representation.The tracing strategy is very different. It doesn't analyze the source code of
the wrapped function at all - instead, it  its execution by means of
specially-boxed arguments, leveraging overloaded operators and functions, and
then works on the generated trace.The code implementing this for our smile demo is surprisingly compact:Each runtime argument of the wrapped function is assigned a , and
that is placed in a , a placeholder class which lets us
do operator overloading:The remaining key function is :To understand how this works, consider this trivial example:After the decorated function is defined,  holds the wrapper function
defined inside . When  is called, the wrapper runs:For each argument of  itself (that is  and ), it creates
a new  holding a . This denotes a named variable in
the  IR.It then calls the wrapped function, passing it the boxes as runtime
parameters.When (the wrapped)  runs, it invokes . This is caught by the overloaded
 operator of , and it creates a new  with
the s representing  and  as children. This
 is then returned .The wrapper unboxes the returned  and passes it to
 to emit LLVM IR from it and JIT execute it with the
actual runtime arguments of the call: .This might be a little mind-bending at first, because there are two different
executions that happen:The first is calling the wrapped  function itself, letting the Python
interpreter run it as usual, but with special arguments that build up the IR
instead of doing any computations. This is the .The second is lowering this IR our tracing step built into LLVM IR and then
JIT executing it with the actual runtime argument values ; this is
the .This tracing approach has some interesting characteristics. Since we don't
have to analyze the source of the wrapped functions but only trace through
the execution, we can "magically" support a much richer set of programs, e.g.:This  with our basic . Since Python variables are
placeholders (references) for values, our tracing step is oblivious to them - it
follows the flow of values. Another example:This also just works! The created  will be a long chain of 
additions of 's runtime values through the loop, added to the 
for .This last example also leads us to a limitation of the tracing approach; the
loop cannot be  - it cannot depend on the function's arguments,
because the tracing step has no concept of runtime values and wouldn't know
how many iterations to run through; or at least, it doesn't know this unless
we want to perform the tracing run for every runtime execution .Tracing JIT case study: JAXThe JAX ML framework uses a tracing
approach very similar to the one described here. The first code sample in this
post shows the JAX notation. JAX cleverly wraps Numpy with its own version which
is traced (similar to our , but JAX calls these boxes "tracers"),
letting you write regular-feeling Numpy code that can be JIT optimized and
executed on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs via XLA. JAX's tracer builds up an underlying IR (called
jaxpr) which can then be
emitted to XLA ops and passed to XLA for further lowering and execution.For a fairly deep overview of how JAX works, I recommend reading the
autodidax doc.As mentioned earlier, JAX has some limitations
with things like data-dependent control flow in native Python. This won't work,
because there's control flow
that depends on a runtime value ():When  is executed, JAX will throw an exception, saying something
like:
This concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the
value of the argument count.As a remedy, JAX has its
own built-in intrinsics from the jax.lax package.
Here's the example rewritten in a way that actually works: (and many other built-ins in the  package) is something JAX
can trace through, generating a corresponding XLA operation (XLA has support for
While loops, to which this
 can be lowered).The tracing approach has clear benefits for JAX as well; because it only cares
about the flow of values, it can handle arbitrarily complicated Python code,
as long as the flow of values can be traced. Just like the local variables and
data-independent loops shown earlier, but also things like closures. This makes
meta-programming and templating easy .The full code for this post is available on GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An art exhibit in Japan where a chained robot dog will try to attack you to showcase the need for AI safety.</title><link>https://v.redd.it/sglstazd96je1</link><author>/u/eternviking</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:24:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI: The Age of AI Is Here!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97kQRYwL3P0</link><author>Two Minute Papers</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/97kQRYwL3P0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:18:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg">Two Minute Papers</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[❤️ Check out Lambda here and sign up for their GPU Cloud: https://lambdalabs.com/papers

Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for NLP and computer vision.For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern large language models (LLMs) without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in  the key concepts that should be studied.Natural language processing (NLP) is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.Before being converted into vectors, words undergo , which includes simple techniques such as , stemming, lemmatization, normalization, or removing . After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into . Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.The  method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance — a concept introduced in the  and  methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings. are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10–20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:  and . Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other large language models (LLMs).When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of  and , introduced in GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.Another important technique developed in recent years is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training. As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model’s weights.This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include ,, and .Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of  is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT’s rich knowledge to a specific domain.Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.As the name suggests,  involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called .In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet, and .Speaking of the object detection task, the  algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about , which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how generative adversial networks (GAN) function to generate images is a good way to broaden one’s horizons.In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.It would be very hard to present in detail the Roadmaps for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.First of all, recommender systems (RecSys) have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions. often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.Closely related to ranking, there is also a  problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair is mapped “well” according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited. is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity. is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier. is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to  find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.The word “approximately” means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms — sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression. involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:the target variable can have an overall , where in the long term its values increase or decrease (e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming).the target variable can have a  which makes its values change based on the currently given period (e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer).Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is , which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning. In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the “trial and error approach”). By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect. After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem. Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.Currently the most popular applications are:. Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans. The most well-known examples are chess and Go.. Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.. Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist. While most of the mentioned topics require time to master, they can add significant value to your portfolio. This is especially true for the NLP and CV domains, which are in high demand today.After reaching a high level of expertise in data science, it is still crucial to stay motivated and consistently push yourself to learn new topics and explore emerging algorithms.Data science is a constantly evolving field, and in the coming years, we might witness the development of new state-of-the-art approaches that we could not have imagined in the past.All images are by the author unless noted otherwise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Generate a Momento Disposable Token with Rust and Lambda</title><link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/generate-a-momento-disposable-token-with-rust-and-lambda-1a58</link><author>Benjamen Pyle</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:57:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Working with browser hosted code (UI) requires a developer to be cautious about exposing secrets and tokens.  A less than trustworthy person could take these secrets and do things that the user doesn't intend.  And while we are all responsible for our internet usage, token and secrets security from an application standpoint falls squarely on a developer's shoulders.  This is why when using Momento, I like to take advantage of the Authorization API.  What the Authorization API allows me to do is create a disposable token from a secure location, so that my UI clients can just refresh them as needed to work with Topics or Caches.  Thus, not having the credential leak up into the "easy to see" JavaScript code.  Let's dive into a Lambda Function coded in Rust that implements this Token Vending Machine concept with Momento.I usually like to work backwards to forwards, meaning I establish what I want in the end and then build from there.  When looking at a sample implementation, that means starting from the diagram and walking through what I'm building.A user's session will need to establish an authenticated and authorized connection to Momento by way of the JavaScript client SDK.  Every call to Momento is over an HTTP API request so it's going to get authenticated and authorized.  Which is a good thing!  However, doing this, requires a token which is what I'll be fetching from the Rust Lambda Function that will be demonstrated throughout the article.  The flow goes like this:1) User requires a token to connect to Momento
2) Browser makes a request to an endpoint backed by a Lambda Function
3) Rust Lambda Function uses a long-lived and secure API Token that has permissions to create short-lived disposable tokens
4) Rust Function uses the Momento SDK to request a token with the supplied Topic and Cache names with scopes to publish and subscribe
5) A token is returned from the Lambda Function where the client code can use to subscribe to a Momento topic.
6) The token has an expiration timestamp represented as a Unix Epoch so that the client can refresh before the token has a chance to expireSo let's walk through those steps above and explore the implementation.
  
  
  Implementing a Momento Token Vending Machine with Rust
I know I'm focusing on Lambda, Momento, and Rust, but there are many other components that go into what I'd consider a quality Lambda Function build.  To address those, let's have a look at the CDK code and what all gets shipped to AWS.TypeScript has become my goto when it comes to creating AWS infrastructure.  I like the CDK, and I especially like having the ability to use the Cargo Lambda CDK Construct.  If you haven't used it before, check out the repository and jump into the documentation.  It's straightforward and the classes inherit from AWS bases.  In addition to Cargo Lambda, I like to include the Datadog Lambda Extension.  This piece of goodness allows me to collect my OpenTelemetry traces into the Datadog UI for easy assessment of performance and any latency or error issues.  I'll highlight further as the article evolves.Here we go! The below is the CDK code that brings the above together.
  
  
  Adding the Datadog Extension
Pay special attention to the following when adding the Datadog extension.Region: I'm using the region my Lambda function is hosted inARM/x64: I'm picking the chip architecture that my Lambda Function is compiled for.
Version: 68 in this case, but  can also be used.
I'm going to use a long-lived API key with Momento so that this Lambda Function can make requests without worrying about expiration.  This is completely acceptable solution.  Think of it like a scoped API key essentially.  To set that up, I'm using AWS SecretsManager.
  
  
  Cargo Lambda Rust Function
Wrapping up the infrastructure components is the definition of the Rust Lambda Function and granting its ability to read from the secret defined above in SecretsManager.  Additionally, I'm exposing the function over a FunctionURL.  This of course could be internal behind an Application Load Balancer or exposed behind a variety of API Gateway setups.  The FunctionURL just makes this example simple to pull together.Key things to point out in the  are:Architecture: set to ARM because I prefer to run on the AWS Graviton chipsEnvironment: 

Setting RUST_LOG allows me to control crate log levels (this is a convention)
At this point, using CDK, I can easily run a  and my code will be live in AWS in just a couple of minutes.  However, I'd like to dive in further on the Rust and Lambda code, specifically addressing the Momento Auth piecesAll Rust code (unless it's a lib) starts out with a  function.  Even Lambda Functions must have a .  In my  below, I'm setting up Momento, Datadog, OpenTelemetry, and other reusable components.  Since my handler is what is called over and over, I want to have things warm and in memory, ready to use as events come in.To initialize the OpenTelemetry, I'm establishing a telemetry layer which I'm registering.The next pieces of  are about fetching the Momento API key from the AWS secret I defined in the infrastructure.  And with that secret, I'll construct an instance of the Momento Auth client so that I can communicate with the Auth API and create the disposable tokens.With all Lambda Functions, I need to define a function that will be called when the Lambda Function is supplied events.  For web APIs, that event is a request from an external client.   My  establishes this connection by the following code.As exposed, I need to send a Momento client, the expiration in minutes I want to let the token be valid for, and the event which is the web request.The Lambda Function handler does the following.Parse the body of the request 

Body in the correct format then generate the tokenIf not, return a 400 BAD REQUESTFor the request body, I'm expecting it to look like this.The Rust structure that this serializes into has the following definition.Now with a struct populated with my request data, I can look at how to generate the disposable token.  It's much easier than I thought it might be.
  
  
  Generating the Disposable Token
This disposable token logic is the heart of this Lambda Function's existence.  Remember, Client code or the UI is going to request a token that I want to scope down to the cache and topic supplied in the payload.  This will guarantee that the client has access to what's needed for the duration defined the environment variable discussed above.Let's break the above down just a little.  First up is the  and .The  plugs into OpenTelemetry that allows me to time the Momento operations by way of the Rust Instrument trait.  I highly recommend any Rust code you write take advantage of these opportunities.  Tracing in the spirit of observability will make finding errors and poor user experiences so much easier when you start to get some volume.The next piece of this function is to create the Disposable token.   are a required parameter to the generate_disposable_token function.  For my example, I'm giving the token access to Publish and Subscribe to the Cache/Topic combination.  And notice that the  parameter is finally being used to round out the function call.The last piece of the function is to create the .  The values returned from the Momento function call are used to populate the struct.
  
  
  Measuring Performance with Datadog and OpenTelemetry
So I can't end an article just demonstrating how to fetch disposable tokens written in Rust and deployed in a Lambda Function without talking about performance.  I am always blown away at the speed of Momento's services.  I hadn't done much work with the Auth API so I wanted to see if the timings that I've been accustomed to with Cache and Topics also held true with Auth.  With the observability code using OpenTelemetry that I've shown above, I'm able to not only track the Lambda Function's execution timings, but also the Momento specific API calls via the  trait that I showed above.  I bring this metrics and traces together via Datadog because there isn't a better tool on the market to help me observe my Lambda Functions as well as other cloud resources.
  
  
  High Level Function Latency
First up is looking at the high level Lambda Function latency. I'm graphing the 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles with this Datadog line graph.I've written about Rust and Lambda performance quite a bit over the past 18 months, but I'm always amazed at how quickly and consistently my function code performs with Rust. I can also make the same statements when it comes to pairing Rust with Momento.  Time and time again, their platform performs consistently, regardless of the load and requests I throw at it.  The same can be said about the Auth API that I'm exercising here.  Consistent p95 latency at the 3ms is just fantastic and not going to be noticeable by an end user.High level tracing is great and something that I love about using Datadog, but since I took advantage of the  trait further up, let's have a look at exactly how the Momento Auth operations play into the overall function latency.This table shows the two spans that are included in the overall latency of the Lambda Functions execution.  If you remember from the code well above, I called the Momento Auth span .  I'm happy all day long with an average latency of 1.25ms and a tail p99 latency of 2.19ms.  I can't recommend their Rust SDK enough.  It is my first and preferred way to work with Momento.Working with client code that is insecure by nature that also needs to authenticate with the Momento API for things like Topic subscriptions can be a challenge.  However, by implementing a token vending machine with Rust, deployed with Lambda, and monitored with Datadog produces a solution that is fast, reliable, and observable.  I've been saying this for a while, but I truly believe that building Lambda Functions with Rust is the way to go.  And I love seeing companies like Momento invest in Rust specific SDKs.  This feature to build disposable tokens was just added in 2025 and will unlock developers to implement this vending machine pattern in Rust like I've shown the article.

My overall stack time is about:Tableau Desktop – 10 yearsA few years ago, I embarked on a mission to be full stack. I picked up Python and learned how to do ETL operations on my own. I’ve heard great things about the speed and efficiency benefits of Rust over Python, so I wanted to put it to the test.The basic question I have is: what is the absolute furthest that I can take Rust in the direction of data science (to include AI applications) and data engineering? The library environment for data science is extremely robust for Python and I know it’s substantially smaller for Rust, but I’m still interested in taking it as far as I can. Over the next few months, I’m going to be upskilling in Rust and seeing where Rust for DS goes.I’m very aware of structural differences of Rust compared to Python. Memory management and static typing are elements that I’ve never had to care about, but it’s going to need to be a consideration moving forward. Ultimately, I think giving Rust a try will make me a more consciencious developer in that there are a lot of things I just took for granted with Python and SQL.I know absolutely no Rust right now, so I’m leaning on Duke University’s Rust Fundamentals course through Coursera to get me up to speed on the basics.The first week of the course revolved around setting up the VS Code environment for Rust, deploying GitHub Copilot, setting up the dev container, and dockerizing it.I’m very familiar with VS Code for local development, but actually using Docker and working in a containerized environment is new. I’ve been wanting to containerize my org’s Python development environment for at least a year (it’s further down the to-do list), so spending some time on this is gonna pay off later on.No actual Rust development work yet. Looking ahead, it appears that week 2 of the course jumps right into for and while loops.

All the facets that describe the shape and meaning of interesting data are not always captured in a handful of pre-generated figures. While we have powerful technologies available for presenting interactive figures — where a viewer can rotate, filter, zoom, and generally explore complex data  —  they always come with tradeoffs.Here I present my experience using a recently released Python library — marimo — which opens up exciting new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations across the entire field of data science.Interactive Data VisualizationThe tradeoffs to consider when selecting an approach for presenting data visualizations can be broken into three categories: — what visualizations and interactivity am I able to present to the user? — what are the resources needed for displaying this visualization to users (e.g. running servers, hosting websites)? – how much of a new skillset / codebase do I need to learn upfront? is the foundation of portable interactivity. Every user has a web browser installed on their computer and there are many different frameworks available for displaying any degree of interactivity or visualization you might imagine (for example, this gallery of amazing things people have made with three.js). Since the application is running on the user’s computer, no costly servers are needed. However, a significant drawback for the data science community is ease of use, as JS does not have many of the high-level (i.e. easy-to-use) libraries that data scientists use for data manipulation, plotting, and interactivity. provides a useful point of comparison. Because of its continually growing popularity, some have called this the “Era of Python”. For data scientists in particular, Python stands alongside R as one of the foundational languages for quickly and effectively wielding complex data. While Python may be easier to use than Javascript, there are fewer options for presenting interactive visualizations. Some popular projects providing interactivity and visualization have been Flask, Dash, and Streamlit (also worth mentioning — bokeh, HoloViews, altair, and plotly). The biggest tradeoff for using Python has been the cost for publishing – delivering the tool to users. In the same way that shinyapps require a running computer to serve up the visualization, these Python-based frameworks have exclusively been server-based. This is by no means prohibitive for authors with a budget to spend, but it does limit the number of users who can take advantage of a particular project. is an intriguing middle ground — Python code running directly in the web browser using WebAssembly (WASM). There are resource limitations (only 1 thread and 2GB memory) that make this impractical for doing the heavy lifting of data science. , this can be more than sufficient for building visualizations and updating based on user input. Because it runs in the browser, no servers are required for hosting. Tools that use Pyodide as a foundation are interesting to explore because they give data scientists an opportunity to write Python code which runs directly on users’ computers without their having to install or run anything outside of the web browser.As an aside, I’ve been interested previously in one project that has tried this approach: stlite, an in-browser implementation of Streamlit that lets you deploy these flexible and powerful apps to a broad range of users. However, a core limitation is that Streamlit itself is distinct from stlite (the port of Streamlit to WASM), which means that not all features are supported and that advancement of the project is dependent on two separate groups working along compatible lines.The interface resembles a Jupyter , which will be familiar to users.Execution of cells is , so that updating one cell will rerun all cells which depend on its output. can be captured with a flexible set of UI components.Notebooks can be quickly converted into , hiding the code and showing only the input/output elements.Apps can be run locally or converted into using WASM/Pyodide.marimo balances the tradeoffs of technology in a way that is well suited to the skill set of the typical data scientists: — user input and visual display features are rather extensive, supporting user input via Altair and Plotly plots. — deploying as static webpages is basically free — no servers required — for users familiar with Python notebooks, marimo will feel very familiar and be easy to pick up.Publishing Marimo Apps on the WebAs a simple example of the type of display that can be useful in data science, consisting of explanatory text interspersed with interactive displays, I have created a barebones GitHub repository. Try it out yourself here.Using just a little bit of code, users can:Generate visualizations with flexible interactivityWrite narrative text describing their findingsPublish to the web for free (i.e. using GitHub Pages)Public App / Private DataThis new technology offers an exciting new opportunity for collaboration — publish the app publicly to the world, but users can only see specific datasets that they have permission to access.Rather than building a dedicated data backend for every app, user data can be stored in a generic backend which can be securely authenticated and accessed using a Python client library — all contained within the user’s web browser. For example, the user is given an OAuth login link that will authenticate them with the backend and allow the app to temporarily access input data.As a proof of concept, I built a simple visualization app which connects to the Cirro data platform, which is used at my institution to manage scientific data. Full disclosure: I was part of the team that built this platform before it spun out as an independent company. In this manner users can:Load the public visualization app — hosted on GitHub PagesConnect securely to their private data storeLoad the appropriate dataset for displayShare a link which will direct authorized collaborators to the same dataAs a data scientist, this approach of publishing free and open-source visualization apps which can be used to interact with private datasets is extremely exciting. Building and publishing a new app can take hours and days instead of weeks and years, letting researchers quickly share their insights with collaborators and then publish them to the wider world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top 22 Sites To Buy Verified Binance Accounts personal</title><link>https://dev.to/hiya_tili_6b6c8383c5ae8c4/top-22-sites-to-buy-verified-binance-accounts-personal-41fk</link><author>Hiya Tili</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:21:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to more information just contact now.

Is there another way we can improve PHP's performance?In the previous post, we gave an overview of 1BRC, tried to push the limits of PHP when discussing performance optimization, and ran our best PHP script on an EC2 instance.The results were not bad, but not noteworthy either: 17.0636 seconds (the fastest Java code took 1.535 seconds).So what are we supposed to do? Call it a day and get on with our lives? No, obviously not!
We could "cheat" our way to a better score, by abusing one of Python's winning strategies: letting external libraries do the heavy lifting job!
  
  
  Foreign Function Interface
One of the ways to optimize an interpreted language is by moving the slow operations in an external module, usually written in a low-level language.
In PHP you can write system-wide modules and enable them in ; this is useful for generic functions or for code that is not specific to one application.
Since version 7.4 PHP introduced a new feature: Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
FFI is a method for calling external libraries in your PHP coding, without changing global PHP configuration.
This method is more flexible than dealing with modules, but configuring it could be a bit daunting at first.Let's try to wrap a Rust solution of 1BRC in a PHP script (yes, ok, we are definitely cheating).To keep things simple we need a Rust solution that:it's written in a clear wayit's composed of a few filesThere's no need to explain point ; points  and  are needed because we are going to modify the code to make it work as a module.
I love Rust, but I'm not a Rust programmer, so the simpler the code the better.  First of all, we clone the repository, then we edit the  file to add some options:In the  section, we enabled additional performance optimizations (, , ); we added the  section, where we specify that we want to compile the source as a  library (shared libraries that can be linked into external programs).   file is used just to call ; we remove this file and add a  method in : disables the mangle (in short: it keeps the function's name in the exported library) and marks this function as "to export".  We are cheating, but in a responsible way 😅: from PHP code, we pass the weather data filename to the Rust module. Then the Rust module returns the station's aggregated data to be displayed.
PHP is a loosely-typed language, while Rust is a strongly-typed language, so moving data between the two can be a bit of a challenge-in-the-challenge. We need  crate and  from .  The code needed to convert from PHP String to Rust string slice has been taken from ; using it's words:Getting a Rust string slice (&str) requires a few steps:We need to make sure that the C pointer is not  as Rust references are not allowed to be .Use  to wrap the pointer.  will compute the string's length based on the terminating . This requires an  block as we will be dereferencing a raw pointer, which the Rust compiler cannot verify meets all the safety guarantees so the programmer must do it instead.Ensure the C string is valid UTF-8 and convert it to a Rust string slice.In  we use this code:to return a JSON string to the PHP script.  That's it for Rust; we can compile the library with:On the PHP side first of all we need a class to manage the input and output of th Rust module. Let's create a file called :The constructor's code uses  to import the Rust function from the  file.
Here we have to declare the extern function's signature using C code, so the Rust  parameters, become .: it's also possible to use a  header file to specify the function(s) that PHP needs to know about; since we only need one simple function, it is easier to declare it inline in PHP code.The  method invokes the  method of the Rust module (self::$ffi->run($filename)). We called both this wrapper method and the Rust function with the same name (); this is only a coincidence (...or lack of fantasy); it's not mandatory. converts the pointer to a String usable in PHP.We also need an  file to instantiate this  class and to print the results:Nothing interesting here: we call our  method, passing it the measurements filename.
The JSON string from Rust contains temperatures as integers, so we need to divide them by 10 and calculate the average temperature for each station.Let's run this code on the EC2 instance. The configuration is the same as last time: an  with 32 vCPUs and 128GB of memory. For the hard disk, I opted for a 200GB io1 volume (to reach 10,000 IOPS).perf  1B-ffi.log  10  php app/index.php
and these are the results: Performance counter stats for 'php app/index.php' (10 runs):

This is a surprising result, considering the overhead of calling an external module and the fact that we are still making some calculations on the PHP side of the app.After this 2-parts-journey we can affirm that:PHP is slow, but the performance improves significantly when using threadsPerformance tuning is a game of trade-offs: you can improve the speed of a task by saturating all the CPU cores, but your system will become unresponsive. In PHP this is a problem if your application needs to accept more than one connection at a timeFor heavy tasks, you can delegate to optimized external librariesI hope you enjoyed the post!]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
