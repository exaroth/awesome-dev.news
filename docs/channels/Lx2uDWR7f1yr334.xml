He was staring at his dual monitors, scrolling through a massive file."You look deep in thought," Eleanor said softly, pausing at his desk."I'm refactoring the User Service," Ethan said, looking up. "You told me interfaces were the key to flexibility. So I made a  interface that handles everything a user might need.""It covers everything," Ethan said. "Now, whenever I need to do anything with users, I just pass this interface around. It fully decouples the code.""That is a very complete list," Eleanor agreed. "How are the unit tests coming along?"Ethan hesitated. "That is where I am running into some friction. I am trying to test the . It only needs to check the user's password, but the setup feels... heavier than I expected.""I spend more time writing empty mock methods than actual test code," Ethan admitted."It looks like that interface is carrying a lot of weight," Eleanor noted gently. "You are forcing the test to carry the whole library just to read one book."
  
  
  Consumer-Defined Interfaces
She pulled up a chair. "Ethan, in languages like Java or C#, you often define the interface  the implementation. You define the  upfront.""Right. That's what I did.""In Go, we can do it differently. We can define interfaces , not where they are implemented. This way, each package defines only the behavior it actually needs, not the entire capabilities of the dependency."She pointed to the  code."Let's look at what this handler actually needs," she suggested. "It certainly uses . But does it ever need to delete users or reset passwords?""No," Ethan said. "It just reads the user ID.""Then let's just ask for that," she said, typing. "We can make your life much easier.""Now look at your test," she said.Ethan stared at the screen. "That's it? I don't need to implement the other nine methods?""No," she smiled. "Because  doesn't ask for a  anymore. It asks for a . Anything that can get a user satisfies the requirement.""But what about my real code?" Ethan asked. "Do I need to go back to my  and tell it that it implements ?""Not at all. Your  already has a  method. In Go, interfaces are satisfied implicitly. Therefore, it  a ."
  
  
  The Interface Segregation Principle
"This is the Interface Segregation Principle," Eleanor explained. "Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use."She pointed to his original code."If you ask for a , you are technically depending on creating, updating, deleting, and auditing users. If you ask for a , you depend only on the read operation."Ethan started deleting lines of code."Return concrete structs from your service package," Eleanor advised. "Let the  define the small, precise interface they need. One method is best. Two is okay. Three is usually fine for cohesive operations, but if you see methods from different domains mixed together, consider splitting it."
  
  
  Key Concepts from Chapter 19

The tendency to create large, all-encompassing interfaces (like ) that describe an entire subsystem. This makes testing difficult because mocks must implement every method, even the ones irrelevant to the test.Consumer-Defined Interfaces:
In Go, interfaces should be defined by the  (the function calling the code), not the  (the struct implementing the code). Export a massive  interface in your  package. Define a small  interface in your  package that only includes the method you call."Accept Interfaces, Return Structs":
A standard Go design pattern.Functions should accept interfaces: This allows you to pass in any implementation (real or mock).Functions should return concrete structs: This gives the consumer the freedom to define their own small interfaces to describe that struct.
A type satisfies an interface if it implements the required methods. No explicit declaration (like ) is required. This allows you to create new, small interfaces that work with existing code without modifying the original structs.Next chapter: The Defer Statement. Ethan learns that defining what you need (interfaces) is half the battle; defining when to clean it up is the other half.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>✨ Beginner-Friendly Guide &apos;Minimum Cost to Convert String I&apos; - LeetCode 2976 (C++, Python, JavaScript)</title><link>https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-minimum-cost-to-convert-string-i-leetcode-2976-c-python-29h6</link><author>Om Shree</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 03:35:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Converting one string into another often feels like a simple find and replace task. However, when every individual character change has a specific price tag, and you can take multiple "detours" through other characters to save money, the problem transforms into a fascinating pathfinding challenge.Two strings,  and , of the same length.A set of allowed character transformations (e.g., change 'a' to 'b') and their associated costs.The ability to use multiple steps to reach a target character (e.g., 'a' to 'c' to 'b').Calculate the minimum total cost to transform every character in  to the corresponding character in .Return -1 if any character in the  cannot be transformed into the required  character. source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20] 28 To convert the string "abcd" to string "acbe":Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost. source = "aaaa", target = "bbbb", original = ["a","c"], changed = ["c","b"], cost = [1,2] 12 To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred. source = "abcd", target = "abce", original = ["a"], changed = ["e"], cost = [10000] -1 It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.1 <= source.length == target.length <= 105source, target consist of lowercase English letters.1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000original[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.original[i] != changed[i]
  
  
  Intuition: Thinking in Graphs
Think of the English alphabet as 26 distinct cities. Every transformation rule given in the input is a one-way road between these cities with a specific toll (the cost). Our task is to find the cheapest route from "City A" to "City B" for every character pair in our strings.Since we only have 26 possible characters, we can pre-calculate the shortest path between every possible pair of letters. Even if the input gives us a direct path from 'a' to 'b' costing 10, there might be a cheaper way: 'a' to 'c' (cost 2) and then 'c' to 'b' (cost 3), totaling only 5.We use the  to solve this. It systematically checks if passing through an intermediate letter 'k' provides a cheaper path between letters 'i' and 'j'. Once we have this 26x26 matrix of minimum costs, we simply iterate through our strings and sum up the values.
  
  
  Walkthrough: Understanding the Examples
Example 1: source = "abcd", target = "acbe" 'a' to 'a'. Cost is 0. 'b' to 'c'. The direct cost is 5. 'c' to 'b'. Direct cost is not available, but we can go 'c' to 'e' (1) and 'e' to 'b' (2). Total cost is 3. 'd' to 'e'. Direct cost is 20.Example 2: source = "aaaa", target = "bbbb"Rules: 'a' to 'c' (1), 'c' to 'b' (2).To get from 'a' to 'b', we must go through 'c'. Cost per character is .Since there are 4 characters, total cost is . When you need to find the shortest path between all possible nodes in a small graph (like the 26 letters of the alphabet), Floyd-Warshall is your best friend. Many problems that don't look like "maps" can be treated as graphs if they involve transitions between states with specific costs. When calculating minimums, initialize your values to a sufficiently large number to represent "impossible" paths, but ensure it doesn't cause overflow in your language.This problem is a classic example of why recognizing patterns is more important than memorizing code. In a real-world software system, this logic is used in things like network routing protocols or  where we need to find the most efficient connection between two points through various intermediaries. Mastering this ensures you can handle optimization tasks where the best path isn't always the most obvious one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deploying and Monitoring Large-Scale Go Network Apps Like a Pro</title><link>https://dev.to/jones_charles_ad50858dbc0/deploying-and-monitoring-large-scale-go-network-apps-like-a-pro-52b4</link><author>Jones Charles</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 03:27:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine your shiny Go API—maybe an e-commerce backend or a payment gateway—blazing through local tests. It’s handling thousands of requests like a champ. But what happens when Black Friday hits, and millions of users flood your app? 😅 Will it scale? Can you spot issues before customers do? This guide will take you from a local Go prototype to a production-ready, battle-tested system that thrives under pressure.
If you’ve got 1–2 years of Go experience, know your way around goroutines and HTTP servers, but feel shaky about large-scale deployment or monitoring, this is for you. We’ll demystify Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and monitoring with real-world code and tips. No fluff—just practical steps to make your Go app shine. 🌟
Go is the superhero of cloud-native apps. Its goroutines juggle thousands of tasks effortlessly, single-binary deployments are a breeze, and its standard library is like a developer’s Swiss Army knife. Whether you’re building for a global e-commerce surge or a rock-solid payment system, Go’s got your back.
We’ll cover Go’s concurrency magic, containerizing with Docker, scaling with Kubernetes, automating with CI/CD, and monitoring like a pro with Prometheus, Zap, and OpenTelemetry. Expect code snippets, real-world pitfalls, and a repo to play with (github.com/example/go-large-scale). Let’s dive in! 🏊‍♂️
  
  
  Why Go Rocks for Large-Scale Apps
Go is like a lightweight sports car for network apps—fast, reliable, and built for the cloud. Let’s see why it’s perfect for handling millions of requests daily, using an e-commerce API as our example.
  
  
  🧵 Concurrency That Scales
Go’s goroutines are lightweight threads (just a few KB!) that handle thousands of concurrent requests without breaking a sweat. Channels keep data in sync safely. Compare that to Java’s heavy threads or Python’s async juggling—Go’s concurrency is a game-changer.: Our e-commerce API spawns a goroutine per product request, aggregating results via channels. It handled 10,000 requests/second with ease, while Java might choke on thread overhead.
  
  
  📦 Single-Binary Simplicity
Go compiles to a single binary—no runtime dependencies, no mess. Unlike Python’s dependency nightmares or Node.js’s  chaos, Go’s deployment is as easy as copying a file.
  
  
  🛠️ Built-In Tools and Ecosystem
Go’s  and  packages are ready-made for networking. Its ecosystem—think Prometheus for metrics or Zap for logging—integrates like LEGO bricks. 🧱Static compilation and efficient garbage collection keep Go apps stable. Our e-commerce API ran for months without restarts, sipping just 500MB of memory.
  
  
  Segment 2: Deployment Strategies

  
  
  Deploying Go Apps Like a Boss 🏎️
Deploying a Go app is like prepping a race car: you need a solid base (Docker), smart orchestration (Kubernetes), and automation (CI/CD). Let’s use an e-commerce order service to show how to handle traffic spikes like Black Friday.
  
  
  🐳 Docker: Your App’s Shipping Container
Docker packages your Go app for consistency across environments. Go’s single-binary nature makes Docker images tiny and fast.: Use multi-stage Docker builds to keep images lean. Compile with , run with , and set  for a static binary.: Our order service once failed due to missing timezone data in Alpine. Adding  fixed it.Here’s a slick Dockerfile:0 linux go build  order-service ./cmd/order-service

apk add  tzdata
This cut our image size to ~15MB and slashed deployment time by 40%. 🚀
  
  
  ☸️ Kubernetes: Your Traffic Maestro
Kubernetes (K8s) is like a race engineer, scaling and balancing your app dynamically. Our order service used K8s to handle traffic surges.: Set  for redundancy, use  for health checks, and define / to avoid resource hogs.: A too-tight  (5s interval, 1s timeout) caused pod restarts during network hiccups. Loosening to 10s initial delay and 3s timeout fixed it.
  
  
  🤖 CI/CD: Automate All the Things
CI/CD is your assembly line, pushing code to production smoothly. We used GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy Docker images.: Split workflows (lint, test, build, push) and secure secrets with environment variables.: A missing  broke our CI. Validating env vars saved the day.Here’s a GitHub Actions workflow:: During Black Friday, our order service handled 100,000 requests/minute. K8s scaled pods dynamically, and CI/CD ensured zero-downtime updates. 🎉
  
  
  Segment 3: Monitoring Like a Pro

  
  
  Monitoring Your Go App: Catch Issues Before They Blow Up 💥
Monitoring is your app’s dashboard, showing its health in real time. For a payment system, you need to spot bottlenecks fast. Let’s cover metrics, logging, tracing, and alerts.
  
  
  📊 Key Metrics with Prometheus
Track latency, error rates, throughput (QPS), goroutine counts, and memory usage. Go’s  makes Prometheus integration a breeze.: Use custom metrics like . Use  for latency,  for errors.: Generic metric names like “errors” slowed debugging. Specific names like  cut debug time in half.Here’s a latency metric setup:
  
  
  📝 Structured Logging with Zap
Logs are your app’s diary. Structured JSON logs (via  or ) are easy to query.: Add fields like  and . Sample low-priority logs to save resources.: Unthrottled debug logs ate 50GB of disk. A 1GB rolling log strategy fixed it.
  
  
  🗺️ Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry
Tracing tracks requests across microservices, like GPS for your app. OpenTelemetry or Jaeger pinpoints slow queries.: Use unique s and sample selectively (e.g., 10% for most endpoints, 100% for critical ones).: Full tracing overloaded our backend. Sampling 10% balanced observability and performance.Here’s an OpenTelemetry example:
  
  
  🚨 Visualization and Alerts with Grafana
Grafana turns metrics into beautiful dashboards. Set alerts (e.g., Slack for 99th percentile latency >1s) to catch issues early.: Export dashboards as JSON for reuse. Set thresholds like 5% error rate over 5 minutes.: Over-sensitive alerts spammed our team. Adjusting thresholds reduced noise.: Grafana caught a 2-second latency spike in our payment system. Tracing revealed a slow DB query, fixed with an index, dropping latency to 200ms. 🙌
  
  
  Segment 4: Best Practices and Wrap-Up

  
  
  Best Practices and Gotchas 🛑
Deploying and monitoring Go apps is like tuning a race car—precision matters. Here’s what we learned:: Use multi-stage Docker builds, set K8s resource limits, and add health checks.: Track business metrics, use structured logs, and add tracing for microservices.: Leverage  for timeouts and  for goroutine leaks.: A payment service hit 10GB memory due to a blocked channel.  and timeouts saved us.: Bad pool settings caused hangs. Monitoring  and capping connections fixed it.: Generic names slowed debugging. Clear names like service_operation_errors_total sped things up.: Our order service crashed from goroutine leaks.  and Prometheus traced it to a forgotten channel. Adding  stabilized it.Go’s concurrency, simplicity, and ecosystem make it a dream for large-scale apps. With Docker, Kubernetes, and tools like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, you can build systems that scale and stay observable. Start small: build an API, containerize it, add metrics, and scale with K8s.: Go will dominate in Kubernetes and Istio.
: Its fast startup makes it perfect for serverless apps.
: Go’s simplicity lets me focus on code, not config. Its tools make debugging a breeze. Try it—deploy a small service and watch it shine! ✨: Clone the repo at github.com/example/go-large-scale, deploy a simple API, and experiment with Prometheus and K8s. Share your wins (or fails!) in the comments—I’d love to hear them! 😄]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>⚡️ YSvelGoK: The Ultimate Full-Stack Starter Kit</title><link>https://dev.to/yxl/ysvelgok-the-ultimate-full-stack-starter-kit-527e</link><author>Yax</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 03:27:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A deep dive into YSvelGoK: Combining SvelteKit, Go (Gin), and MongoDB into a dockerized powerhouse.
  
  
  Why I Paired Svelte with Go
We often find ourselves choosing between Developer Experience (DX) and .: Amazing DX, huge ecosystem, but can get heavy.: Incredible performance, tiny implementation, but authenticating and structuring a full-stack app from scratch takes time.I wanted the best of both worlds. So I built  (Yaxel's Svelte + Go Kit). Here's how it works under the hood.
  
  
  🔐 The "Soft Session" Authentication Pattern
Authentication is usually the biggest pain point in Go. I didn't want to rely on a third-party service like Auth0 for a boilerplate, but I also wanted more security than a standard stateless JWT.I implemented a hybrid approach I call .: User logs in, backend verifies Argon2 hash.: A simple document is created in MongoDB (, , ).: A JWT is signed containing the  (not just the User ID).
  
  
  The Secret Sauce: Middlewares
In my Go middleware, I don't just check the signature. I also verify the session is alive in MongoDB.This gives us  (like sessions) with the  of JWTs. MongoDB handles the cleanup automatically via a  on the  collection.Orchestrating a frontend, backend, and database manually is annoying. I used Docker Compose to bundle it all.The coolest part? Using  with  to ensure the API never crashes because the Database wasn't ready yet.
  
  
  🏎️ SvelteKit on the Frontend
The frontend uses SvelteKit, but configured to work seamlessly with an external Go backend.I use a  (hooks.server.js) to parse the JWT from cookies before the page even renders. This allows the SSR (Server Side Rendering) to know if a user is logged in immediately.This architecture has become my go-to for starting new projects. It's type-safe, compiles fast, and the frontend feels incredible.The code is open source. Feel free to clone it, break it, and fix it!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧩 Building a Number Snake Puzzle Generator in Python (with PDF &amp; JPG Export)</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/building-a-number-snake-puzzle-generator-in-python-with-pdf-jpg-export-2hho</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:34:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build a desktop app in Python that generates Number Snake math puzzles.

from tkinter import messagebox, filedialog
import random
import operator
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
from pathlib import Path
ttkbootstrap → modern dark theme + widgetsrandom + operator → puzzle mathreportlab → PDF generationPath → clean file handling🐍 Step 2 — Create the Main App ClassNow we define our application class:class NumberSnake:
    APP_NAME = "Number Snake Generator"
    APP_VERSION = "1.0"

    OPERATORS = {
        "+": operator.add,
        "-": operator.sub,
        "*": operator.mul,
        "/": operator.floordiv
    }
APP_NAME and APP_VERSION are just labelsOPERATORS maps symbols to real Python math functionsThis lets us randomly choose operations later.🖥️ Step 3 — Initialize the WindowInside , we configure the GUI:def __init__(self):
    self.root = tk.Tk()
    tb.Style(theme="darkly")

    self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
    self.root.geometry("1100x680")

    self.difficulty_var = tk.StringVar(value="Easy")
    self.num_puzzles_var = tk.IntVar(value=1)

    self.grid_numbers = []
    self.grid_ops = []
    self.solution_path = []
    self.target_number = None

    self.rows = self.cols = 0

    self._build_ui()
Sets defaults for difficulty and puzzle countInitializes empty puzzle dataCalls _build_ui() to draw the interface🎛️ Step 4 — Build the User InterfaceNow we create labels, dropdowns, and buttons:def _build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME,
             font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)

    opts = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Options", padding=10)
    opts.pack(fill="x", padx=10)

    tb.Label(opts, text="Difficulty:").pack(side="left")
    tb.Combobox(opts,
        values=["Easy","Medium","Hard"],
        textvariable=self.difficulty_var,
        width=10
    ).pack(side="left", padx=5)

    tb.Label(opts, text="Number of Puzzles:").pack(side="left", padx=10)
    tb.Spinbox(opts, from_=1, to=20,
               textvariable=self.num_puzzles_var,
               width=5).pack(side="left")
ctrl = tb.Frame(self.root)
ctrl.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=10)

tb.Button(ctrl, text="Generate Single Puzzle",
          bootstyle="success",
          command=self.generate_single_puzzle).pack(side="left", padx=5)

tb.Button(ctrl, text="Multiple PDFs",

tb.Button(ctrl, text="JPG Export",
          bootstyle="secondary",
          command=self.generate_multiple_jpgs).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Each button simply calls a method we’ll define later.🧠 Step 5 — Generate the Snake PuzzleThis is the heart of the project.def create_puzzle_data(self):
    diff = self.difficulty_var.get()
    self.rows, self.cols = (3,3) if diff=="Easy" else (4,4) if diff=="Medium" else (5,5)

    visited = [[False]*self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]
    r = c = 0

    self.solution_path = [(0,0)]
    visited[0][0] = True
Grid size depends on difficultyvisited tracks where we’ve beenmoves = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]

while len(self.solution_path) < self.rows * self.cols:
    random.shuffle(moves)
    for dr, dc in moves:
        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
        if 0<=nr<self.rows and 0<=nc<self.cols and not visited[nr][nc]:
            r, c = nr, nc
            self.solution_path.append((r,c))
            visited[r][c] = True
            break
This randomly walks through the grid, touching every cell once.➕ Step 6 — Fill Numbers and Operationsnumbers = [[0]*self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]
ops = [[None]*self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]

current = random.randint(1,9)
numbers[0][0] = current
steps = [f"Start: {current}"]
Then for every next cell:for r,c in self.solution_path[1:]:
    valid = False
    while not valid:
        op = random.choice(list(self.OPERATORS.keys()))
        num = random.randint(1,9)

        if op == "/" and current % num != 0:
            continue
        if op == "-" and current - num <= 0:
            continue

        next_val = self.OPERATORS[op](current, num)
        valid = True

    ops[r][c] = op
    numbers[r][c] = num
    steps.append(f"{current} {op} {num} = {next_val}")
    current = next_val
Avoid fractional divisionEnsure every puzzle is solvable with integers🎯 Step 7 — Display the Grid and SolutionWe draw labels for each cell:def display_grid(self):
    for r in range(self.rows):
        for c in range(self.cols):
            text = str(self.grid_numbers[r][c]) \
                   if self.grid_ops[r][c] is None \
                   else f"{self.grid_ops[r][c]}{self.grid_numbers[r][c]}"
Green cells highlight the snake path.The solution panel prints each math step:def show_solution(self):
    self.solution_text.delete("1.0", tk.END)
    self.solution_text.insert(tk.END, "\n".join(self.steps))
c = canvas.Canvas("puzzle.pdf", pagesize=A4)
c.drawString(50, 800, "Number Snake Puzzle")
Each puzzle can be saved separately or combined.🖼️ Step 9 — Export to JPGimg = Image.new("RGB",(900,700),(34,34,34))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
draw.text((20,20),"Number Snake Puzzle", fill="white")
Save as NumberSnake_1.jpg, NumberSnake_2.jpg, etc.Perfect for printable worksheets.▶️ Final Step — Run the AppAt the bottom of your file:if __name__ == "__main__":
    NumberSnake().run()
You now have a full desktop app that:Generates arithmetic snake puzzlesSupports batch worksheet creation]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I Discovered a Critical Security Gap in Our HashiCorp Vault - And What It Taught Me About Policy Design</title><link>https://dev.to/bhanu_prakash_bd40068f3b6/how-i-discovered-a-critical-security-gap-in-our-hashicorp-vault-and-what-it-taught-me-about-55e3</link><author>Bhanu prakash</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 01:59:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Day I Found a Security Hole in Our Vault Setup
The "Oh Shit" Moment
I was writing a Python script to inventory service accounts across our 50+ Vault namespaces when something caught my eye. Teams were creating auth mounts with weird names - stuff we never approved.Turns out, our wildcard policies had a massive flaw.What We Screwed Up
Our policy looked innocent enough:path "auth/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
We thought: "Let teams manage auth in their namespace. What could go wrong?"Everything. Everything could go wrong.That wildcard meant teams could create any auth mount type, not just the standard AppRole we supported. So they did:Custom AppRole mounts: auth/my-special-approle/Random Kubernetes auth (we don't even use K8s auth)LDAP configs that bypassed our central authExperimental mounts nobody remembered creatingOut of 50+ namespaces, 15% had rogue auth mounts we didn't know existed.Why This Actually Mattered
Monitoring blindspot: Our Splunk dashboards looked for auth/approle/. These custom mounts were invisible.Support hell: Teams configured Vault Agents wrong, got auth failures, opened tickets. We couldn't help because their setup didn't match our docs.Future nightmare: Try migrating 50 namespaces when everyone's doing their own thing.How I Found It
Simple inventory script:for namespace in all_namepaces:
    auth_mounts = vault_client.sys.list_auth_methods()
    for mount in auth_mounts:
        if mount not in ['approle/', 'token/']:
            print(f"WTF is this: {namespace}/{mount}")The output was... concerning.Checked Splunk to see if anyone was actually using these:index=vault_audit request.path="auth/*/login"
| stats count by request.namespace request.path40% had zero logins in 90 days. Dead mounts from old experiments.The Fix
Step 1: Stop the bleeding - locked down policies immediately:`Old (bad)
path "auth/*" { capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"] }path "auth/approle/*" { capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"] }`Step 2: Reached out to teams, made migration plansStep 3: Still migrating production stuff months later (it takes time)What I Learned
Wildcards are dangerous. Be explicit. Always.Your monitoring only catches what you're looking for. Inventory everything, not just what you expect.Standards aren't real until you enforce them. Documentation doesn't count if the system allows chaos.Fixing production takes forever. We're still cleaning this up.The Bigger Issue
This also exposed that our parent/child namespace model was overly complex. We eventually flattened everything - but that's Part 2.If You Run Vault
Check your policies right now:vault policy read your-policy | grep "*"Every wildcard is a potential problem. Can you be more specific?Then actually inventory what exists in your Vault. I bet you'll find surprises.Next up: Why we ditched nested namespaces and went flat. Plus the monitoring system I built to catch this stuff automatically.Drop a comment if you've hit similar issues.

It is well-known to be useful for logs and API calls, among other things. And your favorite AI assistant API is one place you'll probably find it.CsvPath Framework supports validating JSONL. (In fact, it supports JSONL for the whole data preboarding lifecycle, but that's a longer story). And now CsvPath Validation Language supports JSONPath expressions. Since AI prompts are only kinda sorta JSONL, having JSONPath to dig into them is helpful.What I mean by kinda-sorta is that your basic prompt sequence is a series of JSON lines, but the lines are all 1-column wide and arbitrarily deep. That sounds more like a series of JSON "documents" than it does like single JSONL stream. Or, anyway, that's my take.Let's look at how to use JSONPath to inspect a JSONL file using CsvPath Validation Language in FlightPath Data. For those of you who don't already know, FlightPath Data is the dev and ops frontend to CsvPath Framework. It is a free and open source download from the Apple MacOS Store or the Microsoft Store.The file is a common example prompt. We'll start by looking at one line.{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a happy assistant that puts a positive spin on everything."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I'm hungry."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Eat a banana!"
    }
  ]
}
From CsvPath Framework's perspective this is a one-header document. The one header is . If you open this in the grid view you see only the one header. (i.e. one column; but with delimited files we try to stick to the word "header" because with "column" your RDBMS-soaked brain starts to make incorrect assumptions).Here's what it looks like: That's not super fun. The reason is that:JSONL doesn't present its headers in the grid view (for good reasons)The  header is arbitrarily deeply nested, unlike the typical JSONL log lineNevertheless, that's what we have. Will it blend? I mean validate? Yes. JSONPath to the rescue. That said I'll pause to admit that I'm not a JSONPath expert.Right-click in the project files tree on the left of FlightPath and create a new  file, e.g. . Drop this simple example in it.$[*][ 
    push("roles", jsonpath(#messages, "$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content") )

    last() -> print("See the variables tab for results")
]
You can see the  function. It is acting on the  header, as we'd want. We're pushing the data pulled by the JSONPath expression into a stack variable named . A stack variable is like a Python list or tuple. You create a variable by using it.  is part of the set of zero or more variables that are available throughout the csvpath statement run. They are captured to the Variables tab for a one-off FlightPath Data test run. For a production run they end up in the  file in the run results.Put your cursor in the csvpath statement and click  (or  on Windows). The output tabs should open at the bottom-middle of the screen, below your csvpath file. Click to the  tab and have a look.$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content
picked out the objects in the  array where  equaled . And from those objects it extracted and returned the value of the  key. Pretty simple stuff. Tho, I have to admit it took me a few minutes to wrap  my JSONPath-inexperienced head around the context for the JSONPath expression. I was thinking of the whole document or the whole line, but that wasn't right.It is obviously the JSON value assigned to the  key, which is an array, in this case. Once I was operating from that correct context, the JSONPath became pretty straightforward. (Those of us with XPath scars need not be as afraid as we might be!)The point here is two-part. First, we can deal with AI prompts or any other JSONL that is deeply nested. Hooray! The data may look odd, if you are comparing it to regular tabular data, but that's no reason to not validate. Second, this example makes the point that we're doing JSONPath rules-based validation within our CsvPath context. How very Schematron-like, since Schematron does XPath validation within XSLT. Maybe this sounds complicated, but really it's not. CsvPath Validation Language is great for all things line-oriented. In this case, there isn't much for it to do, except hand off to JSONPath, which is great at documents (a.k.a. objects). Simple enough.If we wanted to create a bunch of JSONPath rules to validate our AI prompt JSONL, we could do that. To just do a quick throw-away second rule as an example try this:$[*][ 
    push("roles", jsonpath(#messages, "$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content") )

    @stmts = jsonpath(#0, "$.`len`")
    print("Line $.csvpath.line_number: $.variables.stmts")
    @stmts == 3 

    last.nocontrib() -> print("See the variables tab for results")
]
That new rule will net you 2 lines, which are either valid or failed, depending on how you want to use your csvpath statement. You will see them in the  tab.At the same time the expanded csvpath statement will continue to pull in the same data to the variables tab that we got with the first version of the csvpath.To clean it up just a little, you can do:$[*][ 
    push("roles", jsonpath(#messages, "$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content") )

    jsonpath(#0, "$.`len`") == 3
]
There you go, a valid 2-rule validation statement using JSONPath on nested JSON in a JSONL document. Useful? Totally! Give it a try.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a Serverless Geofencing Engine with Go &amp; PostGIS (to replace expensive APIs)</title><link>https://dev.to/alex_g_aeeb05ba69eee8a4fd/building-a-serverless-geofencing-engine-with-go-postgis-to-replace-expensive-apis-78i</link><author>Alex G</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:46:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently started working on a logistics side project that required real-time geofencing—specifically, detecting when assets enter or exit defined polygon zones.I looked at the market leaders (Radar, Google Maps Geofencing API, etc.), and while they are excellent, the pricing models usually charge per tracked user or per API call. For a bootstrapped project where I might have thousands of "pings" but zero revenue initially, paying for every spatial check wasn't viable.So, I decided to engineer my own solution.Here is a breakdown of how I built a serverless, event-driven Geo-fencing Engine using , , and . The latency between a location ping and a webhook event needed to be sub-second. I didn't want to pay for a K8s cluster idling at 3 AM. The system needed to handle concurrent streams without sticky sessions.

## The ArchitectureI chose Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for the infrastructure, managed via Terraform.
  
  
  1. The Compute Layer: Go + Cloud Run
I wrote the ingestion service in . Go was the obvious choice for two reasons: Handling thousands of incoming HTTP requests with lightweight goroutines. Since I'm using Cloud Run (serverless), the service scales down to zero when not in use. Go binaries start up incredibly fast compared to JVM or Node.js containers, minimizing the "cold start" latency penalty.

### 2. The Spatial Layer: PostGIS
This is where the heavy lifting happens. I'm using  with the  extension.Instead of doing "Point-in-Polygon" math in the application layer (which is CPU intensive and complex to handle for complex polygons/multipolygons), I offload this to the database.The core logic effectively boils down to efficient spatial indexing using GiST indexes and queries like:
  
  
  3. The "Glue": The Client SDKs
Building the backend was only half the battle. The friction usually lies in the mobile app integration—handling location permissions, battery-efficient tracking, and buffering offline requests.
To solve this, I built (and open-sourced) client SDKs. For example, the Flutter SDK handles the ingestion stream and retries, acting as a clean interface to the engine.
Trade-offs & Decisions Redis has geospatial capabilities (GEOADD, GEORADIUS), but it is primarily optimized for "radius" (point + distance) queries. My use case required strict Polygon geofencing (complex shapes). While Redis 6.2+ added some shape support, PostGIS remains the gold standard for robust topological operations.
Why Serverless? The traffic pattern for logistics is spiky. It peaks during business hours and drops to near zero at night. Cloud Run allows me to pay strictly for the CPU time used during ingestion, rather than provisioning a fixed server.
Open Source?
While the core backend engine runs internally for my project (to keep the infrastructure managed), I realized the Client SDKs are valuable on their own as a reference for structuring location ingestion.
I’ve open-sourced the SDKs to share how the protocol works:I'm currently optimizing the "State Drift" issue in Terraform and looking into moving the event bus to Pub/Sub for better decoupling.I’d love to hear feedback on the architecture—specifically if anyone has experience scaling PostGIS for high-write workloads!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Selamat Datang Di Sayabet</title><link>https://dev.to/cssayabet/selamat-datang-di-sayabet-2oni</link><author>Sayabet_Gacor</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:06:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Situs Resmi Dan Terpercaya Tahun 2026!!

Never hardcode secrets in production. Always use environment variables.
Placeholders are used here for learning purposes.The STK Push flow works as follows:Obtain an OAuth access token from DarajaGenerate a password using Shortcode + Passkey + TimestampReceive and process the callback from SafaricomConfiguration
package mainStep 1: Getting an OAuth Access TokenDaraja uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
We generate an access token using Basic Auth.This token is required for all subsequent Daraja API requests.Step 2: Sending an STK Push RequestTo initiate a payment request, we generate a password using:Base64Encode(Shortcode + Passkey + Timestamp)
go
Step 3: Handling the CallbackAfter the user completes (or cancels) the payment, Safaricom sends a callback to your endpoint.func stkCallbackHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var callback map[string]interface{}

    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&callback); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Invalid request", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    log.Println("Callback received:", callback)

    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    w.Write([]byte(`{"ResultCode":0,"ResultDesc":"Received successfully"}`))
}
ResultCode == 0 → Payment successfulAny other value → Payment failed or cancelledTo receive callbacks locally, expose your server using ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel.Step 4: Running the Application📌 Phone numbers must be in the format 2547XXXXXXXX```go{% embed  %}
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/mpesa/callback", stkCallbackHandler)go func() {
    log.Println("Server running on :8080")
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}()

token, err := getAccessToken()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

sendSTKPush(token, 1, "2547XXXXXXXX")

select {}


Testing in the Sandbox

Use test phone numbers provided by Safaricom

Ensure your callback URL is publicly reachable

Check logs for successful callback responses

Security Best Practices

Store secrets in environment variables

Validate callback payloads

Persist transactions in a database

Always verify payment status before fulfilling orders

Conclusion

Integrating M-Pesa Daraja STK Push using Golang is straightforward once you understand the authentication flow, request structure, and callback handling.

With this setup, you can build:

E-commerce platforms

SaaS billing systems

Internal payment tools

It applies a very simple syntax and a large number of functions to validate CSV, JSONL, and Excel files in ways that were never-before possible.And then comes the moment when you want to do some crazy thing that the CsvPath Framework contributors didn't think of. What to do? You create a custom function that does exactly that.Custom functions even work in FlightPath Data and FlightPath Server. I call that out because FlightPath Data is a multi-project environment. And FlightPath Server is both multi-project and also multi-user. That means functions must be scoped and sandboxed. They are and they work great! Let's create a trivial example to show the setup of a custom function. I'll leave the actual functionality as an exercise for the reader, since that part is demonstrated copiously in the CsvPath Framework Github repo.Our goal is to create a function called . It will functionally be the same as . I.e. it returns .Our csvpath statement will be:If you try that in FlightPath Data you will get this error message:The first step is to point to a functions import file. By default, import files are called  and live in the project's  directory. In FlightPath Data, click  at the bottom left of the app to open the config panel. Then click  in the vertical tabs to open the functions config form. The form has just one field for the path to the imports file. The path can be relative or absolute.Once the path is ready click  and then .Next we need to edit the imports file to include our  function. Right click on the blank space in the project files tree and select .Open the config directory and you should see three files, , , and . If you don't see all three don't worry about it; some files are generated just in time. If there is no  create one. Then open it.In  we're going to add one line that imports our  function.This is basically the same form as Python's. It says find the  file and import the  class, using the name  as the function name of the imported class. Simple!Finally we just need to put the custom function in the right place. The right place, starting from the project's home directory, is config/example/one/yes.py.I copied the regular  class from its file in the repo to make my example . Again, we're just setting up a custom function, not showing how to write an awesome function.This is where the  file lives.And... we're basically ready to go. However, if you ran a csvpath already, restart FlightPath to clear the function classes that were already loaded. You can do this programmatically in CsvPath Framework, but there's no button in FlightPath's config yet.That done, back in FlightPath Data right click in your project files tree and create a new file. Call it , or whatever you like.In it, paste our test csvpath:Now, with your cursor inside the csvpath statement, click  (or  on Windows). You should see the message Test run complete. Matched 2 lines. in the status bar and the printouts tab should be blank. (If your status bar says  but has a different number of lines don't worry about it; your test data and mine just aren't the same).For a bit of comfort that all is working as expected, add a print line like this and you should get the same printouts shown.And that's all there is to it. Now you'll never be stumped by the absence of , because you can write it yourself. To be fair, though, while a simple function can be trivial, as we just saw,  more complex functions can be... well, more complex. If you need help creating your awesome function don't hesitate to reach out. We'll be glad to help you get started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Privacy Engineering: Automated PII Detection and Redaction</title><link>https://dev.to/deepak_mishra_35863517037/privacy-engineering-automated-pii-detection-and-redaction-4phl</link><author>Lalit Mishra</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Executive Summary: The Engineering Imperative of Data Sanitization
The digitization of global commerce and the exponential growth of machine learning applications have fundamentally altered the relationship between software architecture and data privacy. Historically, privacy was relegated to the domain of legal compliance—a passive exercise in drafting Terms of Service, consent forms, and retention policies. In the modern data ecosystem, however, privacy has evolved into a hard engineering constraint. It is no longer sufficient to promise privacy; systems must be architected to enforce it deterministically.For senior privacy engineers and data platform architects, the mandate is clear: shift from "compliance by policy" to "compliance by code." The ingestion of unstructured data—whether through high-concurrency web scraping, log aggregation, or third-party API consumption—introduces a significant risk vector. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) acts as a contaminant within the data lake, turning valuable datasets into "toxic assets" that attract regulatory scrutiny and compromise downstream machine learning models.This blog articulates a comprehensive framework for "Privacy Engineering," treating data sanitization as a core software engineering discipline. We explore the architectural failure modes of naive ingestion, the technical supremacy of Microsoft Presidio as a detection standard, and the implementation of robust, privacy-aware pipelines. By integrating Named Entity Recognition (NER), context-aware logic, and advanced cryptographic redaction strategies, engineering teams can dismantle the traditional friction between data utility and data privacy, ensuring alignment with GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI safety standards.Let make our mood light with a pretty funny meme 😊!
  
  
  The Anatomy of a Failure: When "Public" Data Becomes a Liability
To understand the necessity of privacy engineering, one must first analyze the catastrophic failure modes of naive data ingestion. A prevailing misconception among data engineers is that "public" data—information accessible without authentication on the open web—is free from privacy constraints. This assumption is legally perilous and technically flawed.Consider a hypothetical scenario involving "FinScrape Analytics," a fintech entity developing alternative credit scoring models. The engineering team deploys a distributed scraping architecture using headless browsers (e.g., Playwright or Selenium) to aggregate professional profiles from public social media platforms, industry forums, and corporate "About Us" pages. The objective is to extract job titles, employment history, and public endorsements to infer creditworthiness. The scraper is designed to extract  and  content based on CSS selectors. However, the unstructured text within these containers often contains unsolicited PII that the scraper is not designed to recognize or filter. A forum post scraped for sentiment analysis contains a user pasting their personal phone number and email address to resolve a customer service dispute. A scraped corporate biography inadvertently captures a home address listed alongside a business address, or a personal mobile number used for emergency contact. The text contains inferred political opinions, trade union membership, or health data (Special Category Data under GDPR Article 9), which requires explicit consent to process, regardless of its public availability.
  
  
  The Regulatory Blast Radius
Upon ingestion, this raw text is serialized (e.g., JSON or Avro) and dumped into a Data Lake (S3, Azure Blob Storage) and subsequently loaded into a data warehouse like Snowflake. The PII is now "at rest" and replicated across multiple environments (development, staging, production).GDPR Violation (Article 5 - Data Minimization): The company collected data irrelevant to the specified purpose. The principle of data minimization dictates that only data strictly necessary for the purpose should be processed.GDPR Violation (Article 14 - Notification): Since the data was not obtained directly from the subject, the company maintains an obligation to notify the individuals—an operational impossibility given the volume of millions of records. Regulatory bodies like the French CNIL and Irish DPC have aggressively penalized companies for scraping public data without valid legal bases or sanitization measures. For instance, the French DPA fined a data broker €240,000 for scraping LinkedIn profiles without adequate transparency or legal basis, emphasizing that "public" availability does not negate privacy rights. Similarly, Meta (Facebook) faced a €265 million fine related to a scraping leak, underscoring that the failure to implement "technical and organizational measures" to prevent PII harvesting is a punishable offense. The failure was not in the scraping code’s ability to fetch HTML, but in the pipeline’s lack of a "Privacy Firewall." Privacy Engineering dictates that no unstructured text should land in persistent storage without passing through a decontamination layer.
  
  
  Privacy Engineering: A Core Discipline
The transition from legal checkpoints to engineering checkpoints requires a fundamental change in how data pipelines are conceived. Privacy Engineering operationalizes abstract legal principles into concrete code execution, moving the responsibility from the legal department to the DevOps and Data Engineering teams.
  
  
  The Privacy-by-Design Pipeline Model
Traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes often treat privacy as a governance task performed after loading—typically triggered by an audit or a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). Privacy Engineering moves this to the "Transform" phase, or even earlier, to the "Extraction" phase, creating a proactive defense mechanism.Table 1: The Shift from Compliance to EngineeringLegal/Compliance ApproachPrivacy Engineering ApproachIngestion event (Real-time/Batch)Policy documents & retention schedulesCode-level filtering & sanitizationRetroactive deletion/suppressionProactive redaction/tokenizationSpreadsheets, Legal CounselNLP Models, Regex, Vaults, PresidioCompliance Certifications (SOC2, ISO)Recall/Precision of PII Detection, Latency
  
  
  Shift Left: Sanitization at the Edge
The most effective privacy architecture sanitizes data as close to the source as possible. In a scraping context, this means analyzing the text payload within the scraper’s memory space or immediately upon message queue ingestion (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis), before writing to disk. This aligns with the GDPR principle of Data Protection by Design and by Default (Article 25). By stripping PII from the payload before it enters the data lake, the "toxic asset" liability is neutralized immediately. Raw identifiers never spread across logs, backups, or downstream systems, limiting the "blast radius" of any potential breach.This "Shift Left" approach fundamentally changes the economics of data protection. Remediation of PII deep within a data warehouse is computationally expensive and operationally complex (requiring rewrite of immutable partitions). Sanitization at ingestion is a linear cost associated with compute, preventing the compounding debt of privacy risk.
  
  
  Technical Deep Dive: Microsoft Presidio
To implement this vision, engineers require a robust, extensible, and production-ready detection engine. Microsoft Presidio has emerged as the industry standard open-source framework for this purpose. Unlike proprietary SaaS solutions that act as black boxes, Presidio offers the transparency, modularity, and on-premises deployment capabilities required for high-stakes engineering.
  
  
  Architecture: Separation of Concerns
Presidio’s architecture is bifurcated into two distinct, decoupled services: the  and the . This separation is critical for auditability and flexibility, allowing detection logic to evolve independently of redaction policies.
The Analyzer is the detection brain. It ingests unstructured text and outputs a list of detected entities with confidence scores and location indices. It is stateless and read-only regarding the text transformation. The  coordinates the detection process. It manages a registry of "Recognizers" and aggregates their results. These are the logic units. Presidio supports multiple types to maximize coverage and accuracy:

 Use Regular Expressions (Regex) for structured data like credit card numbers, email addresses, and IP addresses. These are computationally efficient and deterministic. Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) models (via spaCy, Stanza, or HuggingFace Transformers) to detect context-dependent entities like Person Names (PER), Locations (LOC), and Organizations (ORG). This allows the system to distinguish "George Washington" (Person) from "Washington" (Location). Implement complex validation logic, such as Luhn algorithm checks for credit cards or checksums for national IDs, reducing false positives from random number sequences. These components boost the confidence score of a detected entity if specific "context words" are found in proximity (e.g., boosting a 9-digit number's score if the word "SSN" or "Social" appears nearby).
The Anonymizer is the transformation muscle. It accepts the original text and the metadata payload from the Analyzer (the list of  objects) to apply specific operations. The Anonymizer executes "Operators" on the detected spans. Standard operators include  (substitution),  (deletion),  (e.g., ), and  (SHA-256/512). Crucially, the Anonymizer supports encryption operators, allowing for reversible pseudonymization if the engineering team manages the encryption keys securely. This enables specific authorized workflows to decrypt data while keeping it opaque to general analytics.
  
  
  NER vs. Regex: The Precision-Recall Trade-off
A sophisticated privacy engineer understands when to deploy NER versus Regex, as the choice impacts both accuracy and system latency.Regular Expressions (Regex): Pattern matching based on character sequences. Highly structured identifiers (Email, IPv4/v6, IBAN, SSN, Phone Numbers). Extremely low latency, deterministic, high precision for strict formats. Fails on unstructured, ambiguous entities. A regex cannot reliably distinguish a person's name from a street name or a common noun. Broad regex patterns (e.g., \d{9}) suffer from high false-positive rates without context.Named Entity Recognition (NER): Statistical models (Deep Learning/Transformers) trained on labeled corpora (e.g., OntoNotes) to predict entity tags based on linguistic context and word vectors. Unstructured entities (Person Names, Organizations, Geopolitical Entities). Context-aware. Can identify "Apple" as an Organization in "Apple released a phone" and as a fruit in "I ate an apple." Higher latency (requires model inference), non-deterministic (probabilistic), requires GPU/TPU for high throughput, larger memory footprint. Evaluation on datasets like CoNLL shows high F1 scores but highlights the computational cost. Presidio excels by combining both. It uses NER to find the "Person" and Regex to find the "Email," then aggregates the results using a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., prioritizing the match with the higher confidence score). This hybrid approach allows engineers to leverage the speed of regex for structured data while relying on the sophistication of NER for ambiguous text.
  
  
  Multilingual Support and NLP Engines
Global scraping operations encounter diverse languages, necessitating a multilingual approach. Presidio’s abstraction layer allows swapping the underlying NLP engine via the . The default engine. Fast, production-ready, with models available for dozens of languages (e.g., , , ). It strikes a balance between performance and accuracy. A Stanford NLP library that often provides higher accuracy for low-resource languages but comes with a higher latency cost. Presidio supports integration with . For state-of-the-art accuracy, engineers can integrate HuggingFace Transformers models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) tailored for NER tasks. While computationally intensive, these models offer superior performance on complex, nuanced text.
  
  
  Architecting the Privacy-Aware Scraping Pipeline
To operationalize Presidio, we propose a "Privacy Firewall" architecture. This pipeline ensures that no raw data is persisted without inspection, adhering to the principle of "Defense in Depth".
  
  
  The Pipeline Flow: Scrape -> Detect -> Redact -> Audit -> Store

  
  
  Python Integration Workflow
The following section details the code implementation of this architecture, demonstrating how to integrate Presidio into a Python-based processing worker.
First, we establish the environment with the necessary libraries. We initialize the  with a registry containing both pre-defined and custom recognizers.4.2.2 The Ingestion and Cleaning Phase
Scraped content is often raw HTML. Analyzing HTML tags directly can confuse NER models (e.g., misinterpreting class names as entities). We must extract visible text while preserving structure where necessary for context.
  
  
  The Detection and Redaction Core
This is the heart of the pipeline. We define a transformation policy: Names are replaced with placeholders, Phones are masked, and specific internal IDs are hashed to allow for referential integrity without exposure.This code snippet demonstrates a self-contained, reproducible unit of the Privacy Firewall. In a production environment, the  function would be the entry point for the Kafka consumer worker.
  
  
  Advanced Redaction Strategies: Beyond Simple Masking
While simple masking () satisfies basic compliance, it often destroys data utility. Analytics and ML teams typically need to preserve the referential integrity of the data without exposing the identity. For example, knowing that "User A" behaved similarly to "User B" is valuable, even if we don't know who "User A" is. Privacy Engineering offers several advanced strategies to bridge this gap.
  
  
  Hashing (Deterministic Anonymization)
Hashing converts PII into a fixed-size string (e.g., SHA-256).. Presidio supports this via the  operator. Consistent. The same email address always hashes to the same string, allowing for  operations across different datasets and frequency analysis (e.g., "How many unique users visited?"). Vulnerable to Rainbow Table attacks if the input space is small (e.g., phone numbers or 6-digit IDs). To mitigate this, engineers must apply a cryptographic salt (a random string added to the input before hashing). Presidio allows configuration of hash types (, , ).
  
  
  Reversible Tokenization (Vault-Based)
For scenarios where PII might need to be recovered (e.g., a support ticket scraping pipeline where an agent might need to contact the user later), irreversible hashing is insufficient. We need .In a Vault-based architecture, the PII is swapped for a random token (UUID or a format-preserving token). The mapping (Token <-> PII) is stored in a secure, isolated "Vault" (e.g., Redis or an encrypted SQL table) with strict access controls.Presidio Integration with Vaults: While Presidio handles the detection and logic, the "Vault" interaction usually requires a custom operator or an integration with the  operator using a symmetric key. When Presidio detects an entity, it calls a custom function that checks the Vault (e.g., Redis). If the PII exists, it retrieves the token; if not, it generates a new token, saves the pair to the Vault, and returns the token to replace the text. This concentrates the risk into the Vault. Securing the Vault (via encryption at rest, strict IAM roles, and network isolation) secures the entire dataset.Table 2: Redaction Strategy ComparisonHigh (Decryption possible)High (Referential integrity)Highest (Data separation)
  
  
  Cryptographic Erasure and Deanonymization
A profound benefit of encryption-based pseudonymization or vault-based tokenization is "Cryptographic Erasure." To comply with a GDPR "Right to be Forgotten" (Article 17) request, one does not need to hunt down every instance of a user's data across petabytes of backups and data lakes. Instead, one simply destroys the encryption key or the Vault mapping associated with that user. The data remains in the lake but is mathematically irretrievable—effectively erased.Conversely, authorized systems can use the Presidio Deanonymize Engine to revert the process. By providing the encrypted text and the correct key (or token and Vault access), the  restores the original PII for legitimate business purposes.
  
  
  GDPR/CCPA Alignment via Code
Privacy Engineering translates legal articles into software functions, providing demonstrable compliance.
  
  
  Data Minimization (GDPR Art. 5(1)(c))
The code in Section 4.2.3 explicitly defines . By detecting only specific types and ignoring others, the system enforces minimization. If the scraper encounters a  but that entity is not in the  list (or is in a configured block-list), it is not processed as PII. Alternatively, if strict minimization is required, the policy can be configured to redact any detected entity type unless explicitly allowed (Allow-list approach).
  
  
  Purpose Limitation (GDPR Art. 5(1)(b))
By segregating the PII into a secure Vault (Tokenization) or hashing it, we technologically enforce purpose limitation. Data Scientists act on the tokenized data for modeling (Purpose A - Analytics). Customer Support accesses the Vault to retrieve the email (Purpose B - Support). Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the Vault enforce the separation, ensuring that analysts cannot accidentally view raw contact details.
  
  
  Contextual Logic for False Positives
Presidio allows "Context Words." For example, to reduce false positives for , the recognizer can be configured to require words like "driver", "license", "id", or "dl" to appear within a window of N tokens around the match. This is crucial for reducing "over-redaction," where non-PII data (like product serial numbers) is mistakenly redacted, destroying data utility. This tuning directly supports data accuracy principles.
  
  
  Operational Excellence: Tuning and Monitoring
Deploying Presidio in production is an iterative process. Models drift, and scraping targets change structure. Operational excellence requires continuous monitoring and tuning.
  
  
  Handling False Positives and Negatives
 Do not deploy straight to production with active redaction. Run the pipeline in "Shadow Mode" where detection results are logged but not applied (or applied to a shadow copy of the data). A human analyst or a secondary automated system samples the logs to verify recall (Did we miss PII?) and precision (Did we redact valid text?). Presidio returns a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0) for each detection.

 (e.g., handling medical data/PHI): Set a  (e.g., 0.3-0.4) to prioritize . It is better to redact a harmless number than to leak a patient ID (False Positive > False Negative). Set a  (e.g., 0.7-0.8) to prioritize Precision. You want to preserve data utility and avoid corrupting the dataset with aggressive redaction. Maintain an allow-list for terms that look like PII but aren't (e.g., company support emails , known dummy numbers, or generic addresses). Presidio supports  functionality to bypass specific values.
  
  
  Performance Tuning and Latency
 NER models (spaCy/Transformers) are CPU/GPU intensive. For high-throughput scraping (thousands of pages/sec), Presidio can become a bottleneck. Benchmarks indicate that out-of-the-box spaCy models have a latency of ~15ms per sample, while Transformer-based models can spike to ~50ms+ per sample.

 Use  to process texts in bulk, amortizing the overhead of model calls. Offload detection to GPU-enabled nodes if using Transformer models. Use Regex-based recognizers primarily and reserve NER only for fields where context is ambiguous. Implementing a Redis cache for repeated text snippets (e.g., common headers/footers in scraped HTML) can drastically reduce inference costs. If the same privacy policy text appears on every scraped page, analyze it once and cache the result.
  
  
  Downstream Benefits: ML and RAG Safety
The investment in upstream Privacy Engineering pays dividends downstream, particularly in the era of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves feeding retrieved documents into an LLM context window to generate answers. If the scraped documents contain PII, the LLM might leak it in the generated answer. By sanitizing the ingestion pipeline, the Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) contains only anonymized embeddings. This ensures that the RAG system is "secure by design"—even if the LLM is prompted to reveal PII, the source data it retrieves is already clean.
  
  
  Removing Bias and Memorization
LLMs trained on datasets containing names and demographics often learn distinct biases associated with those identities (e.g., associating certain names with specific professions). Anonymizing names () and masking demographics helps de-bias the training data. Furthermore, it prevents the model from "memorizing" specific individuals, mitigating Model Inversion Attacks where an attacker queries the model to extract training data.The era of unrestricted data collection is over. For senior engineers, the adoption of tools like Microsoft Presidio represents a necessary evolution in platform architecture. By embedding privacy controls directly into the ingestion pipeline, we move beyond the fragility of "compliance checkboxes" to the robustness of "Privacy Engineering." We do not just protect our users; we protect the future of our data platforms. The code provided herein is your starting block—build your firewall, tune your models, and treat privacy as a first-class citizen in your software stack. The risk of inaction is no longer just legal; it is existential.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Case Study: Saving 20 Hours a Week for a Real Estate Agency with AI Agents</title><link>https://dev.to/frankdotdev/case-study-saving-20-hours-a-week-for-a-real-estate-agency-with-ai-agents-33b9</link><author>Frank Oge</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 20:55:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Real Estate is a numbers game. But it’s also an exhaustion game.
​I recently consulted for a mid-sized agency here in Lagos. Their problem wasn't a lack of leads; it was Lead Fatigue.
For every 100 people who messaged them on WhatsApp asking "How much?", only about 3 were serious buyers with the budget to proceed.
​The agents were spending 4 hours a day just answering the same three questions:
​"Is it still available?"
​"What is the price?"
​They were human FAQs.
​I proposed a solution: Let’s fire the humans from the 'First Response' layer and hire an AI Agent.
​Here is how I built a system that not only answers questions but qualifies leads and books inspections automatically.
​We didn't want a "dumb" chatbot that just gives static replies. We needed an Agent that could query their specific database of properties.
​Brain: OpenAI (GPT-4o) via LangChain.
​Communication: Twilio (WhatsApp API).
​Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector).
​Knowledge Base: A live sync of their property listings.
​Phase 1: The "RAG" Knowledge Base
​The biggest challenge was accuracy. The AI couldn't hallucinate a price.
We used RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
​When a user asks, "Do you have any 3-bedroom flats in Ikeja under N5m?"
​The system converts the query into a vector.
​It searches Supabase for matching properties.
​It retrieves the exact data (Price, Location, Features).
​It feeds this to GPT-4o to generate a polite, human-like response.
​Result: The bot never guesses. It only sells what is in stock.
​Phase 2: The "Guardrail" Qualification
​We instructed the AI to act like a senior sales agent. Its goal wasn't just to chat; it was to qualify.
​"You are a helpful Real Estate Assistant. Your goal is to get the user to book an inspection. Before booking, you must politely ask for their budget and timeline. If they cannot afford the property, politely suggest cheaper alternatives."
​This filter alone saved the human agents hours of driving to inspections with clients who had zero intention of buying.
​Phase 3: The Handoff
​If the user is serious and agrees to a time, the AI Agent uses a "Tool" (via LangChain) to check the human agent's Google Calendar and book the slot.
The human agent gets a notification: "New Inspection Booked: Mr. Obi, 3 Bedroom, Budget Verified."
​After 30 days of running this pilot:
​Response Time: Dropped from ~2 hours to <1 minute.
​Agent Workload: Reduced by ~20 hours/week (no more answering "How much?" at 10 PM).
​Conversion: Inspection bookings increased by 15% because the bot replied instantly while leads were hot.
​Conclusion
​We are past the era of "Chatbots." We are in the era of "AI Agents."
A chatbot follows a script. An Agent uses tools, makes decisions, and performs work.
For this agency, it was the difference between being busy and being profitable.

We have an engineering analysis process that required large amount of inputs to be collected from engineers which contained deeply nested structure with multiple input types. As any sane python developer will do these days, we used pydantic models to both structure our mental model and also to validate this massive input (which comes in the form of a yaml file)Even though yaml is a decent format to use for structured input, it's still quite verbose to hand-craft and it can be quite tricky to get all the indents right. So we needed a decent UI which can be used to fill in this input. The thought was, Instead of writing a UI specifically for our data structure, why not infer the structure dynamically from the already existing pydantic model? It can also give us proper (and upfront) validation errors if there are errors in the input. If we can sprinkle a little more customization on top of the existing pydantic model, it can be quite powerful. That's exactly what I ended up doing (with a lot of help from claude opus 4.5). We thought of open-sourcing our solution.Here's pydantic-ui. It a bit opinionated, but also lets you configure quite a lot.

  Ruff: Because Life Is Too Short for Slow Linters
Remember pylint? You'd run it, go make coffee, come back, still running. So everyone disabled it. Problem solved. Also: problems not solved at all.Ruff is written in Rust. It runs in milliseconds. You can't even alt-tab fast enough to avoid it.That ASYNC rule at the bottom? That's the one that saves your weekends.Here's how to tank your server in one line:This blocks the entire event loop. Every user. Every request. Everything stops while your code takes a little nap. No error. No warning. Just... silence. And then your phone rings at 3 AM.No kidding. You put  in async code.ASYNC100: blocking call `time.sleep` in async function
The fix takes two seconds:I make this mistake weekly. Sometimes daily. My brain refuses to learn. Fortunately, Ruff doesn't care about my brain. Ruff just yells. That's the relationship.
  
  
  MyPy: Because "It Works" Is Not a Type
Python is dynamically typed. This means you can write this:What is ? Could be a string. Could be a list. Could be your hopes and dreams. Python doesn't care. Python will try to call  on anything. Python believes in you.Python is wrong to believe in you.MyPy strict mode fixes this by being incredibly annoying:Now you have to actually say what things are:Is this more typing? Yes. Is this tedious? Also yes. Will this save you from a 4-hour debugging session because you passed a dict to a function expecting a string? Absolutely yes.The AI also loves types. Give it typed code and it knows exactly what to generate. Give it untyped code and it hallucinates confidently. Your choice.Linters catch a lot. But not everything. Third-party libraries do weird things. Someone's "async" wrapper is actually sync. Life is full of disappointments.So I run tests with the event loop in paranoid mode:Anything takes longer than 100ms? Test fails. Loudly. Rudely. Exactly as it should.Belt and suspenders.

  Why I Let AI Choose My Technologies
The philosophy is clear: programming by coercion. Make the machine enforce quality. But which machine? Which stack?Here's a confession: I didn't pick this stack because it's the best. I picked it because AI knows it by heart.Python. FastAPI. TypeScript. React. PostgreSQL. Nothing exciting. Nothing cutting-edge. Nothing that will impress anyone at a conference.
  
  
  The Training Data Advantage
AI generates code based on training data. More examples = better output. Simple as that.You can use that fancy new Rust framework with 200 GitHub stars. AI will hallucinate half the API. You'll spend your evening fixing AI mistakes instead of watching your show.Or you can use technologies with millions of examples in the training data. AI gets it right the first time. You ship faster.I chose option two. My ego will recover.Every AI coding benchmark uses Python. HumanEval, MBPP, SWE-bench—all Python. Coincidence? No. AI understands Python better than any other language.AI generates this correctly every time. Try the same in Scala, Go or Rust. Good luck.Flask is fine. Django is fine. But FastAPI has something they don't: types everywhere and OpenAPI out of the box.AI reads this signature and knows exactly what to generate. Input types, output types, dependency injection—all explicit. No guessing."Just write raw SQL, it's simpler."Sure. And AI will generate SQL injection vulnerabilities, wrong column names, and type mismatches. I've seen it. Multiple times. In one afternoon.SQLAlchemy gives AI structure:AI can't accidentally concatenate user input. The ORM pattern is type-safe by design.I naturally chose relational databases—they enforce typing by design.PostgreSQL because it's the industry standard: mature, stable, perfect migrations, unbelievable backward compatibility.MySQL/MariaDB could work, but I prefer real open source without Oracle's shadow. And I'm still unable to rename a database without voodoo file manipulation—am I the only one shocked by this?NoSQL with MongoDB or Neo4j looks cool, but I'll stick with boring PostgreSQL for type enforcement. AI has seen millions of examples. I'm guaranteed to run it seamlessly for years.This one's not about AI. It's about sanity.uv 
uv run pytest
10-100x faster than pip. Deterministic builds. I'm not interested in watching never-ending package installations, even with Netflix on. I switched and never looked back.With 10 sync workers, a 200 ms request caps you at ~50 RPS (25 RPS at 400 ms) because each worker naps while Postgres thinks.
With async, the same setup can handle ~500 RPS (250 RPS at 400 ms) by multitasking instead of staring at the wall.Python async used to be a footgun. AI would forget  constantly.Now we have Ruff with async rules. AI still forgets . The linter catches it. Problem solved.This is programming by coercion in action.
  
  
  The Frontend That Just Works
JavaScript has no types. AI doesn't know what functions expect. Refactoring is prayer-based.TypeScript strict mode forces AI to be explicit:AI knows the input. AI knows the output. AI generates correct code.I use  and . Yes, it's annoying sometimes. That's the point.Vue is great. Svelte is great. But AI has seen more React code than everything else combined.Standard patterns. Predictable hooks. AI generates this in its sleep."Works on my machine" is not a deployment strategy.Docker makes environments reproducible. AI knows Dockerfile patterns. Everyone wins.YAML-based pipelines. Well-documented. AI generates correct CI configs.More importantly: this is where the coercion happens. Every check, every gate, every "you cannot merge this". One file to rule them all.

AI updates the backend endpoint, the frontend types, and the OpenAPI spec. One commit. One pipeline. All checks run together.The pipeline enforces consistency. Frontend types don't match backend? CI fails. Database migration missing? CI fails. Contract broken? CI fails. You can't ship half a feature.Separate repos can't do this. You'd need cross-repo CI triggers, version pinning, deployment coordination. Complexity for complexity's sake.AI works in one context. The pipeline validates one state. Ship with confidence.I could have picked Rust—efficient memory management, blazing fast, amazing type system, solid async.But AI struggles with Rust. Fewer examples, different patterns, even syntax errors.So I use Python. And FastAPI. And all the boring stuff.My side projects ship. My evenings are free. The stack is unremarkable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Phishing Defense Platform Day 13</title><link>https://dev.to/cyberb0x/ai-phishing-defense-platform-day-13-4690</link><author>Arslon Erkinov</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:11:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Day 13 completed: API Security & Usage TrackingToday I finished Day 13 of building my AI Phishing Defense Platform.

    fname = input("What is your first name? ")
    lname = input("What is your last name? ")

    return f"Your first and last names are: {fname}, {lname} respectively"

Ask the user for their first and last name.Return a formatted string with both names.You can call this function as many times as you want without rewriting the input logic each time!Moving straight to the point..."Dunder" is short for  (like , etc.).These are special methods in Python that Python calls automatically when certain things happen, like creating a new object, printing an object, or adding two objects together.And Dunder Methods: What do they do?
Dunder methods are like automatic rules for Python. They are built-in functions that are triggered in specific situations, and you don't need to call them yourself. : this initializes any new object for a classSample Code for Dunder Methodsclass Player:
    # Define a new class named Player

    def __init__(self, name):
        # This function is automatically called when creating a new Player object
        # self refers to the current object you're creating
        self.name = name  # Whatever name you give me, I’ll remember it as self.name

    def __str__(self):
        # This function is automatically called when you try to print the Player object
        return f"Player: {self.name}"  # Return the actual player's name when printed


# Creating a Player object
name = input("What is your name? ")  # Ask for the player's name
player1 = Player(name)  # Create an instance of the Player class with the input name

# Print the player object
print(player1)  # This will automatically call __str__ and print "Player: [Name]"


TLDR?
The syntax is simple :A class is a blueprint or template that encapsulates properties and behaviors for objects.
A class contains attributes (data) and methods (functions).2. 
Constructor Method ():The constructor method  is a special dunder method used to initialize an object when it's created.It contains parameters that are passed when you create an instance of the class.
The self keyword refers to the current instance (object) of the class.def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name  # Save the player's name
    self.age = age  # Save the player's score

3.
Operation Method (e.g., , , etc.):
This is where you define custom behavior for common operations.: Defines how the object will be represented as a string (when you print it).: Defines what happens when you use the + operator with objects of that class.def __str__(self):
    return f"Player: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}"

def __add__(self, other):
    return self.score + other.score  # Add scores of two Player objects

self: A reference to the current object. It’s used inside methods to access the object's attributes (e.g., self.name, self.age).Other parameters: These are the values you pass into the class constructor or operation methods to define the object's state or behavior.class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # This is the constructor method to initialize the object
        self.name = name  # Store the name in the object
        self.age = age    # Store the age in the object

    def __str__(self):
        # This is the __str__ method to return a string representation of the object
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."

# Example Usage
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)  # Create a Person object with name 'Alice' and age 25
print(person1)  # It will print: Alice is 25 years old.

Divirta-se! :)Quando começamos a aprender a programar, uma das primeiras descobertas que nos deparamos é que: as linguagens de programação são todas em inglês! Bom, pelo menos as que são utilizadas no mercado de trabalho.Estatisticamente falando, apenas 5% dos brasileiros entendem inglês em algum nível, enquanto apenas 1% possui fluência. Ou seja, nem todos os falantes de língua portuguesa tem conhecimento do idioma inglês.O que faz com que a pessoa aprendiz passa encontrar barreiras que a faça dispor mais esforço para desenvolver várias habilidades ao mesmo tempo (programar e aprender outro idioma concomitantemente). Ela terá dificuldades de lidar com recursos e instruções da linguagem de programação, o que poderá comprometer sua aprendizagem de lógica e algoritmos.Aí tem-se a importância de existir uma linguagem como o Pituguês, em que a pessoa nativa em português consiga programar em sua língua mãe, eliminando a barreira idiomática.Sua sintaxe é inspirada na da linguagem de programação Python que, embora seu nome faça alusão a uma espécie de cobra e seu símbolo seja composto de duas cobras em Ying & Yang, seus criadores eram muito fãs da série de comédia “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” e batizaram a linguagem com o nome de “Python”.Pegando carona até mesmo no nome, se formos traduzir “python”, temos “píton”. Assim, para trazer a ideia de uma linguagem de programação inspirada em Python para a língua portuguesa, uniu-se “píton” + “português” que resultou em: Pituguês!E, como comentamos, o Pituguês vai se inspirar e buscar trazer características do Python para português, como…Quando lidamos com linguagem de programação, devemos lembrar que existem tipos diferentes de dados, como dados textuais, numéricos, binários e etc.Algumas linguagens exigem que o tipo de dado seja declarado como, por exemplo, em Java, declaramos uma variável da seguinte maneira…Note que, em Java, indicamos o tipo do dado (int, para números inteiro, e String para tipos textuais), escrevemos o nome da variável e, por fim, damos um valor a ela. Se formos comparar com Python, já possui uma diferença acentuada…Como podem ver, já não é necessário indicar o tipo da variável, pois a linguagem irá verificar isso automaticamente, é o que chamamos de “inferir tipo”.No Pituguês, não vai ser diferente, a nossa declaração de variáveis também vai inferir o tipo...A indentação nada mais é que o aninhamento de trechos de código que, no caso do Python, se dá através da tabulação (4 espaçamentos), ela tem o objetivo de determinar quais linhas de código pertencem a um bloco lógico, definindo a estrutura e hierarquia.Ou seja, declaramos uma função, por exemplo, em seguida, escrevemos os dois pontos e, logo abaixo deles, com certo espaçamento, começamos a escrever o que a nossa função irá executar. Dessa forma que definimos o escopo e a hierarquia do código, determinando em que momento o trecho de código é iniciado e finalizado.Caso a indentação não seja feita da maneira correta, sem o espaçamento ou com espaçamento excessivo, o próprio Python irá nos sinalizar com uma mensagem de erro.Na documentação do Pituguês você consegue ter acesso a exemplos de como a indentação funciona:Assim como o Python, o Pituguês também é uma linguagem de Código Livre e está aberta a contribuições e, deste a postagem original deste tutorial e introdução a respeito da linguagem, já aconteceram mudanças bastante significativas...Há pouco tempo atrás, Pituguês adicionava a palavra  na declaração de variáveis, o que o distanciava de Python. No entanto, contribuições mais recentes da comunidade fizeram que consigamos declarar variáveis da mesma forma que em Python:linguagem_de_programacao = "Pituguês"Em resumo, Pituguês existe no repositório de uma outra linguagem de programação em português chamada Delégua e acabou herdando algumas características dela, como a interpolação:var linguagemDeProgramacao = "Delégua"escreva("Linguagem de programação: ${linguagemDeProgramacao}")Este tipo de interpolação também se distanciava do Python, mas contribuições recentes trouxeram proximidade entre Pituguês e Python e, agora, a interpolação segue o padrão f-strings:linguagem_de_programacao = "Pituguês"imprima(f"Linguagem de programação: {linguagemDeProgramacao}")Lembrando que estamos atualização a documentação do Pituguês constantemente e, qualquer dúvida que senha sobre a sintaxe, basta consultá-la!
  
  
  Mas como programar em Pituguês?
Para programar em Pituguês, basta que você instale uma extensão no VS Code. Se na aba de extensões você procurar por "pitugues", deve encontrar a extensão da Design Líquido que possui todo um ecossistema de linguagens em português como: linguagem de programação, de marcação, de estilo, de consulta e etc.Nesta postagem você pode encontrar um tutorial semelhante a este, mas que demonstra por imagens como instalar a extensão e como executar seus programar em Pituguês!O Pituguês é uma iniciativa feita pela comunidade, para a comunidade e toda contribuição conta! 🐍💜
É uma linguagem que está em constante transformação e vocês podem acompanhar junto com a gente todo esse processo!Junte-se a nós e ajude a construir o Pituguês — uma linguagem feita com comunidade, propósito e muito coração. 💜]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a Semantic Search Knowledge Base with MindsDB</title><link>https://dev.to/mindsdb/building-a-semantic-search-knowledge-base-with-mindsdb-5107</link><author>MindsDB Team</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Written by Andriy Burkov, Ph.D. & Author, MindsDB AdvisorWhat happens when a developer searches for "how to make async HTTP calls" but your documentation says "asynchronous network requests"? Traditional keyword search fails—even though the content is exactly what they need.This is the fundamental limitation of keyword search: it matches words, not meaning.In this tutorial, we'll build a semantic search system using MindsDB that understands user intent. Using 2 million Stack Overflow posts, we'll create knowledge bases with two different vector storage backends— and —and compare their performance.How MindsDB knowledge bases convert text into searchable vectorsSetting up pgvector (PostgreSQL-based) and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) storageCombining semantic search with metadata filtersBuilding an AI agent that uses your knowledge base to answer questionsA MindsDB account (cloud or self-hosted)PostgreSQL database with the Stack Overflow datasetAn OpenAI API key for embeddings
  
  
  How Semantic Search Works
Before we dive in, let's understand the key difference between keyword and semantic search:Misses "asynchronous requests"Semantic search works by:: Converting text into numerical vectors using an embedding model: Saving these vectors in a vector database: Converting the search query to a vector and finding the closest matchesMindsDB handles all of this through its Knowledge Base abstraction.: Python client for interacting with MindsDB servers: For working with query results as DataFrames

  4. Setting Up Vector Storage Backends
MindsDB supports multiple vector storage options. We'll set up both pgvector and a recently added FAISS and will compare how quick they are.
  
  
  pgvector (PostgreSQL Extension)
pgvector is a PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search. It's ideal when you want to keep vectors alongside your relational data.
python
# Create pgvector database connection
run_query("""
    CREATE DATABASE pg_vector
    WITH ENGINE = "pgvector",
    PARAMETERS = {
        "user": "YOUR_PG_USER",
        "password": "YOUR_PG_PASSWORD",
        "host": "YOUR_PG_HOST",
        "port": "5432",
        "database": "vector"
    }
""", "Created pg_vector database connection")


Created pg_vector database connection

  
  
  FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search developed by Facebook AI Research. It's optimized for fast similarity search on large datasets.
python
# Create FAISS database connection
run_query("""
    CREATE DATABASE db_faiss
    WITH ENGINE = 'duckdb_faiss',
    PARAMETERS = {
        "persist_directory": "/home/ubuntu/faiss"
    }
""", "Created db_faiss database connection")


Created db_faiss database connection

  
  
  Choosing Between pgvector and FAISS
Integration with existing PostgreSQLNative PostgreSQL storageExcellent (billions of vectors)Requires PostgreSQL extensionGood (~19s for 2M vectors)Excellent (~5s for 2M vectors)For this tutorial, we'll implement both so you can see the performance difference firsthand.
  
  
  5. Creating Knowledge Bases
Now we have a table with relational data and two vector stores to keep the embedding vectors. We are ready to create knowledge bases using both storage backends.Use OpenAI's  model for generating embeddingsStore the post  as searchable contentInclude metadata fields for filtering results

def kb_exists(kb_name):
    """Check if a knowledge base already exists."""
    try:
        result = server.query("SELECT name FROM information_schema.knowledge_bases").fetch()
        return kb_name in result['name'].values
    except Exception:
        return False

# Create pgvector knowledge base
if kb_exists("kb_stack_vector"):
    print("kb_stack_vector already exists - skipping creation")
else:
    run_query("""
        CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE kb_stack_vector
        USING
            storage = pg_vector.stack,

  Understanding the Parameters
Specifies the vector database connection and table nameConfiguration for the embedding model (provider and model name)Columns to embed and make semantically searchableColumns available for filtering (not embedded, but stored)
  
  
  6. Loading Data into Knowledge Bases
Now we'll insert the Stack Overflow data into our knowledge bases. This process:Fetches data from the source table in batchesGenerates embeddings for content columns using the OpenAI APIStores vectors and metadata in the vector database
  
  
  Loading Data into pgvector Knowledge Base

python
def is_kb_empty(kb_name):
    """Check if a knowledge base is empty (fast - only fetches 1 row)."""
    result = server.query(f"SELECT id FROM {kb_name} LIMIT 1").fetch()
    return len(result) == 0

if is_kb_empty("kb_stack_vector"):
    print("kb_stack_vector is empty - starting data insertion...")
    server.query("""
        INSERT INTO kb_stack_vector
        SELECT * FROM pg_sample.stackoverflow_2m 
        USING 
            batch_size = 1000, 
            track_column = id
    """).fetch()
    print("Data insertion started for kb_stack_vector")
else:
    print("kb_stack_vector is not empty - skipping data insertion")


Data insertion started for kb_stack_vector

  
  
  Loading Data into FAISS Knowledge Base

python
if is_kb_empty("kb_stack_faiss"):
    print("kb_stack_faiss is empty - starting data insertion...")
    server.query("""
        INSERT INTO kb_stack_faiss
        SELECT * FROM pg_sample.stackoverflow_2m 
        USING 
            batch_size = 1000, 
            track_column = id
    """).fetch()
    print("Data insertion started for kb_stack_faiss")
else:
    print("kb_stack_faiss is not empty - skipping data insertion")


Data insertion started for kb_stack_faiss
Wait until the data insertion is complete.
  
  
  7. Querying the Knowledge Bases
Once data is loaded, you can perform semantic searches combined with metadata filtering.Search for content related to "8-bit music" (finds semantically similar content):
python
import time

# Semantic search on pgvector KB
start = time.time()
results_vector = server.query("""
    SELECT * FROM kb_stack_vector 
    WHERE content = '8-bit music'
    AND Tags LIKE '%python%'
    LIMIT 10
""").fetch()
elapsed_vector = time.time() - start
print(f"pgvector query time: {elapsed_vector:.2f} seconds")
display(results_vector)

# Semantic search on FAISS KB
start = time.time()
results_faiss = server.query("""
    SELECT * FROM kb_stack_faiss 
    WHERE content = '8-bit music'
    AND Tags LIKE '%python%'
    LIMIT 10
""").fetch()
elapsed_faiss = time.time() - start
print(f"FAISS query time: {elapsed_faiss:.2f} seconds")
display(results_faiss)

  Combined Semantic and Metadata Filtering
Find AJAX-related posts tagged with jQuery that have high view counts:
python
# pgvector: Semantic search with metadata filters
start = time.time()
results = server.query("""

  The Power of Combined Filtering
The query we just ran demonstrates MindsDB's hybrid search capability:
sql
SELECT * FROM kb_stack_faiss 
WHERE content = 'ajax'              -- Semantic match
    AND Tags LIKE '%jquery%'        -- Metadata filter
    AND ViewCount > 1000            -- Popularity threshold
    AND relevance > 0.6             -- Quality threshold


Are semantically similar to "ajax" (not just keyword matches)Have significant engagement (>1000 views)Meet a minimum relevance scoreThis combination is impossible with traditional search and would require complex custom code with raw vector databases.

To compare JavaScript and TypeScript for building web services, let's look at insights from Stack Overflow posts (see chunk IDs for reference):It is the default language for web development, both on the client (browser) and, with Node.js, on the server (870980:Body:1of1:0to133).JavaScript is flexible and widely supported, but its lack of static typing can lead to runtime errors and makes large codebases harder to maintain.While not directly mentioned in the top results, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and modern language features. It compiles to JavaScript, so it runs anywhere JavaScript does.TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, improves code readability, and is especially beneficial for large projects or teams.TypeScript is increasingly popular for the same purpose, as it provides all the benefits of JavaScript plus type safety and better tooling (e.g., autocompletion, refactoring).Good, but less type-awareExcellent (autocompletion, refactor)Slightly higher (due to types)Same as JS, plus TS-specific toolsCan be challenging in large codeEasier in large codebasesFor small projects or rapid prototyping, JavaScript is sufficient and easy to start with.For larger projects, teams, or when maintainability and reliability are priorities, TypeScript is generally preferred.If you want more specific code examples or a deeper dive into either technology, let me know!We've built a complete semantic search system that:Processes 2 million Stack Overflow postsSupports both pgvector and FAISS backendsCombines semantic search with metadata filteringPowers an AI agent for natural language queriesFAISS is much faster than pgvector for pure search queriesMetadata filtering lets you narrow results by tags, scores, datesKnowledge bases abstract complexity—no need to manage embeddings manuallyAgents can leverage knowledge bases for RAG-style applicationsTry different embedding modelsExplore different chunking strategies]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Federated Learning, Part 2: Implementation with the Flower Framework 🌼</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/federated-learning-part-2-implementation-with-the-flower-framework-%f0%9f%8c%bc/</link><author>Parul Pandey</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Implementing cross-silo federated learning step by step]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 30: Implementing FinOps in Python - Calculating GenAI Costs per Request</title><link>https://dev.to/ericrodriguez10/day-30-implementing-finops-in-python-calculating-genai-costs-per-request-4k96</link><author>Eric Rodríguez</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Serverless is cheap, but "pay-per-use" can become a nightmare if you don't track the usage.

A sudden fog or thunderstorm can lead to missed connections, frustrated users, or skewed data. The key to mitigation? METAR for current airport conditions and TAF for 24–30-hour forecasts.
Integrating these via API enables proactive alerts, rerouting, and better decisions. For small businesses, indie developers, students, and researchers, this means operational continuity without high costs. SkyLink API's endpoints provide raw and decoded data for any ICAO airport, with global coverage, 99.99% uptime, and a free tier (1,000 requests/month) starting at $15.99 for production.
  
  
  Why METAR/TAF Matter More Than General Weather APIs
Unlike consumer APIs like OpenWeather, METAR/TAF are aviation-specific. METAR details wind, visibility (in statute miles), cloud layers (in feet), temperature, pressure, and phenomena like mist (BR) or fog (FG). TAF forecasts evolutions with TEMPO (temporary), BECMG (becoming), and PROB (probability) indicators.
These are tied to ICAO codes, sourced from official observations—not models—ensuring precision for runway impacts. Studies show adverse weather causes ~50% of delays; TAF integration can cut arrival holds by enabling alternates. For travel/hospitality, it minimizes guest waits; for logistics, predicts cargo delays; for research, provides reliable datasets for simulations or papers.
  
  
  Core Use Cases: How Integration Delivers Results

  
  
  Travel App / Hospitality Guest Experience
Users often face fog-induced delays. Poll TAF 12–24 hours ahead and METAR near arrival to trigger notifications: "Low visibility at LHR 18:00–20:00—consider alternate transport." Outcomes: 30–50% fewer complaints, higher ratings.
  
  
  Student/Research Aviation Tools
Manual data pulls from NOAA slow studies. API calls for multiple ICAOs feed dashboards or sim plugins, enabling faster prototyping and accurate theses on weather patterns.
  
  
  Small Logistics / Transportation Dashboard
Unexpected precipitation disrupts ETAs. Combine TAF with flight status to auto-adjust schedules and notify stakeholders, improving on-time performance and reducing costs.
Technical Integration Spotlight: SkyLink METAR/TAF Endpoints
SkyLink's GET /v2/weather/metar/{icao} or /v2/weather/taf/{icao} returns structured JSON: raw text, airport name, timestamp, and decoded fields. Benefits include no parsing issues, fast responses (<500ms), and scalable pricing (overage $0.0004/request).
Quick Python example:import requests


headers = {"X-RapidAPI-Key": "YOUR_KEY"}
response = requests.get(
    "https://skylink-api.p.rapidapi.com/v2/weather/taf/KJFK",
    headers=headers
)
taf_data = response.json()
print(taf_data['raw'])          # Full raw TAF
print(taf_data['airport_name']) # John F Kennedy International Airport
# Use to trigger "TEMPO low vis" alert

However, it comes with a catch: the first run is very slow. That warmup delay  can be a drag on development iteration and can lead to slower cold starts in production. If you’ve ever swapped a LoRA or made a small model change, you’ve probably noticed that frustrating pause before things get moving again. But what if you could dramatically reduce, or even eliminate, these warmup delays?In this post, we'll dive into two practical techniques, powered by Pruna, to mitigate warmup times. We'll show you how to:Using Pruna's portable compilation feature, eliminate the initial model warmup when deploying or reloading a model on a new machine (with identical hardware).Achieve zero warmup when switching LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) on an already optimized model.Get ready to reclaim those precious seconds (or even minutes!) and make your  experience smoother than ever.
  
  
  The Challenge: Understanding  Warmup
Before we dive into the solutions, let's briefly touch upon why  has a warmup phase. When you first invoke a model compiled with , several things happen under the hood. PyTorch needs to:Capture the computational graph: It traces the execution of your model to understand its structure.Perform graph optimizations: The captured graph is then optimized for better performance.Detect and fuse operators: The backend (such as Inductor) identifies which operations can be combined for faster execution.: Optimized code (often CUDA kernels for GPUs or efficient CPU code) is generated by the chosen backend (like Inductor).: This generated code is then compiled into executable machine instructions.This entire process, especially the code generation and compilation steps, can take a noticeable amount of time, ranging from seconds to minutes, depending on the model's complexity and the hardware. While this is a one-time cost for a given model shape and hardware (as the compiled artifacts are cached), it can be disruptive:: When a new instance of an application starts (e.g., a serverless function or a new pod in Kubernetes), the first request might experience this long warmup, leading to poor user experience.: If you compile a model on one machine and then try to run it on another (even with identical hardware), the cache might not be directly usable, leading to another full warmup.: Swapping LoRAs or other adapters can alter the model graph triggering recompilation.: Waiting for recompilation after minor code changes or restarting a kernel slows the development cycle.Pruna offers elegant ways to mitigate these issues, as we'll see next.
  
  
  Use Case 1: Eliminating Initial Warmup with Pruna's Portable Compilation
Traditionally, running a compiled model on a new machine triggers a full compilation warmup, even if the hardware is identical. This can slow down processes, especially when deploying models to production or sharing them with others.Pruna makes compilation portable. It saves the required artifacts so they can be easily packaged with your model and reused on another machine (with the same hardware architecture and CUDA drivers) without needing to recompile from scratch. That way, the model will run fast right from the first inference.: Skip the first-run delay when deploying pre-compiled models to production servers, especially serverless instances.: Share ready-to-run models with your team.: Speed up CI/CD by avoiding repeated compilation.
  
  
  How-to Use Pruna’s Portable Compilation
Let's walk through how to use this feature:Load your model as normally: In our example, we use a Stable Diffusion pipeline from Diffusers.Configure Pruna for Portable Compilation: This is where the magic happens. Create a  object and configure   to be portable.: Apply the configuration using .: Run your model for the first time trigger compilation process, including the warmup. After that, just save your Pruna-smashed model, and it’ll be ready to use on any other machine.

  
  
  Use case 2: Zero Warmup for LoRA Switching with Diffusers Hotswap and Pruna () Compatibility
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a game-changer for efficiently fine-tuning large models. It allows for quick adaptation by training only a small set of parameters.A powerful workflow involves dynamically switching between different LoRAs on a base model to change its output on the fly—for instance, altering image styles in a generative model. However, a challenge arises when you combine it with compilation. Every LoRA swap can look like a graph change—triggering a long recompilation and wiping out the speed advantage.While Diffusers handles the mechanics of LoRA hotswapping, using Pruna with and leveraging one of its cachers ensures that these Diffusers-driven LoRA swaps are efficient and don't cause recompilation warmups after the initial model compilation.With Pruna and Diffusers together, you get flexible LoRA adaptation and high-performance execution with no warmup delays.: Serve models that adapt to diverse user inputs by loading different LoRAs or applications requiring rapid switching between LoRA-defined styles or functionalities (e.g., in an image generation UI), without the latency of recompilation.Efficient experimentation: Test multiple LoRAs quickly without waiting for recompiles.
  
  
  How-to Leverage Diffusers Hotswap with Pruna for Zero WarmupLet's walk through how this works:Load the Base Model and Enable Diffusers LoRA Hotswapping.: Configure  and enable a cacher. In this example, we will be using the  cacher, but others also maintain compatibility.: Apply the configuration using .: Run the model for the first time triggering the  warmup for the base model and the current LoRA. Then, you’ll be ready to hotswap to a new LoRA

  
  
  Comparing the Solutions: Portable Compilation vs. Pruna Cacher Compatibility
While we separately presented these use cases, they can be easily combined:Use  to create a base smashed model (perhaps with a default LoRA and apply Pruna optimization that loads quickly on new instances.Once loaded, pruna’s compatibility with hot-swapping would ensure that any subsequent LoRA hot swaps (managed by Diffusers) on that instance are also free of  warmup delays.This combined approach would give you a fast cold start  adapter switching.
  
  
  Conclusions: Reclaim Your Time with Pruna
The  warmup can slow down production workflows for cold starts and adapter switching. Pruna addresses these challenges with two key features: (torch_compile_make_portable=True) removes first-run warmup when deploying to identical hardware, enabling immediate peak performance.Diffusers' LoRA hotswapping with  and a  enables instant LoRA switching without recompilation delays.We hope this guide helps you optimize your  workflows.

  📊 Behavior Categories We Defined
Chasing, playing with toys
  
  
  Approach 1: Single-Frame Classification
Classify behavior for each image frame.: Simple, fast: Can't judge continuous actions ("walking" vs "stopped")
  
  
  Approach 2: Sequence Analysis
Analyze multiple consecutive frames to understand dynamic behavior.: 200+ images per behavior category: Using Label Studio: Ensure labeling consistency
  
  
  1. Automatic Video Classification
Input Video → Behavior Recognition → Auto-tagging

Think of it like building a house: you can't install the roof (OOP) until you’ve laid the foundation (Basics).Don’t worry this series is designed for beginners. You don’t need to be a senior dev to get started, but having these few tools in your belt will make the transition to OOP feel like a breeze rather than a climb.
  
  
  Core Python Basics You Should Know
To get the most out of this OOP series, ensure you're comfortable with the following three pillars:
  
  
  1. Variables and Data Types
In OOP, we store data inside "Objects." To do that, you must understand how Python handles data. You should be familiar with: For names and descriptions. For counts, ages, or prices. For "True/False" logic (essential for state management). For storing collections of objects. In OOP, these variables will eventually become Attributes the characteristics that define your objects.Functions are the "actions" of your code. Before moving to OOP, you should know:How to define a function ().How to pass arguments (positional and keyword).How to return values to use elsewhere. In the OOP world, functions living inside a class are called Methods. If you can write a function, you’re already 80% of the way to writing a class method.
  
  
  3. Working with Dictionaries
You should understand how Key-Value pairs work because:Dictionaries represent structured data.Internally, Python actually uses dictionaries to store object attributes.If you can pull a value from a dictionary using a key, you'll find the logic of accessing object properties very familiar.
  
  
  What You Do NOT Need to Know
It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the vast Python ecosystem. You do not need to master these before starting this series:Advanced Decorators or Generators: We’ll keep things simple.Web Frameworks: No Django or FastAPI knowledge is required.Database Management: We won’t be touching SQL or NoSQL in the beginning.Our focus is strictly on  step by step.Before we write our first class, make sure your environment is ready:Python Installed: Ensure you have Python 3.x on your machine.Terminal Access: You should be comfortable running a script via . Code Editor: Use whatever you like (VS Code, PyCharm, or even a simple text editor). No complex setup or heavy IDE configuration is required.

  
  
  How to Master This Series
To truly "level up" your skills, don't just be a spectator. Engage with the content:Follow the Sequence: Concepts build on each other. Don't skip ahead!The "Type-Along" Rule: Never just read the code. Type it out. Muscle memory is a real thing in programming.Break Things: Change a value, delete a colon, or rename a variable. Seeing how the code breaks is the fastest way to learn how to fix it.We believe in Hands-on Learning. To support you:All code examples are available on our GitHub repository.Links to the code are provided in our YouTube series descriptions.Clone it, fork it, or copy it just make sure you practice it.Object Oriented Programming isn't just a syntax change; it’s a mindset shift. It will help you write cleaner, reusable, and more professional code. Stay consistent, keep practicing, and don't be afraid to ask questions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bliki: Excessive Bold</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExcessiveBold.html</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm increasingly seeing a lot of technical and business writing make heavy
  use of bold font weights, in an attempt to emphasize what the writers think is
  important. LLMs seem to have picked up and spread this practice widely. But
  most of this is self-defeating, the more a writer uses typographical emphasis,
  the less power it has, quickly reaching the point where it loses all its
  benefits.There are various typographical tools that are used to emphasize words and
  phrases, such as: bold, italic, capitals, and underlines. I find that bold is the one
  that's getting most of the over-use. Using a lot of capitals is rightly
  reviled as shouting, and when we see it used widely, it raises our doubts on
  the quality of the underlying thinking.
  Underlines have become the signal for hyperlinks, so I rarely see this for
  emphasis any more. Both capitals and underlines have also been seen as rather
  cheap forms of highlight, since we could do them with typewriters and
  handwriting, while bold and italics were only possible after the rise of
  word-processors. (Although I realize most of my readers are too young to
  remember when word-processors were novel.)Italics are the subtler form of emphasis. When I use them in a paragraph,
  they don't leap out to the eye. This allows me to use them in long flows of text when
  I want to set it apart, and when I use it to emphasize a phrase it only makes
  its presence felt when I'm fully reading the text. For this reason, I prefer
  to use italics for emphasis, but I only use it rarely, suggesting it's
   important to put stress on
  the word should I be speaking the paragraph (and I always try to write in the
  way that I speak).The greatest value of bold is that draws the eye to the bold text even if the
  reader isn't reading, but glancing over the page. This is an important
  property, but one that only works if it's used sparingly. Headings are often
  done in bold, because the it's important to help the reader navigate a longer
  document by skimming and looking for headings to find the section I want to read.I rarely use bold within a prose paragraph, because of my desire to be
  parsimonious with bold. One use I do like is to highlight unfamiliar words at
  the point where I explain them. I got this idea from Giarratano and Riley. I noticed that when the
  unfamiliar term reappeared, I was often unsure what it meant, but glancing
  back and finding the bold quickly reminded me. The trick here is to place the
  bold at point of explanation, which is often, but not always, at its first
  use. 
A common idea is to take an important sentence and bold that, so it leaps
  out while skimming the article. That can be worthwhile, but as ever with this
  kind of emphasize, its effectiveness is inversely proportional to how often
  it's used. It's also usually not the best tool for the job. Callouts usually
  work better. They do a superior job of drawing the eye, and furthermore they don't
  need to use the same words as in the prose text. This allows me to word the
  callout better than it could be if it also had to fit in the flow of the
  prose.A marginal case is where I see bold used in first clause of each item in a
  bulleted list. In some ways this is acting like a heading for the text in the
  list. But we don't need a heading for every paragraph, and the presence of the
  bullets does enough to draw the eye to the items. And bullet-lists are over
  used too - I always try to write such things as a prose paragraph instead, as
  prose flows much better than bullets and is thus more pleasant to read. It's
  important to write in such a way to make it an enjoyable experience for the
  reader - even, indeed especially, when I'm also trying to explain things for them.While writing this, I was tempted to illustrate my point by using  in a paragraph,  and hopefully demonstrating
  why lots of bold loses the power to emphasize and .
  But I also wanted to explain my position clearly, and I felt that illustrating
  the problem would thus . So I've  to a
  . (And, yes, I  with as much bold as this.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built a small browser engine from scratch in C++</title><link>https://github.com/beginner-jhj/mini_browser</link><author>crediblejhj</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:03:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">Show HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN!

               LINE TextMsg + ImageSendMessage

Agentic Vision requires the user to provide  (e.g., "Mark everyone," "Count how many cats"), unlike general recognition which only needs to "describe the image." Therefore, after selecting Agentic Vision, the user is first asked to input their desired goal.
  
  
  1. Image Temporary Storage Mechanism
Because LINE's Quick Reply is asynchronous (user clicks a button to trigger PostbackEvent), the image needs to be temporarily stored:# main.py
image_temp_store: Dict[str, bytes] = {} # Temporary image storage (user_id → bytes)
pending_agentic_vision: Dict[str, bool] = {} # Waiting for user to input instructions

 Receive image → store in image_temp_store[user_id] User clicks "Agentic Vision" → set pending_agentic_vision[user_id] = True User inputs text → detect pending state, retrieve image + text and send them for analysis
  
  
  2. Quick Reply Implementation
Use LINE SDK's , consistent with the existing YouTube summary and location search Quick Reply modes:quick_reply_buttons = QuickReply(
    items=[
        QuickReplyButton(
            action=PostbackAction(
                label="Recognize Image",
                data=json.dumps({"action": "image_analyze", "mode": "recognize"}),
                display_text="Recognize Image"
            )
        ),
        QuickReplyButton(
            action=PostbackAction(
                label="Agentic Vision",
                data=json.dumps({"action": "image_analyze", "mode": "agentic_vision"}),
                display_text="Agentic Vision"
            )
        ),
    ]
)


  
  
  3. Agentic Vision Analysis Core
# tools/summarizer.py
def analyze_image_agentic(image_data: bytes, prompt: str) -> dict:
    client = _get_vertex_client()

    contents = [
        types.Part.from_text(text=prompt),
        types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_data, mime_type="image/png")
    ]

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
        contents=contents,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            temperature=0.5,
            max_output_tokens=4096,
            tools=[types.Tool(code_execution=types.ToolCodeExecution)],
            thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinkingBudget=2048),
        )
    )

    result_parts = []
    generated_images = []

    for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
        if hasattr(part, 'thought') and part.thought:
            continue # Skip thinking parts
        if part.text is not None:
            result_parts.append(part.text)
        if part.code_execution_result is not None:
            result_parts.append(f"[Code Output]: {part.code_execution_result.output}")
        # Extract the annotated images generated by the model
        img = part.as_image()
        if img is not None:
            generated_images.append(img.image_bytes)

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "analysis": "\n".join(result_parts),
        "images": generated_images # Annotated image bytes
    }


  
  
  4. Image Return Mechanism
LINE's  requires a public HTTPS URL. Because we are deployed on Cloud Run (which is inherently public HTTPS), we directly add an image serving endpoint to FastAPI:# Temporary storage of annotated images (UUID → bytes, 5 minutes TTL)
annotated_image_store: Dict[str, dict] = {}

@app.get("/images/{image_id}")
def serve_annotated_image(image_id: str):
    """Provide temporary annotated images for LINE to download"""
    entry = annotated_image_store.get(image_id)
    if not entry:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    if time.time() - entry["created_at"] > 300: # 5 minutes expired
        annotated_image_store.pop(image_id, None)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    return Response(content=entry["data"], media_type="image/png")

Automatically detect the App's base URL (from the webhook request headers):@app.post("/")
async def handle_webhook_callback(request: Request):
    global app_base_url
    if not app_base_url:
        forwarded_proto = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-proto', 'https')
        host = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-host') or request.headers.get('host', '')
        if host:
            app_base_url = f"{forwarded_proto}://{host}"

Finally, combine into :def _create_image_send_message(image_bytes: bytes):
    image_id = store_annotated_image(image_bytes)
    image_url = f"{app_base_url}/images/{image_id}"
    return ImageSendMessage(
        original_content_url=image_url,
        preview_image_url=image_url,
    )


  
  
  Pitfall 1:  Does Not Exist
ERROR: Error analyzing image: from_image_bytes

: There is types.Part.from_image_bytes() method in the  SDK, the correct one is .# ❌ Incorrect
types.Part.from_image_bytes(data=image_data, mime_type="image/png")

# ✅ Correct
types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_data, mime_type="image/png")


  
  
  Pitfall 2:  enum Does Not Exist
ERROR: module 'google.genai.types' has no attribute 'ThinkingLevel'

:  in  only supports  (integer), and does not support the  enum. Context7 and the examples in the official documentation are based on a newer version of the SDK.# ❌ Does not exist in v1.49.0
types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_level=types.ThinkingLevel.MEDIUM)

# ✅ v1.49.0 supported method
types.ThinkingConfig(thinkingBudget=2048)

: AI-generated code examples may be based on newer or older SDK versions, always use python -c "help(types.ThinkingConfig)" to confirm the actual available parameters.
  
  
  Pitfall 3: Incomplete Image Recognition Results
:  enables thinking by default, and thinking tokens will consume the quota of . Originally set , and thinking used up a large portion, the actual reply was truncated.# ❌ Before: thinking consumed most of the token quota
config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    max_output_tokens=2048,
)

# ✅ After: Disable thinking + increase token quota
config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    max_output_tokens=8192,
    thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinkingBudget=0), # Disable thinking
)

: For simple image descriptions, thinking is an unnecessary overhead.  can disable thinking, allowing all tokens to be used for the reply.┌───────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  1. SDK Version Differences are the Biggest Pitfall
The most time-consuming part of this development was not the functional design, but the SDK version differences. The API of  changes frequently: →  (method name changed) enum does not exist in v1.49.0 (requires  integer)  The impact of  on  is not documented: Before development, run  to confirm the version, and then use  to confirm the actually available API.
  
  
  2. Limitations of LINE Bot Image Returns
LINE's  requires the image to be a public HTTPS URL, and cannot directly transmit bytes. Solutions:Requires bucket and permission settingsFastAPI endpoint serves itselfSimple, no external services requiredDisappears after restart, memory usageI chose the  solution because:  Cloud Run itself is public HTTPS  Annotated images only need to exist briefly (5 minutes TTL)  No need for additional GCS bucket settings
  
  
  3. Thinking is a Double-Edged Sword
 enables thinking by default, which is helpful for complex reasoning, but is a burden for simple image descriptions:  Consumes  quota: Disable thinking for simple tasks (), and only enable it for complex Agentic Vision.
  
  
  4. Trade-offs in State Management
Agentic Vision requires two-step interaction (select mode → input instructions), which introduces state management:image_temp_store: Dict[str, bytes] = {} # Image temporary storage
pending_agentic_vision: Dict[str, bool] = {} # Waiting for instructions

Using an in-memory dict is the simplest, but there is a risk: Cloud Run may restart between two requests. This is acceptable for a personal Bot, but if you want to make it a product-level service, you should switch to Redis or Firestore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Professional Streamlit Styling with CSS and st_yled</title><link>https://dev.to/jonathanalles/professional-streamlit-styling-with-css-and-styled-45o6</link><author>Jonathan Alles</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:48:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Streamlit is an effective tool for building data apps, dashboards, and prototypes in Python. While basic theme properties like primary colors and fonts can be set, customizing specific components often requires additional techniques.This post covers two approaches for styling Streamlit apps:Targeting components with CSS using the  attributeA Python-centric alternative using the  package
  
  
  Styling with CSS and Component Keys
For components that accept a  attribute, Streamlit assigns a corresponding CSS class (). This can be used to apply custom CSS to individual elements.
  
  
  Example 1: Container with Background and Padding
st.html("""
    <style>
    .st-key-my-container {
        background-color: #F6F6F6;
        padding: 16px;
    }
    </style>
""")

with st.container(key="my-container"):
    st.write("This container has a custom background and border.")
In this case the CSS class  is automatically generated by Streamlit based on the component . The container’s background and padding are adjusted via CSS.
  
  
  Example 2: Button with a Custom Border
st.html("""
    <style>
    .st-key-my-button button {
        border: 3px solid #000000;
    }
    </style>
""")

st.button("Click Me", key="my-button", type="primary")
This snippet inserts a  block that targets , allowing customization of the button’s border. The downside is evident: Each component requires different elements to be targeted with the right CSS selectors.These techniques make it possible to customize the appearance of specific components without modifying global theme settings.An alternative approach is to use the package, which allows style properties to be specified directly as arguments in Python.The st_yled philosophy is simple:Write styles in Python right next to your components, no CSSThe approach is to , call  once, then use prefixed components to apply style properties, whenever necessary — while using standard Streamlit components and functions.Instead of styling via CSS, you just pass style properties as arguments to components prefixed with  or  .
  
  
  Example 1: Container with Style Properties
import st_yled as sty

sty.init()

with sty.container(width='content', padding=16, background_color='#F6F6F6'):
    st.write("Hello from Container!")
Here, style properties such as and are passed directly to the container component in Python, without requiring explicit CSS.
  
  
  Example 2: Button with Custom Styling
sty.button(
    "Click Me",
    type="primary",
    border_color='#000000',
    border_style='solid',
    border_width=3
)
This example shows how a button can be styled with border properties through the API. The results are identical to the custom CSS styling in the examples above.
  
  
  Trying new Styles Using st_yled Studio
st_yled Studio is a companion web application built in Streamlit that allows users to interactively explore possible style customizations for common components.Users can select a component, adjust style parameters, and then export either:Python code to insert into your Streamlit appA CSS file to consistently apply styling to all components (this file is automatically loaded by st_yled)This tool can aid in developing consistent visual designs, branding or testing styles before integrating them into code.Post you ideas for new styling options and components below!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PyCharm</title><link></link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:40:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source></item><item><title>I Ditched My Mouse: How I Control My Computer With Hand Gestures (In 60 Lines of Python)</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/i-ditched-my-mouse-how-i-control-my-computer-with-hand-gestures-in-60-lines-of-python/</link><author>Aakash Goswami</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A step-by-step guide to building a “Minority Report”-style interface using OpenCV and MediaPipe]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a Python Puzzle Studio with Tkinter: SixSeven Studio (Step-by-Step)</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/building-a-python-puzzle-studio-with-tkinter-sixseven-studio-step-by-step-56kf</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:16:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build SixSeven Studio — a desktop puzzle generator written in Python.By the end, you’ll have an app that:Displays a modern Tkinter GUIExports layered SVG filesSaves and loads puzzles as JSONThis guide is beginner-friendly and breaks everything into small steps.Step 1 — Install Dependenciespip install ttkbootstrap svgwrite python-barcode pillowttkbootstrap → modern Tkinter UIpython-barcode → barcode imagesStep 2 — Create Your Project Fileimport tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox, colorchooser
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from pathlib import Path
import random
import svgwrite
from barcode import EAN13, Code128
from barcode.writer import ImageWriter
import json
import os
Each module handles a different feature:barcode → barcode creationStep 3 — Create the Main Application Classclass SixSevenStudioV5:
    def __init__(self):
        self.APP_NAME = "SixSeven Studio"
        self.APP_VERSION = "v5"

        self.root = tk.Tk()
        tb.Style(theme="darkly")

        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} {self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.geometry("1100x750")
Step 4 — App State Variablesself.style = tk.StringVar(value="Default")
self.puzzle = tk.StringVar(value="Futoshiki")
self.count = tk.IntVar(value=1)
self.grid_size = tk.IntVar(value=6)

self.bg_color = tk.StringVar(value="#222222")
self.accent_color = tk.StringVar(value="#4caf50")
self.font_size = tk.IntVar(value=24)

self.barcode_type = tk.StringVar(value="EAN13")
self.grid = []
These variables connect your UI controls to logic.Step 5 — Build the User Interfacedef build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME,
             font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)
This shows the app title.opts = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Options", padding=10)
opts.pack(fill="x", padx=10)
tb.Label(opts, text="Puzzle Type:").pack(side="left")
tb.Combobox(
    opts,
    values=["Futoshiki","Arukone","Hidato","Tents & Trees","No-Four-In-Row"],
    textvariable=self.puzzle,
    width=20
).pack(side="left", padx=5)

Control Buttons
ctrl = tb.Frame(self.root)
ctrl.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=10)

tb.Button(ctrl, text="Generate",
          command=self.generate).pack(side="left")

tb.Button(ctrl, text="Export SVG",
          command=self.export_svg).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Each button calls a method.Step 6 — Displaying the Puzzle Gridself.grid_frame = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Puzzle Grid", padding=10)
self.grid_frame.pack(fill="both", expand=True)
def display_grid(self):
    for w in self.grid_frame.winfo_children():

            tb.Label(
                self.grid_frame,
                text=str(self.grid[r][c]),
                width=4,
                relief="ridge"
            ).grid(row=r, column=c, padx=2, pady=2)
This redraws the grid every time puzzles change.Step 7 — Simple Puzzle Generationdef generate_no_four(self, size):
    grid = []
    for r in range(size):
        row = []
        for c in range(size):
            options = [6, 7]
            if len(row) >= 3 and all(x == row[-1] for x in row[-3:]):
                options.remove(row[-1])
            row.append(random.choice(options))
        grid.append(row)
    return grid
This prevents four identical values in a row.def generate(self):
    size = self.grid_size.get()

    if self.puzzle.get() == "No-Four-In-Row":
        self.grid = self.generate_no_four(size)
    else:
        self.grid = [[random.choice([6,7,""]) for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]

    self.display_grid()
Step 8 — Exporting SVG Filesdef export_svg(self):
    folder = filedialog.askdirectory()
    if not folder:
        return
dwg = svgwrite.Drawing("puzzle.svg", size=("700","800"))
dwg.add(dwg.rect((0,0),("100%","100%"), fill=self.bg_color.get()))
for r in range(size):
    for c in range(size):
        dwg.add(dwg.text(str(self.grid[r][c]),
                insert=(100+c*80,100+r*80)))
dwg.save()

Step 9 — Barcode Generation
def generate_barcode(self):
    code = "".join(str(random.randint(0,9)) for _ in range(12))
    barcode = EAN13(code, writer=ImageWriter())
    barcode.save("barcode")
This creates a scannable barcode image.Step 10 — Save & Load Puzzleswith open("puzzle.json","w") as f:
    json.dump(self.grid,f)
with open("puzzle.json","r") as f:
    self.grid = json.load(f)

pandas: Handles CSV/TXT data.scikit-learn: Provides machine learning tools.joblib: Saves and loads trained models.ttkbootstrap: Makes your GUI look modern.tkinterdnd2: Adds drag-and-drop support (optional).Step 2: Download the SMS Spam Dataset AutomaticallyWe’ll use the SMSSpamCollection dataset from the UCI repository. The script downloads it automatically if it’s missing.import urllib.request
import zipfile
import os
import sys

def resource_path(file_name):
    base_path = getattr(sys, "_MEIPASS", os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    return os.path.join(base_path, file_name)

def download_dataset():
    url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/smsspamcollection.zip"
    zip_path = resource_path("smsspamcollection.zip")

    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, zip_path)

    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as z:
        z.extractall(resource_path(""))

    os.remove(zip_path)
    print("[INFO] Dataset downloaded successfully!")
This ensures that even if the dataset is missing, the app will fetch it automatically.Step 3: Train the Machine Learning ModelWe’ll use Naive Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization to classify SMS messages.import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

def train_sms_model():
    ds_path = resource_path("SMSSpamCollection")

    if not os.path.exists(ds_path):
        download_dataset()

    df = pd.read_csv(ds_path, sep="\t", header=None, names=["label", "text"])
    df["label_num"] = df["label"].map({"ham": 0, "spam": 1})

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df["text"], df["label_num"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model = make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print(f"[INFO] Model trained — Test Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)*100:.2f}%")

    joblib.dump(model, resource_path("sms_spam_model.pkl"))
    return model
Tip: The TF-IDF vectorizer converts text into numbers, and Naive Bayes predicts whether a message is spam.We’ll create a helper function to load the model if it already exists, otherwise, it trains a new one.def load_model():
    model_path = resource_path("sms_spam_model.pkl")
    if os.path.exists(model_path):
        return joblib.load(model_path)
    return train_sms_model()
Step 5: Create a Worker to Process SMS FilesFor batch classification, we’ll build a SpamWorker class that reads CSV/TXT files and labels messages.import csv

class SpamWorker:
    def __init__(self, files, model):
        self.files = files
        self.model = model

    def run(self):
        for path in self.files:
            with open(path, newline="", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") as f:
                reader = csv.reader(f)
                texts = [row[0].strip() for row in reader if row]

                labels_num = self.model.predict(texts)
                labels = ["SPAM" if l == 1 else "HAM" for l in labels_num]

                for t, lbl in zip(texts, labels):
                    print(f"{lbl} | {t}")
This prints each SMS with its predicted label. Later, we’ll connect it to a GUI for a better user experience.Step 6: Build a GUI with TkinterWe’ll use ttkbootstrap for styling. This allows drag-and-drop support and batch processing.import ttkbootstrap as tb
from tkinter import filedialog

class SpamShieldApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tb.Window(themename="darkly")
        self.root.title("SpamShield v3.1")
        self.model = load_model()
        self.files = []

        self.build_ui()

    def build_ui(self):
        tb.Label(self.root, text="📩 SpamShield - AI SMS Detector", font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)

        self.path_input = tb.Entry(self.root, width=80)
        self.path_input.pack(pady=5)

        tb.Button(self.root, text="📂 Browse Files", bootstyle="info", command=self.browse_files).pack(pady=5)
        tb.Button(self.root, text="🚀 Start Classification", bootstyle="success", command=self.start).pack(pady=5)

    def browse_files(self):
        self.files = filedialog.askopenfilenames(filetypes=[("CSV Files","*.csv"), ("Text Files","*.txt")])
        self.path_input.delete(0, "end")
        self.path_input.insert(0, f"{len(self.files)} files selected")

    def start(self):
        worker = SpamWorker(self.files, self.model)
        worker.run()

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()
The GUI lets users select files and classify messages with one click.Finally, add the  section to run your app:if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = SpamShieldApp()
    app.run()

Rule-based (static priorities, deadlines, heuristics), or
“AI-powered” in name only, applying ML everywhere whether it makes sense or not.
I wanted to explore a third path.
So I built PriorityPilot — a CLI-first task & project manager that learns from your behavior, but only when the data actually justifies it.
Machine Learning is powerful — but only after:the signal is stronger than a simple baselinethe model proves it’s better than heuristicsPriorityPilot starts fully rule-based, and progressively enables ML only when it earns the right to do so.
No magic. No hype. Just measured decisions.
Manage projects and tasks from the terminalestimated vs actual hours
Learn from:your task completion patternsordering decisions you implicitly make
Then it uses ML to:rank tasks pairwise (what should come before what)
All while staying transparent about confidence and limitations.
Because:
context switching kills focus
developers already live in the terminalPriorityPilot supports:
Basic mode → minimal friction
Advanced mode → ML insights, confidence intervals, drift warnings
Same tool, different levels of depth. (This Is the Important Part)
PriorityPilot is ML-first in design, but ML-last in execution.
Below ~10 samples → no ML
Pure heuristics and neutral predictions
Baseline Always Wins by Default
Ridge regression baseline
ML models must outperform it
If they don’t → they’re ignored
Drift Detection
If your behavior changes, the system notices
Models are downgraded automatically
Estimates include confidence intervals
Warnings appear when predictions are unreliable
This is not “AI guessing”. It’s ML behaving responsibly.
Models Used (Nothing Exotic)
Gradient Boosting → priority prediction
Random Forest → effort estimation
Logistic Regression → pairwise ranking
Ridge → baseline sanity check
Simple models. Interpretable. Good enough.If You’re Curious

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! I want to talk about making computers understand human language. It sounds complex, but with Python, we can start with simple steps and build up to impressive applications. Over the years, I've used these methods to analyze customer feedback, automate support, and even generate content. Let me show you how you can do the same.First, we need to prepare our text. Raw text is messy—full of URLs, odd punctuation, and variations. Think of this like washing vegetables before you cook. We clean it to get consistent results. In Python, libraries like  help with this intelligent cleaning, called preprocessing and tokenization.This code turns a sentence into clean, standard parts. The lemma is the base word—"planning" becomes "plan". This consistency is crucial for the next steps.Once text is clean, we can find the important names and places in it. This is called Named Entity Recognition (NER). It's like a highlighter for text, picking out companies, people, and locations automatically. I use this to quickly scan news articles or legal documents for key players.Running this shows that "Microsoft" and "Google" are organizations (ORG), while "Seattle" and "California" are geographic locations (GPE). This automatic tagging saves hours of manual review.Now, let's gauge feeling or opinion in text, which is sentiment analysis. Early tools just classified text as positive or negative. Now, we can detect nuance, like frustration or mild satisfaction. I've built systems that track brand sentiment from social media using these techniques.This gives a measurable score for emotion. For more advanced needs, pre-trained transformer models from libraries like  can detect sarcasm or mixed feelings, which I often integrate for customer service analysis.When you have thousands of documents, you need to find the common themes without reading each one. This is topic modeling. I think of it as a sorting machine that reads all your documents and groups them by hidden topics. LDA is a classic algorithm for this.This might output Topic 0: stocks, markets, tech, highs, surge and Topic 1: climate, emission, goals, reduction, conference. It instantly reveals the main themes: finance and environment.For tasks like spam detection or categorizing support tickets, we use text classification. We teach a model by showing it many labeled examples. Today, fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models gives remarkable accuracy, even with modest amounts of your own data.For production, you'd use the  library by Hugging Face, which handles the complex steps. I've used this to build classifiers that route customer emails to the correct department with over 95% accuracy.Creating conversational agents or generating text requires sequence-to-sequence models. These are the engines behind many chatbots. They read an input sequence (like a user's question) and generate an output sequence (the response). I'll show a simplified concept.Real models, like GPT or DialoGPT, are trained on massive dialogues and generate far more coherent and varied responses. The key is they understand context; they remember what was said earlier in the conversation.Long documents need summaries. There are two main ways: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization picks the most important existing sentences. It's like highlighting. Abstractive summarization writes new sentences to convey the core meaning, like a human would.For abstractive summarization, I often use the  feature from the  library with a model like . It can take a long article and produce a concise, well-written paragraph.Finally, we have machine translation. Modern neural translation models understand context much better than old word-for-word systems. They can handle idioms and technical terms. Python makes it straightforward to access state-of-the-art models.The real magic is that these models, such as the MarianMT models, have been trained on millions of sentence pairs. They don't just swap words; they rephrase ideas to sound natural in the target language.Each of these eight techniques is a tool. You start with preprocessing to clean your data. Then, you might extract entities to find key information. Sentiment analysis tells you how people feel. Topic modeling helps you organize large collections of text. Classification automates sorting. Sequence models enable conversation and generation. Summarization condenses information. Translation breaks down language barriers.
  
  
  I often combine them. For instance, I might translate foreign social media posts, analyze their sentiment, extract mentioned company names, and summarize the main topics—all in an automated pipeline. Python's ecosystem, with libraries like , , , and , makes this integration possible. The best approach is to start simple, get one technique working, and then gradually add more complexity as your needs grow.

When i started off the week I genuinely thought I already knew everything I needed, but man was I pleasantly surprised at how powerful that testing suite is. Today I'm going to go over a few new things I learned when implementing my tests suite, including:Assertion behind the scenesOne of the first things I noticed when switching from unittest to pytest was how much simpler assertions are. In unittest, you need to use specific methods like , , , etc:# unittest style
self.assertEqual(result, 5)
self.assertTrue(is_valid)
self.assertIn("error", message)
With pytest, you just use Python's built-in  statement:# pytest style
assert result == 5
assert is_valid
assert "error" in message
I was wondering how a 3rd party package could make assertion statements clearer than what's built in to Python, and while digging deeper I found that there's a whole process that goes on when the test fails.
  
  
  Assert Rewriting with AST
Pytest uses the built in assert function because it raises an AssertionException when the case does not pass. This built-in assertion check allows Pytest to work with built-in functionality and expand functionality from there.For example, once an AssertionException is raised pytest uses assertion rewriting to replace the default string. This is done at import time where pytest can grab the value of each variable and sub expressions. This new info is used to provide the logs with more details like:Provides a diff of what was given and what was expectedThe line the test failed atWhat was the failure (mismatch, missing item, etc)By doing this at import time, it's able to place all code in an Abstract Syntax Tree (yes, the same AST we're working with in this project), finds all the  statements, and rewrites them to capture intermediate values before the assertion runs. This is why when an assertion fails, pytest can show you exactly what each part of the expression evaluated to:def test_string_comparison():
    result = "hello world"
    assert result == "hello pytest"
=========================== FAILURES ===========================
_________________ test_string_comparison _______________________

    def test_string_comparison():
        result = "hello world"
>       assert result == "hello pytest"
E       AssertionError: assert 'hello world' == 'hello pytest'
E         
E         - hello pytest
E         + hello world

======================== 1 failed in 0.02s =====================
This works for complex expressions too:def test_list_membership():
    items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    target = "grape"
    assert target in items
E       AssertionError: assert 'grape' in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
Pytest captured both the value of  and  before the assertion ran, so it can show you exactly why it failed.Coming from Node, one thing I appreciated about jest is being able to use , , , and  in combination with  scopes to setup and tear down test data in a straightforward manner. I was relieved to see that pytest gives us these features with the ability of fixtures that allow us to specify the same level of setup, teardown, and scope that's in jest.
  
  
  Why Fixtures over beforeEach
While I was relieved to see familiar patterns, I quickly realized that fixtures are actually more powerful than Jest's approach in a few key ways: - Fixtures can depend on other fixtures. We injected pytest's built-in tmp_path fixture into our own custom fixture - that's composition in action. In Jest, you'd have to nest your beforeEach blocks or manually call setup functions to achieve something similar. - Fixtures let you specify how often they run: function (default, runs for each test), class, module, or session. If I have an expensive setup like connecting to a database, I can scope it to session and it only runs once for the entire suite.Reusability via conftest.py - Any fixture defined in a conftest.py file is automatically available to all tests in that directory and subdirectories. No imports needed. - This one was subtle but important. With Jest's beforeEach, the setup runs before every test in that scope whether you need it or not. With pytest, fixtures only run when a test actually requests them as a parameter. If I have 10 tests in a class but only 3 need the sample_code_file fixture, it only gets created 3 times. This keeps tests fast and avoids unnecessary setup.Part of testing the ASTAnalyzer was making sure that we had a file with data to parse throughout out tests. Initially I created a sample file in a tests/data document and tested against that, but then found that we can create one using a combination of our own fixture and one of pytest's built in fixtures:@pytest.fixture
def sample_code_file(tmp_path):
    """Factory fixture to create temporary Python files with specified content."""

    def _create_file(content, filename="test_file.py"):
        file_path = tmp_path / filename
        file_path.write_text(content)
        return str(file_path)

    return _create_file

def test_enter_opens_file(self, sample_code_file):
    """__enter__ opens the file and returns file object."""
    filepath = sample_code_file("x = 1")
    with Parser(filepath) as f:
        assert f is not None
        assert not f.closed

def test_context_manager_with_exception(self, sample_code_file):
    """File is closed even when exception occurs."""
    filepath = sample_code_file("content")
    file_ref = None
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        with Parser(filepath) as f:
            file_ref = f
            raise ValueError("test error")
    assert file_ref.closed
As we can see, we've created a  that takes in the content that we want to test against and automatically writes it to a file. This allows us to have a piece of reusable code that can be used to test all types of content inside of the fileOne of the harder things I found while setting up my initial tests was making sure that my printing and logging decorators were being tested. Initially I was using  to mimic this behavior like so:@logger(logging.DEBUG)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


def test_ast_log_defaults():
    with patch("ast_analyzer.decorators.logger.logger") as mock_logger:
        add(3, 5)

    mock_logger.debug.assert_called()
    call_args = str(mock_logger.debug.call_args)
    assert "add" in call_args
The test technically works, it checks that mock logger was called in the  function, but it doesn't actually check what the contents of that log are. With pytest we can use  to grab the output and save it to a file that we can then read from:@logger(logging.DEBUG)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_ast_log_defaults(caplog):
    with caplog.at_level(logging.DEBUG):
        add(3, 5)

    assert "DEBUG" in caplog.text
    assert "add" in caplog.text
With this new functionality, we can look for specific strings of text inside of the log. We also have control over the logging level that we display, so we can write tests for DEBUG and INFO to check that the text in both of those logs are appearing properly. This can also be done with capsys for checking print statements:def test_prints_timing_output(capsys):
    """Decorator should print timing information to stdout."""

    factorial(3)
    captured = capsys.readouterr()
    assert "factorial" in captured.out
    assert "->" in captured.out
In both formats we can see the ease of use that pytest gives us for accessing this textLast but not least, there's parametrization. Parametrization is a technique that's used in python to make code more modular and reusable. In our specific case, we use parametrization for testing by iterating through multiple parameters. This is a great way to reduce the amount of code in your test suite without losing any functionality. To demo this, I'll show a before and after of a series of tests made in the repo.When we create our custom , one thing we do on initialization is see how many children the Node has. In order to test that our  declaration for children is working, we set up the following tests:def test_str_shows_children_count_one_child(self):
    """__str__ displays the number of children."""
    tree = ast.parse("x = 1")
    node = ASTNode(tree)
    assert str(node) == f"AST Node | Children: 1"

def test_str_shows_children_count_mult_children(self):
    """__str__ displays the number of children."""
    tree = ast.parse("x = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3")
    node = ASTNode(tree)
    assert str(node) == f"AST Node | Children: 3"

As you can see, the code is simple enough where having it be exactly the same isnt too bad, but its repetitive which is something that we want to avoid. When playing around with this I thought of combining this into a collection and testing that way:def test_str_shows_children_count(self):
    """__str__ displays the number of children."""
    tree = ast.parse("x = 1")
    node = ASTNode(tree)
    assert str(node) == "AST Node | Children: 1"

    tree = ast.parse("x = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3")

While this is definitely a lot cleaner and lean, one thing I didn't appreciate is that I'm stuffing two test cases into one. In the future if one of these were to fail (in a larger test) it would be a bit annoying trying to figure out which one of these was the culprit
  
  
  Introducing: Parametrization
Parametrization solves the above by creating a matrix of key values to test against and running them against 1 test. Unlike our second option above, using parametrization breaks the singular test out into the number of suites we specified above so that we can see which of the items failed a test@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "code,expected_count",
    [
        ("x = 1", 1),

The way this works is pretty straightforward:We use the  and pass in two arguments

A string of variable names separated by commasA tuple of values that you want each variable to represent on iterationFor each tuple in our collection we passed, the test will iterate over and replace the variables with the values we providedEvery time the test is run, it reports it as a separate test, meaning that we can get more insight into which parameter will fail in case of an error.This feature of pytest works great when you want to test one specific thing against a number of start points. For our test, we just wanted to make sure that an ASTNode was created successfully based on the input, so it's a perfect candidate for parametrization. If I wanted to check the outputs or error handling of certain inputs, that is better handled as a separate test so that we can check on a number of items (type of exception if raised, state of ASTNode, log statements, etc).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Making Date-Based Content Reusable</title><link>https://dev.to/cobel1024/making-date-based-content-reusable-5126</link><author>Dora</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:55:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Content with specific dates can't be reused.Example: An exam with these dates:Grading due: Jan 18, 2024Appeal deadline: Jan 20, 2024Confirmation due: Jan 22, 2024Want to reuse this exam in July?

You know how pipelines, ETL, and warehouses work. Now comes the question every beginner asks:"What tools should I actually learn?"The data engineering landscape is overwhelming. New frameworks launch every month. Cloud providers release new services constantly. It's easy to get lost.In this article, I'll cut through the noise. After years of building data systems and training engineers across organizations, I've identified what actually matters — and what you can safely ignore as a beginner.Let's build your toolkit.Every data engineer needs proficiency in four areas: — How you write logic — Where data lives — How you schedule and manage pipelines — Where everything runsMaster these, and you can work anywhere.SQL is the language of data. Period.Every data engineer writes SQL daily. You'll use it to:Transform data in warehousesIf you learn only one thing from this article: Not just SELECT statements. Learn:CTEs (Common Table Expressions)DDL (creating and altering tables)
  
  
  Python: The Swiss Army Knife
Python is the default scripting language for data engineering.
  
  
  Other Languages Worth Knowing
For beginners: focus on . Add others as needed.You'll interact with different storage systems depending on the use case.
  
  
  Relational Databases (OLTP)
Used for transactional workloads: — Open source, widely used — Popular in web applications — Common in enterprise environments
  
  
  Cloud Data Warehouses (OLAP)
Used for analytical workloads:Ease of use, separation of storage/computeServerless, great for GCP usersUnified lakehouse platformAzure ecosystem integrationUsed for raw and unstructured data storage:
  
  
  Which Should You Learn First?
Start with  for relational concepts, then pick one cloud warehouse. I recommend  or  — both have free tiers and are beginner-friendly.Orchestration is how you schedule, monitor, and manage pipelines.Without orchestration, you'd be running scripts manually. That doesn't scale.Airflow uses DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to define workflows. If you learn one orchestration tool, make it Airflow.Modern, Python-native, easier than AirflowFor transformation orchestrationLearn  first. It's everywhere. Once you understand Airflow, picking up alternatives is straightforward.dbt has changed how data teams work.Write transformations in SQLVersion control your modelsDocument your transformationsdbt follows the ELT pattern — transformations happen inside the warehouse.If you're working with a modern data stack, dbt is almost certainly part of it.Almost all data engineering today happens in the cloud. You need to be comfortable with at least one major provider.S3, Redshift, Glue, Lambda, EMR, KinesisBigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Pub/SubSynapse, Data Lake, Data Factory, Event Hubs
  
  
  Which Cloud Should You Learn?
Check job postings in your target market. In my experience: — Most job listings, largest market share — Strong in startups and data-heavy companies — Dominant in enterprise, especially Microsoft shopsPick one and go deep. The concepts transfer across platforms.When data exceeds what a single machine can handle, you need distributed processing.Spark is the dominant big data framework.Processing billions of rowsComplex transformations at scaleMachine learning on large datasetsYou can write Spark jobs in Python (PySpark), Scala, or SQL.Honestly? Not as often as people think.Many teams reach for Spark too early. Modern warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery) handle most workloads without needing Spark.Learn the basics, but don't obsess over it until you're dealing with truly massive datasets.For real-time data processing:Message streaming, event backboneReal-time stream processing
  
  
  Should Beginners Learn Streaming?
Not immediately. Most entry-level roles focus on batch processing. Streaming is an intermediate to advanced skill.Understand the concepts, but prioritize batch pipelines first.
  
  
  DevOps and Infrastructure
Modern data engineers don't just write pipelines. They deploy and maintain them.Version control — absolutely essentialContainerization — run anywhereAutomated testing and deploymentYou don't need to become a DevOps engineer. But you should be able to:Understand CI/CD pipelinesYou'll hear this term often. It refers to a common combination of tools:Ingestion:    Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch

Transform:    dbt
Orchestrate:  Airflow, Prefect, dbt Cloud
Visualize:    Looker, Tableau, Metabase

  What to Learn First: A Priority List
If I were starting over today, here's my order: — Snowflake or BigQuery — Understand orchestration — Modern transformation — AWS, GCP, or Azure — Containerization basics — When you need scaleDon't try to learn everything at once. Build depth, then breadth.

People argue about it for hours, write thread after thread, and treat it as the answer to every quality problem. This is a dramatic shift from 2024 or even early 2025, when the term was barely known. Now everyone knows evaluation matters. Everyone wants to “.“But now they’re lost. There’s so much noise coming from all directions, with everyone using the term for completely different things. Some (might we say, most) people think “evals” means prompting AI models to judge other AI models, building a dashboard of them that will magically solve their quality problems. They don’t understand that what they actually need is a process, one that’s far more nuanced and comprehensive than spinning up a few automated graders.We’ve started to really hate the term. It’s bringing more confusion than clarity. Evals are only important in the context of product quality, and product quality is a process. It’s the ongoing discipline of deciding what “good” means for your product, measuring it in the right ways at the right times, learning where it breaks in the real world, and repeatedly closing the loop with fixes that stick.We recently talked about this on , and so many people reached out saying they related to the confusion, that they’d been struggling with the same questions. That’s why we’re writing this post.Here’s what this article is going to do: explain the entire system you need to build for AI product quality, without using the word “evals.” (We’ll try our best. :p)The status quo for shipping any reliable product requires ensuring three things:: A way to estimate how it behaves while you’re still developing it, before any customer sees it: Signals for how it’s actually performing once real customers are using it: A reliable feedback loop that lets you find problems, fix them, and get better over timeThis article is about how to ensure these three things in the context of AI products: why AI is different from traditional software, and what you need to build instead.Why Traditional Testing BreaksIn traditional software, testing handles all three things we just described.Think about booking a hotel on Booking.com. You select your dates from a calendar. You pick a city from a dropdown. You filter by price range, star rating, and amenities. At every step, you’re clicking on predefined options. The system knows exactly what inputs to expect, and the engineers can anticipate almost every path you might take. If you click the ”search” button with valid dates and a valid city, the system returns hotels. The behavior is predictable.This predictability means testing covers everything: You write unit tests and integration tests before launch to verify behavior. You monitor production for errors and exceptions. When something breaks, you get a stack trace that tells you exactly what went wrong. It’s almost automatic. You write a new test, fix the bug, and ship. When you fix something, it stays fixed. Find issue, fix issue, move on.Now imagine the same task, but through a chat interface: ”I need a pet-friendly hotel in Austin for next weekend, under $200, close to downtown but not too noisy.”The problem becomes much more complex. And the traditional testing approach falls apart.The way users interact with the system can’t be anticipated upfront. There’s no dropdown constraining what they type. They can phrase their request however they want, include context you didn’t expect, or ask for things your system was never designed to handle. You can’t write test cases for inputs you can’t predict.And because there’s an AI model at the center of this, the outputs are nondeterministic. The model is probabilistic. You can’t assert that a specific input will always produce a specific output. There’s no single ”correct answer” to check against.On top of that, the process itself is a black box. With traditional software, you can trace exactly why an output was produced. You wrote the code; you know the logic. With an LLM, you can’t. You feed in a prompt, something happens inside the model, and you get a response. If it’s wrong, you don’t get a stack trace. You get a confident-sounding answer that might be subtly or completely incorrect.This is the core challenge: AI products have a much larger surface area of user input that you can’t predict upfront, processed by a nondeterministic system that can produce outputs you never anticipated, through a process you can’t fully inspectThe traditional feedback loop breaks down. You can’t estimate behavior during development because you can’t anticipate all the inputs. You can’t easily catch issues in production because there’s no clear error signal, just a response that might be wrong. And you can’t reliably improve because the thing you fix might not stay fixed when the input changes slightly.Whatever you tested before launch was based on behavior you anticipated. And that anticipated behavior can’t be guaranteed once real users arrive.This is why we need a different approach to determining quality for AI products. The testing paradigm that works for clicking through Booking.com doesn’t transfer to chatting with an AI. You need something different.So we’ve established that AI products are fundamentally harder to test than traditional software. The inputs are unpredictable, the outputs are nondeterministic, and the process is opaque. This is why we need dedicated approaches to measuring quality.But there’s another layer of complexity that causes confusion: the distinction between assessing the model and assessing the product.Foundation AI models are judged for quality by the companies that build them. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all run their models through extensive testing before release. They measure how well the model performs on coding tasks, reasoning problems, factual questions, and dozens of other capabilities. They give the model a set of inputs, check whether it produces expected outputs or takes expected actions, and use that to assess quality.This is where benchmarks come from. You’ve probably seen them: LMArena, MMLU scores, HumanEval results. Model providers publish these numbers to show how their model stacks up. “We’re #1 on this benchmark” is a common marketing claim.These scores represent real testing. The model was given specific tasks and its performance was measured. But here’s the thing: These scores have limited use for people building products. Model companies are racing toward capability parity. The gaps between top models are shrinking. What you actually need to know is whether the model will work for your specific product and produce good quality responses in your context.There are two distinct layers here:. This is the foundation model itself: GPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever you’re building on. It has general capabilities that have been tested by its creators. It can reason, write code, answer questions, follow instructions. The benchmarks measure these general capabilities.. This is your application, the thing you’re actually shipping to users. A customer support bot. A booking assistant. Your product is built on top of a foundation model, but it’s not the same thing. It has specific requirements, specific users, and specific definitions of success. It integrates with your tools, operates under your constraints, and handles use cases the benchmark creators never anticipated. Your product lives in a custom ecosystem that no model provider could possibly simulate.Benchmark scores tell you what a model can do in general. They don’t tell you whether it works for your product.The model layer has already been assessed by someone else. Your job is to assess the product layer: against your specific requirements, your specific users, your specific definition of success.We bring this up because so many people obsess over model performance benchmarks. They spend weeks comparing leaderboards, trying to find the “best” model, and end up in “model selection hell.” The truth is, you need to pick something reasonable and build your own quality assessment framework. You cannot heavily rely on provider benchmarks to tell you what works for your product.So you need to assess your product’s quality. Against what, exactly?Three things work together:: Real inputs paired with known-good outputs. If a user asks, “What’s your return policy?“ what should the system say? You need concrete examples of questions and acceptable answers. These become your ground truth, the standard you’re measuring against.Start with 10–50 high-quality examples that cover your most important scenarios. A small set of carefully chosen examples beats a large set of sloppy ones. You can expand later as you learn what actually matters in practice.This is really just product intuition. You’re thinking: What does my product support? How would users interact with it? What user personas exist? How should my ideal product behave? You’re designing the experience and gathering a reference for what “good“ looks like.: Once you have reference examples, you need to think about how to measure quality. What dimensions matter? This is also product intuition. These dimensions are your metrics. Usually, if you’ve built out your reference example dataset very well, they should give you an overview of what metrics to look into based on the behavior that you want to see. Metrics essentially are dimensions that you want to focus on to assess quality. An example of a dimension could be, say, helpfulness.: What does “good“ actually mean for each metric? This is a step that often gets skipped. It’s common to say “we’re measuring helpfulness“ without defining what helpful means in context. Here’s the thing: Helpfulness for a customer support bot is different from helpfulness for a legal assistant. A helpful support bot should be concise, solve the problem quickly, and escalate at the right time. A helpful legal assistant should be thorough and explain all the nuances. A rubric makes this explicit. It’s the instructions that your metric hinges on. You need this documented so everyone knows what they’re actually measuring. Sometimes if metrics are more objective in nature—for instance, “Was a correct JSON retrieved?“ or “Was a particular tool called done correctly?”—you don’t need rubrics at all. Subjective metrics are the ones that you generally need rubrics for, so keep that in mind.For example, a customer support bot might define helpfulness like this:: Resolves the issue completely in one response, uses clear language, offers next steps if relevant: Answers the question but requires follow-up or includes unnecessary information: Misunderstands the question, gives irrelevant information, or fails to address the core issueTo summarize, you have expected behavior from the user, expected behavior from the system (your reference examples), metrics (the dimensions you’re assessing), and rubrics (how you define those metrics). A metric like “helpfulness“ is just a word and means nothing unless it’s grounded by the rubric. All of this gets documented, which helps you start judging offline quality before you ever go into production.You’ve defined what you’re measuring against. Now, how do you actually measure it?There are three approaches, and all of them have their place.: Deterministic rules that can be verified programmatically. Did the response include a required disclaimer? Is it under the word limit? Did it return valid JSON? Did it refuse to answer when it should have? These checks are simple, fast, cheap, and reliable. They won’t catch everything, but they catch the straightforward stuff. You should always start here.: Using one model to grade another. You provide a rubric and ask the model to score responses. This scales better than human review and can assess subjective qualities like tone or helpfulness.But there’s a risk. An LLM judge that hasn’t been calibrated against human judgment can lead you astray. It might consistently rate things wrong. It might have blind spots that match the blind spots of the model you’re grading. If your judge doesn’t agree with humans on what “good“ looks like, you’re optimizing for the wrong thing. Calibration against human judgment is super critical.: The gold standard. Humans assess quality directly, either through expert review or user feedback. It’s slow and expensive and doesn’t scale. But it’s necessary. You need human judgment to calibrate your LLM judges, to catch things automated checks miss, and to make final calls on high-stakes decisions.The right approach: Start with code-based checks for everything you can automate. Add LLM judges carefully, with extensive calibration. Reserve human review for where it matters most.One important note: When you’re first building your reference examples, have humans do the grading. Don’t jump straight to LLM judges. LLM judges are notorious for being miscalibrated, and you need a human baseline to calibrate against. Get humans to judge first, understand what “good“ looks like from their perspective, and then use that to calibrate your automated judges. Calibrating LLM judges is a whole other blog post. We won’t dig into it here. But this is a nice guide from Arize to help you get started.Production Surprises You (and Humbles You)Let’s say you’re building a customer support bot. You’ve built your reference dataset with 50 (or 100 or 200—whatever that number is, this still applies) example conversations. You’ve defined metrics for helpfulness, accuracy, and appropriate escalation. You’ve set up code checks for response length and required disclaimers, calibrated an LLM judge against human ratings, and run human review on the tricky cases. Your offline quality looks solid. You ship. Then real users show up. Here are just some examples of emerging behaviors you might see. The real world is a lot more nuanced.Your reference examples don’t cover what users actually ask. You anticipated questions about return policies, shipping times, and order status. But users ask about things you didn’t include: “Can I return this if my dog chewed on the box?“ or “My package says delivered but I never got it, and also I’m moving next week.“ They combine multiple issues in one message. They reference previous conversations. They phrase things in ways your reference examples never captured.Users find scenarios you missed. Maybe your bot handles refund requests well but struggles when users ask about partial refunds on bundled items. Maybe it works fine in English but breaks when users mix in Spanish. No matter how thorough your prelaunch testing, real users will find gaps.User behavior shifts over time. The questions you get in month one don’t look like the questions you get in month six. Users learn what the bot can and can’t do. They develop workarounds. They find new use cases. Your reference examples were a snapshot of expected behavior, but expected behavior changes.And then there’s scale. If you’re handling 5,000 conversations a day with a 95% success rate, that’s still 250 failures every day. You can’t manually review everything.This is the gap between offline and online quality. Your offline assessment gave you confidence to ship. It told you the system worked on the examples you anticipated. But online quality is about what happens with real users, real scale, and real unpredictability. The work of figuring out what’s actually breaking and fixing it starts the moment real users arrive.This is where you realize a few things (a.k.a. lessons):Lesson 1: Production will surprise you regardless of your best efforts. You can build metrics and measure them before deployment, but it’s almost impossible to think of all cases. You’re bound to be surprised in production.Lesson 2: Your metrics might need updates. They’re not “once done and throw.“ You might need to update rubrics or add entirely new metrics. Since your predeployment metrics might not capture all kinds of issues, you need to rely on online implicit and explicit signals too: Did the user show frustration? Did they drop off the call? Did they leave a thumbs down? These signals help you sample bad experiences so you can make fixes. And if needed, you can implement new metrics to track how a dimension is doing. Maybe you didn’t have a metric for handling out-of-scope requests. Maybe escalation accuracy should be a new metric.Over time, you also realize that some metrics become less useful because user behavior has changed. This is where the flywheel becomes important.This is the part most people miss and pay least attention to but you should be paying the  attention to. Measuring quality isn’t a phase you complete before launch. It’s not a gate you pass through once. It’s an engine that runs continuously, for the entire life of your product. You can’t review everything, so you sample intelligently. Flag conversations that look unusual: long exchanges, repeated questions, user frustration signals, low confidence scores. These are the interactions worth examining.Discover new failure modes. When you review flagged interactions, you find problems your prelaunch testing missed. Maybe users are asking about a topic you didn’t anticipate. Maybe the system handles a certain phrasing poorly. These are new failure modes, gaps in your understanding of what can go wrong.Update your metrics and reference data. Every new failure mode becomes a new thing to measure. You can either fix the issue and move on, or if you have a sense that the issue needs to be monitored for future interactions, add a new metric or a set of rubrics to an existing metric. Add examples to your reference dataset. Your quality system gets smarter because production taught you what to look for.Ship improvements and repeat. Fix the issues, push the changes, and start monitoring again. The cycle continues.This is the flywheel: Production informs quality measurement, quality measurement guides improvement, improvement changes production, and production reveals new gaps. It keeps running. . . (Until your product reaches a convergence point. How often you need to run it depends on your online signals: Are users satisfied, or are there anomalies?)And your metrics have a lifecycle.Not all metrics serve the same purpose: (borrowing the term from Anthropic’s blog) measure things you’re actively trying to improve. They should start at a low pass rate (maybe 40%, maybe 60%). These are the hills you’re climbing. If a capability metric is already at 95%, it’s not telling you where to focus. (again borrowing the term from Anthropic’s blog) protect what you’ve already achieved. These should be near 100%. If a regression metric drops, something broke. You need to investigate immediately. As you improve on capability metrics, the things you’ve mastered become regression metrics. have stopped giving you signal. They’re always green. They’re no longer informing decisions. When a metric saturates, run it less frequently or retire it entirely. It’s noise, not signal.Metrics should be born when you discover new failure modes, evolve as you improve, and eventually be retired when they’ve served their purpose. A static set of metrics that never changes is a sign that your quality system has stagnated.As promised, we made it through without using the word “evals.“ Hopefully this gives a glimpse into the lifecycle: assessing quality before deployment, deploying with the right level of confidence, connecting production signals to metrics, and building a flywheel.Now, the issue with the word “evals“ is that people use it for all sorts of things:“We should build evals“ → Usually means “we should write LLM judges“ (useless if not calibrated and not part of the flywheel).“Evals are dead; A/B testing is key“ → This is part of the flywheel. Some companies overindex on online signals and fix issues without many offline metrics. Might or might not make sense based on product.“How are GPT-5.2 evals looking?“ → These are model benchmarks, often not useful for product builders.“How many evals do you have?“ → Might refer to data samples, metrics… We don’t know what.Here’s the deal: Everything we walked through (distinguishing model from product, building reference examples and rubrics, measuring with code and LLM judges and humans, monitoring production, running the continuous improvement flywheel, managing the lifecycle of your metrics) is what “evals“ should mean. But we don’t think one term should carry so much weight. We don’t want to use the term anymore. We want to point to different parts in the flywheel and have a fruitful conversation instead.And that’s why evals are not all you need. It’s a larger data science and monitoring problem. Think of quality assessment as an ongoing discipline, not a checklist item.We could have titled this article “Evals Are All You Need.“ But depending on your definition, that might not get you to read this article, because you think you already know what evals are.

But the line between them keeps blurring.Increasingly, employers expect data analysts to understand machine learning fundamentals. Not to build production AI systems—that's still data science territory—but to know when ML applies, how it works conceptually, and how to collaborate with ML teams.This isn't about becoming a data scientist. It's about being a more effective analyst in a world where machine learning is everywhere.
  
  
  What Machine Learning Actually Is
Strip away the hype and machine learning is pattern recognition at scale.Traditional programming: you write rules. If purchase > $1000 and first_order = True, flag for review.Machine learning: you provide examples. Here are 10,000 transactions, some fraudulent, some legitimate. The algorithm finds patterns that distinguish them.The key insight: ML discovers rules from data instead of you specifying them. This works when patterns exist but are too complex for humans to articulate.Machine learning isn't always the answer. Often simpler approaches work better.Patterns too complex for explicit rules (image recognition, natural language)Problems where you have lots of labeled examplesSituations where small accuracy improvements justify significant investmentTasks with stable patterns that won't shift rapidlyInsufficient data (less than hundreds or thousands of examples)Problems solvable with simple rules or SQLSituations requiring full explainability for complianceRapidly changing patterns that need frequent retrainingA common mistake: reaching for ML when a GROUP BY and a threshold would suffice.
  
  
  The Three Types of Learning
Machine learning approaches fall into three categories. You have labeled examples—inputs paired with known outputs. Predict house prices from features. Classify emails as spam or not. The algorithm learns the relationship between inputs and outputs. No labels, just data. Find natural groupings in customers. Detect anomalies in transactions. Reduce dimensionality for visualization. The algorithm discovers structure without being told what to look for. An agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties. Less relevant for most analysts—used mainly in robotics, games, and recommendation systems.As an analyst, you'll encounter supervised and unsupervised learning most often.
  
  
  Supervised Learning: Classification vs Regression
Supervised learning solves two types of problems. The output is a category. Will this customer churn? Is this transaction fraudulent? Which product category does this belong to? The output is a continuous number. What price will this house sell for? How many units will we sell next quarter?The distinction matters because different algorithms and evaluation metrics apply to each.
  
  
  Common Algorithms You'll Encounter
You don't need to implement these from scratch. But recognizing them helps.Linear/Logistic Regression. Simple, interpretable baselines. Linear regression predicts continuous values; logistic regression predicts probabilities for classification. Split data based on feature thresholds. Easy to understand and visualize. Prone to overfitting. Many decision trees voting together. More accurate than single trees, less interpretable.Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM). Build trees sequentially, each correcting previous errors. Currently dominates tabular data competitions. Find optimal boundaries between classes. Works well in high dimensions. Layers of connected nodes learning complex patterns. Essential for images, text, and unstructured data.For tabular data—what analysts typically work with—tree-based methods often perform best.Understanding how models learn helps you spot problems. Typically 70-80% for training, the rest for testing. Never evaluate on training data—it's like grading your own homework. The algorithm adjusts internal parameters to minimize prediction errors on training data. Test on held-out data. Adjust hyperparameters. Repeat. Final performance check on data the model has never seen.The fundamental challenge: generalization. A model that memorizes training data fails on new examples. Good models learn patterns that transfer.
  
  
  Overfitting: The Central Challenge
Overfitting happens when a model learns training data too well—including noise and quirks that don't generalize.Excellent training performance, poor test performanceModel complexity exceeds what the data supportsDramatic performance drops on new dataRegularization (penalizing complexity)An overfit model looks good in development and fails in production. This is why proper evaluation matters.Different metrics measure different aspects of model performance.MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average prediction error in original unitsRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes large errors more heavilyR² (R-squared): Proportion of variance explainedAccuracy: Percentage of correct predictions (misleading with imbalanced classes)Precision: Of positive predictions, how many were correct?Recall: Of actual positives, how many were found?F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recallAUC-ROC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curveChoose metrics that align with business objectives. Accuracy on a 99% negative dataset can be 99% just by predicting everything as negative.For classification, the confusion matrix is essential.From this, you can calculate any classification metric.False positives and false negatives have different costs. A spam filter that misses spam is annoying. A fraud detector that blocks legitimate transactions costs revenue. Optimize for what matters.Features—the input variables—often matter more than algorithm choice. Knowing that "days since last purchase" predicts churn better than raw timestamps makes a difference.Log transforms for skewed distributionsBinning continuous variablesOne-hot encoding for categorical variablesInteraction features (combining variables)Time-based features (day of week, month, etc.)Data analysts often excel at feature engineering because they understand the data and business context. This is where your skills directly improve ML.Many real problems have imbalanced classes. Fraud is rare. Churn happens to a minority. Disease is uncommon.Standard algorithms struggle—they learn to predict the majority class.Undersample the majority classOversample the minority class (SMOTE)Adjust class weights during trainingUse appropriate metrics (not accuracy)Imbalance is the norm in business problems. Expect to handle it.A single train-test split might be lucky or unlucky. Cross-validation provides more robust estimates.Split data into K equal partsTrain on K-1 parts, validate on the remaining partRepeat K times, rotating which part is held outThis gives a more reliable estimate of model performance and helps detect overfitting.Black box predictions often aren't enough. Stakeholders ask why the model made a decision. Linear regression, decision trees, and logistic regression have transparent logic.Interpretation techniques for complex models:Feature importance (which variables matter most)SHAP values (how each feature affects each prediction)Partial dependence plots (how one feature affects predictions)LIME (local explanations for individual predictions)When interpretability matters—for compliance, debugging, or stakeholder buy-in—consider it from the start.
  
  
  Working with Data Scientists
As an analyst, you might not build production ML systems. But you'll likely collaborate with those who do.Domain knowledge about the data and businessFeature ideas based on your experienceData cleaning and preparationEvaluation from a business perspectiveAlgorithm selection and tuningEffective collaboration requires shared language. Understanding ML basics lets you participate meaningfully in discussions.
  
  
  Getting Started Practically

Start with beginner-friendly competitions like Titanic survival prediction. "Hands-On Machine Learning" by Géron is accessible and practical.
  
  
  What You Don't Need (Yet)
Focus before breadth. These can wait:Deep learning and neural network architecturesAdvanced optimization techniquesCutting-edge research papersMaster the fundamentals first. Advanced topics build on solid foundations.
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions
Do I need to code to understand machine learning?
Basic Python helps significantly. You can understand concepts without code, but hands-on practice builds intuition faster.What's the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning?
AI is the broadest term (systems that seem intelligent). ML is a subset (learning from data). Deep learning is a subset of ML (neural networks with many layers).
Conceptual understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics helps but isn't essential for practical use. Libraries handle the math.Should data analysts learn ML?
Increasingly yes. You don't need to become a data scientist, but understanding when and how ML applies makes you more valuable.What's the easiest algorithm to start with?
Linear/logistic regression. Simple, interpretable, and the foundation for understanding more complex methods.How do I know if ML will help my problem?
Ask: Do I have enough labeled examples? Is the pattern learnable? Is the improvement worth the complexity? Often, simpler approaches suffice.What tools should I learn?
Start with scikit-learn for classical ML. Add pandas for data prep, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.How long does it take to learn ML basics?
A few weeks of focused study for conceptual understanding. Months to years for practical proficiency.Is AutoML replacing the need to understand ML?
AutoML automates algorithm selection and tuning but doesn't replace understanding. You still need to frame problems, prepare data, and interpret results.What's the biggest mistake beginners make?
Jumping to complex algorithms before understanding the data. Exploratory analysis and feature engineering usually matter more than algorithm choice.Machine learning isn't magic. It's pattern recognition powered by data and computation.As a data analyst, you don't need to become an ML expert. But understanding the basics—when it applies, how it works, and how to evaluate it—makes you more effective in a world where ML is increasingly ubiquitous.Start with the fundamentals. Build intuition through practice. The advanced topics will make more sense once you have a solid foundation.This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Modeling Urban Walking Risk Using Spatial-Temporal Machine Learning</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-urban-walking-risk-using-spatial-temporal-machine-learning/</link><author>Aneesh Patil</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Estimating neighborhood-level pedestrian risk from real-world incident data]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🔥 Trending Now: Today&apos;s Top Updates &amp; Viral Links - 2026-01-28</title><link>https://dev.to/tarun_walia_ad82c14a97e0c/trending-now-todays-top-updates-viral-links-2026-01-28-5804</link><author>tarun walia</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:45:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is the list of latest trending updates fetched on 2026-01-28.

Whether you're setting up a data science environment with Jupyter and Pandas, building production applications, or managing machine learning projects, the decision between Anaconda, Miniconda, and Mamba affects everything from installation speed and disk space usage to dependency resolution performance and environment reproducibility. Understanding their differences, strengths, and ideal use cases will help you make an informed choice that aligns with your specific needs and workflow requirements.The Python ecosystem offers multiple package management solutions, each optimized for different use cases. While traditional tools like venv and newer alternatives like uv have their place, conda-based solutions excel at managing complex scientific computing dependencies that include both Python packages and system libraries. This unique capability makes them indispensable for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing workflows where packages often require compiled binaries, system libraries, and non-Python dependencies.
  
  
  Understanding the Conda Ecosystem
The conda ecosystem consists of three main components: the package manager (conda), different distributions (Anaconda, Miniconda), and alternative implementations (Mamba). Each serves distinct purposes in the Python data science and development workflow. is both a package manager and an environment manager that handles Python packages along with their binary dependencies, system libraries, and even non-Python software. This makes it particularly valuable for scientific computing where packages like NumPy, SciPy, and machine learning frameworks have complex native dependencies. is the full-featured distribution that includes conda plus hundreds of pre-installed packages. It's designed for users who want everything ready out of the box, including popular data science libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and the Anaconda Navigator GUI. provides just the essentials: conda, Python, and a minimal set of dependencies. It's the lightweight alternative that lets you build custom environments from scratch, installing only what you need. represents the evolution of conda's dependency resolution engine. Originally a standalone tool, its core technology (libmamba) has been integrated into modern conda versions, offering significantly faster dependency resolution and environment creation.
  
  
  Anaconda: The Complete Solution
Anaconda is the heavyweight champion of Python distributions, weighing in at approximately  with over 600 pre-installed packages. This comprehensive installation includes everything from core data science libraries to development tools and visualization packages.Anaconda shines in scenarios where convenience and completeness matter more than disk space or installation speed. It's ideal for: entering data science who want immediate access to tools without learning package installation where consistency across student machines is important when you need to experiment with various libraries without setup overhead users who prefer Anaconda Navigator over command-line interfaces requiring commercial support and compliance featuresThe pre-installed packages include essential data science tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, and many others. This means you can start analyzing data or building machine learning models immediately after installation.
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


bash Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

 ~/.bashrc
The installation process is straightforward, and Anaconda Navigator provides a graphical interface for managing environments, packages, and launching applications like Jupyter Notebook or Spyder IDE.
  
  
  Miniconda: The Minimalist Approach
Miniconda takes the opposite philosophy: start minimal and add only what you need. At approximately , it includes just conda, Python, and essential dependencies—about  total.Miniconda is the preferred choice for: where smaller footprint and faster installation matter where image size directly impacts deployment speed who know exactly which packages they need where minimal environments reduce build times on systems with limited storageSecurity-conscious environments where fewer packages mean smaller attack surfaceThe minimalist approach gives you complete control over your environment. You explicitly install each package, which leads to more reproducible environments and better understanding of dependencies. This aligns well with modern Python design patterns for clean architecture where explicit dependencies are preferred.
  
  
  Miniconda Installation and Setup

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

 ~/.bashrc


conda create  myproject 3.11
conda activate myproject


conda pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
This workflow requires more steps but results in leaner, more maintainable environments. Each package is intentionally added, making it easier to track dependencies and reproduce environments across different systems.
  
  
  Mamba: The Performance Revolution
Mamba represents a significant leap forward in dependency resolution performance. Originally developed as a standalone conda alternative, its core technology has been integrated into conda itself, but standalone Mamba tools remain valuable for specific use cases.Mamba's libsolv-based solver delivers 50-80% faster dependency resolution compared to conda's legacy solver. In practical terms, this means:: 3 seconds vs 17 seconds for conda (in benchmark tests)Complex dependency resolution: Handles conflicts that would cause conda to fail: Comparable download times but faster resolution phase: More informative feedback when resolution failsThe performance gains are most noticeable when working with large environments or complex dependency trees common in machine learning and data science projects.As of  (November 2023), libmamba became conda's default solver. This means modern conda installations automatically benefit from Mamba's performance improvements without requiring separate Mamba installation.However, standalone  and  tools still offer value:: Single-binary, no installation required, perfect for containers: Full-featured alternative with additional commands like : Mamba tools often start faster than conda
conda mamba  base  conda-forge


mamba create  myenv 3.11 pandas numpy
mamba activate myenv
mamba scikit-learn


curl  https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba/linux-64/latest |  bin/micromamba
./bin/micromamba create  myenv 3.11
The command syntax is nearly identical to conda, making migration seamless. You can literally replace "conda" with "mamba" in most workflows.
  
  
  For Data Science Beginners
 if you're just starting with data science. The pre-installed packages and GUI tools (Anaconda Navigator) provide a smooth learning curve. You can focus on learning Python and data analysis rather than package management.
  
  
  For Production Development
 for production environments. The smaller footprint, explicit dependencies, and faster installation make it ideal for Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, and server deployments. This approach aligns with best practices for unit testing in Python where reproducible environments are critical. When you're ready to package your Python applications for distribution, tools like PyInstaller can help create standalone executables from your conda-managed environments.
  
  
  For Performance-Critical Workflows
Use modern conda (23.10.0+) which includes libmamba, or  if you need additional features. The faster dependency resolution significantly improves workflow efficiency, especially when frequently creating or modifying environments.
  
  
  For Containerized Applications
 for Docker containers. It's a single binary with no installation step, making it perfect for minimal container images. This is particularly useful when building containers for LLM applications with structured output where fast startup and small image size matter.Regardless of which tool you choose, follow these best practices.
For a comprehensive reference of conda commands, see our Conda Cheatsheet:
conda create  myproject 3.11


conda  environment.yml
conda create  environment.yml


conda config  auto_activate_base 
conda config  channels conda-forge
conda config  channel_priority strict
While you can use pip within conda environments, follow this order:Install conda packages first (they handle binary dependencies better)Use pip only for packages unavailable in condaAvoid mixing conda and pip for the same packageThis prevents dependency conflicts and ensures binary compatibility.Use  channel (more packages, better maintained)Enable  in modern conda (default in 23.10.0+)Consider  for CI/CD pipelinesCache packages locally for offline installations is worth mentioning as a conda-forge based distribution that comes with Mamba pre-installed. It's open-source focused, uses only conda-forge channel by default, and provides the best of both worlds: minimal installation with fast dependency resolution.Miniforge is ideal if you:Prefer open-source packages exclusivelyWant Mamba included from the startNeed a middle ground between Anaconda and MinicondaThe choice between Anaconda, Miniconda, and Mamba depends on your specific needs:: Best for beginners and quick starts with comprehensive pre-installed tools: Ideal for production, containers, and custom environments: Essential for performance-critical workflows with complex dependenciesModern conda (23.10.0+) includes Mamba's performance improvements by default, so you get the best of both worlds. For most users, Miniconda with modern conda provides the optimal balance of flexibility, performance, and control.Remember that these tools complement rather than replace each other. You might use Anaconda for initial exploration, Miniconda for production, and Mamba for environments requiring frequent updates.

Then, you leave ChatGPT, open a travel website, and start your search from scratch.The conversation helped you think, but it didn’t actually  anything…Now imagine you say, “Find me a flight to Tokyo under $500,” and an interactive widget appears inside the chat. You browse options, compare prices, select your seat, and book, all without leaving the conversation.Instead of responding with text and sending you elsewhere, ChatGPT can now surface interactive widgets from third-party apps directly in your conversation. OpenAI opened the app store for submissions on 17 December 2025, and with 800 million weekly active users, this may be the next great distribution wave for developers.But how does it actually work?How does a message like “find me a hotel” turn into an interactive booking widget?In this newsletter, I’ll break down the architecture behind ChatGPT Apps, walk through how tool calls and widgets work together, and cover everything you need to know to build your own.We’ll follow one example throughout: building a restaurant finder. is the first autonomous software development platform with infinite code context, enabling Fortune 500 companies to ship 5x faster.Large enterprises are adopting Blitzy at the beginning of every sprint. While individual developer tools like co-pilots struggle with context and only autocomplete code, Blitzy is engineered specifically for enterprise-scale codebases: clearing years of tech debt and executing large-scale refactors or new feature additions in weeks, not quarters.- Ingest millions of lines of code, mapping every line-level dependency.- 3,000+ cooperative agents autonomously plan, build, and validate production-ready code using spec and test-driven development at the speed of compute. - Over 80% of the work delivered autonomously, 500% faster.The future of autonomous software development is here:He’s the founder of , an enterprise prototyping and observability platform for ChatGPT Apps. He’s also a popular Maven instructor and former healthtech product manager.How Is This Different From Plugins?If you’ve been following OpenAI for a while, you might think, “Wait, didn’t they already try this with Plugins?”ChatGPT Plugins (launched March 2023, deprecated April 2024) were essentially API wrappers. You’d describe your API endpoints, and ChatGPT would call them and return text. The problem was that everything came back as text that ChatGPT had to interpret and re-present to the user. There was no native UI, no interactivity, and no way to create rich experiences.They allow users to upload content and shape their conversations, but are difficult to share broadly and don’t give brands control over how they’ll appear in chats.ChatGPT Apps take a fundamentally different approach.Instead of just calling APIs and returning text, Apps can render full interactive widgets directly in the conversation. You can show a map, display a booking form, or let users interact with a spreadsheet.Here’s how the three approaches compare:The key insight is that Apps aren’t just “GPTs with UI”; they’re a different architecture entirely.The widget runs in a sandboxed iframe with its own state, its own event handling, and direct communication with your backend. ChatGPT orchestrates when to show your app, but once it’s rendered, users interact with your UI directly.Here’s the simplest way to think about it: a chatbot talks, but an app does.Ask ChatGPT to book a restaurant, and normally, it explains how. It lists options, gives links, and tells you what to search for. Helpful, but nothing actually changes in the world.Now ask ChatGPT with a restaurant app installed, and something different happens.An interactive widget appears right in the chat. You can see real availability, browse the menu, pick a time, and confirm your reservation. When you’re done, you have an actual booking, not just information about how to make one.Here’s exactly what that would look like:The launch partners tell you a lot about where OpenAI sees this going: Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow.Users install apps through: Settings > Apps & Connectors.Once installed, ChatGPT can automatically surface your app based on conversation context, or users can tag it manually.Before we get into the technical details, it’s worth thinking about what kinds of apps work well in this model.ChatGPT apps should be quick and conversational. The goal is not to export your entire web app to ChatGPT. OpenAI says that apps should show, do, or know something that ChatGPT doesn’t. For example, ChatGPT can’t deliver groceries to your house, but the Instacart app with ChatGPT can.Now let’s look at how this all works under the hood.Every ChatGPT App is built from three parts that work together:The first is the, which is your backend. It tells ChatGPT what your app can do by defining “tools” (functions the model can call) and “resources” (UI templates to render).MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, an open standard that Anthropic created and OpenAI has now adopted.The second component is the, which is your frontend. It’s HTML that runs on ChatGPT in a sandboxed iframe.The third is , which acts as the host. It decides when to call your tools, renders your widgets, and manages the conversation state.Let’s look at each component in detail:The MCP Server is your backend—it’s where you define what your app can actually do.It exposes two main things to ChatGPT: tools and resources. are actions that ChatGPT can call.Each tool has a name (like ), a description that helps ChatGPT decide when to use it, an input schema defining which parameters are required, and an output template specifying which UI resource to render the results in. are UI templates that ChatGPT renders when tools return data.They’re served as HTML bundles (typically React apps compiled to a single file) and rendered inside a sandboxed iframe.Here’s what a tool definition might look like for our restaurant finder:Tool: search_restaurants

Description: “Find restaurants by location and cuisine type”

Inputs: location (required), cuisine (optional), price_range (optional)

Output: → ui://widget/restaurant-list.htmlThe description is especially important.ChatGPT uses it to decide whether your tool is relevant to the user’s request. If your description is vague—like “do restaurant stuff”—ChatGPT won’t know when to invoke it. Be specific about what the tool does and when it should be used.Let’s trace what happens when you tell ChatGPT, “Find me Italian restaurants in Brooklyn”.Understanding this flow is key to building apps that work well.First, ChatGPT checks the available tools from all installed apps.It sees your  tool with the description “Search for restaurants by location and cuisine type”. Based on the user’s message, it decides this tool is relevant.Next, ChatGPT constructs a tool call:{

  “name”: “search_restaurants”,

  “parameters”: {

    “location”: “Brooklyn”,
    “cuisine”: “Italian”

  }

}Your MCP server receives this request, validates the parameters, queries your database (or an external API such as Yelp), and returns the results.This includes a reference to your UI template if you have one.return {

  content: [

    { type: “text”, text: “Found 12 Italian restaurants in Brooklyn” }

  ],

  structuredContent: {

    restaurants: results

  },

  _meta: {

    “openai/outputTemplate”: “ui://widget/restaurant-list.html”

  }

};The  field is for ChatGPT. It’s a text summary, so the model knows what happened and can respond intelligently.The  field is for your widget, containing the raw data your UI will display.And the  in  tells ChatGPT to fetch and render your widget HTML.Finally, ChatGPT fetches your HTML bundle, renders it in a sandboxed iframe, and injects your  via a JavaScript bridge. The user sees an interactive list of restaurants right in their chat.The Widget is your frontend widget.When your widget loads, ChatGPT injects an  object that gives you access to data and methods for interacting with the system.Here’s what you can do with : — The data returned from your tool call — The parameters that were passed to your tool — Any persisted UI state — Whether the user is in light or dark mode — The user’s locale (e.g., “en-US”) — Call another MCP tool directly — Persist UI state — Send a message back to ChatGPT — Switch between inline, full screen, or picture-in-picture — Open an external URLThis is what makes Apps fundamentally different from Plugins.Your widget can trigger new tool calls, save state, and continue the conversation. Users interact directly with your UI, not through ChatGPT’s text interface. When they click on a restaurant to see more details, you have two options for handling that interaction.The first option is a .Your widget can call tools directly using , which bypasses the model entirely. Your widget requests restaurant details, your server returns the data, and the widget updates immediately. This is fast and efficient for straightforward data fetching.The second option is a .Your widget can send a follow-up window.openai.sendFollowUpMessage(), which puts the model back in the loop. ChatGPT sees the message, decides what to do next, and might call additional tools or ask clarifying questions.// Direct tool call (model not involved)

const details = await window.openai.callTool(

  ‘get_restaurant_details’,
  { id: restaurant.id }

);


// Follow-up message (model decides next step)

await window.openai.sendFollowUpMessage({

  prompt: `I want to book ${restaurant.name} for 4 people`

});This creates a continuous loop that makes the whole experience feel seamless:The user speaks, ChatGPT calls a tool, the widget renders, the user interacts with the widget, the widget either calls another tool or sends a message, and the cycle continues.Widgets can appear in three different formats depending on what makes sense for your app. widgets embed directly in the conversation flow. This is the default for all apps, and it works well for things like listings, search results, or quick selections. mode takes over the entire viewport. This is better for maps, dashboards, or complex workflows where users need more space to work. mode floats the widget while the user continues chatting. This is great for music players, timers, or other persistent tools that the user might want to keep visible while doing other things.window.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: “fullscreen” });

window.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: “pip” });One constraint to keep in mind: you can only show one widget per message.If someone asks ChatGPT to “book a restaurant and order an Uber,” it will show one app at a time. Users work through these requests sequentially.Now that we understand how the pieces fit together, let’s talk about security.With four parties involved (ChatGPT, your MCP server, your widget, and external APIs), it’s important to understand where the trust boundaries lie.ChatGPT calls your MCP server over HTTPS. Your server should validate that requests are actually coming from ChatGPT. ChatGPT trusts your server to return valid tool responses and UI resources.The widget runs in a heavily sandboxed iframe. ChatGPT injects the  bridge, but the widget cannot access ChatGPT’s DOM, cookies, or any data from other apps. This is the strictest boundary.Your widget can only make network requests to domains you’ve explicitly declared in your Content Security Policy () configuration. All other requests are blocked.Each app’s widget runs in its own isolated sandbox. Apps cannot access each other’s data, state, or DOM. Even if a malicious app tried to extract data from another app, the browser’s same-origin policy prevents it.Your widget runs under strict restrictions. It cannot:Access cookies (it’s on a sandbox origin, not your domain)Use localStorage or sessionStorageAccess the parent DOM (ChatGPT’s interface)Submit forms directly (use  instead)Open popups (use  instead)Make network requests except for declared CSP domainsExecute JavaScript normallyFetch from CSP-allowed domainsCommunicate through the  bridgeStore UI state via You declare your allowed connections in your tool’s :_meta: {

  “openai/widgetCSP”: {

    “connect_domains”: [”api.yourservice.com”],
    “resource_domains”: [”cdn.yourservice.com”],
    “frame_domains”: []  // Nested iframes trigger stricter review

  }

}The key principle: external API calls should go through your MCP server, not the widget.Let your widget handle the UI and let your server handle the business logic and sensitive operations.With the security model in mind, let’s look at how authentication works:There are two separate concerns: authenticating that requests to your MCP server are coming from ChatGPT, and authenticating users to your service.For authenticating users to your service (so they can access their own data), ChatGPT acts as an OAuth 2.1 client while your MCP server acts as the resource server.PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration are requiredChatGPT registers with your identity provider at runtime, generating a unique  for each connection.Discovery endpoints are also required.Your MCP server needs to expose /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource (RFC 9728), and your IdP needs to expose either /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server (RFC 8414) or /.well-known/openid-configuration.One important security detail: your widget never sees tokens directly.All authentication flows go through the ChatGPT host, which keeps credentials out of the browser sandbox. Your MCP server validates tokens on every incoming request: fetch JWKS signing keys, verify the signature and issuer, check expiry and audience claims, and validate scopes.If validation fails, return a 401 with a  header.User sessions are scoped to the conversation.If a user authenticates with your app in one conversation, they’ll need to re-authenticate in a new conversation. This is by design as it prevents credentials from leaking across contexts and gives users clear control over when they’re authenticated.State in ChatGPT Apps exists in three tiers, each with different owners, lifetimes, and purposes. Understanding which tier to use for what is important for building apps that feel reliable. is stored using  and is scoped to a specific message and widget pair. Use it for UI preferences, such as which tab is selected or how results are sorted.One important detail: this state is visible to the model, so keep it under 4k tokens and never store sensitive data here.// Good: minimal UI state for preferences

await window.openai.setWidgetState({

  selectedTab: “reviews”,
  sortOrder: “rating”

});


// Bad: don’t store sensitive or large data here

await window.openai.setWidgetState({

  userEmail: “...”,      // Never store credentials
  allResults: [...]      // Too large

}); is maintained by ChatGPT.The model remembers what’s happened in the conversation and uses that context when deciding what to do next. You don’t control this directly, but you influence it through the content field in your tool responses. is anything you persist in your own database.This is the only state that survives across conversations, devices, and time. If something matters long term, like a user’s saved preferences, booking history, or account data, store it in your backend.If the user refreshes the page, the widget state persists (it’s stored by ChatGPT, not in browser storage). If the user switches devices mid-conversation, widget state is lost, but the conversation context remains.If the user starts a new conversation, everything resets except the backend state.Once you’ve built your app, you need to actually run it.This section covers everything from error handling to deployment:Things will go wrong. Networks fail, APIs time out, servers crash.The good news is that errors cascade through the system in predictable ways, and ChatGPT has built-in fallbacks for most failure modes.If your MCP server is unreachable,ChatGPT falls back to text and continues the conversation without your app.The user might see something like “I wasn’t able to connect to the restaurant app, but I can help you find Italian restaurants in Brooklyn another way. Similarly, if your tool returns an error, ChatGPT explains what went wrong in natural language. Return clear error messages in your content field so ChatGPT can communicate the issue to users.If an external API fails while your tool is running, try to return partial results or a useful error state rather than failing completely.If you found 8 restaurants but couldn’t get ratings for 3 of them, return the 8 restaurants with partial data. Users generally prefer some information over none.One important detail: ChatGPT may automatically retry failed tool calls, so make sure your handlers are . If a user clicks “book this restaurant” and the network hiccups, you don’t want to create two bookings when the retry succeeds.If you’re concerned about overwhelming requests, there are three layers of rate limiting to think about:First is ChatGPT’s loop detection, which prevents runaway tool calls.If your app gets stuck calling the same tool repeatedly, ChatGPT will eventually stop. But this is a backstop, not a strategy. This means your server needs its own rate limiting. Implement per-user limits on tool calls and track costs for external API usage. If your app calls the Google Maps API on every tool invocation, and a user asks a vague question that triggers dozens of calls, you’ll see that in your bill.You should also validate inputs and set limits on expensive operations.Consider what happens if someone asks ChatGPT to “find every restaurant in New York.” That’s potentially millions of results. Your tool should have sensible defaults (e.g., return 20 results, not 20,000) and reject queries that would be prohibitively expensive.A good pattern is to return early with a clarifying question: “I found over 10,000 Italian restaurants in New York. Can you narrow down the search to a specific neighborhood?”Finally, we have privacy. Building apps that handle user data comes with responsibilities, and OpenAI’s guidelines are specific about what you can and cannot do.First, you should collect only the minimum data needed to perform your tool’s function.Your input schema should be narrowly scoped and clearly linked to the task (no “just in case” fields or broad profile data). The same applies to responses: return only what’s directly relevant to the user’s request. Don’t include diagnostic info, telemetry, session IDs, or logging metadata unless strictly necessary.Some data types are off-limits entirely.You cannot collect, solicit, or process:Payment card information (PCI DSS data)Protected health information (PHI)Government identifiers (social security numbers, etc.)Access credentials (API keys, passwords, MFA codes)For sensitive data categories (as defined by local regulations), you can only collect if it’s strictly necessary, the user has given adequate consent, and you’ve clearly disclosed the collection.Any tool that posts messages, sends emails, uploads files, or otherwise moves data outside the current boundary must be marked as a write action. This surfaces it to ChatGPT so users can confirm before execution. Misrepresenting a write action as read-only is a common rejection reason.If you’re building an app that might have users in regions with strong privacy regulations, you’re responsible for compliance.Your OAuth consent screen should clearly explain what data your app accesses. Users should be able to request copies of their data and request deletion. Remember that ChatGPT Apps involve data flowing through multiple parties (user → ChatGPT → your MCP server → external APIs), so your privacy policy should explain this chain clearly.Ready to build something?There are a couple of good paths depending on how much control you want: (chippy.build) is an AI agent trained on the Apps SDK (and built by me!). It can create MCP servers and widgets for you, includes built-in testing, and lets you connect to ChatGPT without dealing with deployment setup. This is probably the fastest way to get something running. gives you more control. Import the official examples from https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples, then configure: bundle your React widgets with Vite (set  to your Replit domain), serve  with CORS on port 80, run your MCP server on port 8000 bound to , and allow all hosts.Of course, you can also clone the official examples locally, set up an ngrok tunnel to your MCP endpoint, and connect directly.In any case, you’ll need to enable Developer Mode in ChatGPT settings to connect. Once enabled, go to Settings > Apps & Connectors > New App, enter your MCP URL, and test by mentioning your app by name in a new conversation.Here’s the mental model of how everything fits together:Your MCP server defines what your app can do through tools and resources. Your widget handles how it looks and how users interact with it. ChatGPT orchestrates the whole thing—deciding when to invoke your tools and rendering your widgets in the conversation.The communication loop is what makes it feel seamless: user speaks → ChatGPT calls tool → widget renders → user interacts → cycle continues.Security is enforced through sandboxing. Your widget can’t access cookies, storage, or arbitrary network requests. Everything flows through declared CSP domains or the  bridge.State exists at three levels: widget state is per-message, conversation context is per-session, and backend state is persistent in your database.Errors cascade predictably. ChatGPT falls back to text and explains what went wrong in natural language.With 800 million weekly active users and the app directory just launched, this is the moment to start building.

Tachyon,
the new “high-frequency statistical sampling profiler” coming in
Python 3.15, to see if we can
speed up the Pillow imaging library. I started with a simple script to open an image:Which generates this flame graph:The whole thing took 40 milliseconds, with half in ’s . If you visit
the interactive HTML page we can see  calls
, which in turn imports , , 
and  (hover over the  boxes to see them).Do we really need to import all those plugins when we’re only interested in PNG?Okay, let’s try another kind of image:Hmm, 60 milliseconds with 80% in  and most of that in . The
HTML page shows it imports , ,
, ,  and . We also
have  importing ,  and .Again, why import  plugins when we only care about WebP?Loading all the plugins? That’s enough profiling, let’s look at the code.When
ing
or
ing
an image, if Pillow isn’t yet initialised, we call a

function. This loads five drivers for five formats by importing their plugins: BMP, GIF,
JPEG, PPM and PNG.During import, each plugin
registers
its file extensions, MIME types and some methods used for opening and saving.Then we check each of these plugins in turn to see if one will accept the image. Most of
Pillow’s plugins detect an image by opening the file and checking if the first few bytes
match a magic prefix. For example:GIF
starts with  or .JPEG
starts with , where  means “Start of Image”, and  is
the start of the next marker
(reference).If none of these five match, we call
,
which imports the remaining 42 plugins. We then check each of these for a match.This has been the case since at least
PIL 1.1.1
released in 2000 (this is the oldest version I have to check). There were 33 builtin
plugins then and 47 now.This is all a bit wasteful if we only need one or two image formats during a program’s
lifetime, especially for things like CLIs. Longer running programs may need a few more,
but unlikely all 47.A benefit of the plugin system is third parties can
create their own plugins,
but we can be more efficient with our builtins.I opened a PR to add a mapping of
file extensions to plugins. Before calling  or , we can instead do a
cheap lookup, which may save us importing, registering, and checking all those plugins.Of course, we may have an image without an extension, or with the “wrong” extension, but
that’s fine; I expect it’s rare and anyway we’ll fall back to the original 
->  flow.After merging the PR, here’s a new flame graph for opening PNG
(HTML page):The flame graphs are scaled to the same width, but there’s far fewer boxes meaning
there’s much less work now. We’re down from 40 and 60 milliseconds to 20 and 20
milliseconds.The PR has a bunch of benchmarks which show opening a PNG (that previously loaded five
plugins) is now 2.6 times faster. Opening a WebP (that previously loaded all 47
plugins), is now 14 times faster. Similarly, Saving PNG is improved by 2.2 times and
WebP by 7.9 times. Success! This will be in Pillow 12.2.0.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EuroPython: Humans of EuroPython: Rodrigo Girão Serrão</title><link>https://blog.europython.eu/humans-of-ep-rodrigo/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:07:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[EuroPython depends entirely on the dedication of volunteers who invest tremendous effort into bringing it to life.

Over the years, my involvement with EuroPython as a volunteer and organiser has been increasing exponentially!EP: Are there any new skills you learned while volunteering at EuroPython? If so, which ones?Volunteering definitely pushed me to develop many skills. As an example, hosting the sprints developed my social skills since I had to welcome all the participants and ensure they had everything they needed. It also improved my management skills, from supporting the project sprint organisers to coordinating with venue staff.EP: Did you have any unexpected or funny experiences during EuroPython?In a recent EuroPython someone came up to me after my tutorial and said something like “I doubted your tutorial was going to be good, but in the end it was good”. Why on Earth would that person doubt me in the first place and then come to me and admit it? 🤣EP: Did you make any lasting friendships or professional connections through volunteering?Yes to both! Many of these relationships grew over time through repeated interactions across multiple EuroPython editions and also other conferences. Volunteering created a sense of continuity and made it much easier to connect with the same people year after year.EP: If you were to invite someone else, what do you think are the top 3 reasons to join the EuroPython organizing team?Nothing beats the smiles and thank you’s you get when the conference is over.

You define them, pass arguments, get results. Then one day you encounter  and , and suddenly function calls look confusing and unpredictable.This article is designed as one complete learning source. We will start from absolute basics and slowly move toward advanced, production‑ready patterns used in real Python libraries.By the end of this post, a beginner will understand not just  and  are, but  they exist and  professionals design APIs using them.We will build everything step by step using one evolving example:  🥪A function is a reusable block of code that:accepts input (arguments)optionally returns output
 →  (defined in function) →  (passed during call)This distinction matters once arguments become flexible.
  
  
  2. Positional Arguments (Order Matters)
Python assigns values :If you swap them, Python won’t complain — but your logic will break.
  
  
  3. Keyword Arguments (Name Matters)

  
  
  Critical Rule (Very Important)
Python always assigns positional arguments first, from left to right, before it processes keyword arguments.This single rule explains most  confusion.
  
  
  4. Why Fixed Arguments Don’t Scale
Imagine a real sandwich order:You  keep adding parameters forever:This becomes unreadable and fragile.Python solves this with .
  
  
  5.  — Variable Positional Arguments
 collects extra positional arguments into a .Number of values is unknown
  
  
  6.  — Variable Keyword Arguments
 collects  into a .
  
  
  7. Using  and  Together
Correct order  be followed:
  
  
  8. Why  Became Positional (Common Confusion)
Python assigns positional arguments .Now  already has a value ().TypeError: got multiple values for argument 'bread'
Nothing is converted. Position alone decides binding.
  
  
  9. Defensive 
  
  
  10. Production‑Ready Version (Recommended)

  
  
  Why This Is Production‑Ready
Keyword‑only arguments ()No hidden positional traps
  
  
  11. Real‑World Usage from Popular Libraries
 → message formattingFlexible APIs powered by .Keyword arguments allow backward compatibility and clean defaults.
  
  
  12. Mental Model That Sticks
 → extra Positional arguments Keywords cannot override positionshow Python binds argumentswhen to use  vs You are no longer a beginner.You are designing flexible, professional Python APIs — exactly how real libraries do it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Project: Monetizing TikTok Content with Lightweight ML (Learning in Public)</title><link>https://dev.to/jrsteve_eth/project-moniteze-tiktok-ml-4pga</link><author>JR.

  What Makes a Meme Go Viral?
Before writing code, let’s define virality in measurable terms: – how fast mentions increase – total number of mentions – likes, shares, comments – appears on multiple networks – remixes, captions, variationsThe Penguin meme exploded because it hit  within hours.┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
│ Social APIs │──▶│ Trend Engine│──▶│ Action Layer │
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └──────────────┘

You can see the repo here: cdk-go-simple-restapi. This year, I want to take it a step further by using AWS CDK to create and manage an AWS EKS cluster.I’ll be writing a short series of posts around this topic, starting with the basics. In this first post we’ll focus on building a minimal EKS cluster using AWS CDK as the foundation for the next parts of the series.Amazon EKS already provides multiple ways to create and manage clusters, from the AWS Console to CloudFormation and Terraform. However, when infrastructure starts to grow in complexity, the way it’s defined and maintained becomes just as important as the resources themselves.CDK allows you to define infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Instead of managing large YAML or JSON templates, you work with code—loops, conditions, and abstractions included. This makes infrastructure easier to reason about, review, and evolve over time. According to the documentation, AWS CDK supports multiple languages such as Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C#For EKS specifically, the kit provides higher-level constructs that abstract away a lot of the boilerplate required to get a cluster running. Networking, IAM roles, and node groups can be defined in a few lines of code while still allowing you to customize the parts that matter.
  
  
  How AWS CDK Works with Amazon EKS
The diagram above shows us how CDK interacts with AWS services when creating an Amazon EKS cluster.Everything starts from your CDK application (stack), where infrastructure is defined using a programming language such as Go, TypeScript, or Python. At this stage, no AWS resources are created yet. When you run , AWS CDK translates your code into a standard AWS CloudFormation template.This CloudFormation template is then deployed using . At this point, AWS CloudFormation becomes responsible for provisioning the infrastructure. It creates all required AWS resources, including the VPC, IAM roles, the EKS control plane, and the managed node group. AWS CDK itself does not bypass CloudFormation, it simply acts as a higher-level abstraction on top of it.Once CloudFormation finishes, the Amazon EKS cluster is fully provisioned and exposes a Kubernetes control plane backed by AWS-managed infrastructure. From this point forward, the cluster behaves like a standard Kubernetes cluster.Optionally, the CDK can also interact with the Kubernetes API to manage workloads, such as applying Kubernetes manifests or deploying Helm charts. This step usually happens after the cluster is ready and is covered in later parts of this series.In this series, all AWS CDK examples will be written in Python.
While AWS CDK supports multiple languages such as TypeScript and Go, the underlying concepts and constructs remain the same regardless of the language used.AWS account and configured AWS CLIAn active AWS account with permissions to create EKS, VPC, IAM, and CloudFormation resources. Installed and configured with valid credentials ().Used for writing the AWS CDK application in this series.Installed globally via npm:Used to interact with the EKS cluster once it is created.This post focuses on creating the EKS cluster. No Kubernetes workloads are deployed yet.Make sure your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions before running cdk deploy, as EKS provisioning may take several minutes.We’ll start by creating a new AWS CDK project using Python. AWS CDK provides a project template that sets up the basic structure, dependencies, and configuration needed to get started.First, create a new directory and initialize a CDK app:cdk-eks
cdk-eks
cdk init app  python
This command generates a basic project structure for a Python-based CDK application. The output after you run Applying project template app python



This is a blank project CDK development with Python.

The cdk.json file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

Enjoy!

Executing Installing dependencies...
✅ All After initialization, you should see a structure similar to this:
├── app.py
├── cdk_eks
│   ├── cdk_eks_stack.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── cdk.json
├── README.md
├── requirements-dev.txt
├── requirements.txt
├── source.bat
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── unit
The entry point of the CDK application. This is where the stack is instantiated.Contains the definition of the CDK stack where we’ll define the EKS cluster.Python dependencies for the CDK app.CDK configuration file, including the command used to run the app.A placeholder for unit tests, which we’ll use in a later post.Before writing any code, activate the Python virtual environment and install the dependencies. BTW, you need add this one to your :  aws-cdk.lambda-layer-kubectl-v34. .venv/bin/activate
pip  requirements.txt
Keeping dependencies isolated using a virtual environment helps avoid version conflicts and keeps the project reproducible.If this is your first time using AWS CDK in the selected AWS account and region, you’ll need to bootstrap the environment:This command creates the necessary resources in your AWS account that CDK requires to deploy stacks.At this point, the project is ready, and we can start defining the EKS cluster using AWS CDK.In this section, we’ll define a minimal EKS cluster using AWS CDK. The goal is not to build a production-ready cluster yet, but to create a foundation that we can extend in later posts.All changes will be made inside the CDK stack file Import Required ModulesOpen  and start by importing the required CDK modules: for creating the EKS cluster and its node groupsEKS requires a VPC. For simplicity, we’ll let CDK create one for us:This creates a basic VPC across two Availability Zones, which is sufficient for a minimal cluster.Next, we define the EKS cluster itself:Kubernetes version is explicitly set to avoid unexpected upgrades. disables the default node group so we can define our own. Add a Managed Node GroupNow we add a managed node group to run workloads:A managed EC2-based node groupAutoscaling between 1 and 3 nodesInstance type for testingBy default, creating an EKS cluster with AWS CDK does not automatically grant Kubernetes access to the IAM identity used to deploy the stack. While the control plane and node group roles are configured, additional IAM-to-Kubernetes RBAC mapping is required to access the cluster using kubectl.At this point, our CDK stack defines:A managed node group for worker nodesAll of this is defined as code and will be provisioned via CloudFormation.Before deploying, it’s a good idea to check what CDK will generate:cdk synth 2>&1 |

This command outputs the CloudFormation template that will be used to create the EKS cluster.With the stack definition in place, we can now deploy the EKS cluster using AWS CDK. This step will trigger AWS CloudFormation to provision all required resources.Run the following command from the project root:During deployment, CDK will:Package and upload assets (if any)Create or update the CloudFormation stackProvision AWS resources such as the VPC, IAM roles, EKS control plane, and managed node groupYou’ll be prompted to confirm the deployment, as the stack creates IAM roles and other security-related resources. Review the changes and approve the deployment when prompted.After the deployment completes, the next step is to verify that the EKS cluster has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.At this point, you should see a CloudFormation stack created by AWS CDK in the AWS Console.
This stack represents all resources defined in the CDK application, including the VPC, IAM roles, EKS control plane, and the managed node group.The stack status should be , indicating that all resources were provisioned without errors. This also reinforces that AWS CDK relies on CloudFormation as the underlying provisioning engine.Next, navigate to the Amazon EKS console. You should see the newly created cluster listed and marked as Active. Accessing the Cluster with kubectlTo interact with the cluster, update your kubeconfig:aws eks update-kubeconfig  <cluster-name>  <region>
Once configured, verify that the nodes are registered:This command deletes the CloudFormation stack and all resources created by AWS CDK, including the EKS cluster, node groups, and networking components.
Since EKS is not covered by the AWS free tier, it’s recommended to clean up resources when they are no longer needed.At this point, we have a fully functional Amazon EKS cluster created and managed using AWS CDK. The cluster is accessible via kubectl, the node group is running, and IAM access has been configured correctly. This gives us a foundation, but so far, the cluster is still empty.In the next post, we’ll move beyond infrastructure and start running actual workloads on this cluster. Instead of applying raw Kubernetes YAML files manually, we’ll use AWS CDK to deploy workloads in a more structured and repeatable way.Aight, thanks for taking the time read this post.

import operator
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *

from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
from pathlib import Path
ttkbootstrap → modern dark themerandom + operator → puzzle mathreportlab → PDF generationCreating the Main App ClassWe wrap everything in a class called MazeMath.class MazeMath:
    APP_NAME = "MazeMath"
    APP_VERSION = "2.1"

    OPERATORS = {
        "+": operator.add,
        "-": operator.sub,
        "*": operator.mul,
        "/": operator.floordiv
    }
APP_NAME and APP_VERSION are just labelsOPERATORS maps math symbols to Python functionsInside , we set up the main window and variables:def __init__(self):
    self.root = tk.Tk()
    tb.Style(theme="darkly")

    self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
    self.root.geometry("1100x680")

    self.solution_path = []
    self.target_number = None

    self.rows = self.cols = 0

    self._build_ui()
Building the User InterfaceNow we create buttons, dropdowns, and panels:def _build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME,
             font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)

    def dfs(r, c):
        visited[r][c] = True

                dfs(nr, nc)

    dfs(0,0)
    return path
This gives us a guaranteed path from start to finish.Now we place numbers and operators along that path:def create_puzzle_data(self):
    diff = self.difficulty_var.get()

    if diff == "Easy":
        self.rows = self.cols = 3

For every next cell, we safely apply math:for r,c in path[1:]:
    op = random.choice(list(self.OPERATORS.keys()))
    num = random.randint(1,9)

    if op == "/" and current % num != 0:
        continue

    next_val = self.OPERATORS[op](current, num)
    steps.append(f"{current} {op} {num} = {next_val}")
    current = next_val
We draw labels for each cell:for r in range(self.rows):
    for c in range(self.cols):
        text = f"{op}{num}"
        bg = "#4caf50" if (r,c) in self.solution_path else "#222"

        tb.Label(self.grid_frame,
            text=text,
            background=bg).grid(row=r,column=c)
Green cells show the solution path.Showing Step-by-Step Solutions
def show_solution(self):
    self.solution_text.delete("1.0", tk.END)
    self.solution_text.insert(tk.END, "\n".join(steps))

5 + 3 = 8
...c = canvas.Canvas("puzzle.pdf", pagesize=A4)
c.drawString(50, 800, "MazeMath Puzzle")
Each puzzle becomes a printable worksheet.img = Image.new("RGB", (900, 800), (34,34,34))

You do not declare that a struct implements an interface (like  in Java). If your struct has a  method with the right signature, it  a Reader. This allows different packages to work together without knowing about each other.: Reads the  stream into memory at once. Easy, but dangerous for large data.Streaming (e.g., , , ): Processes data in small chunks as it arrives. This is memory-efficient and the preferred way to handle .

The bronze layer simply landed the raw CSV files. The silver layer standardized measurement names. The gold layer aggregated for analysis. Everything worked beautifully.This post demonstrates what happens when vendor CSV files exhibit the full spectrum of real-world data quality issues. We'll watch the bronze layer transform from "just land the data" into an increasingly complex series of transformations, vendor-specific logic, and fragile workarounds. By the end, we'll be asking uncomfortable questions about what "bronze" actually means.
  
  
  Problem 1: Different Column Names for the Same Measurements
Vendor A and Vendor B measure the same soil properties. Both provide pH, copper concentration, and zinc concentration. Their CSV files look like this:sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm
sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,acidity,cu_total,zn_total
Same measurements. Different names. Vendor B calls pH "acidity." They use chemical symbols with  suffixes instead of element names with  suffixes.This is not a data quality problem. This is a legitimate difference in how two professional laboratories name their measurements. (Although pedantically you might wonder about a chemistry lab that thinks pH and acidity are the same thing.) Both schemas are internally consistent and well-documented. The challenge is ours: we need both vendors' data in the same bronze table.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 1 (Add Vendor-Specific Column Mapping)
We create a standardization function for each vendor:The bronze ingestion now includes a vendor detection step:This works. We can now query both vendors' data using consistent column names. The bronze layer contains standardized schemas.But we just added vendor-specific business logic to what was supposed to be a raw data landing zone.
  
  
  Problem 2: Schema Instability Within the Same Vendor
The vendor-specific mapping holds up until Vendor A sends a new file. Our ingestion pipeline fails with a schema mismatch error. Examining the file reveals that Vendor A now includes additional analytes:Vendor A - Basic package (what we had):sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm
Vendor A - Metals package (what we just received):sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm,lead_ppm,iron_ppm,manganese_ppm
The schema changes based on which analysis package the customer ordered. Sometimes they order basic soil testing. Sometimes they add heavy metals analysis. The vendor includes only the columns relevant to what was tested.This is also not a data quality problem. Including only requested measurements is reasonable and reduces file size. But it breaks our bronze table schema.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 2 (Create Superset Schema)
The solution requires accommodating all possible variations. We create a superset schema containing all possible columns from all analysis packages. When ingesting files with fewer columns, we add NULL values for missing measurements:Now our bronze ingestion tracks package types:Our bronze table is sparse (most columns are NULL for most rows)We must maintain a master list of all possible columns for each vendorAdding new analytes requires code changesWe can't distinguish between "wasn't measured" and "measurement failed"The bronze layer is accumulating knowledge about vendor schemas and business rules.
  
  
  Problem 3: Typos in Column Headers
Our superset schema handles varying column sets, but the next issue reveals a different category of problem. A file from Vendor A fails to parse correctly. Examining the raw CSV, we find:sample_barcod,lab_id,date_recieved,date_proccessed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm
Three typos:  (missing 'e'),  (i before e),  (double c). The vendor's export system mangles column names. Occasionally.These files are otherwise valid. The data values are correct. Only the header row has issues. Rejecting these files would delay processing by days while we contact the vendor.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 3 (Add Fuzzy Column Matching)
Rejecting files creates unacceptable delays, so we implement fuzzy matching to handle common typos:Our bronze ingestion grows:This works. But we're now making quality decisions about what constitutes an acceptable typo. We're interpreting intent. The bronze layer is no longer just landing raw data.
  
  
  Problem 4: Excel Nightmares
Vendor B sends a file that completely breaks our parser. Opening it in a text editor reveals the structure:Contact:,lab@testing.com,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
Generated:,2024-10-15,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
Lab Name:,Premium Soil Testing,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
Sampl_Barcode,lab_id,DATE_RECEIVED,Date_Proccessed,acidity,cu_totl,ZN_TOTL,pb_total,fe_total,Mn_Totl,b_total,mo_totl,ec_ms_cm,Organic_Carbon_Pct,"","","","",""
PYB2475-266277,AT6480 68463,2024-05-12,2024-05-19,6.46,6.63,29.5,4.22,103.,3.56,0.759,0.186,1.44,0.30,"","","","",""
Three metadata rows precede the actual header. Additionally, the file has empty column name padding (those trailing empty strings). The file exhibits the telltale signs of an Excel export where someone navigated beyond the data range and accidentally pressed enter before saving.The actual data is fine. The measurements are valid. We just need to skip the metadata rows and ignore the empty columns.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 4 (Add Header Detection and Column Filtering)
We implement header detection to skip metadata:We filter out empty columns:And implement re-reading from the correct header position:The bronze ingestion continues to grow:The bronze layer now includes heuristics for detecting valid data. We're making educated guesses about file structure.
  
  
  Problem 5: Database-Hostile Column Names
Vendor B's files sometimes include special characters in column names:#sample_id,lab_id,organic_matter%,cu-total,zn-total
The  prefix,  suffix, and hyphens require backtick escaping in SQL queries:Every analyst who touches this data must remember the escaping rules. Queries become brittle and harder to read.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 5 (Add Character Sanitization)
We sanitize column names to be database-friendly:The complete bronze ingestion:Eight transformation steps. Vendor-specific logic branches. Fuzzy matching heuristics. Schema knowledge. Quality decisions.This was supposed to be "just land the raw data."
  
  
  The Uncomfortable Questions
We started with a simple bronze layer that read CSV files and wrote them to a table. We now have a complex ingestion pipeline that: Vendor-specific column mapping encodes knowledge about what measurements mean across different schemas Fuzzy matching determines which typos are acceptable and how to fix them Header detection guesses where real data begins Character sanitization changes the raw column names we receivedIs this still a "bronze layer"? The Medallion Architecture describes bronze as raw data with minimal transformation. We're well beyond minimal.What happens when Vendor C arrives? We add more column mappings to the function, another branch in the if/elif chain, and hope their quirks don't conflict with the assumptions we've baked into our existing logic. And how do we decide what the "default" name for the column should be?How do we test this? We need sample files for every vendor, every analysis package, every combination of issues. The test matrix grows exponentially.We haven't addressed date format differences, unit conversions, vendor-specific codes, or the dozens of other variations we'll encounter as more vendors join the system.The bronze layer has gotten away from us.
  
  
  How Would You Manage This Complexity?
Before we explore solutions in the next post, consider how you would handle this problem in your own systems:Would you continue adding transformation logic to the bronze layer until it handles every edge case?Would you reject files that don't conform to expected formats and force vendors to fix their exports?Would you build a configuration system where new vendor quirks can be added without code changes?Would you accept some data quality issues and handle them downstream in the silver layer?Each approach has tradeoffs. Adding more transformations makes the bronze layer complex and fragile. Rejecting files delays processing and frustrates vendors and users of the data alike. Configuration systems add their own complexity. Pushing problems downstream just moves the pain to a different layer.What if the fundamental problem is that we're treating column names as schema when they should be treated as data?In the next post, we'll explore this alternative. Instead of fighting schema chaos with increasingly complex transformations, we'll embrace it. We'll examine how a single transformation applied to all vendors can replace vendor-specific logic, superset schemas, fuzzy matching, and header detection with something simpler and more robust.The solution involves questioning what "raw" actually means.

Python has also introduced more intuitive methods in recent versions that make these tasks much simpler.In this guide, we’ll dive into every major technique for deleting characters in Python, covering both string and list operations with practical code examples and modern best practices.
  
  
  Basic Techniques for String Deletion
In Python, strings are , meaning you cannot modify the original string directly. Instead, these methods return a  string with the characters removed.
  
  
  1. : Delete All Occurrences
To remove a specific character or substring everywhere it appears, use the  method by replacing it with an empty string .You can also limit the number of deletions by providing a third argument:  will only remove the first two hyphens.
  
  
  2. : Remove Leading and Trailing Characters
To clean up unwanted characters (like spaces or newlines) only at the  or  of a string, use the  family of methods:: Removes from both ends.: Removes from the left (start) only.: Removes from the right (end) only.
By default, these remove whitespace, but you can specify a set of characters like .
  
  
  3.  and  (Python 3.9+)
Added in Python 3.9, these are the best practices for removing a specific word only if it appears at the very beginning or end of a string.Unlike , which treats the input as a set of individual characters to prune,  treats it as a single exact string, making it much safer for filenames and IDs.
  
  
  Advanced Pattern Deletion

  
  
  1. : Delete Multiple Different Characters at Once
If you need to delete a whole set of symbols (e.g., vowels or punctuation), chaining  multiple times is inefficient. Using  with  is much faster.
  
  
  2. : Regex-Based Deletion
For pattern-based deletion—like "remove all numbers" or "remove everything except letters"—the  (regular expression) module is your best friend.
  
  
  Deleting Specific Elements from a List
When dealing with a  of strings, the logic changes from "modifying a string" to "filtering a collection.": Deletes the first occurrence of a specific .: Deletes the element at a specific  and returns it.

  
  
  2. List Comprehension: Bulk Filtering
The most Pythonic way to remove all elements that meet a certain condition is to use a . Instead of "deleting," you "keep" the ones you want.The right way to "delete" in Python depends on the scope. For exact matches in strings,  or  are your best bets. For complex patterns, use . When cleaning up lists,  is almost always the most efficient and readable choice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💡 Discovery: docs(ralph): Auto-publish discovery blog post</title><link>https://dev.to/igorganapolsky/discovery-docsralph-auto-publish-discovery-blog-post-2e0k</link><author>Igor Ganapolsky</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:03:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to add autonomous AI coding to your project?

Product prices across thousands of stores.Real estate listings in every market. Job postings across industries. Public records from government agencies.For data analysts, this represents opportunity. Web scraping—extracting data programmatically from websites—opens doors that APIs and official datasets keep closed.But scraping walks a fine line. What's technically possible isn't always legal. What's legal isn't always ethical. Understanding these boundaries is essential before you write your first line of scraping code.
  
  
  Why Scrape When APIs Exist
A fair question. Why scrape when many platforms offer APIs? APIs provide what companies want to share. Scraping accesses what's publicly visible—often far more comprehensive. APIs frequently charge for access, especially at scale. Scraping public pages typically costs only computing resources. API terms change. Rate limits tighten. Access gets revoked. Scraped data from public pages can't be retroactively restricted in the same way. APIs return structured responses. Scraped data reflects what users actually see, including formatting, promotions, and dynamic content.That said, APIs are easier, more reliable, and less legally ambiguous when they meet your needs.Web scraping legality isn't black and white. It depends on what you're scraping, how, and why.Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). This US law prohibits "unauthorized access" to computer systems. The hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn case (2022) clarified that scraping publicly accessible data generally doesn't violate the CFAA. Most websites prohibit scraping in their terms. Violating terms isn't automatically illegal, but it can create civil liability. Scraped content may be copyrighted. Extracting facts is generally permissible; copying creative expression is not. GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws regulate personal data collection. Scraping personal information creates compliance obligations. This file indicates which parts of a site bots should avoid. It's not legally binding but ignoring it weakens legal defenses.This isn't legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific situations.Legal doesn't mean ethical. Even permitted scraping can be problematic. Aggressive scraping can overload servers, affecting real users. You're using someone else's infrastructure. Scraping a competitor's pricing to systematically undercut them raises ethical questions, even if technically legal. Just because someone posted information publicly doesn't mean they consented to bulk collection.Business model disruption. Some websites rely on advertising revenue from visitors. Scraping without visiting the page circumvents their revenue model.The ethical test: would the website operator consider your actions reasonable? If not, proceed with caution.The robots.txt file lives at a site's root (e.g., example.com/robots.txt) and specifies scraping rules.User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
Crawl-delay: 10

User-agent: BadBot
Disallow: /
This file asks all bots to avoid /private/, wait 10 seconds between requests, and blocks "BadBot" entirely.Respecting robots.txt is industry standard. Ignoring it signals bad faith and weakens legal defenses if disputes arise.
  
  
  Rate Limiting and Politeness
Hammering a server with requests is both rude and counterproductive. Servers detect aggressive bots and block them. Space requests seconds apart. Mimic human browsing patterns. If robots.txt specifies a delay, honor it. Don't parallelize requests to the same server aggressively.Scrape during off-peak hours. Early morning or late night typically has lighter server load.Python dominates web scraping. Here's your toolkit. For fetching page content. Simple, reliable, efficient. For parsing HTML and extracting data. Intuitive and forgiving of malformed HTML. For JavaScript-rendered content. Runs a real browser. Slower but handles dynamic content. Full framework for large-scale scraping. Handles concurrency, pipelines, and output formats. Modern alternative to Selenium. Faster, more reliable for dynamic content.Most scraping effort goes into parsing. HTML is messy, inconsistent, and designed for browsers, not data extraction. Look for consistent structures—classes, IDs, data attributes—that identify the data you need. Often cleaner than navigating the DOM manually. Pages vary. Code defensively. Browser developer tools show the actual HTML structure. Use them constantly.Modern websites load content with JavaScript. A simple HTTP request gets you an empty shell. Often, dynamic content comes from API calls you can access directly—cleaner than scraping.Use Selenium or Playwright. These run real browsers and execute JavaScript. Run browsers without visible UI for automation.
  
  
  Handling Anti-Scraping Measures
Websites actively resist scraping. Common measures and countermeasures: Websites block requests with obvious bot user-agents. After too many requests, your IP gets blocked. Rotating proxies can help—but this enters ethically gray territory. Designed to distinguish humans from bots. CAPTCHA solving services exist but are expensive and ethically questionable. Hidden links that only bots follow. Following them flags you as a scraper.Aggressive anti-circumvention measures may cross ethical and legal lines. Consider whether the site is clearly saying "no."
  
  
  Data Storage and Processing
Scraped data needs somewhere to go. Easy to produce, universally readable. Preserves nested data better than CSV. SQLite for local work, PostgreSQL for larger projects. Stripping whitespace, normalizing formats, and validating data during scraping saves pain later.Production scrapers need error handling and recovery. Networks fail. Set reasonable timeouts and retry. When something breaks at 3 AM, logs are essential. Keep the original pages. Re-parsing is easier than re-scraping. For large jobs, save progress incrementally. Crashes shouldn't mean starting over.Let's scrape a book catalog (using a site designed for practice).Simple, effective, and polite.
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions

Generally yes for publicly accessible data, but it depends on jurisdiction, terms of service, data type, and purpose. When in doubt, consult a lawyer.Can I scrape any website?
Technically yes, but not all scraping is legal or ethical. Check terms of service, robots.txt, and consider whether you're causing harm.How do I avoid getting blocked?
Use delays between requests, rotate user-agents, respect robots.txt, and don't scrape faster than a human could browse.Should I use an API instead of scraping?
If an API meets your needs, yes. APIs are more reliable, explicitly permitted, and easier to work with.What about scraping social media?
Social media platforms have strict terms and aggressive anti-scraping measures. Scraping them carries higher legal risk.Is it okay to scrape personal information?
Be very careful. Data protection laws like GDPR apply. Even public personal data may require consent for collection.What tools should I start with?
Requests and BeautifulSoup for static pages. Add Selenium when you need JavaScript rendering.How do I handle pagination?
Identify the URL pattern for pages and loop through them. Or find and follow "Next" links programmatically.
Possibly, but this amplifies legal concerns. Commercialization changes risk calculations.What if the site changes its structure?
Your scraper breaks. This is normal. Monitor for failures and update selectors when layouts change.Web scraping is a powerful tool for data analysts. It opens access to data that would otherwise be inaccessible or prohibitively expensive.But power comes with responsibility. Scrape legally. Scrape ethically. Respect the websites and people behind them.When done right, scraping extends your analytical capabilities far beyond the limits of official data sources.This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🎬 行為辨識</title><link>https://dev.to/stklen/xing-wei-bian-shi-34dj</link><author>TK Lin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI 能辨識這是 Jelly 還是 Ariel 後，下一步是什麼？：讓 AI 不只認出動物，還能理解牠們在做什麼。：簡單、快速：無法判斷連續動作（如「正在走」vs「停下來」）輸入影片 → 行為辨識 → 自動加標籤

  🧠 What Is a Mixin? (Conceptual View)
Encapsulates Is not meant to be instantiated directlyIs combined with other classes using ❌ : “This class  User”✅ : “This class  /  / ”
  
  
  ⚖️ Mixins vs Inheritance vs Composition
✅ : Mixins add , not .Let’s start with a minimal Python example.✔ No 
✔ No assumptions about where it will be used[LOG] Creating user: alice
🧩 The mixin cleanly injects logging behavior without complicating the class.
  
  
  ✅ Python Mixin Best Practices
Keep mixins Avoid state () when possibleAvoid  unless you fully understand MRODjango heavily uses mixins in .Instead of one massive view class, Django splits behavior into:Each responsibility lives in a mixin.
  
  
  🛠️ User-Defined Django Mixin

  🧪 Real-World Production Example: Audit Mixins in Django & DRF
This section demonstrates a real, production-grade use case for mixins that is commonly required in professional Django projects.In most real-world applications, we need to:Track  a record was created or updatedTrack  created or updated the recordApply this logic consistently across many models and APIsAvoid copy-pasting the same logic everywhereDoing this manually in every model or API view quickly becomes error-prone and difficult to maintain.We solve this using mixins at multiple layers: → reusable across Django apps → reusable across API viewsetsWidely used in production systems
  
  
  1️⃣ Model-Level Mixins (Reusable & Abstract)

  
  
  Why this is production-ready
 → no extra database tablesFully reusable across multiple appsKeeps audit logic centralizedNo business logic inside models
  
  
  2️⃣ Using the Model Mixins

from tkinter import messagebox, filedialog
import random
import operator
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *

from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
from pathlib import Path
random + operator → puzzle logicttkbootstrap → modern stylingreportlab → PDF generation✅ Step 3 — Create the App ClassWe wrap everything inside a class:class NumMaze:
    APP_NAME = "NumMaze"
    APP_VERSION = "2.2.0"
    OPERATORS = {
        "+": operator.add,
        "-": operator.sub,
        "*": operator.mul,
        "/": operator.floordiv
    }

This lets us dynamically apply math later.✅ Step 4 — Initialize the Window    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        tb.Style(theme="darkly")

        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.geometry("1250x700")
We also define app state:        self.difficulty_var = tk.StringVar(value="Easy")
        self.num_puzzles_var = tk.IntVar(value=1)

        self.grid_numbers = []
        self.target_number = None
        self.solution_steps = []

        self.rows = self.cols = 0
✅ Step 5 — Build the User Interface    def _build_ui(self):
        tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME,
                 font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)
        tb.Label(
            self.root,
            text="Auto-Generated Arithmetic Puzzle",
            font=("Segoe UI", 10, "italic")
        ).pack()
        opts = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Options", padding=10)
        opts.pack(fill="x", padx=10)

        tb.Label(opts, text="Difficulty:").pack(side="left")
        tb.Combobox(
            opts,
            values=["Easy","Medium","Hard"],
            textvariable=self.difficulty_var,
            width=10
        ).pack(side="left", padx=5)
        tb.Label(opts, text="Number of Puzzles:").pack(side="left", padx=10)
        tb.Spinbox(opts, from_=1, to=20,
                   textvariable=self.num_puzzles_var,
                   width=5).pack(side="left")
✅ Step 6 — Control Buttons        ctrl = tb.Frame(self.root)
        ctrl.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=10)

        tb.Button(ctrl, text="Generate Puzzle",
                  bootstyle="success",
                  command=self.generate_single_puzzle).pack(side="left")
You can add export buttons the same way:        tb.Button(ctrl, text="Combined PDF",
                  bootstyle="warning",
                  command=self.generate_multiple_combined_pdf).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Each button simply calls a method.✅ Step 7 — Grid + Solution Panels        self.grid_frame = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Puzzle Grid", padding=10)
        self.grid_frame.pack(fill="x", padx=10)
        sol = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Solution", padding=10)
        sol.pack(fill="both", expand=True, padx=10)

        self.solution_text = tk.Text(sol, height=10, font=("Consolas", 12))
        self.solution_text.pack(fill="both", expand=True)
✅ Step 8 — Generate Puzzle DataDifficulty controls how many numbers:    def create_puzzle_data(self):
        d = self.difficulty_var.get()

        if d == "Easy":
            n, rows, cols = 4, 2, 2
        elif d == "Medium":
            n, rows, cols = 6, 2, 3
        else:
            n, rows, cols = 9, 3, 3
        numbers = [random.randint(1,15) for _ in range(n)]
        expr, target, steps = self.recursive_solution(numbers)
        return numbers, target, steps, rows, cols
✅ Step 9 — Recursive SolverThis repeatedly tries random combinations:    def recursive_solution(self, numbers):
        for _ in range(5000):
            nums = numbers[:]
            random.shuffle(nums)
            expr, val, steps = self.build_expr(nums)
            if val is not None and val > 0:
                return expr, val, steps

        return str(numbers[0]), numbers[0], []
    def build_expr(self, nums):
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return str(nums[0]), nums[0], []
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            left = nums[:i]
            right = nums[i:]
            for op in self.OPERATORS:
                try:
                    val = self.OPERATORS[op](left_val, right_val)
                    steps = left_steps + right_steps + [
                        f"{left_val} {op} {right_val} = {val}"
                    ]
                    return expr, val, steps
                except:
                    continue
This is the core logic engine.    def display_grid(self):
        for w in self.grid_frame.winfo_children():
            w.destroy()
Create labels for each number:        for r in range(self.rows):
            for c in range(self.cols):
                tb.Label(self.grid_frame,
                         text=str(self.grid_numbers[idx]),
                         font=("Segoe UI",20,"bold")).grid(row=r,column=c)
        tb.Label(self.grid_frame,
                 text=f"Target: {self.target_number}",
                 font=("Segoe UI",16,"bold")).grid(row=self.rows,columnspan=self.cols)
✅ Step 11 — Show Solution    def show_solution(self):
        self.solution_text.delete("1.0", tk.END)
        self.solution_text.insert(tk.END, "\n".join(self.solution_steps))

CsvPath Framework, by contrast, is a data-file feeds management infrastructure that covers data validation as just one aspect of the full data preboarding lifecycle. Moreover, CsvPath Framework does not deal with relational databases (other than as an option for storing its own metadata). Validatar et. al., are first and foremost relational database quality management tools, and only secondarily deal with data files. So it's a mismatch, to some degree, but useful and entertaining nonetheless.Here's the problem description at the top of the Validatar example: This Standard Test is designed to demonstrate the concept of how to create a uniqueness template test for all CSV files in multiple folders.
The Standard Test here compares the Row Count per  value in the  to make sure all 's only have 1 row. The test only keeps failures and stops after 100 failure records.Spoiler alert: in FlightPath this is a trivial example (as I  it is  to be)Validatar starts by having you create a test template. Before you can do that, though, you need a project. Here are the instructions for that step: Make sure your Data Source is Mapped correctlyThe first bullet sounds simple. I'm not sure what the second bullet means because I'm not a Validatar expert and that one isn't explained on that page.Moving on, let's create that template. Most of this exercise is forms based. The setup is shown in the image below. Their ask is that you notice:Note that the column specified to group by is account_idNote that it is comparing the ROW_COUNT to a fixed value of 1Note that the Result Configuration is set so that only Failures are kept and to abort after 100 failures are foundGood requirements for us to use on the CsvPath side. At this point we have our test. Now we need to create a template from it so that we can apply it to each CSV file. This is how we get to a single action we can apply to multiple files in a uniform way. I'm going to just add the bullets because the screenshot is in the link above, which is of course a more complete description. We do: Update the Folder input to Update the File input to Update the Column input to {{#replace table.name "_data.csv" "_id"}}Update the Metadata Links to {{schema.name}}.{{table..name}}Change the Generate column list using to Dynamic Template ConfigurationUpdate the Dynamic ScriptThe dynamic script is pretty simple:    [
    {"name":"{{#replace table.name "_data.csv" "_id"}}","sequence":1,"type":"Numeric","role":"Key"},
        {"name":"ROW_COUNT","sequence":2,"type":"Numeric","role":"Value"}
    ]
Now, we're going to use some metadata to filter down to the files we care about. Switch to the Metadata Selection TabChange to the  optionAdd a Filter on the Table Name Field that contains "_data.csv"At this point, check that the filter finds your files and run the example. You should be good to go. My feeling is that all works better for database tables than for CSV files, just as you would expect from Validatar.Once more, this time with feeling! Let's see how CsvPath Framework and FlightPath Data can make the same magic happen. And, hopefully you'll agree that it's much simpler and more powerful for its use case.Create a uniqueness test for all csv files in multiple foldersThe column specified to group by is account_idThe core of these requirements is the validation statement. Using CsvPath Validation Language this is next to trivial:$[*][ 
    @duplicate_accounts.nocontrib == 100 -> stop()
    has_dups(#account_id) -> counter.duplicate_accounts(1) 
]
(The  sign means a variable and the  sign indicates a header name)This csvpath says: for each line in a file check if the counter is . If it is, stop processing that file. Otherwise, increase the counter if the  is a duplicate.The statement will collect only error lines because:The counter is a side-effect with no contribution to matchingThe check if  equals  is marked to not contribute to matching. (Using the  qualifier)The function that does the heavy lifting is . If that returns  (i.e. the value of ) we match the line and capture it.All pretty readable. Now what do we do with it?All of what we need to do is almost as simple in Python using only CsvPath Framework. Almost! But using FlightPath Data it is even simpler.In FlightPath, create a new file called . Paste in our statement. Right-click on  and select . In the load dialog give the named-paths group the name  and click . You should see your csvpath show up in the middle window on the right under the  folder. When you load a csvpath statement it always goes into a  file. And when you click on that file its background is pale green to let you know you cannot edit it. (You can, of course, over-write it anytime without losing prior versions, but that is another topic for a different post.)Next stage your data. In the example, each file is in its own folder and its folder is one of many in the same directory. We'll just add the parent folder and let FlightPath find the files for us. To do that right click the parent directory and select . In the stage data dialog uncheck the  checkbox because we're going to have every physical file be one version of the same named-file. Think of a named-file as a category that has one file assigned to it at a time, in sequence. We say named-files have versions.In the named-file name box type . That's our category. You will see your data in the top-right window as a directory named . I used a template of :6/:filename in order to keep the month folders, but that is completely optional.Finally, right click the  folder, or the  folder below it, and select . In the run dialog, for named-paths select . For named-file type in . That named-file name is a reference that indicates every version of the  named-file. Again remember, the named-file is like a category that registers a file at a time. We registered a bunch of files and now we're applying our CsvPath Validation Language statement to each of them in turn.And here's the Run dialog: When you click  you will see your results in the lower right-hand window. Your run is date stamped within the  results. In your date-stamped run you can see the  where your duplicate lines landed. In this image I dropped each run into its own folder using a template; you can see the  and . That is completely optional, of course.There is, of course, much more you can do with CsvPath Framework. Likewise, Validatar has a ton more functionality than what we showed. But now you've had a taste of both. What I'd hope you come away with is that CsvPath Framework is the better tool for CSV, JSONL, and Excel file validation. The ease of using FlightPath Data for this validation example makes the case well. Obviously, for relational database validation, Validatar is your horse.And of course I also want to point out again that CsvPath Framework is a complete data preboarding solution, not just a validation engine. Preboarding inbound data files is a big deal. If you need that (and who doesn't?) you owe it to yourself to take a look at CsvPath Framework.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Efficiently Transforming CSV Data to Styled Excel Worksheets with Python</title><link>https://dev.to/allen_yang_f905170c5a197b/efficiently-transforming-csv-data-to-styled-excel-worksheets-with-python-38e5</link><author>Allen Yang</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Raw data, often residing in CSV files, is the lifeblood of many organizations. However, presenting this data directly can be challenging. CSVs are excellent for data storage and interchange due to their simplicity, but they lack the visual structure and formatting capabilities required for effective analysis and professional reporting. This is where Excel steps in. With its robust formatting options, charting tools, and user-friendly interface, Excel transforms raw data into understandable and actionable insights.The manual process of converting CSVs to Excel and then meticulously applying styles can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with large datasets or recurring tasks. This article will guide you through automating this process using Python, enabling you to convert your CSV data into professional, styled Excel spreadsheets efficiently. We'll explore how to not only transfer data but also to enhance its readability and impact through various formatting techniques, leveraging a powerful Python library designed for comprehensive Excel manipulation.
  
  
  Preparing Your Python Environment for Excel Automation
To effectively interact with and style Excel files in Python, a dedicated library is essential. While several options exist, some offer more extensive control over Excel's features, particularly when it comes to intricate styling and advanced functionalities. For this tutorial, we will be using a robust library that provides deep integration with Excel's object model, allowing for precise control over formatting and data presentation.To get started, you'll need to install the library. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:This command will download and install Spire.XLS for Python, an API designed to create, read, edit, and convert Excel files. Its comprehensive feature set, including support for a wide range of Excel versions and extensive styling capabilities, makes it an excellent choice for automating complex Excel tasks, from basic data transfer to advanced report generation.
  
  
  Fundamental CSV to Excel Conversion
Before diving into styling, let's establish the basic process of converting a CSV file into an Excel workbook. This fundamental step involves reading the CSV content and then saving it as an  file.Here’s a simple Python script to perform this basic conversion:Below is a preview of the output Excel file:In this code,  creates an empty Excel file.  then reads your CSV data directly into the first sheet. Finally, sheet.AllocatedRange.AutoFitColumns() adjusts the column widths to fit their content, and  saves the result. This script provides a functional Excel file, but it lacks any visual enhancements.
  
  
  Implementing Essential Excel Styling for Clarity
While the basic conversion is functional, raw data in Excel can still be hard to read. Implementing essential styling, such as formatting headers, adjusting column widths, and applying proper number and date formats, dramatically improves clarity and professionalism.
  
  
  Formatting Headers and Auto-fitting Columns
Headers are crucial for understanding data. Making them stand out with bold formatting and ensuring columns are wide enough to display all content are fundamental steps in creating a readable spreadsheet.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with styled headers:In this example, we create a new style (), set its font to bold, assign a light gray background, and center the text. This style is then applied to the first row, which typically contains the headers. sheet.AllocatedRange.AutoFitColumns() is called again to ensure all content, including potential longer header texts, is fully visible.
  
  
  Applying Number and Date Formatting
Raw data often treats numbers and dates as plain text, leading to formatting inconsistencies or incorrect calculations in Excel. Explicitly setting number and date formats ensures data integrity and improves readability.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with formatted numbers and dates:Here, we select specific column ranges ( for Amount,  for Date) and apply custom number formats using . This ensures that monetary values are displayed with currency symbols and two decimal places, and dates are presented in a consistent  format. These small details significantly enhance the professional appearance and utility of your data.
  
  
  Advanced Styling Techniques for Professional Data Presentation
Beyond basic formatting, advanced styling techniques like borders, background colors, and conditional formatting can further elevate your Excel reports, making them more visually appealing and easier to interpret.
  
  
  Adding Borders and Background Colors
Visual separation and grouping of data can be achieved effectively using borders and alternating row colors. This helps guide the reader's eye and distinguishes different data elements.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with advanced styling applied:In this script, data_range.BorderAround() adds a thin black border around the entire dataset, while data_range.BorderInside() adds lighter gray borders between cells. For alternating rows, a loop iterates through the data rows, applying a  background color to even-numbered rows, creating a visually distinct pattern that improves navigability.
  
  
  Implementing Simple Conditional Formatting
Conditional formatting highlights data based on specific rules, drawing immediate attention to critical information.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with conditional formatting applied:In this final enhancement, we target the  column and add a conditional formatting rule. cf.FormatType = ConditionValueType.Number specifies that the rule is based on the cell's value. cf.Operator = ComparisonOperatorType.Greater sets the condition, and  defines the threshold. Cells meeting this condition will have their background color changed to , instantly drawing attention to higher amounts.
  
  
  Streamlining Data Presentation Workflows
This tutorial has guided you through a practical journey of transforming raw CSV data into professionally styled Excel spreadsheets using Python. We started with a fundamental CSV-to-Excel conversion, then progressively enhanced the output with crucial styling elements: bold headers, auto-fitted columns, precise number and date formatting, and advanced visual cues like borders, alternating row colors, and conditional formatting.The power of Python, especially when combined with a comprehensive library like Spire.XLS for Python, lies in its ability to automate these intricate tasks. By scripting these processes, you eliminate manual effort, reduce the risk of human error, and ensure consistent, high-quality data presentation across all your reports. This automation not only saves valuable time but also elevates the professionalism and clarity of your data analysis and reporting workflows.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🌀 Beginner-Friendly Guide &apos;Minimum Cost Path with Teleportations&apos; - LeetCode 3651 (C++, Python, JavaScript)</title><link>https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-minimum-cost-path-with-teleportations-leetcode-3651-c-python-pk8</link><author>Om Shree</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:08:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Navigating a grid is a classic coding challenge, but adding teleportation changes the game entirely. This problem asks us to find the most efficient route when we can either pay to move or jump for free under specific conditions. By mastering this, you will learn how to layer dynamic programming to handle multiple "states" of a problem.A 2D grid of size  where each cell contains a cost.An integer , representing the maximum number of times you can teleport.Two movement rules: standard moves (right or down) which cost the value of the destination cell, and teleportation (to any cell with a value less than or equal to your current cell) which costs zero.Calculate the minimum total cost to travel from the top-left cell  to the bottom-right cell .The core of this problem lies in balancing standard movement and the limited resource of  teleports. Without teleports, this is a standard pathfinding problem. The cost to reach a cell is the cell's value plus the minimum cost of reaching the cell above it or to its left. Teleporting is powerful because it costs . However, you can only teleport to a cell  if . This means if we have used  teleports to reach a cell with value , we can start a new path from any cell with value  with a cost of  for that jump. We solve the problem in "rounds" based on the number of teleports used. For each round from  to , we update our minimum costs. We maintain a suffix minimum array () that stores the cheapest way to reach any cell that has a value of at least . This allows us to quickly check if teleporting to a cell with value  is cheaper than walking to it.
  
  
  Walkthrough: Understanding the Examples
grid = [[1,3,3],[2,5,4],[4,3,5]], k = 2 We begin at . Initial cost is . Move to . Cost becomes . Move to . Cost becomes . The value at  is . We can teleport to  because its value is also  (and ). The teleportation cost is . Total cost remains . Since  is the destination, the answer is . Adding a variable like  (number of teleports) often means we need to repeat our logic  times or add a dimension to our DP table. Using an auxiliary array to track the minimum value across a range (like all values ) is a common trick to optimize search time from  to . We only ever need the results from the "previous teleport count" to calculate the "current teleport count," allowing us to save memory.This problem is a fantastic representation of how real-world logistics systems work. Think of a delivery drone. It can drive along streets (standard moves with cost), but it might also have the battery to fly (teleport) between high-altitude landing pads. Systems like Google Maps or airline routing use similar multi-state optimizations to find the cheapest or fastest paths.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beyond Just a Photo: Building a Pixel-Perfect Calorie Estimator with SAM and GPT-4o</title><link>https://dev.to/beck_moulton/beyond-just-a-photo-building-a-pixel-perfect-calorie-estimator-with-sam-and-gpt-4o-1foj</link><author>Beck_Moulton</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've all been there: staring at a delicious plate of pasta, trying to manually log every gram into a fitness app. It’s tedious, prone to "optimistic" human error, and frankly, ruins the meal. But what if we could turn those pixels directly into nutritional data? In this tutorial, we are building a Multimodal Dietary Analysis Engine. By combining the surgical precision of Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the reasoning power of , we can transform a simple smartphone photo into a detailed nutritional breakdown. We will leverage  and  to isolate food items and use reference-based scaling to estimate volume and calories with surprising accuracy.While building this prototype, I drew heavy inspiration from the production-grade AI patterns found on the WellAlly Blog, which is a goldmine for anyone building robust, AI-driven health tech solutions.To achieve high accuracy, we don't just "show" an image to an LLM. We process it. First, SAM identifies the exact boundaries of the food. Then, we feed the segmented mask and the original context to GPT-4o to perform the cross-referencing.graph TD

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following stack ready:: For running the SAM weights.: Meta's pre-trained vision model.: Our multimodal "brain.": To wrap everything into a production-ready microservice.: For image manipulation.
  
  
  Step-by-Step Implementation

  
  
  1. Isolating the Food with SAM
First, we need to distinguish the food from the plate. Traditional bounding boxes are too messy; we need pixel-level masks to estimate surface area effectively.
  
  
  2. Crafting the Multimodal Prompt for GPT-4o
GPT-4o is excellent at visual reasoning, but it needs context. We provide it with the original image and instructions to use common items (like a credit card or a fork) as a scale reference.Now, let's wrap this into an endpoint that our mobile app can consume.
  
  
  The "Official" Way: Advanced Patterns
While the code above works for a hobby project, production-grade health apps require robust error handling, Pydantic data validation, and real-time feedback loops. For example, how do you handle low-light conditions or overlapping food items?If you're looking for more production-ready examples and advanced architectural patterns regarding AI in health tech, I highly recommend checking out the . They cover deep-dives into LLM observability and multimodal data processing that were instrumental in refining this dietary engine.By combining 's spatial awareness with 's cognitive understanding, we've moved past simple "image labeling." We've built an engine that understands volume, context, and nutrition at a pixel level.  Try adding a "Reference Object Detection" step using YOLOv8 to help GPT-4o with scale.

Mutation testing injects small bugs and checks whether your tests detect them. If tests still pass after changing  to , you found a gap.
  
  
  Why Mutation Testing Has Been Impractical
Traditional tools (mutmut, cosmic-ray) rewrite source files, reload modules, and run the full test suite per mutation. A codebase with 100 mutations and a 10-second test suite takes 17+ minutes. That runtime kills feedback loops.
  
  
  pytest-gremlins Architecture
: All mutations are embedded during a single instrumentation pass. Switching between mutations requires only an environment variable change, eliminating per-mutation file I/O and module reloads.Coverage-Guided Test Selection: The plugin tracks which tests cover each line. When testing a mutation on line 42, it runs only the 3 tests that touch line 42 instead of all 200 tests.: Results are keyed by content hash of source and test files. Unchanged code skips mutation testing entirely on subsequent runs.

Measured on Python 3.12 in Docker:pytest-gremlins (sequential)pytest-gremlins (parallel)pytest-gremlins (parallel + cache)Sequential mode is slower because pytest-gremlins runs additional mutation operators.

How many units will we sell next quarter? What will demand look like during the holiday season? When should we increase inventory?These questions require time series forecasting—analyzing historical patterns to predict future values.The good news: Python makes time series analysis accessible. You don't need a PhD in statistics. You need the right approach and the right tools.
  
  
  What Makes Time Series Special
Time series data isn't like other data. The order matters. Yesterday's value influences today's. Last year's pattern might repeat this year.This temporal dependence violates assumptions that most statistical techniques rely on. You can't just throw time series data at a standard regression and expect good results.Understanding the unique properties of time series is essential before diving into techniques.Every time series can be decomposed into fundamental components. The long-term direction. Is the series generally increasing, decreasing, or stable? Sales might trend upward as a company grows. Regular, predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals. Retail sales spike in December. Ice cream sales peak in summer. Longer-term fluctuations that aren't as regular as seasonality. Economic cycles affect many time series. What's left after removing trend and seasonality. Sometimes called noise, though it may contain meaningful variation.Decomposition helps you understand what's driving your data before you try to forecast it.
  
  
  Setting Up Your Environment
Python's ecosystem for time series is mature and powerful. Here's what you need:Pandas handles time-indexed data naturally. Statsmodels provides classical time series methods. Scikit-learn offers evaluation metrics.For more advanced work, consider Prophet (from Meta), pmdarima (auto-ARIMA), and sktime (unified time series interface).
  
  
  Loading and Preparing Time Series Data
Time series data needs proper datetime indexing. Without it, Python treats your data as arbitrary rows.The frequency specification matters. Many time series methods assume regular intervals. Gaps or irregular timestamps cause problems.Before modeling, understand your data visually.Look for obvious patterns. Is there a trend?Seasonal spikes? Outliers? Structural breaks where behavior changed?This visual inspection guides your modeling choices.
  
  
  Stationarity: Why It Matters
Many forecasting methods require stationarity—the statistical properties of the series don't change over time.A stationary series has constant mean, constant variance, and consistent autocorrelation structure. Most real-world time series aren't stationary.The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test helps check stationarity:If your series isn't stationary, you'll need to transform it—usually through differencing.
  
  
  Making a Series Stationary
Differencing removes trend by computing changes between consecutive values.First differencing removes linear trends. Seasonal differencing removes repeating patterns. Sometimes you need both.After differencing, check stationarity again. Multiple rounds might be needed.
  
  
  Classical Forecasting: ARIMA
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) remains a workhorse for time series forecasting.The three parameters (p, d, q) define the model:: Autoregressive order (how many past values influence the current value): Degree of differencing (how many times to difference for stationarity): Moving average order (how many past errors influence the current value)
Choosing the right parameters requires experimentation. You can use ACF and PACF plots for guidance, or rely on automated selection.
  
  
  Auto-ARIMA: Parameter Selection Made Easy
Manually tuning ARIMA parameters is tedious. The pmdarima library automates this:Auto-ARIMA searches through parameter combinations and selects the best model based on information criteria.When seasonality is present, SARIMA extends ARIMA with additional seasonal parameters.The seasonal order (P, D, Q, m) mirrors the non-seasonal parameters but operates at the seasonal frequency m.
  
  
  Prophet: Accessible Forecasting
Meta's Prophet is designed for business time series. It handles seasonality, holidays, and missing data gracefully.Prophet is less flexible than ARIMA but requires less expertise. It's excellent for quick, reasonable forecasts.
  
  
  Train-Test Splitting for Time Series
Standard random train-test splits don't work for time series. You can't use future data to predict the past.Always split chronologically:The test set must come after the training set. Otherwise, your evaluation is meaningless.Common metrics for time series forecast evaluation:MAPE is intuitive but undefined when actuals are zero. MAE and RMSE are more robust but less interpretable.
  
  
  Cross-Validation for Time Series
Time series cross-validation uses rolling or expanding windows:Each fold trains on historical data and tests on a subsequent period. This gives a realistic estimate of forecast accuracy. Fitting models to non-stationary data produces unreliable forecasts. Complex models with many parameters fit training data perfectly but generalize poorly. Failing to account for obvious seasonal patterns leads to systematic errors. Using future information during training—easy to do accidentally with calculated features.Over-reliance on point forecasts. Always consider prediction intervals, not just the central forecast.
  
  
  When Simple Beats Complex
Surprisingly often, simple methods outperform sophisticated ones.Naive forecasts (tomorrow equals today) and seasonal naive forecasts (next January equals last January) are strong baselines. If your fancy model can't beat them, it's not adding value.Exponential smoothing methods are simpler than ARIMA and often perform comparably.Always start simple. Add complexity only when it demonstrably improves forecasts.
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions
What's the minimum amount of data needed for time series forecasting?
It depends on seasonality. To detect yearly patterns, you need multiple years of data. For weekly patterns, months might suffice. Generally, more data is better.How far ahead can I forecast reliably?
Forecast accuracy degrades with horizon length. Short-term forecasts (days to weeks) are typically much more accurate than long-term ones (quarters to years).Should I use ARIMA or Prophet?
Prophet is easier and handles holidays well. ARIMA offers more control and performs better when properly tuned. Try both and compare on your data.How do I handle missing values?
Interpolation works for small gaps. For larger gaps, consider whether the missing pattern itself contains information. Some methods like Prophet handle missing values automatically.Can I use machine learning for time series?
Yes. LSTMs, Gradient Boosting, and other ML methods work for time series but require careful feature engineering and cross-validation.What if my series has multiple seasonal patterns?
Prophet handles multiple seasonalities well. SARIMA requires choosing the dominant pattern. For complex seasonality, consider Fourier terms as features.How do I forecast multiple related time series?
Hierarchical forecasting and vector autoregression (VAR) handle multiple series. Prophet and other methods can be applied to each series independently.What about external factors that affect my series?

for a process to terminate. The standard library's  module has
relied on a busy-loop polling approach since the  parameter was added
to
Popen.wait()
in Python 3.3, around 15 years ago (see
source).
And psutil's
Process.wait()
method uses exactly the same technique (see
source).The logic is straightforward: check whether the process has exited using
non-blocking , sleep briefly, check again, sleep a bit
longer, and so on.In this blog post I'll show how I finally addressed this long-standing
inefficiency, first in psutil, and most excitingly, directly in CPython's
standard library subprocess module.The problem with busy-pollingCPU wake-ups: even with exponential backoff (starting at 0.1ms, capping at
  40ms), the system constantly wakes up to check process status, wasting CPU
  cycles and draining batteries.Latency: there's always a gap between when a process actually terminates and
  when you detect it.Scalability: monitoring many processes simultaneously magnifies all of the
  above.All POSIX systems provide at least one mechanism to be notified when a file
descriptor becomes ready. These are
select(),
poll(),
epoll() (Linux) and
kqueue() (BSD / macOS)
system calls. Until recently, I believed they could only be used with file
descriptors referencing sockets, pipes, etc., but it turns out they can also be
used to wait for events on process PIDs!In 2019, Linux 5.3 introduced a new syscall,
,
which was added to the  module in Python 3.9. It returns a file descriptor
referencing a process PID. The interesting thing is that  can be
used in conjunction with ,  or  to effectively wait
until the process exits. E.g. by using :This approach has zero busy-looping. The kernel wakes us up exactly when the
process terminates or when the timeout expires if the PID is still alive.I chose  over  because  has a historical file
descriptor limit (), which typically caps it at 1024 file
descriptors per-process (reminded me of
BPO-1685000).I chose  over  because it does not require creating an
additional file descriptor. It also needs only a single syscall, which should
make it a bit more efficient when monitoring a single FD rather than many.BSD-derived systems (including macOS) provide the  syscall. It's
conceptually similar to ,  and , but more powerful
(e.g. it can also handle regular files).  can be passed a PID
directly, and it will return once the PID disappears or the timeout expires:Windows does not busy-loop, both in psutil and subprocess module, thanks to
. This means Windows has effectively had event-driven
process waiting from the start. So nothing to do on that front.Both  and  can fail for different reasons. For example,
with  if the process runs out of file descriptors (usually 1024), or
with  /  if the syscall was explicitly blocked at the system
level by the sysadmin (e.g. via SECCOMP). In all cases, psutil silently falls
back to the traditional busy-loop polling approach rather than raising an
exception.This fast-path-with-fallback approach is similar in spirit to
BPO-33671, where I sped up
 by using zero-copy system calls back in 2018. In there,
more efficient  is attempted first, and if it fails (e.g. on
network filesystems) we fall back to the traditional  / 
approach to copy regular files.As a simple experiment, here's a simple program which waits on itself for 10
seconds without terminating:We can measure the CPU context switching using . Before the
patch (the busy-loop):$/usr/bin/time-vpython3test.py>grepcontext
Voluntarycontextswitches:Involuntarycontextswitches:After the patch (the event-driven approach):$/usr/bin/time-vpython3test.py>grepcontext
Voluntarycontextswitches:Involuntarycontextswitches:This shows that instead of spinning in userspace, the process blocks in
 / , and is woken up only when the kernel notifies it,
resulting in just a few CPU context switches.It's also interesting to note that waiting via  (or ) puts
the process into the exact same sleeping state as a plain  call.
From the kernel's perspective, both are interruptible sleeps: the process is
de-scheduled, consumes zero CPU, and sits quietly in kernel space.The  state shown below by  means that the process "sleeps in
foreground".After landing the psutil implementation
(psutil/PR-2706), I took the
extra step and submitted a matching pull request for CPython 
module: cpython/PR-144047.I'm especially proud of this one: this is the  in psutil's 17+
year history that a feature developed in psutil made its way upstream into the
Python standard library. The first was back in 2011, when 
inspired
shutil.disk_usage() (see
python-ideas ML proposal). 15 years ago, Python 3.3 added the  parameter to
 (see
commit). That's
probably where I took inspiration when I first added the  parameter to
psutil's  around the same time (see
commit). Now, 15 years
later, I'm contributing back a similar improvement for that very same 
parameter. .psutil/#2712: proposal to
  extend this to multiple PIDs ().psutil/#2703: proposal for

Not because the data is missing.
But because the decision keeps getting delayed, softened, or deferred.A week becomes a sprint.
A sprint becomes a phase.
A phase becomes “we’ll deal with it later.”On paper, the project is still moving.
In reality, momentum is leaking out through indecision.This is what I mean by decision latency.It’s the time between when a decision becomes necessary and when someone is willing to own it. That gap is where most project risk is created.What makes it dangerous is that it usually looks reasonable.“We just need one more data point.”
“Let’s see how it trends.”
“We’ll take that offline.”
“We’ll re-baseline next cycle.”Each of those sounds sensible in isolation. Together, they quietly stall the project.Dashboards, frameworks, and AI can improve visibility and analysis, but they don’t reduce decision latency. In some cases, they make it worse by giving people more reasons to wait.More data.
More scenarios.I’ve written before about why AI struggles with real project work. This is a big part of it. AI can tell you what usually happens next. It can’t tell you which trade-off you’re prepared to live with when the information is incomplete and the pressure is real.That choice isn’t analytical.
It’s accountable.Decision latency also hides behind good governance.Steering committees meet. Papers are circulated. Risks are noted. Actions are captured. And still, the core decision gets deferred because no one wants to be the one who makes it too early.The longer that goes on, the fewer options remain. By the time the decision is forced, the project has already paid the price.Experienced project managers learn to recognise this early. They stop asking, “Do we have enough information?” and start asking a harder question:“What happens if we don’t decide now?”That’s usually when the real risk becomes visible.Projects don’t need perfect information.
They need timely decisions with clear ownership.Everything else is support.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I scraped Reddit to find $10k leads without getting banned 🕵️‍♂️</title><link>https://dev.to/hypertools/how-i-scraped-reddit-to-find-10k-leads-without-getting-banned-35o6</link><author>Roberto | Hyper-Tools</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:06:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most people look for sales leads on LinkedIn.

  The Go port of Saga Engine. Compile-time step safety via generics, PostgreSQL persistence, and a 15-minute hard limit. No Temporal cluster required.
After shipping Saga Engine for Node.js, the most common request was a Go version. Not a wrapper. A native implementation that leverages what Go actually gives you: generics, context propagation, and compile-time safety. is that implementation. Same guarantees. Different language idioms.
  
  
  What's Different from the Node.js Version
This isn't a line-by-line port. Go changes the design in meaningful ways:Compile-time via  generics (optional) (first-class)Single-threaded event loopGoroutines + race detectorThe Go version catches an entire class of bugs at compile time that the Node version can only catch at runtime.
  
  
  1. The Core API: Generic Steps
Every step is parameterized by its return type. No  casting. No runtime type assertions.The compensate function receives the exact type returned by execute. If  returns ,  receives . The compiler enforces this.Go's  is the mechanism for timeout enforcement. The engine cancels the context when deadlines are exceeded. This only works if your functions cooperate.The 15-minute execution limit and per-step timeouts are enforced via context cancellation. If you pass  to every I/O call, it works. If you don't, the engine has no way to interrupt your function.Same as the Node.js version, enforced at the library level:Required. Returns  if keys are missing at transaction or step level.State committed to PostgreSQL before the next step executes. prevents double-execution across processes.15-minute hard limit, checked before every step.Failed compensations move to  for manual audit via  CLI.
  
  
  4. The JSON Serialization Contract
On crash recovery, step results are reconstructed from PostgreSQL via . This means your result types must follow Go's JSON serialization rules:This is a hard requirement, not a suggestion. If your step returns a struct with unexported fields, those fields will be zero-valued after a crash recovery. The saga will continue with corrupted state.
  
  
  5. Error Handling the Go Way
All errors support  and :Seven sentinel errors, seven corresponding error types with structured fields. Standard Go error handling, no custom error-checking patterns to learn.
  
  
  6. PgBouncer Compatibility
Advisory locks are session-scoped. This matters for connection pooling:PgBouncer (transaction mode)If you run PgBouncer in transaction mode, lock ownership is lost between queries. The engine won't warn you. Your workflows will silently lose mutual exclusion.Same philosophy as the Node.js version:No workflows > 15 minutes. Use Temporal for long-running processes.No auto-recovery from dead letters. If compensation fails, a human investigates.  is intentionally manual.No distributed transactions. Single-process, single-database. We coordinate side effects; we don't replace your DB's ACID properties.Operational visibility without a dashboard:
go build  saga-admin ./cmd/saga-admin


saga-admin  dead-letter


saga-admin  show order-123


saga-admin  retry order-123


saga-admin  stats
Single PostgreSQL table. No migrations framework required. The schema is in the README.Saga Engine Go brings the same crash-resilient saga execution to the Go ecosystem. Type-safe generics, context-based cancellation, and a single PostgreSQL dependency.If you're already using the Node.js version, the Go port follows the same mental model. If you're new to Saga Engine, pick whichever runtime your services are built on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I wrapped the Zorks with an LLM</title><link>https://infocom.tambo.co/</link><author>alecf</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:59:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">Show HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Docker for Beginners: Stop saying &quot;It works on my machine.&quot;</title><link>https://dev.to/frankdotdev/docker-for-beginners-stop-saying-it-works-on-my-machine-45ll</link><author>Frank Oge</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:30:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a sentence that every Junior Developer says at least once. It’s the sentence that makes Senior Engineers sigh and rub their temples.
​"But it works on my machine!"
​You wrote the code. You tested it on your laptop. It worked perfectly. Then you pushed it to the server, and it crashed. Why?
Maybe you have Python 3.10, and the server has Python 3.8.
Maybe you are on a Mac, and the server is Linux.
Maybe you installed a library three months ago and forgot to put it in your requirements.txt.
​This is called Environment Drift, and it is a nightmare.
​The solution is Docker.
​The Shipping Container Analogy
​Before 1950, shipping goods was a disaster. You had barrels of whiskey, sacks of flour, and loose furniture. Loading them onto a ship took forever because every item was a different shape.
​Then, the standardized Shipping Container was invented.
It didn't matter what was inside (cars, grain, TVs). The container was always the exact same size. The crane didn't need to know what was inside; it just needed to lift the box.
​Docker does this for code.
It creates a digital "Container" that holds everything your app needs:
​The Operating System (e.g., a tiny version of Linux).
​The Code.
​The Environment Variables.
​When you ship your app, you don't ship just the code. You ship the whole box. If it runs on your laptop, it is mathematically guaranteed to run on the server, because the environment inside the box never changes.
​The 3 Concepts You Need to Know
​Forget the complex commands for a second. Understand these three words:
​Dockerfile (The Recipe): A text file that tells Docker how to build your box. ("Start with Linux, install Python, copy my files, run this command").
​Image (The Blueprint): When you run the recipe, you get an Image. This is a frozen snapshot of your app. It cannot be changed.
​Container (The House): When you actually run the Image, it becomes a Container. This is the live, running application.
​Let's say you have a simple Python script.
You tell your friend, "Install Python, then run pip install requests, then run python main.py."
(This fails if they have the wrong Python version).
​With Docker:RUN pip install -r requirements.txtCMD ["python", "main.py"]Now, your friend just types:
docker build -t my-app .
​It works instantly. No installing Python. No version conflicts. It just works.
​Docker isn't just for DevOps engineers. It is for anyone who values their sanity.
It forces you to document your dependencies explicitly. It allows you to onboard new developers in minutes, not days.
​If you want to be a professional software engineer, stop relying on your local setup. Containerize everything.

You'll be given a certificate in TEXT format and asked to identify what's wrong with it. This exercise prepares you for exactly that scenario.
  
  
  🎯 For Security Engineers: Why This Exercise Matters
You need to understand WHAT makes a TLS certificate valid and WHY - not just IF it's valid.Off-the-shelf tools like sslyze, testssl.sh, and OpenSSL will give you a simple answer:sslyze google.com:443
✓ Certificate is valid
But they won't teach you: SHA-1 signatures are catastrophically broken (Google SHAttered attack, 2017) CA:TRUE on an end-entity certificate enables complete PKI compromise (DigiNotar breach, 2011) browsers ignore the Common Name field (RFC 6125 deprecation) the 398-day validity limit exists (CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC22) wildcard matching actually works ( rules) to detect self-signed certificates (SKI/AKI comparison logic) Key Usage flags matter (Digital Signature vs Key Encipherment vs Certificate Sign)This exercise forces you to implement the validation logic yourself.By the end, you won't just run security scanners - you'll understand X.509 certificate structure at a fundamental level. This understanding separates those who run tools from those who understand PKI fundamentals.
  
  
  What Do Off-the-Shelf Tools Actually Tell You?
Here's what happens when you check an expired certificate with popular tools:openssl verify expired_cert.pem
error 10 at 0 depth lookup: certificate has expired
❌ Cryptic error code ("error 10")❌ Doesn't show which date field or the actual dates❌ No explanation of why it matterssslyze  expired.com:443
  Certificate Validation:
     Hostname Validation:     FAILED - Certificate does NOT match
     Path Validation:         OK - Certificate is trusted
❌ Says it failed but doesn't show the SANs field❌ Doesn't explain wildcard matching rules❌ Black box: "It failed" (but not WHERE or WHY)testssl.sh https://expired.com

     Why this matters: Expired certificates cannot be trusted.
     The private key may have been compromised after expiration.
     Browsers reject these to prevent MITM attacks.

  🔹 PHASE 1: FUNDAMENTAL VALIDITY
Stop immediately if any of these fail!
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 1: Certificate Version
What you'll see in a good certificate:Plain English explanation:
X.509 certificates come in 3 versions:Version 1 (0x0) - Ancient, from 1988, no extensionsVersion 2 (0x1) - Rarely used - Modern standard, supports extensions ✅
Only Version 3 supports the security extensions we need:Subject Alternative Names (SANs) - for hostnamesKey Usage - what the key can doExtended Key Usage - what the certificate is forOCSP/CRL - revocation checkingCertificate Transparency - public audit trail RFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.1 - "When extensions are used, as expected in this profile, version MUST be 3"What happens if it fails:
Certificate cannot have modern security features → Reject immediately
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 2: Certificate Expiration (Not Expired / Not Yet Valid)
What you'll see in a good certificate:Validity
    Not Before: Dec  1 00:00:00 2025 GMT
    Not After : Feb 28 23:59:59 2026 GMT
Plain English explanation:
Every certificate has two dates: = Certificate becomes valid at this date/time = Certificate expires at this date/timeThe current date/time MUST be between these two dates. can't be trusted (keys might be compromised)Not-yet-valid certificates might be test/staging certs leaked earlyCertificate expired on: Jan 1, 2026
Today's date: Jan 25, 2026
→ ❌ EXPIRED! Don't trust!
What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID" - Connection blocked
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 3: Signature Algorithm (SHA-256 or Better)
What you'll see in a good certificate:Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
Signature Algorithm: ecdsa-with-SHA256
Plain English explanation:
The signature proves the CA really issued this certificate. The hash algorithm must be strong.This check validates the  (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512), NOT the signature algorithm (RSA vs ECDSA).✅ Allowed hash algorithms:✅ Allowed signature algorithms (with approved hash):, , , , MD5 (broken 2004): SHA-1 (broken 2017): , Outdated signature algorithms:DSA (deprecated by NIST 2019): , Note: DSA deprecated even with strong hash algorithmsFocus on the HASH algorithm, not the signature type:
- "sha256WithRSAEncryption" → SHA-256 ✅
- "ecdsa-with-SHA256" → SHA-256 ✅
- "sha1WithRSAEncryption" → SHA-1 ❌
- "ecdsa-with-SHA1" → SHA-1 ❌
Why this matters - Collision attacks:MD5 collision (2008):
1. Attacker creates GOOD cert request
2. Also creates EVIL cert with same MD5 hash
3. CA signs GOOD cert
4. Attacker swaps in EVIL cert (same signature!)
5. Browser trusts EVIL cert ❌
Flame malware (2012): Used MD5 collision to forge Microsoft certificateSHAttered (2017): Demonstrated practical SHA-1 collision CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "CAs MUST NOT issue certificates using MD5 or SHA-1" (since January 2016)What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM"
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 4: Public Key Strength
What you'll see in a good certificate:Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
    Public-Key: (2048 bit)
Public Key Algorithm: id-ecPublicKey
    Public-Key: (256 bit)
    ASN1 OID: prime256v1
    NIST CURVE: P-256
Plain English explanation:
The public key must be strong enough to resist brute-force attacks.RSA: ≥2048 bits (3072 or 4096 recommended)ECDSA: ≥P-256 (P-384 or P-521 recommended)RSA-1024 (crackable with $1M+ budget)RSA-512 (crackable in hours)RSA-1024 security level:
- 1999: "Safe for 20+ years"
- 2010: Factored by academics
- 2015: NSA likely can crack
- 2025: Definitely broken ❌
 CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "Recommended key strengths are at least 2048-bit RSA or Elliptic Curve using NIST P-256"What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_WEAK_KEY"
  
  
  🔹 PHASE 2: IDENTITY VALIDATION

  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 5: Subject Distinguished Name (DN)
What you'll see in a good certificate:Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com
Plain English explanation:
Subject DN = Who owns this certificate
  
  
  🎯 The Core Rule (RFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.6)
Check 5 validates the Subject DN field with a  based on whether Subject has content:SANs Critical Requirement⚠️  - SANs can be critical OR non-critical❌  if SANs not critical Check 5 only cares about the SANs critical flag when Subject is empty. When Subject has components, the SANs critical flag is irrelevant to Check 5.
  
  
  ✅ Case 1: Subject Present, SANs Non-Critical (99% of real certificates)
Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ✅  Subject has DN components (C=US, O=Example Inc, CN=...), so Check 5 passes immediately. The SANs critical flag is  by Check 5. ssllabs.com, google.com, amazon.com - nearly all production certificates follow this pattern.
  
  
  ✅ Case 2: Subject Present, SANs Critical (also valid)
Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ✅  Subject has DN components, so Check 5 passes. SANs being marked critical is  when Subject is present. Some CAs mark SANs as critical even when Subject is present - this is valid and doesn't affect Check 5.
  
  
  ✅ Case 3: Empty Subject, SANs Critical (rare but valid)
Subject: (empty)

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ✅  Subject is empty, BUT SANs is marked critical, which satisfies RFC 5280's requirement. Certificates issued by modern CAs that choose to omit the Subject DN entirely and rely solely on SANs for identity.
  
  
  ❌ Case 4: Empty Subject, SANs Non-Critical (INVALID)
Subject: (empty)

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ❌  Subject is empty AND SANs is not marked critical - violates RFC 5280. Without a Subject DN and without the critical flag, older validators might ignore the SANs extension completely, causing validation to fail in unpredictable ways.
  
  
  🔍 How to Check if SANs is Critical
The "critical" keyword appears on the same line as the extension name:X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical  ← Has "critical" keyword
    DNS:www.example.com
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:  ← No "critical" keyword
    DNS:www.example.com
 "SANs must always be critical"❌ False - SANs only MUST be critical when Subject is empty "Subject can never be empty"❌ False - RFC 5280 allows empty Subject if SANs is marked critical "If Subject exists, SANs cannot be critical"❌ False - SANs can be critical even when Subject exists (it's just not required) "SANs critical flag requirement is conditional on Subject being empty"✅ True - this is the actual RFC 5280 rule
  
  
  📊 Decision Tree for Check 5

  🔬 What Counts as "Empty" Subject?
These are considered empty:Subject:                    ← Nothing after colon
Subject: (empty)            ← Explicit empty marker
Subject: CN=                ← Key without value
Subject: =value             ← Value without key
Subject: CN= , O=           ← All values empty
Subject: CN=www.example.com           ← Has valid component
Subject: C=US, O=Example              ← Has valid components
Subject: CN=www.example.com, O=       ← At least one valid component
 A Subject with at least one valid  pair (where both key and value are non-empty) is considered "present" for Check 5 purposes.Old certificates (pre-2000): Used only Subject DN for identityCommon Name (CN) field contained the hostnameModern certificates (2000+): Use SANs for identitySANs contains all valid hostnamesSubject DN became optionalCN field deprecated for hostname validation (RFC 6125) Allows empty Subject IF:SANs is marked critical (forces validators to check it)Ensures backward compatibility with older validatorsIf Subject is empty and SANs is NOT critical:Legacy validators might skip SANs (non-critical extensions can be ignored)Certificate would have no identity informationValidation would fail unpredictablyBy requiring SANs to be critical when Subject is empty:Forces all validators (old and new) to check SANsGuarantees certificate identity can be validatedMaintains backward compatibilityRFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.6:"If the subject field contains an empty sequence, then the issuing CA MUST include a subjectAltName extension that is marked as critical." This is a one-way requirement. It does NOT say "if Subject is present, SANs cannot be critical." Both critical and non-critical SANs are valid when Subject exists.
  
  
  ❓ What Happens if Check 5 Fails?
Scenario 1: Both Subject and SANs emptyCertificate has no identity informationCannot determine who owns the certificate Reject certificate immediatelyScenario 2: Subject empty, SANs not criticalViolates RFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.6Legacy validators might ignore SANs Reject certificate (non-compliant)Scenario 3: Subject presentCheck 5 automatically passesIdentity validation continues with Check 6 (SANs present) and Check 7 (hostname match)
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 6: Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:www.example.com
    DNS:example.com
    DNS:api.example.com
Plain English explanation:
SANs = List of ALL valid hostnames for this certificateCertificate for: www.example.com
User visits: api.example.com

WITHOUT SANs listing api.example.com:
→ ❌ Hostname mismatch! Reject!

WITH SANs listing api.example.com:
→ ✅ Valid! Allow connection!
DNS:*.example.com
→ Matches: www.example.com, api.example.com
→ Does NOT match: example.com (no subdomain!)
→ Does NOT match: foo.bar.example.com (only 1 level!)
 CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "This extension MUST be present"What happens if it fails:
Cannot validate hostname → Reject
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 7: Hostname Matches SAN
User visiting: www.example.com
SANs: DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
→ ✅ MATCH!
Plain English explanation:
The hostname in the browser address bar MUST match one of the SANs in the certificate.⭐ CRITICAL: CHECK 7 USES DNS WILDCARD PATTERN MATCHING ⭐This check performs DNS wildcard pattern matching where  is a wildcard character. DNS wildcards follow RFC 6125 rules, NOT shell/filesystem wildcard rules!🔑 Understanding DNS Labels (The Foundation of Wildcard Matching)Before understanding wildcard matching, you must understand :A label is one "part" of a domain name separated by dotsThink of labels as "levels" in the domain hierarchyExample: Breaking down  into labels:www.example.com
 │    │      │
 │    │      └─── Label 3: "com" (TLD/root)
 │    └────────── Label 2: "example" (base domain)
 └─────────────── Label 1: "www" (subdomain - LEFTMOST)

Total: 3 labels
mail.example.com        → 3 labels: ["mail", "example", "com"]
api.example.com         → 3 labels: ["api", "example", "com"]
wrong.host.badssl.com   → 4 labels: ["wrong", "host", "badssl", "com"]
sub.domain.example.com  → 4 labels: ["sub", "domain", "example", "com"]
example.com             → 2 labels: ["example", "com"]
🎯 The Core Rule of DNS Wildcard Matching:The wildcard  replaces EXACTLY ONE label - no more, no less!This is fundamentally different from shell wildcards which can match multiple levels.⭐ CRITICAL DNS Wildcard Rules (RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3):Wildcard replaces exactly ONE label = [exactly-one-label].example.comNOT:  = Wildcard only in leftmost positionPattern and hostname must have same number of labelsThis is the key rule most implementations miss!Case-insensitive comparison matches Exact non-wildcard labels must match exactlyIn , both "example" and "com" must match exactly📊 DNS Wildcard Matching Examples (Understanding Label Counts):Pattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",     "example", "com"]  → 3 labels
Hostname: ["www",   "example", "com"]  → 3 labels

Label count: 3 = 3 ✅ MATCH!
- Label 1: "*" matches "www" ✅
- Label 2: "example" = "example" ✅
- Label 3: "com" = "com" ✅
Result: ✅ PASS
Example 2: Correct Match (Different Subdomain)Pattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: api.example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",    "example", "com"]  → 3 labels
Hostname: ["api",  "example", "com"]  → 3 labels

Label count: 3 = 3 ✅ MATCH!
- Label 1: "*" matches "api" ✅
- Label 2: "example" = "example" ✅
- Label 3: "com" = "com" ✅
Result: ✅ PASS
Example 3: NO MATCH - Too Many LabelsPattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: wrong.host.badssl.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",      "example", "com"]        → 3 labels
Hostname: ["wrong",  "host", "badssl", "com"] → 4 labels

Label count: 3 ≠ 4 ❌ NO MATCH!
Why: Wildcard replaces ONE label, but hostname has TWO extra labels
The wildcard can't "absorb" multiple labels!
Result: ❌ FAIL
Example 4: NO MATCH - Too Few LabelsPattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",       "example", "com"]  → 3 labels
Hostname: ["example", "com"]             → 2 labels

Label count: 3 ≠ 2 ❌ NO MATCH!
Why: Wildcard needs a label to replace, but hostname has no subdomain
Result: ❌ FAIL
Example 5: NO MATCH - Wrong Base DomainPattern:  *.api.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",   "api", "example", "com"]  → 4 labels
Hostname: ["www", "example", "com"]         → 3 labels

Label count: 4 ≠ 3 ❌ NO MATCH!
Even if we ignore count: "api" ≠ nothing, "example" ≠ "example" position mismatch
Result: ❌ FAIL
🎓 Conceptual Approach to DNS Wildcard Matching:Step 1: Split into labelsSplit the pattern on dots:  → Split the hostname on dots:  → ["www", "example", "com"]Step 2: Check label countCount labels in pattern: 3Count labels in hostname: 3If counts don't match → NO MATCH, stop here!This step is CRITICAL and catches most invalid matchesStep 3: Compare each label positionGo through each position (left to right)If pattern label is  → any hostname label matches (continue)If pattern label is not  → must match exactly (case-insensitive)If any non-wildcard label doesn't match → NO MATCHStep 4: If all positions match → MATCH!🚨 Common Implementation Mistakes to Avoid:❌ WRONG: Using shell/filesystem wildcardsShell wildcards (like fnmatch, glob, Path.match):
- * matches EVERYTHING including dots
- Would match "*.example.com" to "wrong.host.example.com" ❌
- This is a SECURITY BUG!
❌ WRONG: Using regex wildcards without constraintsRegex .* matches EVERYTHING including dots
- Would match "*.example.com" to "a.b.c.d.example.com" ❌
- Must constrain * to match ONE label only
❌ WRONG: Forgetting to check label countWithout label count check:
- Might incorrectly match multi-level subdomains
- Major security vulnerability!
✅ CORRECT: DNS wildcard matching (RFC 6125)RFC 6125 rules:
- Wildcard replaces exactly ONE label
- Must check label count FIRST
- Compare each label position
More wildcard matching examples:SAN: DNS:*.example.com

✅ Matches: www.example.com (one level - 3 labels match 3 labels)
✅ Matches: api.example.com (one level - 3 labels match 3 labels)
✅ Matches: mail.example.com (one level - 3 labels match 3 labels)
❌ NO match: example.com (wildcard needs subdomain - 2 labels ≠ 3 labels)
❌ NO match: foo.bar.example.com (wildcard only covers 1 level - 4 labels ≠ 3 labels)
❌ NO match: wrong.host.badssl.com (different base domain - 4 labels ≠ 3 labels)
⚠️ CRITICAL: TLD Wildcards Are FORBIDDEN by RFC 6125 ⚠️These wildcards are INVALID and MUST be rejected:❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.com (TLD wildcard)
❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.org (TLD wildcard)
❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.net (TLD wildcard)
❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.co.uk (public suffix wildcard)

Why forbidden?
- One certificate would cover ALL domains under that TLD
- Massive security risk
- Would allow attacker to impersonate any .com domain
- RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3 explicitly prohibits this
Example of the attack TLD wildcards prevent:If *.com was allowed:
1. Attacker gets certificate with SAN: DNS:*.com
2. Certificate would match: google.com, amazon.com, facebook.com, ANY .com domain!
3. ❌ Complete breakdown of trust model!

RFC 6125 prevents this by FORBIDDING wildcards on public suffixes.
⚠️ IMPORTANT: How TLD Wildcards Are Handled (NOT Automatic Fail!)TLD wildcard SANs should be SKIPPED/IGNORED, not cause automatic failure.If certificate has: DNS:*.com, DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
And hostname is: www.example.com

Validation process:
1. Check DNS:*.com
   → Is TLD wildcard? YES
   → Action: SKIP this SAN (don't attempt to match)
   → Continue to next SAN

2. Check DNS:www.example.com
   → Is TLD wildcard? NO
   → Is valid? YES
   → Does hostname match? YES (exact match)
   → Result: ✅ PASS CHECK 7

CHECK 7 PASSES because a valid SAN matched the hostname!
 Treat TLD wildcard SANs like malformed data - ignore them and continue checking other SANs.❌ ONLY TLD wildcard SANs (no valid SANs to check)❌ Has valid SANs, but none match the hostname✅ At least one valid (non-TLD-wildcard) SAN matches the hostnameExample 1: Only TLD wildcard (FAILS)SANs:     DNS:*.com
Hostname: www.example.com
Result:   ❌ FAIL CHECK 7
Reason:   No valid SAN to match against (only TLD wildcard)
Example 2: TLD wildcard + matching valid SAN (PASSES)SANs:     DNS:*.com, DNS:www.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com
Result:   ✅ PASS CHECK 7
Reason:   Valid SAN (www.example.com) matches hostname
Example 3: TLD wildcard + non-matching valid SAN (FAILS)SANs:     DNS:*.com, DNS:api.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com
Result:   ❌ FAIL CHECK 7
Reason:   No valid SAN matches hostname (api ≠ www)
🔗 How to Detect TLD Wildcards Programmatically:To properly validate and reject TLD wildcards, you can retrieve the official list of valid TLDs from IANA:IANA TLD List (Updated Daily):https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt
Example TLD list content:# Version 2026012600, Last Updated Mon Jan 27 07:07:01 2026 UTC

...
TLD list includes both generic TLDs (.com, .org) and country-code TLDs (.uk, .jp)Some TLDs have second-level registrations (.co.uk, .com.au) - also forbiddenFor production code, cache the TLD list and update periodicallyIANA updates this list when new TLDs are addedFigure out how to use this list to detect TLD wildcards in your validator!Certificate SANs: DNS:example.com
User visits: www.example.com
→ ❌ NO MATCH! (www. is a subdomain!)

Certificate SANs: DNS:*.example.com  
User visits: example.com
→ ❌ NO MATCH! (wildcard requires subdomain!)

Certificate SANs: DNS:*.example.com
User visits: foo.bar.example.com
→ ❌ NO MATCH! (wildcard only covers 1 level!)

Certificate SANs: DNS:*.com
User visits: example.com
→ ❌ INVALID! (TLD wildcards FORBIDDEN by RFC 6125!)
Why wildcard matching is used here:SANs contain  for hostnamesOne certificate can cover multiple subdomains is a  that matches many hostnamesBut TLD wildcards would be too dangerous and are forbiddenTest Cases in Challenge That REQUIRE Wildcard Matching:Your validator MUST correctly handle these test certificates to pass CHECK 7:Test 003: Basic Wildcard (MUST PASS)SANs:     DNS:*.example.com, DNS:example.com

 Implement wildcard matching that:✅ Matches single-level subdomains ( matches )❌ Rejects multi-level subdomains ( does NOT match )❌ Rejects base domain ( does NOT match )❌ Rejects TLD wildcards ( is INVALID per RFC 6125)✅ Case-insensitive matching✅ Wildcard only in leftmost label Don't use  - it's for file paths, not hostnames! You need RFC 6125 compliant matching.RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3 - Server Identity Validation (Wildcard Certificates)CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 3.2.2.6 - Wildcard Domain ValidationWhat happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID"
  
  
  🔹 PHASE 3: ACCESS CONTROL

  
  
  ✅ CHECK 8: Basic Constraints (CA:FALSE)
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
    CA:FALSE
Plain English explanation:
This certificate is for a SERVER, NOT a Certificate Authority. = Can sign other certificates (CAs only) = Cannot sign certificates (servers, users)Why this matters - CA impersonation attack:Without CA:FALSE enforcement:
1. Attacker gets valid cert for evil.com
2. Cert has CA:TRUE (mistake!)
3. Attacker signs fake google.com cert
4. Browser trusts it (signed by "valid" CA)
5. ❌ Game over!

With CA:FALSE enforcement:
1. Browser checks: CA:FALSE ✅
2. Cert cannot sign anything
3. Attack prevented ✅
X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical  ← MUST say "critical"!
    CA:FALSE
 CA/Browser Forum Certificate Contents - "If present, the cA field MUST be set false"What happens if it fails:
Certificate could be used to forge other certificates → Reject
  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 9: Key Usage Flags (RSA vs ECDSA Requirements)
 ⚠️ OPTIONAL (Universal in practice - 99%+ have it)What you'll see in good certificates:Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
X509v3 Key Usage: critical
    Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
Public Key Algorithm: id-ecPublicKey  
X509v3 Key Usage: critical
    Digital Signature
Plain English explanation:
Key Usage = What cryptographic operations this public key can perform
  
  
  🔑 Algorithm-Specific Requirements
The requirements differ based on the certificate's signature algorithm:✅  be marked as critical✅  be marked as critical (ECDSA keys cannot encrypt)
  
  
  RSA Key Exchange (TLS 1.2 and earlier)
In traditional RSA key exchange, the server's RSA certificate is used for TWO different operations: Signs the ServerKeyExchange message (DHE) or verifies certificate authenticity Decrypts the pre-master secret that the client encrypts with the server's public RSA keyClient → Server: ClientHello
Server → Client: ServerHello, Certificate (RSA public key)

Client: Generates random pre-master secret
Client: Encrypts pre-master secret with server's RSA public key
Client → Server: Encrypted pre-master secret

Server: Decrypts with private RSA key    ← Needs Key Encipherment!
Both: Derive session keys from pre-master secret
Why RSA needs both flags: The RSA key is used for both signing AND encrypting during the TLS handshake.
  
  
  ECDSA with ECDHE (Modern TLS)
In modern TLS with ECDSA, the certificate is used for  Signs the ServerKeyExchange message containing ECDHE parameters NOT needed - ECDSA keys can only sign, not encryptClient → Server: ClientHello
Server → Client: ServerHello, Certificate (ECDSA public key)

Server: Generates ephemeral ECDHE key pair
Server: Signs ECDHE parameters with ECDSA private key
Server → Client: Signed ECDHE parameters

Client: Verifies signature    ← Only needs Digital Signature!
Client: Generates own ECDHE key pair
Client → Server: Client's ECDHE public key

Both: Compute shared secret via ECDHE (no encryption!)
Both: Derive session keys from shared secret
Why ECDSA only needs Digital Signature:ECDSA keys can only sign, not encryptKey exchange uses ECDHE (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman)The pre-master secret is derived via DH key agreement, not encryptedProvides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
  
  
  ❌ Banned Flags for TLS Server Certificates
These flags should  appear in TLS server certificates:Reserved for CA certificatesEnd-entity cert could sign other certificates! (DigiNotar attack)Could issue fake revocation lists (Non-Repudiation)For legally-binding signaturesUnusual for TLS, adds legal liability If a TLS server certificate has , it can create valid-looking certificates for ANY domain → Complete PKI compromise!

  📖 Why OPTIONAL per Specification
CA/Browser Forum language: "If present, bit positions for keyCertSign and cRLSign MUST NOT be set" "If present" - the extension itself is technically optional 99%+ of real-world TLS certificates include Key Usage (it's universal in practice)IF Key Usage extension is present:
  1. ✅ Must be marked critical
  2. ❌ MUST NOT have Certificate Sign or CRL Sign
  3. ✅ Must have algorithm-appropriate flags:
     - RSA: Digital Signature + Key Encipherment
     - ECDSA: Digital Signature only

IF Key Usage extension is absent:
  → Accept (extension is optional per CA/B Forum)

  
  
  🔒 Why Modern TLS Prefers ECDSA + ECDHE
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): Even if private key stolen later, past sessions remain secure ECDSA P-256 (256-bit) ≈ RSA 3072-bit security ECDSA signing/verification is faster Only needs Digital Signature flag Industry moving from RSA to ECDSA + ECDHE for these security and performance benefits. RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.3 (Key Usage), CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 7.1.2.3What happens if it fails:Missing required flags → Cannot establish TLS connection (cipher suite mismatch)Has Certificate Sign or CRL Sign → REJECT IMMEDIATELY (security catastrophe!)Not marked critical → Reject (violates RFC 5280)Extension absent → Accept (optional per CA/B Forum)
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 10: Extended Key Usage (EKU)
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Web Server Authentication
Plain English explanation:
EKU = What PURPOSE this certificate servesFor TLS server certificates, MUST include:TLS Web Server Authentication (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) ✅CAN also include (for specific use cases):TLS Web Client Authentication (for mTLS - mutual TLS)Other purposes (as long as Server Auth is present)Why this matters - Wrong purpose attack:Purpose Used INSTEAD of Server AuthTLS Web Client Authentication (alone)E-mail Protection (alone)✅ CORRECT - Server Auth WITH other purposes:X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Web Server Authentication
    TLS Web Client Authentication
→ ✅ HAS Server Auth (Client Auth is bonus for mTLS)
❌ WRONG - Client Auth INSTEAD OF Server Auth:X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Web Client Authentication
→ ❌ MISSING Server Auth!

Test 028: Code Signing INSTEAD OF Server Auth → ❌ FAIL
Test 059: Client Auth INSTEAD OF Server Auth → ❌ FAIL
Test 029: Server Auth WITH Client Auth → ✅ PASS
Bitwarden: Server Auth WITH Client Auth → ✅ PASS CA/Browser Forum Certificate Contents - "Either the value id-kp-serverAuth or id-kp-clientAuth or both values MUST be present"What happens if it fails:
Certificate has wrong purpose → Browser rejects
  
  
  🔹 PHASE 4: REVOCATION INFRASTRUCTURE
⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE - Ballot SC63 (Effective March 15, 2024):
The CA/Browser Forum made significant changes to revocation requirements:✅ CRL (Check 11): NOW REQUIRED (was recommended)⚠️ OCSP (Check 13): NOW OPTIONAL (was required)This reversal addresses privacy concerns (OCSP exposes browsing behavior), security issues (plain HTTP), and operational complexity. Short-lived certificates (≤7 days) are exempt from both requirements. CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63 - "Make OCSP optional, require CRLs, and incentivize automation"
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 11: CRL Distribution Points (Certificate Revocation List)
 ✅ REQUIRED (Changed March 15, 2024 via Ballot SC63)What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 CRL Distribution Points:
    URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/ca.crl
    URI:http://crl4.digicert.com/ca.crl
Plain English explanation:
CRL = Certificate Revocation List = List of canceled certificate serial numbers✅ CRL Distribution Points extension MUST be present✅ At least  is required⚠️  for redundancy (but not required)Why multiple URLs are recommended (but not required)? Redundancy!If one CRL server is down, browser can try the backupBest practice: 2+ URLs for high availabilityReality: 70% have 2 URLs, 30% have 1 URL (both valid) Avoid circular dependency:If CRL URL was HTTPS:
1. Need to validate cert for crl.example.com
2. To validate, need to download CRL
3. To download CRL, need to validate cert
4. Infinite loop! 🔄
Without CRL:
1. Private key stolen
2. CA revokes cert
3. Client can't check (no URL)
4. ❌ Accepts revoked cert!

With CRL:
1. Private key stolen
2. CA revokes cert (adds to CRL)
3. Client downloads CRL
4. Finds cert serial in revoked list
5. ✅ Rejects connection!
CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63 (Adopted August 17, 2023, Effective March 15, 2024):: OCSP required, CRL recommended: CRL required, OCSP optional Privacy concerns with OCSP (reveals browsing behavior), operational complexity, and browser failures with OCSP led to this reversal
In 2023, Let's Encrypt announced plans to end OCSP support in favor of CRLs due to:Privacy: OCSP requests expose user browsing behaviorSecurity: OCSP requests sent over plain HTTP can be interceptedComplexity: OCSP requires high-availability serversBrowser behavior: Many browsers ignore OCSP failures anyway Short-lived certificates (≤7 days validity) do NOT require CRL or OCSP.CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63: "Make OCSP optional, require CRLs, and incentivize automation"CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 7.1.2.7.1: "The cRLDistributionPoints extension MUST be present"Wikipedia: "Certificate authorities were previously required by the CA/Browser Forum to provide OCSP service, but this requirement was removed in July 2023"What happens if it fails:
✅ REQUIRED check - certificate will be rejected
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 12: Authority Information Access (AIA)
What you'll see in a good certificate:Option 1: Both OCSP and CA Issuers (most common)Authority Information Access:
    OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
    CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/ca.crt
Option 2: CA Issuers only (Bitwarden, Let's Encrypt pattern)Authority Information Access:
    CA Issuers - URI:http://r12.i.lencr.org/
Plain English explanation:
AIA = Authority Information Access = Where to find more information about the certificate✅ AIA extension MUST be present✅ Must contain at least one access methodWhat can be IN the AIA extension: (recommended): Where to download the issuing CA certificate (optional per SC63): Real-time revocation checking Validates that AIA extension exists Separately validates OCSP URL (which is optional) Have both OCSP + CA Issuers Have only CA Issuers (valid! - Bitwarden, Let's Encrypt) Have only OCSP (valid but not recommended)Why CA Issuers URL matters:Browser has: Server cert
Browser needs: Intermediate cert to validate chain
Problem: Where to get intermediate cert?
→ Connection might fail ❌
Browser has: Server cert
Browser downloads: Intermediate from CA Issuers URL
Browser builds: Complete chain to root
→ Validation succeeds ✅
 CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 7.1.2.7.2: "With the exception of stapling, this extension MUST be present"What the extension can contain:CA Issuers (recommended for chain building)OCSP (optional per SC63 - validated separately in Check 13)What happens if it fails:
Missing AIA extension → Reject (required by CA/B Forum)
  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 13: OCSP URL (Real-Time Revocation Checking)
 ⚠️ OPTIONAL (Changed March 15, 2024 via Ballot SC63)What you'll see in a good certificate:OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
Plain English explanation:
OCSP = Online Certificate Status Protocol = Ask CA "Is this cert still valid?" = Download entire list (slow, big) = Ask about ONE cert (fast, small)CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63 (Adopted August 17, 2023, Effective March 15, 2024):: OCSP required, CRL recommended: CRL required, OCSP optional: OCSP requests expose which sites users visit: OCSP sent over plain HTTP (can be intercepted): Many browsers ignore OCSP failures (fail-open): Requires high-availability infrastructure
Let's Encrypt announced in 2023 they're ending OCSP support in favor of CRLs due to these privacy and operational concerns.Why this matters - Real-time revocation (when present):Timeline with OCSP:

9:00 AM: Private key stolen
9:30 AM: CA revokes cert, OCSP updated
9:31 AM: Client connects
  → OCSP query: "Valid?"
  → OCSP: "Revoked!"
  → ✅ Rejected in 1 minute!

Without OCSP:
Must wait for CRL update (hours/days)

While OCSP is now optional, most CAs still provide it for backward compatibility. However, you may encounter modern certificates without OCSP URLs - this is compliant as long as CRL is present.CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63Wikipedia: "Certificate authorities were previously required by the CA/Browser Forum to provide OCSP service, but this requirement was removed in July 2023"smallstep.com/blog/ocsp-vs-crl-explainedWhat happens if it fails:
No longer a hard failure - certificate can be valid with CRL alone
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 14: Certificate Transparency (Public Audit Trail)
What you'll see in a good certificate:CT Precertificate SCTs:
    Signed Certificate Timestamp (Log 1)
    Signed Certificate Timestamp (Log 2)
Plain English explanation:
CT = Public log of ALL certificates issuedSCT = Signed Certificate Timestamp = Proof cert was logged Redundancy and independenceWhy this matters - Prevents secret certificates:DigiNotar hack (2011):
1. Hackers compromise DigiNotar CA
2. Issue FAKE google.com certificate
3. Use it for espionage (no one knows!)
4. Months pass before discovery
5. ❌ Massive damage done

With Certificate Transparency:
1. CA issues certificate
2. MUST log to public CT log
3. Google monitors logs
4. Sees unauthorized google.com cert
5. ✅ Revokes within hours!
Certificate with 0 SCTs: ❌ Reject (Chrome, Safari)
Certificate with 1 SCT: ❌ Reject (not redundant)
Certificate with 2+ SCTs: ✅ Accept
 Required since April 2018 Required (Apple platforms enforce for all TLS) Required since version 135 (February 2025) Follows Chrome policySigned Certificate Timestamp:
    Version: v1 (0x0)

    Signature: (CA's signature proving it was logged)
RFC 6962: Certificate TransparencyMozilla Firefox 135+ requirement (February 2025)What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED"
  
  
  🔹 PHASE 5: CHAIN VALIDATION

  
  
  ✅ CHECK 15: Not Self-Signed
What you'll see in a good certificate:Issuer:  C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, CN=DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1
Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com
→ Issuer ≠ Subject ✅
Plain English explanation:
Self-signed certificate = Issuer and Subject are the SAME⭐ CRITICAL: CHECK 15 DOES NOT USE WILDCARD MATCHING ⭐This check performs , NOT pattern matching!The  character (if present in a DN) is treated as a , not a wildcard!For publicly-trusted certificates:Issuer MUST be a trusted CAIssuer MUST NOT equal SubjectSelf-signed certificates are only valid for:Root CA certificates (in browser trust stores)Self-signed cert for www.example.com:
Issuer:  CN=www.example.com  ← Claims to sign itself!
Subject: CN=www.example.com

Anyone can create this!
→ ❌ No trust anchor!
→ ❌ Not publicly trusted!
⚠️ NO WILDCARD MATCHING - Distinguished Names are Exact Identifiers!Unlike CHECK 7 (which uses wildcard matching for hostnames), CHECK 15 compares DNs for .Example - These are NOT considered self-signed:Issuer:  CN = *.example.com, O = Example CA
Subject: CN = www.example.com, O = Example Corp
→ NOT self-signed ✅ (CNs differ: "*.example.com" ≠ "www.example.com")
The  is just a literal character in the CN field, NOT a wildcard pattern!Example - These ARE self-signed:Issuer:  CN = *.example.com, O = Example Inc
Subject: CN = *.example.com, O = Example Inc
→ Self-signed ❌ (exact DN match including the "*")
Why NO wildcard matching for CHECK 15:Distinguished Names are , not patterns identifies a specific CA, it's not a patternWildcard matching would create false positives (different entities matching) matches Only:  = ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION WARNING: Field Order Matters!DO NOT use simple string comparison! The Issuer and Subject fields can contain the same values in  but still represent the same Distinguished Name.Example of a self-signed certificate with different field order:Issuer:  C=US, O=Example Corp, OU=Engineering, CN=Test CA
Subject: CN=Test CA, OU=Engineering, O=Example Corp, C=US
 Figure out how to compare DNs correctly regardless of field order. Think about how to normalize or parse the DN components before comparing.Test cases to verify your implementation:# Test 1: Obvious self-signed (same order)
Issuer:  CN=Test CA, O=Example
Subject: CN=Test CA, O=Example
Expected: self-signed ✅

# Test 2: Self-signed (different order) - THE TRICKY ONE!
Issuer:  C=US, O=Example, CN=Test CA
Subject: CN=Test CA, O=Example, C=US
Expected: self-signed ✅ (must handle this!)

# Test 3: Not self-signed (different CN)
Issuer:  C=US, O=DigiCert, CN=DigiCert CA
Subject: C=US, O=Example, CN=www.example.com
Expected: not self-signed ✅

# Test 4: Not self-signed (different order AND different values)
Issuer:  CN=CA Root, O=TrustCorp
Subject: O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com
Expected: not self-signed ✅

# Test 5: Wildcard in DN - NOT self-signed (no wildcard matching!)
Issuer:  CN=*.example.com, O=Example CA
Subject: CN=www.example.com, O=Example CA
Expected: not self-signed ✅ ("*.example.com" ≠ "www.example.com" - exact comparison!)

# Test 6: Wildcard in DN - IS self-signed (exact match with wildcard)
Issuer:  CN=*.example.com, O=Example CA
Subject: CN=*.example.com, O=Example CA
Expected: self-signed ❌ (exact DN match including the "*")
Why this matters in practice:Different certificate authorities and tools format DNs differently: Often uses  order Often uses  order (reverse!) May omit optional fields Custom ordering conventionsYour validator must handle all of these correctly! CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "CAs MUST NOT issue Subscriber Certificates directly from Root CAs"What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 16: Valid Serial Number
What you'll see in a good certificate:Serial Number:
    0a:f7:e7:ca:cf:45:d8:a9:72:ab:47:c5:f8:49:11:da
Plain English explanation:
Every certificate MUST have a unique serial number with sufficient randomness.CA/Browser Forum requirements:✅ At least 64 bits of entropy (8 bytes of randomness)❌  (0x01, 0x02, 0x03...)❌  (timestamp-based)Why this matters - Serial number attacks:EJBCA CA software had a bugGenerated serial numbers with only 63 bits entropy (not 64!)Required revoking over Affected Actalis: 230,000 active certificates EJBCA generated serial numbers with only 63 bits of entropy instead of 64 bits because it incorrectly handled negative values in signed integers.Real-world examples from test suite:Test 040 - Sequential serial (FAIL):Serial Number: 1234 (0x4d2)
→ ❌ Only 11 bits! Predictable!
Test 069 - Weak entropy (FAIL):Serial Number: 4660 (0x1234)
→ ❌ Only 16 bits! Weak PRNG!
Serial Number:
    0a:f7:e7:ca:cf:45:d8:a9:72:ab:47:c5:f8:49:11:da
→ ✅ 128 bits! Excellent entropy!
What happens if it fails:
Weak serial number → Potential collision → CA may need to revoke certificate
  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 17: Subject Key Identifier (SKI) Present
 ⚠️ RECOMMENDED (Not required for end-entity certificates)What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:
    B7:3E:8E:1A:93:0E:2B:86:93:6A:BC:23:5C:55:01:F4:23:6C:45:87
Plain English explanation:
SKI = Hash of the public key = Unique identifier for this certificate's key✅ REQUIRED for CA certificates⚠️ RECOMMENDED (not required) for end-entity certificatesWhy recommended but not required:RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.2:
"For CA certificates, subject key identifiers SHOULD be derived..."
[No MUST requirement for subscriber/end-entity certificates]
99%+ of modern certificates include SKILet's Encrypt community discussion (July 2024) asked if they could remove itThis proves it's technically optionalWhy it's useful (when present):Building certificate chain:
1. Find cert with SKI matching parent's AKI
2. Continue until reaching root
→ Faster chain building
SKI = SHA-1 hash of the public key
→ Uniquely identifies this key
OpenSSL GitHub Issue #13603: "SKID with the exception of non-CA certs"Let's Encrypt community discussion (July 2024)What happens if it fails:
If absent → May still accept (recommended but not required)
If present → Must be properly formatted
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 18: Authority Key Identifier (AKI) Present
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
    13:92:C7:15:88:71:4D:F8:F4:32:45:E6:67:8B:A2:1C:65:43:B1:2D
Plain English explanation:
AKI = Hash of the ISSUING CA's public key = Links child cert to parent certSection 4.2.1.1:
"The keyIdentifier field of the authorityKeyIdentifier extension 
MUST be included in all certificates generated by conforming CAs"
 Self-signed certificates MAY omit AKI (since AKI would equal SKI)Why this matters - Chain building:Certificate chain validation:
1. Server cert has AKI: 13:92:C7:...
2. Find intermediate cert with SKI: 13:92:C7:...
3. Match! This is the parent ✅
4. Repeat until reaching root
1. Server cert (no AKI)
2. Which intermediate signed it?
3. Try all intermediates? Slow!
4. Might fail to build chain ❌
Server cert AKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
   ↓ MUST MATCH
Intermediate SKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
 RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.1 - "MUST be included in all certificates generated by conforming CAs to facilitate certification path construction"What happens if it fails:
Missing AKI → Cannot build certificate chain → Reject
  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 19: SKI ≠ AKI (Not Self-Signed Detector)
 ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Only applies if both SKI and AKI are present)What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:
    B7:3E:8E:1A:93:0E:2B:86:93:6A:BC:23:5C:55:01:F4:23:6C:45:87

X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
    13:92:C7:15:88:71:4D:F8:F4:32:45:E6:67:8B:A2:1C:65:43:B1:2D

→ B7:3E... ≠ 13:92... ✅ Different! Not self-signed!
Plain English explanation:
If SKI (this cert's key) equals AKI (issuer's key), then certificate is self-signed.For publicly-trusted certificates:SKI and AKI MUST be differentSKI = AKI means self-signed (not allowed)
Since Check 17 (SKI) is RECOMMENDED (not required), this check only applies when BOTH SKI and AKI are present.Self-signed certificate:
  SKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
  AKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
  → Same! Self-signed! ❌

Valid certificate:
  SKI: B7:3E:8E:1A:93:0E...
  AKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
  → Different! Has parent CA ✅
 If both SKI and AKI are present, compare them. If they're equal, it's self-signed (FAIL). If different, it has a separate issuer (PASS). If either is missing, rely on CHECK 15. RFC 5280 logic for self-signed certificatesWhat happens if it fails:
If SKI == AKI → Self-signed certificate → Reject (covered by Check 15)
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 20: Certificate Validity Period ≤ 398 Days
What you'll see in a good certificate:Validity
    Not Before: Dec  1 00:00:00 2025 GMT
    Not After : Feb 28 23:59:59 2026 GMT
→ Duration: 89 days ✅ (under 398 days)
Plain English explanation:
Certificates issued after September 1, 2020 CANNOT be valid for more than 398 days (~13 months).Pre-2015: Up to 5 years allowed2015-2018: Max 39 months (825 days)2018-2020: Max 27 months (825 days)
Sept 2020-Present: Max 398 days (CA/B Forum Ballot SC-081)Longer validity = More risk:

5-year certificate (2015):
- Year 1: RSA-2048 is "safe"
- Year 3: New attacks discovered
- Year 5: RSA-2048 possibly broken
- Problem: Cert still valid! ❌

90-day certificate (2025):
- Renewed every 90 days
- Can upgrade to stronger algorithms
- Can fix validation errors quickly
- Limited exposure window ✅
Today to March 15, 2026: Max 398 days
March 15, 2026: Max 200 days
March 15, 2027: Max 100 days
March 15, 2029: Max 47 days
 Parse the Not Before and Not After dates, calculate the difference in days, and check if it exceeds 398 days.CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC22 (effective September 1, 2020)CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC-081 (approved April 2025, reducing to 47 days by 2029)What happens if it fails:
Certificate validity too long → Browsers reject as non-compliant

Now let's learn how to fix race conditions.Go provides tools like  to fix race conditions.You can check with this implementation Link: concurrencyThis concept is called mutual exclusion where only one goroutine can access the shared data at a time which will be locked and unlocked after the operation is completed.That means if one goroutine need to access the shared data they need to first lock the data and then perform the read operation, after they can do operation with the data, and once it is done, the write operation is completed, then they will unlock the shared data.As, there is lock and unlock, it will ensure only one goroutine updates counter at a time.Currently we just solved the simple race condition, but in real application, there will be very complex race conditions.To find these and solve will be very complex.So, I suggest you to just use go race detector to find race conditions.Similar to dining philosophers problem where philosophers are fighting over shared forks (data). So, We learned why go routines are not thread safe, how they act under cercumstances, how they can be detected and how to fix it.In next series, I will explain concepts of go and how to use it to build concurrent programs.I’ve been building for .A collection of UI/UX-focused tools crafted to simplify workflows, save time, and reduce friction when searching for tools and materials.Any feedback or contributions are welcome!It’s online, open-source, and ready for anyone to use.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Ultimate Guide to Buying Old Yahoo accounts | Articles</title><link>https://dev.to/marysamckinneytgmxl/the-ultimate-guide-to-buying-old-yahoo-accounts-articles-2nk0</link><author>marysamckin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 18:39:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s digital landscape, having a reliable email account is more crucial than ever.

We train interactive avatar video models. Our API lets you upload a photo and immediately jump into a FaceTime-style call with that character. Here's a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9Chatbots are everywhere and voice AI has taken off, but we believe video avatars will be the most common form factor for conversational AI. Most people would rather watch something than read it. The problem is that generating video in real-time is hard, and overcoming the uncanny valley is even harder.We haven’t broken the uncanny valley yet. Nobody has. But we’re getting close and our photorealistic avatars are currently best-in-class (judge for yourself: https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor). Plus, we're the only avatar model that can do animals and heavily stylized cartoons. Try it: https://lemonslice.com/try/alien. Warning! Talking to this little guy may improve your mood.Today we're releasing our new model* - Lemon Slice 2, a 20B-parameter diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length video at 20fps on a single GPU - and opening up our API.How did we get a video diffusion model to run in real-time? There was no single trick, just a lot of them stacked together. The first big change was making our model causal. Standard video diffusion models are bidirectional (they look at frames both before and after the current one), which means you can't stream.From there it was about fitting everything on one GPU. We switched from full to sliding window attention, which killed our memory bottleneck. We distilled from 40 denoising steps down to just a few - quality degraded less than we feared, especially after using GAN-based distillation (though tuning that adversarial loss to avoid mode collapse was its own adventure).And the rest was inference work: modifying RoPE from complex to real (this one was cool!), precision tuning, fusing kernels, a special rolling KV cache, lots of other caching, and more. We kept shaving off milliseconds wherever we could and eventually got to real-time.We set up a guest playground for HN so you can create and talk to characters without logging in: https://lemonslice.com/hn. For those who want to build with our API (we have a new LiveKit integration that we’re pumped about!), grab a coupon code in the HN playground for your first Pro month free ($100 value). See the docs: https://lemonslice.com/docs. Pricing is usage-based at $0.12-0.20/min for video generation.Looking forward to your feedback!EDIT: Tell us what characters you want to see in the comments and we can make them for you to talk to (e.g. Max Headroom)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Words to Meaning: Core NLP Concepts Every Beginner Must Know</title><link>https://dev.to/zeroshotanu/from-words-to-meaning-core-nlp-concepts-every-beginner-must-know-3hl3</link><author>Ananya S</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:48:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the previous post, we covered the basics of NLP such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop words.In this continuation, we will understand how machines extract meaning from text and represent language numerically.1.

Today we will create a QR Code Generator from scratch with Python!We will use KivyMD a library that makes python app looks like a modern Android or iOS app using Material Design.QR codes are Quick response code are one of the easiest and fastest way to share any information  with other people, we see Qr codes in most of around us  we see in restaurants, railway tickets, doing payments.It is standard python apps can look a bit “old school”. KivyMD gives us beautiful text fields, buttons, and layouts with very little code.Before we start, we need to install two main tools: for user interface. to create the actual QR patterns.
  
  
  Step 1: Install the Requirements
Run this code in terminal or command promptpip install kivymd qrcode pillow
  
  
  Step 2: Import the Libraries
Create a new file named QRGeneratorApp.py and start by importing the necessary tools.from kivymd.app import MDApp
from kivy.lang import Builder
from kivy.core.image import Image as CoreImage
import qrcodefrom io 
import BytesIOimport os

## Step 3: Design the UI (The KV String)We use the KV Language to design the app. This is a declarative way to build the interface. We need a text field for input, two buttons (Generate and Download), and an image area to show the result.KV = '''
MDScreen:
    md_bg_color: app.theme_cls.bg_light

    MDBoxLayout:
        orientation: 'vertical'
        spacing: "20dp"
        padding: "20dp"
        adaptive_height: True
        pos_hint: {"center_x": .5, "center_y": .5}

        MDLabel:
            text: "QR Code Generator"
            halign: "center"
            font_style: "H4"
            bold: True
            theme_text_color: "Primary"

        MDTextField:
            id: user_input

Step 4: Create the App LogicTo reuse the button clicks, we'll have to make a class in Python that will allow the stoner to perform certain tasks through buttons and will interact with the illustration operation we are erecting, which utilizes the Kivy Framework to give a means for druggies to produce QR canons from their entries. Once a stoner clicks the Generate button, Kivy will take the textbook that was written in the Text Input contrivance and produce QR law( s). Kivy will also give the druggies with QR canons via the illustration operation's GUI.The button labeled Download will not change color until at least one QR code has been generated through the click of the Generate button. Once QR code(s) have been created by clicking the Generate button one or more times the Download button will allow users to save the QR code generated(s) in PNG format to their current working folder.class QRGeneratorApp(MDApp):
    current_qr_img = None  # To store the image in memory

    def build(self):
        self.theme_cls.primary_palette = "DeepPurple"
        return Builder.load_string(KV)

    def generate_qr(self, data):
        if not data.strip():
            return

        # 1. Create the QR object
        qr = qrcode.QRCode(version=1, box_size=10, border=2)
        qr.add_data(data)
        qr.make(fit=True)

        # 2. Store as PIL image
        self.current_qr_img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")

        # 3. Convert to Kivy Texture for the UI
        buffer = BytesIO()
        self.current_qr_img.save(buffer, format='PNG')
        buffer.seek(0)
        core_img = CoreImage(buffer, ext='png')
        self.root.ids.qr_display.texture = core_img.texture

        # 4. Enable Download Button
        self.root.ids.download_btn.disabled = False

    def download_qr(self):
        if self.current_qr_img:
            file_name = "my_qr_code.png"
            self.current_qr_img.save(file_name)
            print(f"Saved successfully as {file_name}")

Pushpay’s church management system provides church administrators and ministry leaders with insight-driven reporting, donor development dashboards, and automation of financial workflows.Using the power of generative AI, Pushpay developed an innovative agentic AI search feature built for the unique needs of ministries. The approach uses natural language processing so ministry staff can ask questions in plain English and generate real-time, actionable insights from their community data. The AI search feature addresses a critical challenge faced by ministry leaders: the need for quick access to community insights without requiring technical expertise. For example, ministry leaders can enter “show me people who are members in a group, but haven’t given this year” or “show me people who are not engaged in my church,” and use the results to take meaningful action to better support individuals in their community. Most community leaders are time-constrained and lack technical backgrounds; they can use this solution to obtain meaningful data about their congregations in seconds using natural language queries.By empowering ministry staff with faster access to community insights, the AI search feature supports Pushpay’s mission to encourage generosity and connection between churches and their community members. Early adoption users report that this solution has shortened their time to insights from minutes to seconds. To achieve this result, the Pushpay team built the feature using agentic AI capabilities on Amazon Web Services (AWS) while implementing robust quality assurance measures and establishing a rapid iterative feedback loop for continuous improvements.In this post, we walk you through Pushpay’s journey in building this solution and explore how Pushpay used Amazon Bedrock to create a custom generative AI evaluation framework for continuous quality assurance and establishing rapid iteration feedback loops on AWS.Solution overview: AI powered search architectureThe solution consists of several key components that work together to deliver an enhanced search experience. The following figure shows the solution architecture diagram and the overall workflow.Figure 1: AI Search Solution Architecture The solution begins with Pushpay users submitting natural language queries through the existing Pushpay application interface. By using natural language queries, church ministry staff can obtain data insights using AI capabilities without learning new tools or interfaces. At the heart of the system lies the AI search agent, which consists of two key components: 
  : Contains the large language model (LLM) role definitions, instructions, and application descriptions that guide the agent’s behavior.Dynamic prompt constructor (DPC): automatically constructs additional customized system prompts based on the user specific information, such as church context, sample queries, and application filter inventory. They also use semantic search to select only relevant filters among hundreds of available application filters. The DPC improves response accuracy and user experience.Amazon Bedrock advanced feature: The solution uses the following Amazon Bedrock managed services: 
  : Reduces latency and costs by caching frequently used system prompt.: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to process prompts and generate JSON output required by the application to display the desired query results as insights to users.The evaluation system implements a closed-loop improvement solution where user interactions are instrumented, captured and evaluated offline. The evaluation results feed into a dashboard for product and engineering teams to analyze and drive iterative improvements to the AI search agent. During this process, the data science team collects a golden dataset and continuously curates this dataset based on the actual user queries coupled with validated responses.The challenges of initial solution without evaluationTo create the AI search feature, Pushpay developed the first iteration of the AI search agent. The solution implements a single agent configured with a carefully tuned system prompt that includes the system role, instructions, and how the user interface works with detailed explanation of each filter tool and their sub-settings. The system prompt is cached using Amazon Bedrock prompt caching to reduce token cost and latency. The agent uses the system prompt to invoke an Amazon Bedrock LLM which generates the JSON document that Pushpay’s application uses to apply filters and present query results to users.However, this first iteration quickly revealed some limitations. While it demonstrated a 60-70% success rate with basic business queries, the team reached an accuracy plateau. The evaluation of the agent was a manual and tedious process Tuning the system prompt beyond this accuracy threshold proved challenging given the diverse spectrum of user queries and the application’s coverage of over 100 distinct configurable filters. These presented critical blockers for the team’s path to production. Figure 2: AI Search First SolutionImproving the solution by adding a custom generative AI evaluation frameworkTo address the challenges of measuring and improving agent accuracy, the team implemented a generative AI evaluation framework integrated into the existing architecture, shown in the following figure. This framework consists of four key components that work together to provide comprehensive performance insights and enable data-driven improvements.Figure 3: Introducing the GenAI Evaluation FrameworkA curated golden dataset containing over 300 representative queries, each paired with its corresponding expected output, forms the foundation of automated evaluation. The product and data science teams carefully developed and validated this dataset to achieve comprehensive coverage of real-world use cases and edge cases. Additionally, there is a continuous curation process of adding representative actual user queries with validated results. The evaluator component processes user input queries and compares the agent-generated output against the golden dataset using the LLM as a judge pattern This approach generates core accuracy metrics while capturing detailed logs and performance data, such as latency, for further analysis and debugging.: Domain categories are developed using a combination of generative AI domain summarization and human-defined regular expressions to effectively categorize user queries. The evaluator determines the domain category for each query, enabling nuanced, category-based evaluation as an additional dimension of evaluation metrics.Generative AI evaluation dashboard: The dashboard serves as the mission control for Pushpay’s product and engineering teams, displaying domain category-level metrics to assess performance and latency and guide decisions. It shifts the team from single aggregate scores to nuanced, domain-based performance insights.The accuracy dashboard: Pinpointing weaknesses by domainBecause user queries are categorized into domain categories, the dashboard incorporates statistical confidence visualization using a 95% Wilson score interval to display accuracy metrics and query volumes at each domain level. By using categories, the team can pinpoint the AI agent’s weaknesses by domain. In the following example , the “activity” domain shows significantly lower accuracy than other categories.Figure 4: Pinpointing Agent Weaknesses by DomainAdditionally, a performance dashboard, shown in the following figure, visualizes latency indicators at the domain category level, including latency distributions from p50 to p90 percentiles. In the following example, the activity domain exhibits notably higher latency than others.Figure 5: Identifying Latency Bottlenecks by DomainStrategic rollout through domain-Level insightsDomain-based metrics revealed varying performance levels across semantic domains, providing crucial insights into agent effectiveness. Pushpay used this granular visibility to make strategic feature rollout decisions. By temporarily suppressing underperforming categories—such as activity queries—while undergoing optimization, the system achieved 95% overall accuracy. By using this approach, users experienced only the highest-performing features while the team refined others to production standards.Figure 6: Achieving 95% Accuracy with Domain-Level Feature RolloutStrategic prioritization: Focusing on high-impact domainsTo prioritize improvements systematically, Pushpay employed a 2×2 matrix framework plotting topics against two dimensions (shown in the following figure): Business priority (vertical axis) and current performance or feasibility (horizontal axis). This visualization placed topics with both high business value and strong existing performance in the top-right quadrant. The team then focused on these areas because they required less heavy lifting to achieve further accuracy improvement from already-good levels to an exceptional 95% accuracy for the business focused topics.The implementation followed an iterative cycle: after each round of enhancements, they re-analyze the results to identify the next set of high-potential topics. This systematic, cyclical approach enabled continuous optimization while maintaining focus on business-critical areas.Figure 7: Strategic Prioritization Framework for Domain Category OptimizationDynamic prompt constructionThe insights gained from the evaluation framework led to an architectural enhancement: the introduction of a dynamic prompt constructor. This component enabled rapid iterative improvements by allowing fine-grained control over which domain categories the agent could address. The structured field inventory – previously embedded in the system prompt – was transformed into a dynamic element, using semantic search to construct contextually relevant prompts for each user query. This approach tailors the prompt filter inventory based on three key contextual dimensions: query content, user persona, and tenant-specific requirements. The result is a more precise and efficient system that generates highly relevant responses while maintaining the flexibility needed for continuous optimization.The generative AI evaluation framework became the cornerstone of Pushpay’s AI feature development, delivering measurable value across three dimensions:: The AI search feature reduced time-to-insight from approximately 120 seconds (experienced users manually navigating complex UX) to under 4 seconds – a 15-fold acceleration that directly helps enhance ministry leaders’ productivity and decision-making speed. This feature democratized data insights, so that users of different technical levels can access meaningful intelligence without requiring specialized expertise.: The scientific evaluation approach transformed optimization cycles. Rather than debating prompt modifications, the team now validates changes and measures domain-specific impacts within minutes, replacing prolonged deliberations with data-driven iteration.: Improvements from 60–70% accuracy to more than 95% accuracy using high-performance domains provided the quantitative confidence required for customer-facing deployment, while the framework’s architecture enables continuous refinement across other domain categories.Key takeaways for your AI agent journeyThe following are key takeaways from Pushpay’s experience that you can use in your own AI agent journey.1/ Build with production in mind from day oneBuilding agentic AI systems is straightforward, but scaling them to production is challenging. Developers should adopt a scaling mindset during the proof-of-concept phase, not after. Implementing robust tracing and evaluation frameworks early, provides a clear pathway from experimentation to production. By using this method, teams can identify and address accuracy issues systematically before they become blockers.2/ Take advantage of the advanced features of Amazon BedrockAmazon Bedrock prompt caching significantly reduces token costs and latency by caching frequently used system prompts. For agents with large, stable system prompts, this feature is essential for production-grade performance.3/ Think beyond aggregate metricsAggregate accuracy scores can sometimes mask critical performance variations. By evaluating agent performance at the domain category level, Pushpay uncovered weaknesses beyond what a single accuracy metric can capture. This granular approach enables targeted optimization and informed rollout decisions, making sure users only experience high-performing features while others are refined.4/ Data security and responsible AIWhen developing agentic AI systems, consider information protection and LLM security considerations from the outset, following the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, because security requirements fundamentally impact the architectural design. Pushpay’s customers are churches and faith-based organizations who are stewards of sensitive information—including pastoral care conversations, financial giving patterns, family struggles, prayer requests and more. In this implementation example, Pushpay set a clear approach to incorporating AI ethically within its product ecosystem, maintaining strict security standards to ensure church data and personally identifiable information (PII) remains within its secure partnership ecosystem. Data is shared only with secure and appropriate data protections applied and is never used to train external models.

The key breakthrough wasn’t in the AI technology itself, but in implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework built on strong observability foundation that provided granular visibility into agent performance across different domains. This systematic approach enabled rapid iteration, strategic rollout decisions, and continuous improvement.Ready to build your own production-ready AI agent?Build your golden dataset: Start curating representative queries and expected outputs for your specific use case is a Senior Solution Architect at AWS.

As a developer who thrives on squeezing every drop of performance and architectural elegance out of my code, the recent cadence of Go releases has been nothing short of exhilarating. We're not just getting incremental fixes; we're seeing foundational shifts and mature refinements that are genuinely reshaping how we build robust, high-performance systems. Forget the marketing fluff; let's dive deep into the technical trenches and examine what Go 1.21, 1.22, and the foundational elements of 1.23 bring to the table. I've been running these versions through their paces, and the practical implications are significant.
  
  
  Generics: The Journey from Novelty to Necessity (Go 1.21 & 1.22)
Two years into their official release with Go 1.18, generics are no longer a "new" feature but a rapidly maturing cornerstone of the language. Go 1.21 and 1.22 have brought crucial enhancements, particularly around type inference and the standard library's embrace of generic patterns, making them significantly more ergonomic and powerful. This is genuinely impressive because the initial generic implementation, while functional, sometimes felt a little verbose. While Go focuses on runtime efficiency, other ecosystems are seeing similar shifts; for instance, Rust JS Tooling 2025 shows how performance-first languages are taking over the frontend toolchain.Go 1.21 delivered a substantial leap in the power and precision of type inference. The compiler can now infer type arguments for generic functions even when those arguments are themselves generic functions, or when generic functions are assigned to variables or returned as results. This means less explicit type instantiation, leading to cleaner, more idiomatic generic code. For instance, when working with the new  or  packages, the compiler often deduces the types you intend, reducing boilerplate.Consider the  package, a standout addition in Go 1.21. It offers a suite of common operations like , , , and , all generic. Before, you'd either write custom loops or use  with runtime type assertions, sacrificing type safety or clarity. Now, these operations are both type-safe and efficient.The , , and  built-in functions introduced in Go 1.21 are also a welcome quality-of-life improvement, especially  for maps and slices, eliminating common boilerplate loops for resetting data structures. While seemingly minor, these additions streamline everyday coding patterns significantly. The  package in Go 1.22 further embraces generics with a new  function, allowing random number generation for any integer type.
  
  
  Expert Insight: The Generics Performance Frontier
While generics bring undeniable expressiveness and type safety, a common question I get is about their performance overhead. My observation, backed by community benchmarks, is that the Go compiler's instantiation model is remarkably efficient. For types that fit the "shape" of a generic function (e.g., all  types, all  types), the compiler often generates a single, optimized code instance. However, for types that require unique code generation (e.g., struct types with different memory layouts), it might generate separate instances, leading to increased binary size. The  constraint, while flexible, can sometimes prevent the most aggressive optimizations, pushing more work to runtime interface calls. My prediction is that future compiler work will focus on even smarter specialization heuristics, potentially leveraging PGO data to identify hot generic code paths that warrant dedicated, optimized implementations, even for distinct type instantiations. Developers should be mindful of the  constraint and use more specific type parameters (, , or custom interfaces) when possible to give the compiler more opportunities for optimization.
  
  
  Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO): Unlocking Latent Performance (Go 1.21 & 1.22)
This is where things get truly exciting for performance enthusiasts. Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO), introduced as a preview in Go 1.20 and made generally available in Go 1.21, has matured into a robust, practical tool for significant performance gains. Go 1.22 further refines it, delivering even greater benefits.PGO fundamentally shifts the optimization strategy. Instead of relying purely on static analysis, the compiler now uses runtime profiles collected from actual workloads to make informed optimization decisions. This is not magic, but a pragmatic approach: your program runs, it generates a profile of its "hot" code paths, and then the compiler uses that profile to rebuild a more efficient binary.The workflow is straightforward:Build an initial binary (without PGO): This is your baseline, often from a recent production build.Collect profiles from production/representative workloads: Use  or  to gather CPU profiles. The key here is ; a profile from a trivial test might not yield optimal results for a complex production system. Save the collected CPU profile as  in your main package's directory. The  command, starting with Go 1.21, will automatically detect  and enable PGO if you use  (which is the default behavior if a  file is present).The impact is substantial. Go 1.21 saw programs from a representative set achieve 2-7% performance improvements. Go 1.22 pushed this further, with gains ranging from 2-14%. These improvements stem from PGO's ability to:Devirtualize interface method calls: The compiler can replace dynamic interface dispatches with direct, static calls to the most common concrete type methods, enabling further optimizations like inlining.More aggressive inlining: Functions identified as "hot" in the profile are more aggressively inlined, reducing function call overhead. Go 1.22 even introduced a preview () of an enhanced inliner that uses heuristics to boost inlinability at "important" call sites (e.g., within loops) and discourage it in less critical areas (e.g., panic paths).The compiler itself benefits; Go 1.21 saw build speeds improve by up to 6% because the compiler was built with PGO. This is a sturdy, practical performance boost that requires minimal effort for significant returns.
  
  
  Concurrency Reinvented: Loop Variables and Enhanced Tracing (Go 1.22)
Concurrency is Go's bread and butter, and Go 1.22 delivered a truly significant, long-awaited language change that impacts concurrent programming directly: the resolution of the "for loop variable capture" issue. I've been waiting for this, and it's a huge win for preventing subtle but pervasive bugs.Previously, variables declared by a  loop were created once and updated by each iteration. This meant that goroutines launched within a loop, if they captured the loop variable directly, would often all end up referencing the  value of the variable after the loop completed, leading to unexpected and hard-to-debug behavior.This change in Go 1.22 ensures that each iteration of a  loop creates new variables, fundamentally eliminating this common source of bugs in concurrent scenarios. While a  setting can revert to the old behavior for compatibility, the new default is a significant step forward for writing safer concurrent code.Beyond this, Go 1.22 also brought a complete overhaul of the execution tracer. The new tracer uses the operating system's clock on most platforms (excluding Windows), allowing for better correlation with external system traces. It's more efficient, with substantially reduced CPU costs for trace collection, and produces streamable, partitioned traces. The  package also received updates, with new histogram metrics providing more granular details about stop-the-world pauses (/sched/pauses/stopping/gc:seconds, /sched/pauses/total/gc:seconds, etc.) and mutex profiles now scaling contention by the number of goroutines blocked, giving a much more accurate picture of bottlenecks. This is invaluable for pinpointing and addressing performance hot spots in highly concurrent applications.
  
  
  Standard Library and Runtime Power-Ups (Go 1.21 & 1.22)
The standard library continues to evolve, with Go 1.21 and 1.22 bringing a slew of practical additions and performance tweaks that enhance developer productivity and application efficiency.Go 1.21 introduced the much-anticipated  package for structured logging. This is a significant improvement over the basic  package, providing a standardized, performant way to emit key-value pairs, which is critical for modern observability and log analysis tools. When working with structured logs in , you might find yourself dealing with complex outputs; you can use this JSON Formatter to verify your structure and ensure your logs are parseable. The  package supports different log levels and handlers, allowing for flexible integration into various logging infrastructures.The  package, a cornerstone of Go concurrency, saw new functions in Go 1.21:  and . These allow you to specify a "cause" for context cancellation when a deadline or timer expires, which can then be retrieved with the  function. This adds valuable debugging context for complex cancellation flows. Additionally,  registers a function to run  a context has been canceled, providing a clean way to perform cleanup or reactive tasks. The  package also gained , , and  in Go 1.21, simplifying patterns for lazy initialization.Go 1.22's  received a substantial upgrade, now supporting enhanced routing patterns with HTTP methods and wildcards. This means you can define routes like  or , making the standard library's router much more capable for building RESTful APIs without needing external frameworks. The  method allows easy access to the wildcard values. This is a welcome change for simplifying API design directly within the standard library.Other notable improvements include  for easy slice concatenation and the zeroing of elements between the new and old length when shrinking slices. The  package types (base32, base64, hex) gained  and  methods, streamlining buffer management. On Windows,  now batches directory entries, improving performance by up to 30%, and  can leverage  and  on Linux where applicable, reducing data copies.
  
  
  Memory Management and GC Evolution (Go 1.21 & 1.22)
The Go garbage collector (GC) is a silent workhorse, and recent releases have continued to refine its efficiency and predictability. The ongoing goal is to minimize pause times and memory overhead, allowing Go applications to run smoothly even under heavy load.Go 1.21 brought several runtime improvements to memory management. On Linux, the runtime now manages transparent huge pages more explicitly, leading to better memory utilization. Small heaps might see less memory used (up to 50% in pathological cases), while large heaps could experience improved CPU usage and latency due to fewer broken huge pages. Crucially, Go 1.21's runtime-internal GC tuning resulted in up to a 40% reduction in application tail latency for some applications. While some might observe a small loss in throughput, this trade-off is often acceptable for latency-sensitive services, and can be adjusted with  or .Go 1.22 continued this trend by keeping type-based garbage collection metadata nearer to each heap object. This seemingly minor change yields tangible benefits: CPU performance (latency or throughput) improves by 1-3%, and memory overhead is reduced by approximately 1% due to deduplicating redundant metadata. While this does mean some objects might shift alignment from 16-byte to 8-byte boundaries, potentially affecting rare assembly-optimized code, the overall benefit for the vast majority of Go programs is a more efficient runtime.The  environment variable, while not new to these specific versions, continues to be a powerful tool for controlling memory usage. It allows developers to specify a soft memory limit for the Go heap, enabling the GC to be more aggressive when approaching this limit. This is particularly useful in containerized environments where memory is a constrained resource, preventing OOM kills by giving the GC a clear target.
  
  
  Toolchain and Developer Experience (Go 1.21 & 1.22)
Beyond runtime and language features, the developer experience and toolchain are paramount. Go 1.21 and 1.22 have made important strides here, especially in compatibility and static analysis.Go 1.21 formalized the use of the  environment variable for controlling behavioral changes, allowing programs to opt into older (or newer) behaviors based on the  line in  or . This means you can upgrade your Go toolchain to the latest version for security and performance benefits, while still ensuring your older modules behave as expected. It also made the  line a strict minimum requirement, providing clearer error messages when a project requires a newer Go version. The  command can now even invoke other Go toolchain versions found in your  or downloaded on demand, simplifying management of projects with diverse Go version requirements.The  tool, our trusty static analyzer, received crucial updates in Go 1.22. It now correctly analyzes code with the new per-iteration  loop variables, no longer reporting false positives for loop variable capture within function literals. This is a testament to the toolchain keeping pace with language changes. Additionally,  now warns about  calls with no values (a common mistake), non-deferred  calls within  statements (another common subtle bug), and mismatched key-value pairs in  calls. These are practical, everyday improvements that help catch subtle errors before they hit runtime.Finally,  in Go 1.22 provides a cleaner, type-safe way to obtain a  value for a given type , replacing the slightly awkward reflect.TypeOf((*T)(nil)).Elem() pattern. This is a small but welcome ergonomic improvement for those working with reflection.
  
  
  Reality Check: The Unpolished Edges (Go 1.23 and beyond)
While the recent Go updates are a triumph of practical engineering, it's essential to maintain a "reality check." Not everything is perfectly polished, and some areas are still works in progress.Generics, while powerful, still have their limitations. As noted by community discussions, Go's generics design, while solid, doesn't solve  problems. For instance, you can't currently have a type constraint that expresses a union of arbitrary types  a method set (e.g., "either  or has a  method"). You have to pick one. This can lead to some awkward workarounds or force a return to  in complex scenarios. Furthermore, while tooling is improving, some older linters and static analysis tools might still struggle with heavily generic code, occasionally producing inaccurate warnings or failing to understand type flows. Stack traces from panics in generic code can also sometimes be harder to decipher than those from non-generic code, though this is an area of ongoing improvement.Upgrades, while generally smooth, are not entirely "free." As an article discussing Go 1.23 migration highlighted, even with Go's strong compatibility guarantees, minor version upgrades can introduce "unexpected performance regressions or subtle behavioral changes" that might not be caught in basic testing. The language stays compatible, but the runtime, compiler, and standard library implementations shift underneath, potentially affecting performance characteristics or uncovering latent bugs in existing code. This underscores the importance of thorough benchmarking and testing, especially for performance-critical components, after  Go upgrade.Experimental features, while exciting, are still experimental. Features like  for advanced inlining heuristics or  for range-over-function iterators (a preview in Go 1.22) are powerful glimpses into the future. However, they come with the implicit warning that their behavior, API, or even existence might change in subsequent releases. Relying on them in production without careful consideration and mitigation strategies is a risk.Go 1.23, based on available information, seems to be a version focused more on internal optimizations and bug fixes, laying groundwork for future major features. While this might seem less glamorous, these foundational improvements are crucial for long-term stability and continued performance gains, especially in areas like the runtime and garbage collector.The recent Go releases, particularly 1.21 and 1.22, demonstrate a language and ecosystem in a state of robust, thoughtful evolution. Generics have matured into a practical, powerful tool, enhanced by significant type inference improvements and their integration into the standard library. Profile-Guided Optimization is a game-changer for real-world performance, offering tangible speedups with minimal effort. And the resolution of the  loop variable capture bug in Go 1.22 is a monumental win for concurrent programming safety.As Go developers, we're navigating a landscape where the language is becoming more expressive, more performant, and safer by default. The journey isn't over, and there are always rough edges to smooth out, but the trajectory is undeniably positive. These aren't just features; they're practical, sturdy tools that empower us to build more efficient, reliable, and maintainable software. I'm genuinely excited to see what the next iterations bring, building on this incredibly strong foundation.This article was published by the **DataFormatHub Editorial Team, a group of developers and data enthusiasts dedicated to making data transformation accessible and private.

Have you ever wondered why some influencers seem to “pop up” out of nowhere with massive followings? Often, the secret is acquiring a pre-existing channel. This shortcut transforms your digital journey from a slow crawl into a high-speed race. Let’s look at the specific advantages:Instant Audience 
The hardest part of YouTube is getting those first 1,000 subscribers. When you buy a channel, that community is already there. You start with a “warm” audience rather than a cold start.Enhanced Credibility 
Social proof is everything. A channel with thousands of subscribers looks like an authority. New viewers are far more likely to click “Subscribe” if they see that others have already done so.Monetization Opportunities 
Getting approved for the YouTube Partner Program requires 4,000 watch hours and 1,000 subscribers. Purchasing an established channel can put you on the fast track to earning ad revenue from day one.Algorithm Advantage 
The YouTube algorithm likes history. An older, active channel is often treated better by the recommendation engine than a brand-new account with no data.Content Testing 
With an existing audience, you get immediate data. You can A/B test different video styles and get feedback in hours instead of weeks, allowing you to pivot your strategy with precision.Networking and Collaborations 
Big creators rarely collaborate with “zero-sub” channels. An established subscriber count acts as your resume, opening doors to partnerships and sponsorships that would otherwise be closed.Time and Effort Savings 
Time is your most valuable asset. By skipping the grind of the first 12 months of channel growth, you can dedicate your energy to high-quality production and business scaling.Is Buying a YouTube Channel Legal?
Legally speaking, there are no laws prohibiting the sale of a social media account. However, it is important to be transparent: this practice often goes against YouTube’s specific Terms of Service regarding account transfers.

Shared GPU interfaces enable  dependency injection across the ecosystem.
  
  
  The Problem: Circular Dependencies
As the GoGPU ecosystem grew to , we hit a classic enterprise problem:gogpu/gogpu (windowing, GPU init)
      ↓ depends on
gogpu/gg (2D graphics)
      ↓ depends on
gogpu/wgpu (WebGPU implementation)
      ↓ depends on
gogpu/naga (shader compiler)
 How can  receive a GPU device from  without creating circular dependencies? And how will  receive both GPU context AND input events?The answer: Shared interfaces in a zero-dependency package. is a new package with  that defines shared GPU infrastructure:GPU device + queue accessIME positioning for CJK inputThis follows the  from Rust — separating type definitions from implementation.
  
  
  DeviceProvider: The database/sql Pattern
Just like Go's  lets you swap MySQL for Postgres without changing your code, gpucontext.DeviceProvider lets libraries receive GPU resources without knowing the source:
  
  
  gogpu Implements DeviceProvider
In , the  now provides GPU context to external libraries: The library receiving  doesn't need to know it came from . It could come from born-ml/born for ML compute, or a future WebAssembly host.
  
  
  EventSource: Input Events for UI
Building a GUI toolkit requires more than GPU access — you need input events. The  interface provides platform-independent input delivery:
  
  
  Full IME Support for CJK Input
Enterprise applications must support international users. The  struct provides everything needed for inline composition rendering:
  
  
  gg Enterprise Architecture
 introduces two new packages that leverage :
  
  
  core/ — CPU Rendering Primitives
Independent of GPU, contains pure algorithms:gg/core/
├── fixed.go          # Fixed-point math (FDot6, FDot16)
├── edge.go           # Line/curve edges
├── edge_builder.go   # Path → edges conversion
├── analytic_filler.go # Anti-aliased rendering
└── alpha_runs.go     # RLE coverage storage
 CPU rendering code is separate from GPU code, following Skia/Vello architecture patterns.

 Data Collection and Merging
 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 Exploratory Data AnalysisAverage Rating by Wine TypeTop Countries by Average RatingBest Value for Money WinesWine is more than just a beverage — it is a global market with diverse varieties, prices, and qualities. For millions of consumers, choosing the right wine can be overwhelming: should they pay more for a reputed brand, or are there hidden gems that offer great quality at an affordable price?In the digital age, online wine marketplaces like Vivino provide access to extensive wine data, including ratings, reviews, prices, and origins. Leveraging this data with data science techniques can help both businesses and consumers make smarter decisions.In this project, we aim to explore the wine market using a dataset of over 12,000 wines across red, white, and rose varieties. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between price and quality, identify value-for-money wines, and analyze how features like wine type, country, and vintage influence ratings.Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, this project demonstrates how data science can transform raw wine data into actionable insights for businesses, helping them recommend wines effectively and optimize pricing strategies.To get a complete view of the wine market, we combined three separate datasets for red, white, and rose wines into a single, unified dataset. Each entry includes essential information about the wine, such as its name, country of origin, region, winery, rating, number of reviews, price, vintage year, and type, providing a rich foundation for analysis and insights.Before diving into the analysis, we carefully prepared the dataset to ensure its quality. Numeric columns like Rating, Price, and Year were correctly formatted, while categorical columns such as Type and Country were standardized. Missing or invalid values were addressed, duplicates were removed, and outliers—especially in the Price column, where a few luxury wines created a skewed distribution—were carefully handled to ensure a clean and reliable dataset for exploration.This tells us how wines are rated overall.The analysis shows that most wines receive relatively high ratings, with a median of 3.9, indicating overall good quality. Very few wines are poorly rated, as reflected by the minimum rating of 2.5. Overall, ratings are concentrated between 3.7 and 4.1, demonstrating a consistent level of high quality with low variability across the dataset.Since price is right-skewed, it’s better to plot log scale as well.The majority of wines are affordable, with a median price of approximately $16. A small number of very expensive wines create a right-skewed distribution, stretching the upper end of the price range while most wines remain in the accessible price segment.Are expensive wines really higher rated?
Do cheap wines also have high ratings?Optional: Add correlation coefficient:Examining the relationship between price and rating revealed a moderate correlation of 0.44, suggesting that while higher-priced wines tend to have slightly higher ratings, price alone does not guarantee quality.
  
  
  Average Rating by Wine Type
By comparing red, white, and rose wines, we can identify which type tends to receive higher ratings. The analysis shows that red wines have slightly higher average ratings than both white and rose varieties, suggesting a small but consistent preference for reds among consumers.
  
  
  Top Countries by Average Rating
The graph shows: Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia at the top, it means wines from these countries have the highest average ratings in our dataset.
Before trusting this result, we must check how many wines come from these countries : -If a country has only < 20  wines → average is unreliable
-If it has 200 wines → very reliable
This is called sample size bias.Although Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia show high average ratings, their limited sample sizes suggest that these results should be interpreted with caution.Although Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia display the highest average ratings, each country is represented by fewer than 20 wines in the dataset. As a result, these averages are likely influenced by small sample bias and should be interpreted with caution. To ensure reliable conclusions, we focused our analysis on countries with a sufficient number of observationsThis graph illustrates the evolution of the average wine rating over time by showing how ratings vary across different vintage years. It helps to evaluate whether the vintage has a significant influence on perceived quality. If an upward trend is observed, it suggests that newer wines tend to receive higher ratings, possibly due to improvements in production techniques or changing consumer preferences. Conversely, fluctuations or stable patterns indicate that vintage alone is not sufficient to determine quality. Overall, this analysis highlights the role of the production year as a secondary factor in wine evaluation, complementing other important variables such as price and origin.
  
  
  Best Value for Money Wines
This part identifies the best value-for-money wines in the dataset by selecting bottles that combine high quality with affordable prices.More specifically, it filters the data to keep only wines that have a rating of at least 4.3 (highly appreciated by users) and a price of 20 or less (considered relatively inexpensive). It then sorts these wines by rating in descending order and displays the top 10 highest-rated affordable wines.This analysis highlights wines that offer an excellent quality–price ratio, which can be used to support recommendations, help users discover hidden gems, and guide business strategies focused on promoting high-value products.The analysis reveals that most wines have ratings concentrated around 4, indicating generally good quality. Wine prices show a right-skewed distribution, with the majority being affordable and a few luxury wines driving up the high end. While there is a moderate correlation between price and rating, a higher price does not always guarantee better quality. Red wines tend to slightly outperform white and rose varieties, and certain countries consistently produce higher-rated wines. Vintage year appears to have only a minor effect on ratings. Finally, several value-for-money wines stand out, providing actionable insights for recommendations and business strategy.For our predictive modeling, the target variable is the wine Rating, which represents the score given by users. The features used to predict this rating include Price, Vintage Year, Country of Origin, and Type of wine (red, white, or rose). These variables capture both the economic and qualitative aspects of the wine, allowing the model to learn patterns that influence user preferences and perceived quality.To prepare the data for modeling, we first split it into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio, ensuring the model can be evaluated on unseen data. The numerical features (Price and Year) were standardized using a scaler, while categorical features (Country and Type) were encoded with one-hot encoding to convert them into a machine-readable format. These preprocessing steps were combined into a ColumnTransformer pipeline, which ensures that all data is properly transformed before being fed into the predictive model.The Random Forest model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.161, indicating that on average, the predicted wine ratings deviate by approximately 0.16 points from the actual ratings on the rating scale. The R² score of 0.511 shows that the model explains about 51% of the variance in wine ratings. This suggests that while the model captures a significant portion of the factors influencing ratings—particularly price and vintage year—there remains some variability that is not accounted for, likely due to other qualitative factors such as taste preferences, winery reputation, or unobserved characteristics. Overall, the model provides a reasonable predictive performance for guiding value-based wine recommendations and pricing strategies.Accurate Rating Predictions: The model can estimate a wine’s rating based on its price, country, type, and vintage year. This is useful for recommending wines that users are likely to enjoy, even when a wine has few existing reviews.Price-Quality Relationship: While price does influence the rating to some extent, the model demonstrates that other factors—such as country, type, and year—also play a significant role in predicting quality.Business Impact: Vivino can leverage this model to highlight “value-for-money” wines, identify underrated wines, and optimize strategic pricing to better guide consumers.To make this report even more insightful, we can examine which variables have the greatest influence on wine ratings. By analyzing feature importance from the trained Random Forest model, we can identify the key drivers behind the predictions and better understand how factors like price, country, type, and vintage year contribute to perceived wine quality.A horizontal bar plot with:Y-axis → feature names (Price, Year, Country_…, etc.)X-axis → importance values (ranging from 0 to 1)The Price feature should visually dominate the chart.This produces a clear and easily readable graph, eliminating the need for a table.Price is the dominant factor, accounting for approximately 78% of the variation in wine ratings. As expected, higher-priced wines tend to receive slightly higher ratings, though this is not always guaranteed. Vintage year is the second most important factor, contributing around 7.6% to the rating prediction. Both older and more recent vintages can subtly influence perceived quality. In contrast, the impact of country of origin and wine type (red or white) is relatively minor, each contributing roughly 1% individually. This confirms that price and year are the primary drivers of wine ratings, while categorical features such as country and type can still help fine-tune recommendations. From a business perspective, Vivino can leverage these insights to highlight wines that offer the best value for money, enabling the platform to recommend wines based on perceived quality rather than relying solely on raw ratings.This project successfully explored the relationship between wine price, quality, and origin using data science techniques. By combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, we were able to identify the key factors that influence wine ratings.The Random Forest model demonstrated that price and vintage year are the strongest predictors of wine quality, while country of origin and type play a smaller but meaningful role. The model’s performance, with an MAE of 0.16 and R² of 0.51, shows it can reasonably predict wine ratings, providing valuable guidance for wine recommendations.From a business perspective, these insights empower Vivino to highlight value-for-money wines, identify underrated wines, and optimize pricing strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.Overall, this project illustrates how leveraging large wine datasets and machine learning can transform raw data into actionable insights, supporting smarter decisions for both businesses and consumers. Future work could incorporate additional features, such as tasting notes, winery reputation, or user reviews, to further improve the predictive performance and recommendation quality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧠 Ensemble_Strategy</title><link>https://dev.to/stklen/ensemblestrategy-4mde</link><author>TK Lin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Washin Village AI Director Tech Notes #4Just like human teamwork,  makes multiple AI models work together, combining their judgments for more accurate results.: Two heads are better than one.

Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🚀 I just published the first working version of Flowrra!After months of experimenting, building, and learning along the way, I finally have a small but fully functional background task execution framework that is async-first, Python-native, and designed with simplicity and clarity in mind.I’ve been using Celery in production for years. It’s powerful, but it can also feel a bit opaque; tasks run in processes or threads, async support isn’t native, and integrating it tightly with custom frameworks can get tricky.On top of that, using Celery usually means you have to:Run a separate worker service just to execute tasks.Start a separate Flower service if you want to monitor them.No separate worker service needed: tasks are executed directly by the scheduler/worker integration, reducing setup complexity.Async-native: built around Python’s asyncio for truly non-blocking, I/O-heavy tasks.Pluggable result backends: currently supports In-Memory and Redis, but swapping or adding new backends is straightforward.Built-in UI / framework integration: monitor tasks, view results, and integrate directly with your framework without starting a separate service.Transparent lifecycle: every task’s state is explicit — perfect for debugging and learning.For developers exploring async workloads or wanting a simple, understandable task system, Flowrra could be a more natural fit than Celery.Building Flowrra wasn’t just about writing code; it was a deep dive into distributed systems and Python concurrency: Understanding how tasks are scheduled, executed, and their results stored. Learning the subtle complexities of retries, state management, and task lifecycles. Every line of code taught me something I could never fully grasp just by reading docs or tutorials.Flowrra is still early-stage. Next steps include:Expanding backend optionsEnhancing the built-in UI for better monitoringTesting distributed task execution scalabilityTesting multiple scheduler instances' scalabilityIt’s exciting to see something that started as a curiosity turn into a working system.Flowrra is fully open-source. If you’re curious about async Python, distributed systems, or just want to experiment with a task runner, you can contribute or test it today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using ORM with Scrapy: The Complete Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/ikram_khan/using-orm-with-scrapy-the-complete-guide-15cf</link><author>Muhammad Ikramullah Khan</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:39:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last blog, I learned about ORM. Writing Python instead of SQL. Clean code. No more complex INSERT statements.But how do I actually use it in my Scrapy spiders?I tried adding ORM to my pipeline. It crashed. Session errors. Connection problems. Duplicate key errors. I had no idea how to integrate ORM properly with Scrapy.After hours of trial and error, I figured it out. Now my spiders save data with clean Python code, handle relationships automatically, and update existing records seamlessly.Let me show you how to use ORM with Scrapy the right way.In this guide, we'll create:Scrapes products from an e-commerce siteScrapes reviews for each productSaves everything to database using ORMHandles product-review relationships automaticallyUpdates existing products (no duplicates)All with clean Python code (no SQL!)No messy SQL. Just Python objects.
  
  
  Step 1: Install Dependencies
pip scrapy sqlalchemy

  
  
  Step 2: Create Scrapy Project
scrapy startproject ecommerce
ecommerce

  
  
  Step 3: Project Structure
ecommerce/
├── scrapy.cfg
├── ecommerce/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── models.py          # NEW: ORM models
│   ├── pipelines.py       # ORM pipeline
│   ├── items.py
│   └── spiders/
│       └── products.py

  
  
  Step 1: Define ORM Models
Create  with our database models:Defines Product table (stores product info)Defines Review table (stores reviews)Creates relationship (one product has many reviews)Provides helper functions for setup
  
  
  Step 2: Define Scrapy Items

  
  
  Step 3: Create ORM Pipeline
Creates database connection on spider startHandles both products and reviewsUpdates existing products (no duplicates!)Links reviews to products automaticallyLogs statistics when spider closesHandles errors gracefully
  
  
  Step 5: Configure Settings
Spider scrapes product pagesFor each product, yields ProductItemPipeline saves product to database (or updates if exists)Spider scrapes reviews for that productYields ReviewItem for each reviewPipeline saves reviews (linked to product automatically!) All handled by ORM.After scraping, query your data:Access reviews: Access product: Relationships handled automatically!
  
  
  Advanced: Batch Processing
For better performance, save items in batches:Batch processing benefits:More efficient (fewer database operations)Better for large scraping jobs
  
  
  Using PostgreSQL Instead of SQLite
For production, use PostgreSQL:
  
  
  Step 1: Install PostgreSQL Driver
pip psycopg2-binary

  
  
  Step 3: Create PostgreSQL Database

psql  postgres

CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db
CREATE USER scrapy_user WITH PASSWORD 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ecommerce_db TO scrapy_user
  
  
  Step 4: Update settings.py

  
  
  Step 5: Pass URL to Pipeline
That's it! Now using PostgreSQL with ORM.
  
  
  Handling Multiple Spiders
For distributed crawling, use connection pooling:Multiple spiders share connection poolHandles concurrent access properly
  
  
  Common Issues and Solutions

  
  
  Issue 1: "Table already exists"
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: table products already exists

Use  only once, or check if tables exist:
Always create new session for each spider:
  
  
  Issue 3: Duplicate Key Errors
UNIQUE constraint failed: products.url

Check if product exists before inserting:
  
  
  Issue 4: Relationship Not Working
 returns empty list even though reviews exist.
Make sure product_id is set correctly:
  
  
  1. Always Use Transactions

  
  
  2. Close Sessions Properly
Here's everything together:How to integrate ORM with ScrapyDefine models for products and reviewsHandle relationships automaticallyBatch processing for performanceHandle duplicates (check before insert)Use batch processing for large jobsPostgreSQL for productionYou now have production-ready ORM integration with Scrapy!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost]</title><link>https://dev.to/jaynniixxzz/-48gp</link><author>Jay</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:28:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[First Working Version of Flowrra]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>7 Under-the-Radar Python Libraries for Scalable Feature Engineering</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/7-under-the-radar-python-libraries-for-scalable-feature-engineering</link><author>Iván Palomares Carrascosa</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/kdn-7-under-radar-python-feat-eng-libraries.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This article lists 7 under-the-radar Python libraries that push the boundaries of feature engineering processes at scale.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How AI Inpainting Actually Works — And Why It&apos;s Better Than Clone Stamp</title><link>https://dev.to/danny_miller/how-ai-inpainting-actually-works-and-why-its-better-than-clone-stamp-4n9d</link><author>Danny Miller</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:12:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wondered how those "magic eraser" tools actually work? I spent weeks diving into image inpainting technology, and here's what I learned about removing watermarks, objects, and imperfections from images.The Problem with Traditional Approaches
If you've ever used Photoshop's Clone Stamp or Healing Brush, you know the pain:Carefully paint over targetCry
Even Content-Aware Fill, while better, often produces weird artifacts — duplicating elements that shouldn't be there or creating unnatural patterns.Enter AI Inpainting
Modern inpainting uses neural networks trained on millions of images to understand:Context — What should logically be in the masked area
Texture — How to match surrounding patterns
Semantics — Whether it's filling sky, grass, fabric, or skin
The key insight: instead of copying pixels from nearby areas (clone stamp), AI generates new pixels that make contextual sense.The Technical Architecture
Most state-of-the-art inpainting models follow this pattern:Input Image + Binary Mask
        ↓
   Encoder (extract features)
        ↓
   Attention Layers (understand context)
        ↓
   Decoder (generate pixels)
        ↓
Popular approaches include:LaMa (Large Mask Inpainting) — Great for big areas
Stable Diffusion Inpainting — Uses diffusion models
MAT (Mask-Aware Transformer) — Transformer-based
What I Built (and What I Learned)
I've been working on an image processing tool that uses AI inpainting for watermark removal. Here's what surprised me:Mask Quality Matters More Than Model Size
A precise mask with a smaller model beats a sloppy mask with SOTA models. The mask tells the AI exactly what to regenerate.AI-Generated Images Are Easier to Fix
Ironic, right? Images from Midjourney, DALL-E, Gemini, and other AI tools have consistent synthetic textures that inpainting models understand well.Processing Time is Constant-ish
Unlike traditional methods where complex watermarks take longer, AI processing is roughly the same regardless of content complexity. Most images process in 2-3 seconds.Upload image
Brush over watermark (creates binary mask)
AI generates replacement pixels
Download resultStock photo watermarks
AI-generated image logos (Gemini, Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
Corner badges
Code Snippet: Basic Inpainting Pipeline
If you want to experiment yourself, here's a minimal Python example using a pre-trained model:from transformers import pipelineinpainter = pipeline("image-to-image", model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting")
def remove_watermark(image, mask):
    image: PIL Image with watermark
    mask: Binary PIL Image (white = area to inpaint)
    """
        prompt="clean background, no text",
        mask_image=mask,
    )
For production use, you'd want:GPU acceleration
Proper image preprocessing
Edge blending post-processing
Batch processing support
Testing on 100 random watermarked images:Method  Avg Time    Quality (1-10)
Manual (Photoshop)  8 min   9
Content-Aware Fill  3 sec   6
AI Inpainting   2.5 sec 8.5
AI inpainting hits the sweet spot: near-manual quality at near-instant speed.Limitations to Know
AI inpainting isn't magic. It struggles with:Large masked areas (>40% of image) — Not enough context to work with
Faces and text — Can hallucinate weird results
Precise reconstruction — If you need exact details, manual is still better
What's Next
The field is moving fast. Recent developments:Segment Anything + Inpainting — Auto-detect watermarks, no manual masking
Video inpainting — Remove watermarks from video frames consistently
Real-time processing — Mobile-friendly speeds
I'm particularly excited about automatic watermark detection. Imagine: upload image → AI finds watermarks → removes them → done.Try It Out
If you want to see AI inpainting in action without setting up your own pipeline:Free credits on signup. No GPU required on your end.Have you worked with inpainting models? What's your experience been? Drop a comment — I'd love to hear about edge cases you've encountered.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Buy LinkedIn Accounts</title><link>https://dev.to/pvaseoshop0022/buy-linkedin-accounts-1j5d</link><author>PVA SEO SHOP</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:11:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Buy LinkedIn Accounts

Buy LinkedIn Account: A Professional Network Access Review
You need a professional LinkedIn profile for just about anything in business. A share of individuals and companies may take a shortcut. That’s why they prefer to buy LinkedIn accounts for networking or marketing purposes. This approach implies substantial trade-offs between speed and security. The market for such accounts is murky and largely unregulated. Potential buyers have a landscape to cross that is strewn with opportunity and risk.
This analysis is particularly relevant to the market of buying LinkedIn accounts. We examine the reasons and risks involved with this request. We also provide an objective review of service providers. We seek to provide a complete picture for informed decision-making. Knowledge about this practice is vital. Publications like this help keep practitioners out of trouble while also steering them clear of hit-or-miss stumblings into unexamined terrain. The information contained is the result of market research.
Looking forward to hiring LinkedIn Profiles
Why buy LinkedIn account services now? The reasons behind buying LinkedIn account services are even more specific. Lead gen or sales outreach cos are typically the driver of this demand. They need points of exposure. Older accounts get around the new account restrictions on LinkedIn. ¡¨ These limitations mean that I’m restricted in the number of invitations and messages I can send. The demand gives rise to a supply of different types of accounts. The seller could be an individual or an impersonal digital marketing entity.
New accounts have instant activity constraints. This slows down the work of business development. An old account looks more credible. It includes the form, more connections, and some historical activities. This perceived actuality contributes to the acceptance of messages. Large-scale marketers also buy accounts to enhance their efficiency at the top of the market. They control numerous profiles and large campaigns. This approach is designed to pump volume for outreach and lead gen.
Comparison of US Service Providers
Many US websites provide the service. Their products differ in age, connections, performance characteristics, and features. The following table provides an overall glimpse of the frequent specifications in the best platforms. Discreet online storefronts frequently facilitate services from these providers. They also organize accounts by age and network strength. The buyers may choose such profiles for the ad campaignsö according to their campaign needs.
Provider Feature    Account Age (Months)    Connection Range    Common Inclusions
Basic Account   1-6 0-50    Profile setup, basic info
Established Account 7-24    51-500  Some endorsements, past posts
Premium Account 25+ 501+    Recommendations, full activity history
There’s a wide variation in service levels from providers. A few even lock down their accounts for a specific time period. Others don’t provide any guarantee once the sale is made. Payment methods also vary. They often accept PayPal, cryptocurrency, and credit cards. The crypto adds an anonymous layer for both the buyer and seller. This complicates the transaction process even further.
Primary Motivations for Account Acquisition
Businesses give several reasons for buying pre-made accounts. The number one reason given is faster deployment. It would take a lot of time to organically build your network. Account on sale supplies you with instantaneous access to a network. This is especially important for near-term marketing. So the salespeople need weapons at hand to go for a more comprehensive program. They cannot wait months for an account to grow ripe.
B2B salespeople target these accounts for cold outreach. If you have an aged profile, the acceptance rate will be higher. By doing this, it raises the chance of lead conversion. They are also employed by some social media management agencies. From a single platform, they handle various client profiles. This makes social selling strategies scalable. It even differentiates the personal and professional relationship-building tasks.
Overcoming Initial Platform Barriers
LinkedIn has algorithms that are tasked with keeping a close eye on new account behavior. No need to rush, as a sudden spike of requests may cause throttling. The older the account, the higher the trust it has. They let you get more aggressive in your networking. This is relevant for anyone in sales. Their KPIs are built around reaching out in high volume. New users will have daily invitation and message limits.
Established accounts have fewer restrictions. This allows for proactive, rather than reactive, engagement strategies. Companies market leverage this to do concurrent campaigns. They manage a bunch of accounts directed toward various industries. It’s a strategy that allows them to spread out the way they are generating leads. This also decreases the chance of a single account getting banned. These use cases are scrutinized by the Pvaseshop team daily.Significant Risks and Potential Consequences
You cannot buy an account according to LinkedIn’s User Agreement. This also applies to section 8.2 Selling or transferring access is strictly forbidden. The service uses advanced detection mechanisms. These compare behavior, login locations and device fingerprints. Permanent suspension due to erratic activity is also a typical result. If you lose an account, you’ve lost all that effort and connection.
That is not a compliment; that means I wouldn’t trust us with their data, and I certainly would never trust your data. The owner of the original account may still have recovery data on file. After you have put time into the account, they might try to take it back. The history of the account might even involve unknown transgressions. This presents a risk to the new owner. The original owner may have been a spammer. It could permanently sully the Profile’s reputation.
Security and Legal Implications
There are risks of using a paid account. You have no record of the past activities of this Profile. Someone could have used it for spam or scams. It tarnishes your professional reputation by association. Others also have negative implications under the realm of false pretense. Using a fictitious identity on an account for business purposes could hold legal liabilities.
It May Violate Truthful Advertising Laws And Commercial Practices. The PVASEOSHOP blog offers detailed posts about digital compliance. We recommend these resources before you decide. Misrepresentation can open them up to legal action from clients or business partners. It’s not conducive to trust in professional relationships. The long-term brand damage may be anything but worth it.
Financial and Operational Risks
There is a direct financial loss in a banned account. You lose the price you paid for it and any associated assets. There can be an even greater cost: operational disruption. Marketing campaigns come to a screeching halt. Sales pipelines that relied on that account become useless. If you ever get banned, they ban absolutely everything. It has affected business earnings. These loss of momentum, i.e., business revenue, also leads to crime..
It’s an awful lot of time and effort to rebuild a network. And the actual costs of such ads are usually more than the original purchase price. Most businesses overlook these potential losses. They see only the short-term advantages. An intelligent risk assessment is necessary. At Pvaseoshop, this assessment is mandatory for all of our digital products.
Evaluating Service Provider Credibility
Note that not all companies in the segment have this capability at this level. Others employ automated bots to form complex networks of fake profiles. These are detected and banned quickly. Others employ manual creation methods. Such accounts generally do (last longer). Key signs of a trusted provider are no-nonsense replacement guarantees. They must provide transparent policies concerning account sourcing.
Find platforms that provide excellent customer support. Transparent disclosure of account sourcing is also crucial. Clear terms of service are essential. Pvaseoshop recommends thorough due diligence. And always look for verified/unbiased user ratings and reviews. Steer clear of providers without a web presence beyond a sales page.
Account Specifications and Feature Analysis
The usefulness of the account depends on the feature set bundled with it. Basic accounts don’t offer much beyond a verified email. Premium accounts feature full work history and references. Below is a table detailing the majority of core attributes and their real-world values. This analysis aids customers in comparing sourcing options.
Account Feature Practical Utility   Longevity Factor
Profile Photo & Banner  Increases profile view credibility  Low
Work History & Education    Adds depth and context to the profile   Medium
Skill Endorsements  Provides social proof of capabilities   High
Written Recommendations Significantly boosts profile authority  High
Previous Content Posts  Shows a history of engagement   Medium
Follower Count  Indicates influence and reach   High
All the details make the account as a whole more believable. Accounts that get recommended and endorsed do better. They sound and look more natural to both machines and people. These improvements are not the result of any sourcing. “Stylish” (non-organic) characteristics have a longer life than “artificially induced” ones.
Best Practices for the Safe Handling of Procured Accounts
If you decide to make a purchase, some strategies can minimize the risk. Change the password and email to that account asap, obviously. And update your recovery phone number and security questions. Simplify the modification of the Profile details over a few days. Don’t implement turnaround tactics in one go. Suddenly, complete overhauls appear suspicious.
Mimic organic user behavior. Begin the process: Looking at each other’s profiles and consuming content. Ease into requesting connections and sending messages. Do not post links or promote anything. This timing method ensures the account looks natural to LinkedIn’s systems. It decreases the likelihood of flags and reviews made by bots.
Maintaining Account Longevity
How long you will keep your account depends on regular, non-crazy activity. Log in from a single geographic location and device. Do not use VPNs or proxies that change your IP address often. Like and comment on your network’s content. Flag immunity is mainly achieved through regular, legitimate activity.
Develop a consistent posting schedule. Share industry-relevant articles and insights. Join groups that pertain to the industry/area in which the Profile is located. This is in line with the legitimate users. It is a consistent history of the actions you perform. This keeps the account usable for quite a bit longer.
Integration into Business Workflows
Introduce the account gently into your business life. Don’t rely on it for the main face of your major client relationships. It’s more effective for initial outreach and lead generation. But you can still use it when scheduling meetings for one main account. This tiered method limits the damage to reputations.
Train staff in the correct manner of use. Record any process in account management. Set communication style and frequency expectations. Keep an eye on your account stats to watch for any signs of something being off. Such organized management will limit operational risks. It also increases the ROI.
Ethical Alternatives to Account Purchase
The LinkedIn profile constructed from scratch is still the safest way. It creates an authentic professional narrative. And you can speed up the process with a targeted plan. Make good use of relevant keywords on your Profile. Engage consistently with industry-specific content. This creates a network for life.
Then, join and engage in the relevant LinkedIn groups. Leverage the built-in content tools and networking features that LinkedIn provides. Think about purchasing LinkedIn Sales Navigator for more sophisticated lead generation. These are the techniques that lead to a hardy, long-term professional network. They sharpen your actual professional skills and knowledge, too.
Strategic Organic Growth Methods
An organic approach to strategic growth pays off. Publish useful stuff three times a week minimum. It sets you up as an authority and brings in followers. Jot a short note on all of your connection requests so that they aren’t generic. This dramatically improves acceptance rates. It’s a fabric of deep connections.
Reach out to the influencers in your sector. Comment on their posts in a meaningful way to become more visible. Use LinkedIn Articles to show expertise. These strategies create an extensive network without policy infringement. The Pvaseoshop knowledge base provides organic growth strategies that work. These methods offer lasting value.
Leveraging LinkedIn’s Native Advertising
LinkedIn Ads for instantaneous professional outreach. They also provide highly targeted job titles, company size and industry. And direct your message with Sponsored Content and Message Ads. This approach doesn’t violate any platform TOS. It’s also scalable to your budget.
Marketing has proven ROI and so much analytics. You have access to key decision makers without the network limitations. It increases brand recognition and generates leads. This method typically provides better results when compared to paid accounts. It also has no chance of getting my account suspended or tarnishing my reputation.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can you buy a LinkedIn account legally?
Buying the LinkedIn account is not a criminal offense, though. But it violates LinkedIn’s User Agreement. Such a violation may lead to the suspension of an account without appeal. The misrepresentation and its legal implications. The practice itself involves misrepresentation, which can be addressed legally.
How much do these accounts generally range for?
Prices vary based on account age and the number of features. Basic accounts can run $30 to $60. Accounts with established profiles cost between $80 and $200. Recommended significantly aged accounts that can be over $300. Due to specialized targeting value, Niche Industry profiles frequently carry a premium cost.
Can LinkedIn tell if you purchased an account?
Yes, LinkedIn has security measures in place to identify abnormal activity. Irregular login locations, abrupt modifications to profile sections, or repetitive non-organic development systems are often red flags that trigger a review, processing, and account suspension. Behavioral algorithms assess hundreds of data points for anomalies.
What if I get my bought account banned?
In the event LinkedIn shuts down your account, you’re shut out for good. All relations, contents or data linked to that Profile will be destroyed. There is a limited replacement guarantee, but that does not restore lost time and network connectivity. Continued violations may result in hardware or IP bans.
What are some secure ways to purchase LinkedIn accounts?
There is neither a totally safe nor approved way. The deal is obviously against the platform policy. All CCS get banned. The easiest way is to have a profile that’s under your constant development. This approach builds your genuine professional reputation and network.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: We Built the 1.

It’s powerful, but it can also feel a bit opaque; tasks run in processes or threads, async support isn’t native, and integrating it tightly with custom frameworks can get tricky.On top of that, using Celery usually means you have to:Run a separate worker service just to execute tasks.Start a separate Flower service if you want to monitor them.No separate worker service needed: tasks are executed directly by the scheduler/worker integration, reducing setup complexity.Async-native: built around Python’s asyncio for truly non-blocking, I/O-heavy tasks.Pluggable result backends: Redis now, but swapping or adding new backends is straightforward.Built-in UI / framework integration: monitor tasks, view results, and integrate directly with your framework without starting a separate service.Transparent lifecycle: every task’s state is explicit — perfect for debugging and learning.For developers exploring async workloads or wanting a simple, understandable task system, Flowrra could be a more natural fit than Celery.Building Flowrra wasn’t just about writing code; it was a deep dive into distributed systems and Python concurrency: Understanding how tasks are scheduled, executed, and their results stored. Learning the subtle complexities of retries, state management, and task lifecycles. Seeing how even simple abstractions leak complexity when scaled. Every line of code taught me something I could never fully grasp just by reading docs or tutorials.Flowrra is still early-stage. Next steps include:Expanding backend optionsEnhancing the built-in UI for better monitoringTesting distributed task execution scalabilityTesting multiple scheduler instances' scalabilityIt’s exciting to see something that started as a curiosity turn into a working system.Flowrra is fully open-source. If you’re curious about async Python, distributed systems, or just want to experiment with a task runner, you can contribute or test it today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Best Resources to Learn Python as a Beginner</title><link>https://dev.to/srdan_borovi_584c6b1d773/best-resources-to-learn-python-as-a-beginner-1f3l</link><author>Srdan Borović</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:30:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learning Python in 2025 shouldn't cost you a fortune. The internet has democratized programming education to the point where some of the best resources are completely free. However, too many options can paralyze you before you write your first line of code.After digging through Reddit threads, developer forums, and course reviews, a clear pattern emerges. The resource matters less than how you use it. But some paths are definitely smoother than others.
  
  
  Start Where You Actually Are
Mimo offers a mobile-first approach that fits into your daily routine. The platform teaches Python through bite-sized lessons and includes an AI assistant to answer questions as you code. You can build projects directly in the app, which helps bridge the gap between theory and practice. For people learning on their commute or during lunch breaks, this format works well.Mimo also recently launched a building experience where you can create real apps and websites using AI-assisted development. You describe what you want to build in plain language, then collaborate with AI to implement changes in an actual codebase. The platform includes a modern editor, built-in SQL database, instant preview, and the ability to publish your projects with a custom domain. It's designed to teach you both coding fundamentals and the AI-assisted workflows that are becoming industry standard.Futurecoder takes a different angle. This free browser-based course includes built-in debuggers and enhanced error messages that explain what went wrong. Users praise its ability to teach how code executes step-by-step. The instant feedback loop prevents you from building bad habits early on.Want someone to actually review your code? Exercism offers a mentor-reviewed system where experienced developers critique your work. Some beginners find it too challenging at first. Those who stick with it appreciate the personalized feedback. You'll learn not just how to make code work, but how to make it good.
  
  
  Two Free University Courses Worth Your Time
When people hear about free university courses, they often assume they're watered-down versions of the real thing. They're not.14 sections with roughly 30 exercises eachTest My Code system auto-grades your work instantlyYou need to pass 80% of exercises before advancingExpect 120 to 160 hours of work totalDedicated Discord channel for peer supportThat 80% requirement sounds harsh. It prevents the illusion of understanding that plagues many self-taught programmers. Students report gaining the independence to write programs without constantly Googling syntax. Later sections transition from a browser editor to Visual Studio Code. You'll learn professional workflows like setting up development environments and using extensions. These skills separate hobbyists from job-ready developers. brings Hollywood production values to programming education. Professor David Malan makes compiler errors feel exciting, which is a weird thing to say but somehow true.The course deliberately teaches 80% of what you need for each problem set. You research the remaining 20% independently. This gap forces you to develop the search skills that professional developers use daily.CS50P's auto-graders are unforgiving. You might spend hours debugging because you capitalized a letter wrong. Students curse this at first, then thank it later when they're catching bugs in production code. The course costs $219 for a verified certificate on edX, but Harvard offers the identical curriculum free through their OpenCourseWare platform.
  
  
  For People Who Learn by Building
Some people need to see results immediately. Abstract theory kills their motivation. Show them a for-loop in isolation and their eyes glaze over. Show them how it could rename 500 files in two seconds and suddenly they're taking notes.Mimo's building experience fits this learning style perfectly. You can build full-stack apps with front and back ends, work with a built-in SQL database, and publish stable versions for real users. The instant preview shows your changes as you implement them, and you can export your source code or connect a custom domain for portfolio-ready projects. Unlike pure AI generation tools that create code you can't explain, Mimo keeps you close to what you're building.Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code on Udemy promises 100 projects in 100 days. You'll build console games, data visualizations, and web applications while forming a daily coding habit. The first 50 days earn universal praise for pacing and clarity.The quality drops in the latter half as projects become more self-guided. Web development sections feel slightly dated. But here's why it still works: the course teaches you concepts you didn't know existed. That unknown-unknown problem trips up many self-taught programmers. You can't Google something if you don't know it has a name.Price matters here. The course lists for over $100 but goes on sale for $15-$20 regularly. Many U.S. public libraries offer free access through "Gale by Udemy." Check before buying.Update spreadsheets automaticallyAccountants and data entry professionals swear by this approach because it solves immediate pain points. One Reddit user credited this book with launching their data engineering career. However, the code style leans toward beginner-friendly rather than pythonic. Use this alongside a more rigorous course if you're aiming for software development roles.
  
  
  Physical Books Still Have Their Place
Physical books force you away from digital distractions. Many developers report better retention when studying from paper, particularly during deep focus sessions. by Eric Matthes consistently ranks as the number one beginner book. Half covers syntax and theory, half walks through projects including a space invaders-style game and Django web app. The 3rd edition includes updated content on modern Python practices. Users recommend it for striking the balance that many online courses miss. by Allen Downey focuses on computational thinking. If you want to understand not just Python but programming as a discipline, this book delivers. The approach feels more academic. Works for some learners, alienates others.Skip Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw. Experienced developers describe it as "radioactive garbage" due to idiosyncratic style and outdated Python 3 information. The controversy runs deep enough that recommending it will get you downvoted on Reddit.
  
  
  YouTube Works If You're Disciplined About It
YouTube tutorials get a bad rap for encouraging passive learning. Watch a video, feel smart, then freeze at a blank screen. But some creators break this pattern. produces the clearest Python tutorials on the platform. His explanations of Object-Oriented Programming, Django, and regular expressions beat many paid textbooks.The catch? His videos lack built-in exercises. You need to create your own practice problems or risk falling into tutorial hell.Avoid 6-12 hour "Full Course" videos unless you're ready to pause every five minutes and code along. Otherwise, you're just watching someone else solve problems.
  
  
  The Tools You'll Actually Need
Your choice of IDE sparks religious debates in programmer circles. The 2025 consensus has settled on two options.PyCharm Community Edition works brilliantly out of the box. Powerful autocomplete catches errors before you run code. The introspection helps you understand type annotations and available methods through exploration rather than memorization. Beginners benefit from this immediate feedback. requires more setup. You'll need to install Python and Jupyter extensions at minimum. But it offers flexibility across languages. For long-term career development, learning VS Code pays dividends when you inevitably need to work with JavaScript, HTML, or other technologies. inside VS Code transform the learning experience for data science paths. Line-by-line execution with instant visual output reduces debugging burnout. You see results immediately, which maintains motivation during difficult concepts.
  
  
  Breaking Out of Tutorial Hell
The biggest trap isn't picking the wrong resource.Tutorial hell happens when you become a passive consumer, following along perfectly but unable to create anything independently. I spent two months in this trap with web development. Could follow any tutorial flawlessly. Couldn't build a contact form from scratch. Breaking out required three deliberate changes in approach.The Parallel Project RuleAfter completing a tutorial that builds a calculator, you build a unit converter. Similar concepts, different implementation. This forces you to apply knowledge rather than copy it. The struggle of adapting what you learned to a new context teaches more than any smooth tutorial walkthrough.Got code working? Now change it until it breaks. See what error messages appear. Fix them without consulting the tutorial.This builds debugging skills that no polished walkthrough can teach. After a week of deliberately breaking scripts, you'll read Python error messages like sentences instead of cryptic warnings.Google, Stack Overflow, and official documentation are separate skills to master. They're as important as Python syntax. Fighting with documentation for 30 minutes teaches you more than getting a quick answer from ChatGPT.Good rule of thumb: struggle for at least 20 minutes before asking anyone for help.
  
  
  The AI Question Nobody Wants to Address
ChatGPT and Claude have become standard tools in 2025. Use them right, and you'll learn syntax in weeks. Use them wrong, and you'll never learn at all.How to use AI without crippling yourself:Ask it to explain cryptic error messagesRequest progressive difficulty drills based on your current levelHave it generate custom exercises for weak areasNever ask it to just write the solutionThe framework: Use AI for explanations, minimal debugging hints, and practice generation. Write the code yourself. Always.
  
  
  What Separates Success from Failure
Here's what nobody wants to hear: grit matters more than your resource choice. The ability to sit with confusion, read error messages carefully, and keep trying after your code fails for the hundredth time. That's the skill.People with expensive bootcamp degrees wash out because they quit when things get hard. High school dropouts become senior developers because they refuse to stop learning.The best resources teach you how to think through problems, not just how to type syntax.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Connections to Meaning: Why Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) Change Demand Forecasting</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/from-connections-to-meaning-why-heterogeneous-graph-transformers-hgt-change-demand-forecasting/</link><author>Partha Sarkar</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How relationship-aware graphs turn connected forecasts into operational insight]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>📘 Build a Trace Grid Puzzle Book Generator in Python (with Live Preview + PDF Export)</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/build-a-trace-grid-puzzle-book-generator-in-python-with-live-preview-pdf-export-8no</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:28:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build a desktop puzzle book generator using Python.By the end, you’ll have an app that:Generates grid-based tracing puzzlesAutomatically builds a print-ready PDFSupports multiple puzzles per pageIs ready for KDP / Etsy style publishingIf you’d rather jump straight to the finished code:Let’s build it step by step.Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.pip install pillow svgwrite reportlab ttkbootstrap cairosvgttkbootstrap – modern UI themesvgwrite – vector puzzle exportcairosvg – SVG → PNG for PDF embedding🧱 Step 1 — Project Skeletonimport sys, random
from pathlib import Path
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageTk
import svgwrite
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter

import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *
Pillow → live preview imagesvgwrite → scalable puzzle pagesttkbootstrap → dark themed UI🧠 Step 2 — Main Application ClassEverything lives inside one class:class TraceGridPuzzleBook:
    APP_NAME = "TraceGrid Puzzle Book Generator"
    APP_VERSION = "1.3.0"
Define available options:    GRID_STYLES = ["Square", "Isometric", "Triangle"]
    SYMBOL_TYPES = ["Dot", "Circle", "Square", "Mixed"]
    EXPORT_FORMATS = ["SVG", "PNG", "PDF"]
Now initialize the window:    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        tb.Style(theme="darkly")

        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.geometry("1130x620")
🎛 Step 3 — State VariablesThese store user settings:        self.grid_size_var = tk.IntVar(value=5)
        self.symbol_var = tk.StringVar(value="Dot")
        self.path_complexity_var = tk.IntVar(value=50)

        self.symbol_color_var = tk.StringVar(value="#000000")
        self.line_color_var = tk.StringVar(value="#000000")
        self.bg_color_var = tk.StringVar(value="#ffffff")

        self.line_thickness_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)
        self.symbol_radius_var = tk.IntVar(value=8)

        self.rows_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)
        self.cols_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)
        self.pages_var = tk.IntVar(value=1)

        self.output_dir = Path.home() / "TraceGridPuzzleBooks"
Each tk.Variable automatically syncs with UI widgets.🖼 Step 4 — Building the InterfaceCreate the UI:

        self._build_ui()
        self._update_preview()
Create left control panelsAdd spinboxes and dropdownsCreate a center Live Preview canvasExample: Grid size control:tb.Spinbox(
    grid_body,
    from_=3,
    to=15,
    textvariable=self.grid_size_var,
    command=self._update_preview
).grid(row=0, column=1)
Whenever the value changes, _update_preview() redraws puzzles instantly.🧩 Step 5 — Generating a Single Puzzle PathEach puzzle is just a random walk through a grid:def _generate_single_puzzle(self):
    size = self.grid_size_var.get()
    complexity = self.path_complexity_var.get() / 100

    total_steps = max(2, int(size * size * complexity))

    path = [(0, 0)]
    visited = set(path)

    for _ in range(total_steps - 1):
        x, y = path[-1]

        neighbors = [
            (x+dx, y+dy)
            for dx, dy in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]
            if 0 <= x+dx < size
            and 0 <= y+dy < size
            and (x+dx, y+dy) not in visited
        ]

        if not neighbors:
            break

        next_cell = random.choice(neighbors)
        visited.add(next_cell)
        path.append(next_cell)

    return path
Randomly move up/down/left/rightStop when complexity limit is reachedThis produces clean tracing paths.✏️ Step 6 — Drawing Puzzles (PNG Preview)For live preview we draw with Pillow:def _draw_puzzle_png(self, draw, path, x_offset, y_offset, cell_width, cell_height):
    step = cell_width / (self.grid_size_var.get()+1)
    radius = self.symbol_radius_var.get()

    for i, (x, y) in enumerate(path):
        px = x_offset + (x+1)*step
        py = y_offset + (y+1)*step

        draw.ellipse([px-radius, py-radius, px+radius, py+radius], fill=self.symbol_color_var.get())

        if i > 0:
            prev = path[i-1]
            px0 = x_offset + (prev[0]+1)*step
            py0 = y_offset + (prev[1]+1)*step

            draw.line([px0, py0, px, py],
                      fill=self.line_color_var.get(),
                      width=self.line_thickness_var.get())
Dots + connecting lines = tracing puzzle.Every UI change regenerates sample puzzles:def _update_preview(self):
    img = Image.new("RGB", (400,400), self.bg_color_var.get())
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

    for r in range(self.rows_var.get()):
        for c in range(self.cols_var.get()):
            path = self._generate_single_puzzle()
            self._draw_puzzle_png(draw, path, c*200, r*200, 200, 200)

    self.preview_image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(img)
    self.preview_canvas.delete("all")
    self.preview_canvas.create_image(0,0, anchor="nw", image=self.preview_image)
This gives instant visual feedback.📄 Step 8 — Exporting SVG PagesEach page is a large SVG with multiple puzzles:def _export_page_svg(self, filename, puzzle_paths, rows, cols):
    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(filename, size=(1000,1000))

    cell_w = 1000 / cols
    cell_h = 1000 / rows

    for i, path in enumerate(puzzle_paths):
        r = i // cols
        c = i % cols

        self._draw_puzzle_svg(
            dwg,
            path,
            c*cell_w,
            r*cell_h,
            cell_w,
            cell_h
        )

    dwg.save()
SVG is perfect for printing because it’s vector-based.📚 Step 9 — Building the PDFWe convert SVG → PNG → PDF:def _export_pdf(self, pdf_filename, svg_files):
    c = canvas.Canvas(str(pdf_filename), pagesize=letter)

    for svg in svg_files:
        from cairosvg import svg2png

        png = svg.with_suffix(".png")
        svg2png(url=str(svg), write_to=str(png))

        img = Image.open(png)
        c.drawInlineImage(img, 0, 0)
        c.showPage()

    c.save()
Now you have a multi-page puzzle book PDF.if __name__ == "__main__":

generate millions of tokens and millions of lines of source code to
create one basic browser that can render HTML and CSS (no JS tho), and
hopefully I could use this to receive even more VC investments.But then I remembered that I have something even better: a human
brain! It is usually better than any machine at coordinating and
thinking through things, so let's see if we can hack something together,
one human brain and one LLM agent brain!The above might look like a simple .webm video, but it's actually a
highly sophisticated and advanced browser that was super hard to build,
encoded as pixels in a video file! Wowzers.For extra fun when building this, I set these requirements for myself
and the agent:I have three days to build itNot a single 3rd party Rust library/dependency allowedAllowed to use anything (commonly) provided out of the box on the OS
it runs onShould run on Windows, macOS and common Linux distributionsShould be able to render some websites, most importantly, my own
blog and Hacker News, should be easy right?The codebase can always compile and be builtThe codebase should be readable by a human, although code quality
isn't the top concernSo with these things in mind, I set out on the journal to build a
browser "from scratch". I started with something really based, being
able to just render "Hello World". Then to be able to render some nested
tags. Added the ability of taking screenshots so the agent could use
that. Added specifications for HTML/CSS (which I think the agent never
used :| ), and tried to nail down the requirements for the agent to use.
Also started doing "regression" or "E2E" tests with the screenshotting
feature, so we could compare to some baseline images and so on. Added
the ability to click on links just for the fun of it.After about a day together with Codex, I had something that could via
X11 and cURL, fetch and render websites when run, and the Cargo.lock is
empty. It was about 7500 lines long in total at that point, split across
files with all of them under 1000 lines long (which was a stated
requirement, so not a surprise).Second day I got annoyed by the tests spawning windows while I was
doing other stuff, so added a --headless flag too. Did some fixes for
resizing the window, various compatibility fixes, some performance
issues and improved the font/text rendering a bunch. Workflow was
basically to pick a website, share a screenshot of the website without
JavaScript, ask Codex to replicate it following our instructions. Most
of the time was the agent doing work by itself, and me checking in when
it notifies me it was done.Third day we made large changes, lots of new features and a bunch of
new features supported. More regression tests, fixing performance
issues, fixing crashes and whatnot. Also added scrolling because this is
a mother fucking browser, it has to be able to scroll. Added some debug
logs too because that'll look cool in the demonstration video above, and
also added support for the back button because it was annoying to start
from scratch if I clicked the wrong link while testing.At the end of the third day we also added starting support for macOS,
and managed to get a window to open, and the tests to pass. Seems to
work OK :) Once we had that working, we also added Windows support,
basically the same process, just another platform after all.Then the fourth day (whaaaat?) was basically polish, fixing CI for
all three platforms, making it pass and finally cutting a release based
on what got built in CI. Still all within 72 hours (3 days * 24 hours,
which obviously this is how you count days).The results after ~3 days
(~70 hours)And here it is, in all its glory, made in ~20K lines of code and
under 72 hours of total elapsed time from first commit to last:You can clone the repository, build it and try it out for yourself.
It's not great, I wouldn't even say it's good, but it works, and
demonstrates that one person with one agent can build a browser from
scratch.This is what the "lines of code" count ended up being after all was
said and done, including support for three OSes:$ git rev-parse HEAD

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------One human using one agent seems far more effective than one human
using thousands of agentsOne agent can work on a single codebase for hours, making real
progress on ambitious projectsThis could probably scale to multiple humans too, each equipped with
their own agent, imagine what we could achieve!Sometimes slower is faster and also betterThe human who drives the agent might matter more than how the agents
work and are set up, the judge is still out on this oneIf one person with one agent can produce equal or better results than
"hundreds of agents for weeks", then the answer to the question: "Can we
scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem?", probably
has a more pessimistic answer than some expected.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SpamSentinel v1.0 – Build a GUI Email Spam Detector in Python</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/spamsentinel-v10-build-a-gui-email-spam-detector-in-python-377p</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build SpamSentinel, a fast email spam detector with a GUI using Python. This tool can scan .eml and .txt email files, calculate a spam score, and help you manage spam emails effectively.Setting up the environmentCreating utility functionsBuilding the spam detection workerAdding file selection and drag & dropConnecting the worker to the GUISetup: Install required librariesttkbootstrap (for modern UI)tkinterdnd2 (optional, for drag & drop support)Install the extras using pip:pip install ttkbootstrap
pip install tkinterdnd2We need a helper to get resource paths, especially for icons when packaged with PyInstaller.def resource_path(file_name):
    """
    Get the path to a resource, works with PyInstaller.
    """    base_path = getattr(sys, "_MEIPASS", os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    return os.path.join(base_path, file_name)
Explanation:
This function ensures your icon or other files can be found whether running as a script or a packaged executable.We’ll create a class to handle scanning emails and calculating a spam score.import re
from collections import Counter, deque

class SpamWorker:
    def __init__(self, files, min_confidence, include_words, exclude_words, regex_pattern, max_results, callbacks):
        self.files = files
        self.min_confidence = min_confidence
        self.include_words = include_words
        self.exclude_words = exclude_words
        self.regex_pattern = re.compile(regex_pattern, re.IGNORECASE) if regex_pattern else None
        self.max_results = max_results
        self.callbacks = callbacks
        self._running = True

        self.spam_patterns = [
            re.compile(r"(free money|win cash|click here|urgent|lottery)", re.I),
            re.compile(r"(prize|offer|risk-free|credit card)", re.I),
        ]

    def stop(self):
        self._running = False

    def spam_score(self, text):
        score = 0
        for pattern in self.spam_patterns:
            if pattern.search(text):
                score += 50
        return min(score, 100)
spam_score calculates a fake spam score for demonstration.We use regex patterns to detect typical spam keywords.stop() allows the process to be canceled.We now scan files and calculate scores:    def run(self):
        total_files = len(self.files)
        counters = Counter()
        results_buffer = deque(maxlen=self.max_results)

        for i, path in enumerate(self.files):
            if not self._running:
                break
            try:
                with open(path, "r", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") as f:
                    content = f.read()
                    if self.include_words and not any(w in content.lower() for w in self.include_words):
                        continue
                    if self.exclude_words and any(w in content.lower() for w in self.exclude_words):
                        continue
                    if self.regex_pattern and not self.regex_pattern.search(content):
                        continue

                    score = self.spam_score(content)
                    if score < self.min_confidence:
                        continue

                    counters["SPAM"] += 1
                    counters["TOTAL"] += 1
                    results_buffer.append((path, score))

                    if "found" in self.callbacks:
                        self.callbacks["found"](path, score)

                    if counters["TOTAL"] >= self.max_results:
                        break
            except Exception:
                pass

            if total_files > 0 and "progress" in self.callbacks:
                self.callbacks["progress"](int((i + 1) / total_files * 100))
            if "stats" in self.callbacks:
                self.callbacks["stats"](dict(counters))

        if "stats" in self.callbacks:
            self.callbacks["stats"](dict(counters))
        if "finished" in self.callbacks:
            self.callbacks["finished"]()
Loops over files and calculates spam scores.Supports include/exclude word filters and optional regex.Reports progress and statistics via callbacks for the GUI.GUI: Setup with ttkbootstrapWe’ll use ttkbootstrap for a modern dark-themed GUI.import tkinter as tk
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *

class SpamSentinelApp:
    APP_NAME = "SpamSentinel"
    APP_VERSION = "1.0"

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tb.Window(themename="darkly")
        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.minsize(1200, 700)
        self._build_ui()

    def _build_ui(self):
        main = tb.Frame(self.root, padding=10)
        main.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)

        tb.Label(main, text=f"🧠 {self.APP_NAME} - Enterprise Spam Detector",
                 font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=(0, 4))
tb.Window(themename="darkly") creates a dark-themed window.Label displays the app name and description.File selection & drag & dropWe allow users to select folders or drag & drop files:from tkinter import filedialog
try:
    from tkinterdnd2 import TkinterDnD, DND_FILES
    DND_ENABLED = True
except ImportError:
    DND_ENABLED = False

    def browse_files(self):
        folder = filedialog.askdirectory(title="Select Email Folder")
        if folder:
            print("Folder selected:", folder)
TkinterDnD enables drag & drop.filedialog.askdirectory allows folder selection.We connect buttons to start scanning and update the GUI with results:def start_scan(self):
    selected_files = ["emails/test1.eml", "emails/test2.txt"]  # Example
    min_conf = 50
    self.worker_obj = SpamWorker(
        selected_files,
        min_conf,
        include_words=[],
        exclude_words=[],
        regex_pattern="",
        max_results=1000,
        callbacks={
            "found": lambda f,s: print(f"{f} -> {s}%"),
            "progress": lambda p: print(f"Progress: {p}%"),
            "stats": lambda stats: print(stats),
            "finished": lambda: print("Scan finished")
        }
    )
    threading.Thread(target=self.worker_obj.run, daemon=True).start()
Uses a separate thread to avoid freezing the GUI.Updates are sent back to the GUI via callbacks.We allow users to save selected results:def export_results(self, results):
    path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".txt")
    if path:
        with open(path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            for r in results:
                f.write(f"{r[0]} | Spam Score: {r[1]}%\n")
        print("Export completed!")
Saves selected files with their spam score to a text file.Finally, run the application:if __name__ == "__main__":

But as your database grows, those once-snappy pages are starting to feel... sluggish. You check your logs and see a query taking 2 seconds to load.Your first thought might be: "I need a bigger server."
Your second thought (the correct one) should be: In this guide, we’ll walk through why caching matters, how to set it up with Redis, and—most importantly—how to prove it’s actually working.Imagine you are a librarian. Someone asks you for a complex report on 19th-century architecture. You spend 20 minutes walking to the back of the library, climbing a ladder, and finding the book.If ten more people ask for that same report in the next hour, would you walk back every time? No. You’d keep a copy on your desk. While Django supports several backends (Database, File System, Local Memory),  is the industry standard. It’s an in-memory data store, meaning it lives in your RAM. It is significantly faster than reading from a traditional Disk-based database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
  
  
  The Setup: Before Caching
Let’s look at a standard Django view that calculates "Trending Products" for an e-commerce dashboard. This query is "expensive" because it involves aggregates and filters over thousands of rows.
  
  
  The "Before" Performance:
 1 per request. ~500ms - 1.5s (depending on DB size). Poor. 100 concurrent users = 100 heavy DB queries.
  
  
  Step 1: Install and Configure Redis
First, you need the Redis server installed on your machine and the Python interface.Update your  to point Django toward Redis:
  
  
  Step 2: Implementing the "Cache-First" Pattern
The most common way to cache is the  pattern. You check the cache; if it's there (a ), return it. If not (a ), fetch from the DB and save it to the cache for next time.Here is our updated view:
  
  
  Step 3: Verifying and Monitoring
This is where many developers trip up. How do you know it's working?Open your terminal and run the Redis monitor tool. This shows every command hitting your Redis server in real-time.Now, refresh your browser. You will see a  command in the monitor. You will see a  command. If you see  followed by another , your logic is broken (Cache Miss).To see exactly what is stored in your Redis database:redis-cli keys Note: Django-redis automatically prepends a version (usually ) to your keys.You can also use your browser's "Network" tab. Compare the  column.
  
  
  Step 4: Pro-Tip - Cache Warming
What if that first user of the day is a VIP? They shouldn't have to wait for the "Cache Miss." We use a —a custom Django management command that runs on a schedule (Cron job) to pre-fill the cache.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️
If you cache product prices for 24 hours and change a price in the admin panel, the user will see the old price. Use Django "Signals" to clear the cache whenever a model is saved.Django code is loaded into memory by your web server (Gunicorn/Uvicorn). If you change your  name in your code, you must restart Gunicorn. Otherwise, your server will keep looking for the old key while your warming script generates the new one.systemctl restart gunicorn

Don't cache things that are unique to every user (like a shopping cart) unless you include the  in the cache key.Caching is the bridge between a "hobby project" and a "production-ready app." By moving your most frequent, expensive queries into Redis, you reduce the load on your database and provide a lightning-fast experience for your users. Try implementing caching on your slowest API endpoint and use  to watch the magic happen!Have questions about cache invalidation?

After messing around for over six months without finding a consistent rhythm, while wasting huge amounts of time and energy, I stumbled upon quantitative trading. That’s when I finally realized: “Let data speak, let rules discipline”—this is the real key to reducing risk and improving efficiency. But at first, I was completely put off by the myths of “high barriers to quant trading” and “expensive APIs,” until I discovered this free stock API. That’s when I truly took my first step into quant trading. Today, I’m sharing this battle-tested, practical experience with no reservations—for beginners who are as lost as I once was.Let me be upfront: as a beginner in quant, you don’t need to chase complex machine learning models right away, and you definitely don’t need to spend big money on paid APIs. The free tier is more than enough to build basic strategies, connect real-time data, and run backtests. Only when you have higher needs later (e.g., high-frequency trading or Level 2 depth data) should you consider upgrading to paid plans. This is the most cost-effective and efficient path to getting started with quant trading, based on my own testing.Today we’re keeping it real—no fluff, just my personal hands-on breakdown. I’ll walk you through using this free stock API to build a simple, beginner-friendly quantitative trading strategy, while avoiding all the pitfalls I hit along the way. Everything here is practical and implementable.The biggest worry for beginners is “the tech is too complicated” or “registration is a hassle.” But iTick’s free tier eliminates those concerns entirely—it takes just 5 minutes to get set up, zero barrier to entry, and the free version is especially friendly for individual developers and newcomers to quant trading.Go to the iTick website, click “Get Started” in the top right, and register with your personal email—no complicated personal information required, one-step process.After registering, go straight to the dashboard, find the “API Management” section, and you’ll see your API Token. This token is crucial—you’ll need it for real-time data access and all API calls. Save it securely and never share it.Key details on free tier permissions (must-read for beginners): Supports basic real-time quotes for US stocks, Hong Kong stocks, A-shares, and other markets, plus minute-level to daily historical K-line data. Rate limit is 10 requests/minute—plenty for beginners building simple strategies (e.g., trend following, moving average crossover). It’s permanently free with no expiration, very beginner-friendly.
  
  
  2. Connecting Real-Time Data
The core of quantitative trading is simple: get market data in real time → apply preset strategy logic → generate trading signals. The very first and most critical step is real-time data access—if latency is high, your strategy judgments become inaccurate and can lead to unnecessary losses. iTick’s free API supports both RESTful and WebSocket push methods with very low latency (<100 ms for major markets), perfectly suitable for non-ultra-high-frequency strategies and easy for beginners to handle.I used Python throughout (the top choice for beginners—simple syntax, tons of online resources, quick solutions when you get stuck). Below are ready-to-run code examples. Just replace with your own API Token, copy-paste, and run to get real-time US stock data. Every line has detailed comments—take your time if something looks unfamiliar.First, install the two required libraries (run in your terminal):pip install requests websocket-client
These are standard Python libraries for API calls and real-time streaming—installation is straightforward.
  
  
  1. RESTful API for Real-Time Quotes
Real-world result: Running this instantly returns Apple’s current price, volume, and percentage change with very low latency—basically in sync with regular trading apps. Beginners should start with a single stock to get familiar with the data structure before expanding to multiple.
  
  
  2. WebSocket for Real-Time Streaming
If your strategy needs to monitor multiple stocks continuously (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Nvidia), WebSocket is better—it pushes updates in real time without repeated polling, more efficient and time-saving.
  
  
  3. Building a Real Strategy
Once real-time data is connected, you can start building the actual strategy. Beginners should begin with the classic “Dual Moving Average Crossover”—simple logic, easy to understand, controllable risk, and a favorite starting point for many experienced quant traders. Combined with iTick’s real-time and historical data, it’s quick to implement without advanced coding skills.Quick breakdown of the dual MA strategy (no complex formulas—just understand the idea):Choose two moving averages—a short-term (e.g., 20-day) and a long-term (e.g., 60-day). Trading signals come from crossovers:Short-term MA crosses above long-term MA (“Golden Cross”) → bullish trend → Buy signalShort-term MA crosses below long-term MA (“Death Cross”) → bearish trend → Sell signalUsing iTick data, the program automatically detects these crossovers, removing emotional bias—this is the biggest advantage of quant: rational, disciplined, no chasing or panic selling.Get historical data: Pull a stock’s historical K-lines via iTick API (e.g., last ~3 years daily data) for backtesting—essential to validate past performance before live use.Calculate MAs: Use Python’s talib library to compute 20-day and 60-day simple moving averages.Generate signals: Automatically detect golden/death crosses.Real-time monitoring: Use WebSocket to watch price; alert on signal (beginners: alerts only, no auto-trading).I wrote a lot, but it really boils down to one thing: getting started with quant trading as a beginner doesn’t have to be technically intimidating or expensive. Start with a free stock API and the simplest dual moving average strategy—nail real-time data first, then gradually optimize and simulate live trading. Step by step is far more reliable than trading on emotion or tips.That’s exactly how I did it—from not even knowing what an API was to now comfortably building basic quant strategies and monitoring multiple US stocks in real time. I’m not making huge profits, but I’ve avoided most of the old emotional traps, and my trading mindset is much calmer. The real essence of quant trading has never been “beating the market”—it’s “understanding the market,” using discipline to control your behavior and overcome greed and fear. That’s the philosophy I’ve stuck with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Death of the DMV Line: How I Found a Driving Test Slot in 48 Hours 🚗</title><link>https://dev.to/hypertools/the-death-of-the-dmv-line-how-i-found-a-driving-test-slot-in-48-hours-2mon</link><author>Roberto | Hyper-Tools</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:09:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had to renew my license in Nevada.

C is a systems language. JavaScript is a browser language. Rust is a safety-focused systems language. SQL is a query language.Python doesn't fit. It can be tricky, for an experienced programmer, to grasp what Python actually is and which slot to put it in. Often, they conclude "I don't like Python" and express confusion at its vast popularity in the 2020s.Like the eponymous snake, Python can be hard to pin down — and like a real python, it may end up wrapped around your codebase whether you planned it or not.Traditionally we're taught to classify languages along a few axes:scripting vs "real" languagesimperative vs OO vs functionalPython fits poorly into all of them.It isn't a compiled language in the C or Rust sense: it doesn't result in a standalone executable. It supports imperative, object-oriented and functional styles but isn't optimized for any of them. It began as a scripting language, but today it's used to build large, long-running systems.
  
  
  The Key Insight: Python Is Not Defined by Its Output
The turning point is to realize that Python is not defined by the artefact it produces.C, C++, Rust, Zig and Fortran produce binaries that can be directly run. The output is the thing. Once compiled, the language largely disappears from the execution model.Python doesn't work like that.A Python program needs a runtime ecosystem to execute: the interpreter, the object model, the garbage collector and the standard library. These are not incidental. They  Python. A Python program can't run standalone unless all of these components are bundled with it.
  
  
  Python as a Runtime Ecosystem
In structural terms, Python sits alongside other runtime-centric language ecosystems:Java, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure on the JVMThe similarity is architectural role: in all these cases, the runtime is the , not any compiled artefact.Strictly speaking, Python is a language specification with multiple implementations — IronPython runs on .NET, Jython on the JVM. But in practice, CPython and its C-API-dependent package ecosystem  Python. That's what made Python popular, and that's what we're discussing here.The differences from .NET and the JVM matter too..NET and the JVM have JIT compilation to native code; CPython does not by default..NET and the JVM enforce static typing as part of the compilation model; Python's type hints are advisory..NET and the JVM produce native distributable artefacts (.dll, .jar) with stable ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces); Python does not, making it more difficult to call. Python prefers to call other libraries rather than be called itself.So Python belongs in the "runtime ecosystem" category, but it's a looser, more dynamic variant; it trades static type-safe guarantees for flexibility and rapid development.This structural similarity doesn't fully explain Python's success — Ruby, Perl and PHP share similar characteristics but declined while Python grew. Historical contingency matters: NumPy's timing, Google's investment in TensorFlow, and early academic adoption all played roles that had little to do with language design.
  
  
  Where Python's Nature Is Clearest: Orchestration
Going to back to our question of "What IS Python?", the key is to realize that Python is a runtime-centric language. Its nature is clearest in numerical computing, data engineering and machine learning, where Python orchestrates work rather than performing it.The most important Python libraries—NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow—are not written in Python in any meaningful sense. Python provides the API, the glue and the control flow. The heavy computation happens in C, C++, Fortran or CUDA libraries that expose a C ABI.Python performs the same role over its libraries as:It is an orchestration language sitting above high-performance systems. That's why it thrives in scientific computing, data pipelines and machine learning. You build rapidly and easily, with simple syntax, while the underlying libraries deliver the performance. So long as orchestration overhead is low, Python-based systems can scale surprisingly far.This is the glamorous use case — but not necessarily the most common one.
  
  
  That's Not the Whole Story
The orchestration model explains Python's dominance in scientific and data-heavy domains — but most Python code written globally is web apps, scripts, automation and data munging where Python  doing the work directly.In web development and business applications (think Django, Flask, FastAPI), Python handles HTTP requests, processes strings and executes business logic. Here, Python trades raw performance for development speed and ecosystem breadth. A Django application will be slower than an equivalent in Go or C#, but it may ship months earlier.For these workloads, the framing is different: Python is a productive general-purpose language that prioritizes developer time over CPU time.Python's popularity is no mystery once you consider this trade-off.Being able to assemble things quickly, in readable code, with vast ecosystem support, matters more for mass adoption than type-safety, compilation speed or raw performance. Make something easy, and more people will do it; make something quick to do, and more people will do it, more often.Python lowers the barrier to entry for proof-of-concept and prototype work. You can validate an idea in hours rather than days. If performance becomes critical later, you can translate hot paths into a compiled language—but you've already learned what needs building.Getting something working , quickly, turns out to be more important than getting it working fast or elegantly. Shell scripting demonstrated this in the 1970s; Visual Basic and VBA did this in the 1990s; Python demonstrates it today. Make it easy and fast to build, and they will come and build.A note of realism: "rewrite hot paths later" is technically true but economically rare. Most prototypes never get rewritten; they become production systems. This is true of any language, but Python's low barrier to entry means more prototypes get written in the first place — and more of them survive into production.
  
  
  When Python Is the Wrong Choice
A fair assessment requires acknowledgement of where Python doesn't belong: — Garbage collection pauses are unacceptable when deadlines are measured in microseconds. — Neither iOS nor Android use Python as a first-class development language. — JavaScript and WebAssembly own this space.Memory-constrained embedded systems — Python's runtime overhead is prohibitive on microcontrollers (although MicroPython, a cut-down implementation, has some adoption in this space).Latency-critical network services — Where every millisecond matters, Go, Rust or C++ are better choices.CPU-bound pure-Python workloads — If you can't offload to native libraries, Python's interpreter speed becomes a genuine bottleneck.These are domains Python doesn't seriously contest. More relevant are the pain points in domains where Python  used: — The Global Interpreter Lock limits true parallelism in CPU-bound multithreaded code.Packaging and distribution — pip, virtualenv, conda, poetry, and pyproject.toml represent years of fragmented solutions to dependency management. — Relative imports, __init__.py behaviour, and module resolution remain sources of confusion. — Shipping a Python application to end users without requiring them to install Python remains harder than it should be.Python excels at orchestration, rapid prototyping and domains with strong library support. It is not a universal solution, and it carries real operational costs.
  
  
  Why Python still feels slippery
Even with this framing, Python can still feel oddly unsatisfying if you come from strongly structured languages.Compared with C#/Java or their ecosystems, Python has:a simpler, leakier object modelIf you're used to the discipline of C#, the functional elegance of F# or the precision of Rust, Python can feel vague. Things work — until they don't — and the language often declines to help you reason about correctness ahead of time.That's a real cost. But as the previous section argues, for many problem domains it's a cost worth paying.
  
  
  Clearing Up Misconceptions

True for CPU-bound pure-Python code. False when Python orchestrates native libraries—NumPy array operations execute at C speed regardless of Python's overhead."Python is a scripting language."
Historically accurate; Python originated as a scripting tool. But "scripting language" now undersells what Python has become.
Misleading. CPython compiles source to bytecode, then executes that bytecode on a virtual machine — much like many modern interpreters do. The distinction matters when reasoning about performance and behaviour, but it's an implementation detail rather than a defining characteristic.
  
  
  A Better Language Taxonomy
Python fits comfortably into this three-tier classification:C, C++, Rust, Zig, FortranThe binary is the productThe runtime is the productBash, PowerShell, VBA, LuaThe host environment is the productPython belongs firmly in the second group—with the caveat that it's a more dynamic, less rigidly structured member than Java or C#.The boundaries are not perfectly clean. Go has garbage collection, a runtime and reflection, yet produces statically-linked binaries — it sits at the boundary between the first two categories. Taxonomies are useful simplifications, not natural laws.
  
  
  A brief note for Rust and Go proponents
A common challenge: Python's role is better served by "doing it properly" in a compiled language from the start.That view makes sense if your problem is well-specified, stable, performance-critical and worth committing to upfront architectural constraints. In such cases, Rust or Go can be excellent choices.But many real-world problems do not start that way. They begin as ill-defined, exploratory or fast-moving systems: data pipelines, research code, internal tools, integration glue. A research team needs to test an idea quickly at small scale. A business team needs a tactical solution because the problem won't wait for strategic architecture.In those contexts, using a language with strict typing, memory models or concurrency primitives can frustrate development with language-wrestling, where making the language work becomes centre-stage.Python and compiled languages are therefore not competitors but complements: Python for orchestration and discovery; Rust, Go or C# for stabilised, performance-critical components. Your Python prototype becomes your teacher—clarifying what the real system needs to do.That said, Python's actual competition in most domains isn't Rust or Go — it's JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, R, and Julia. Python's victory over these closer competitors owes as much to ecosystem momentum and historical timing as to language design.Python isn't confused, incoherent or a "toy" language. It simply departs from the mental models of earlier language generations.Python is a runtime-centric ecosystem that excels at orchestration, rapid prototyping and leveraging high-performance native libraries. It trades static guarantees and raw speed for flexibility, readability and development velocity.That trade-off turns out to be exactly what a large portion of programmers need — including many who aren't professional developers at all, but scientists, analysts and business users who need working code fast. It let's you deliver, quickly.

Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. My solutions are written in Python first, and then converted to Perl. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.You are given an array of alphanumeric string, .Write a script to find the max value of alphanumeric string in the given array. The numeric representation of the string, if it comprises of digits only otherwise length of the string.This task can be achieved in a single line in both Python and Perl, while still maintaining readability. For the Python solution I use list comprehension to convert each string into an integer (if it is all digits) or the length of string (if it isn't). This is wrapped around the max function to return maximum (largest) of these values.Not to out-shinned, Perl can achieve similar functionality by using the map function, converting each string into its numeric representation or its length. Perl doesn't have a built-in  function, but it is available from the List::Util package../ch-1.py

You are given a string  and an integer $int.Write a script to encrypt the string using the algorithm - for each character  in , replace  with the  character after  in the alphabet, wrapping if needed and return the encrypted string.For this task, I start by setting  (called  in Python as  is a reserved word) to be the modulus (remainder) of 26. If that value is , I return the original string as no encryption is required.The next step is creating a mapping table. I start with the variable  that has all the lower case letters of the English alphabet. I create a  string by slicing the  string at the appropriate point. I then double the length of each string by adding the upper case equivalent string. Finally, I use  to convert the strings to a dictionary where the key is the original letter and the value is the new letter.The final step is to loop through each character and use the  dictionary to replace the letter, or use the original character if it is not found (numbers, spaces, punctuation characters, etc).The Perl code follows the same logic. It uses the splice method to create the  variable, and both  and  are arrays. The  function also comes from the List::Util package. Perl will automatically convert a flat list to key/value pairs in the  hash../ch-2.py abc 1

This guide shows you how to build an automated traffic monitoring system using APIs to track organic rankings, competitor dynamics, and advertising performance in real-time.How to identify Amazon listing traffic sources (organic, PPC, external)Building an automated traffic monitoring system with PythonUsing Pangolinfo Scrape API for real-time Amazon data collectionSetting up anomaly detection and alerts for traffic changes
  
  
  The Problem: Amazon's Traffic Attribution Black Box
A seller recently contacted me with a common problem: their silicone baking mat listing went from 15 daily orders to 35+ orders overnight. They were only running a single automatic campaign with a $30 daily budget, and their advertising report showed no significant change in ad-generated orders. Where did the extra 20 daily orders come from?This scenario highlights a fundamental challenge for Amazon sellers: Amazon's Seller Central doesn't provide clear traffic source attribution. You get aggregate metrics like Sessions and Page Views, but no breakdown of:How much traffic comes from organic search vs. paid adsWhich keywords are driving the most trafficWhether competitor stockouts are sending traffic your wayIf external promotion campaigns are actually workingFor developers building seller tools or data-driven sellers with technical teams, this black box is unacceptable.
  
  
  Understanding Amazon Traffic Sources
Before we dive into the technical solution, let's map out the traffic landscape:
  
  
  1. Organic On-Platform Traffic
: Buyers searching keywords and finding your listingRanking position is everything (page 1 vs. page 2 = 10x traffic difference)Influenced by sales velocity, conversion rate, reviews, and relevance: Best Sellers, New Releases, Movers & ShakersHigh-intent traffic with strong conversion ratesProvides brand exposure beyond keyword searches: "Customers who bought this also bought"Often overlooked but can represent 20-30% of trafficEspecially valuable for complementary products
  
  
  2. Paid On-Platform Traffic
: Appear in search results and product pages: Top-of-search brand ads: Retargeting and audience-based adsSocial media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)Deal sites (Slickdeals, Kinja Deals)Independent website referrals
  
  
  Building a Traffic Attribution System
Here's how to build a system that actually tells you where your traffic comes from.┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  Step 1: Data Collection Setup
First, let's set up automated data collection using Python and Pangolinfo's Scrape API.
  
  
  Step 2: Automated Scheduling
Set up a cron job or use a task scheduler to run data collection daily:
  
  
  Step 3: Anomaly Detection
Implement logic to detect significant traffic changes:
  
  
  Step 4: Traffic Source Attribution Logic
Now combine all data sources to attribute traffic:Let's return to the silicone baking mat example. Here's what the data revealed:Keyword rankings for 10 core keywords (daily)Competitor data for 5 main competitors (daily)Advertising data from Amazon Ads API A Facebook promotion one week earlier generated 50 concentrated orders, improving sales velocity and conversion rate, which triggered Amazon's algorithm to boost organic rankings.Increased ad budget to consolidate ranking positionAccelerated inventory replenishmentResult: Sustained 30+ daily orders (50% improvement)
  
  
  Why Pangolinfo for Amazon Data Collection
After testing multiple solutions, here's why Pangolinfo Scrape API stands out:1. High Accuracy for Sponsored Ads98% success rate for SP ad position scrapingCritical for understanding competitive advertising landscapeNo estimation models—actual scraped dataMinute-level updates available3. Comprehensive CoverageSearch results (organic + sponsored)RESTful API with clear documentationMultiple output formats (JSON, CSV, HTML)Webhook support for real-time alertsPay per request (no unused features)Much more cost-effective than $3,588/year SaaS tools1. Start Simple, Scale GraduallyBegin with 5-10 core keywordsAdd more metrics as you understand patternsManual data collection doesn't scaleSet up scheduled jobs from day one3. Focus on Actionable MetricsDon't just collect data—define what actions each metric triggersExample: Ranking drop > 10 positions → increase ad budget4. Combine Multiple Data SourcesAmazon Ads API for advertising dataPangolinfo for organic rankings and competitor dataAmazon Attribution for external traffic5. Build Historical ContextTraffic analysis requires time-series dataCollect data for at least 2-4 weeks before drawing conclusionsAmazon's lack of transparent traffic attribution doesn't have to be a black box. By building a systematic monitoring system with automated data collection, anomaly detection, and attribution logic, you can:Quickly identify traffic source changesRespond to opportunities (ranking improvements, competitor stockouts)Optimize advertising spend based on actual dataMake data-driven decisions instead of guessingThe technical implementation is straightforward—the real value comes from consistent execution and acting on insights.Have you built your own Amazon traffic monitoring system?

Ethan sat at his desk, wrapped in a thick wool sweater, staring at a terminal full of empty brackets."It compiles," he muttered. "But it's empty."Eleanor walked by, carrying a stack of microfiche. "What is empty?""My config loader. I'm trying to parse this JSON file from the legacy system. The file has data, the code runs without error, but my Go struct comes out blank. Zero values everywhere."He pointed to the screen.The JSON File ():"Ah," Eleanor said, glancing at the struct definition. "The Privacy Wall.""Go is strict about visibility," Eleanor explained. "If a field starts with a  letter, it is private. It is visible  inside your package.""I know that," Ethan said. "But I'm using it right here in .""You are," she corrected, "but  is not. That function lives in the  package. When you pass  to it, it uses  to inspect your struct. But it cannot see your private fields. To the JSON decoder, your struct looks completely empty.""So I just capitalize them?"Ethan updated the struct:He ran it again. The output changed:{ServerHost:"" ServerPort:0 TimeoutMs:0}"Still empty," Ethan sighed. "Why?""Because Go is literal about names," Eleanor said. "Your struct field is  (PascalCase). The JSON field is  (snake_case). Go will try to match cases, but it cannot bridge the gap between  and  automatically.""So I have to rename my Go fields to use underscores? ? That looks ugly.""No," Eleanor said firmly. "Never break Go naming conventions to satisfy an external format. Instead, we use a ."She reached over and typed backticks next to the fields."Think of a tag as a sticky note attached to the field definition," she explained. "It tells the  package: 'I know this field is named , but when you look at the JSON, look for  instead.'"Ethan ran the code again.{ServerHost:"localhost" ServerPort:8080 TimeoutMs:0}"It works," he smiled. "It's like mapping wires.""One more thing," Ethan asked. "What if a field is missing in the JSON? Or I want to hide a field when I write JSON back out?""You use options," Eleanor said. "You can stack them inside the tag string."She modified the timeout field."I added a few special instructions here," she pointed out.: "If  is zero (the default), it won't appear in the JSON output at all. It keeps your payloads clean.": "This dash tells the encoder to ignore the field entirely. Useful for sensitive data like passwords.": "Sometimes legacy APIs send numbers as strings, like . This tag tells Go to peel off the quotes and parse it as an integer automatically."Ethan looked at the backticks. "It feels a bit... magical. For a language that hates magic.""It is the one place Go allows runtime inspection," Eleanor admitted. "Under the hood,  inspects the memory layout of your struct, reads these tags, and maps the data dynamically. It is slower than writing manual parsing code, but infinitely more convenient."She stood up to adjust the thermostat."Data from the outside world is messy, Ethan. It uses different casing, different structures, different rules. Struct tags are how we keep our internal code clean while still talking to the messy world outside. We don't change our identity; we just wear a name tag."
  
  
  Key Concepts from Chapter 17
Public vs. Private Fields:
The  package can only read and write  fields (fields starting with a Capital Letter). Lowercase fields are invisible to the parser and will remain empty.Struct Tags ():
Metadata attached to a field definition. They allow you to map Go's  field names to JSON's  keys without breaking Go naming conventions. (Decoding):
Parses JSON data into a Go struct. It ignores JSON fields that don't match any struct fields (safe partial parsing).
Converts a Go struct into a JSON string.: If the field has the zero value (0, "", nil), it is omitted from the JSON output.: The field is completely ignored by the JSON encoder/decoder.: Forces the decoder to parse a string value () into a numeric field ().
Go validates types during parsing. If the JSON has a string  but your struct expects an  (and you didn't use the  tag),  will return a type error.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a Production-Ready Portfolio: Phase 3 - Freezing the Product Surface</title><link>https://dev.to/imsushant12/building-a-production-ready-portfolio-phase-3-freezing-the-product-surface-492i</link><author>Sushant Gaurav</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:41:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you build side projects, there’s a phase that almost nobody talks about.Not the phase where you learn a new framework.
Not the phase where you wire APIs.
Not even the phase where everything finally works.There’s a much quieter phase.The phase where you stop building
and start deciding what is allowed to exist.Up to this point in Phase-3, I had a fully functional frontend:
routing worked, pages existed, layout was in place, navigation was responsive, and the system was technically sound.From an engineering perspective, I could have kept adding features endlessly.But from a product perspective, something more important was missing:the product didn’t yet have a .And without a final shape, you’re not building a product — you’re just accumulating components.
  
  
  The Moment You Switch From Developer to Product Owner
Day-5 was the first day where I consciously stopped asking:“How do I implement this?”“What should this product even be?”That’s a very different mental model.As a developer, you’re rewarded for adding things.
As a product owner, you’re rewarded for .Because every extra option:increases maintenance costincreases surface area for bugsweakens the identity of the systemSo instead of adding, I started .Freezing decisions.
Freezing structure.This is something you only learn after working on real systems:
progress is not always forward — sometimes it’s about drawing boundaries.
  
  
  Why I Removed “Home” From Navigation
One of the most deliberate decisions I made was removing the “Home” link from the navigation.On paper, it looks harmless.
In practice, it’s redundant.Users already know three universal rules:home is not a feature, it’s a stateSo keeping “Home” in the navigation was not helping anyone.
It was just occupying attention.And attention is the most expensive resource in any product.By removing it, the navigation became something else:
not a list of pages,.Each item now answers a real user question:That’s not navigation anymore.
That’s storytelling.
  
  
  Navigation as a Contract, Not a Menu
At this point,  stopped being just a config file.It became a .what the user is allowed to explorewhat I’m willing to maintain long-termChanging it is no longer a refactor.
It’s a strategic decision.This is exactly how real systems evolve:
routes become APIs,
contracts become identity.Your navigation is literally your public interface.
  
  
  Branding Is Not Design, It’s Memory
Adding the logo consistently across the Navbar, Header, and Footer wasn’t a cosmetic improvement.It was a memory-building decision.People don’t remember layouts.
They remember symbols.the product becomes recognizablenavigation becomes intuitivethe site feels “real” instead of “personal project”This is one of the biggest psychological differences between:
a portfolio that feels like a demo
and one that feels like a product.The logo stops being decoration.
It becomes infrastructure.
  
  
  The Real Work of Day-5: Knowing When to Stop
Day-5 didn’t involve complex algorithms.
It didn’t involve clever abstractions.
It didn’t involve any “wow” features.But it involved one of the hardest engineering skills:knowing when the system is coherent enough to freeze.Not perfect.
Not complete.This is where many projects die:
they keep evolving without ever stabilizing,
so nothing ever feels finished,
and everything feels temporary.By finalizing the navigation, footer, and branding,
I wasn’t just polishing UI —locking the surface area of the product.new features must fit this structuredesign must respect these boundarieschanges become intentional, not accidentalThat’s the moment a codebase becomes a system.Now, I want to talk about something more important:what this phase does to how other people perceive you.Because at some point, your portfolio stops being a learning tool.
It becomes a signal.A signal to recruiters.
A signal to engineers.
A signal to people who might work with you.And signals are built from decisions, not from code volume.
  
  
  Why This Is Actually Leadership Work
Most developers think leadership looks like:In reality, leadership starts much earlier.making irreversible decisions in uncertain systems.I was saying:
“This is the shape of the system I’m responsible for.”That’s not coding.
That’s ownership.And ownership is the single strongest signal of seniority.
  
  
  The Recruiter Psychology Nobody Talks About
Here’s a harsh truth most people don’t realize:Recruiters don’t evaluate portfolios like engineers.
They evaluate them like .Does this feel intentional?Does this person make decisions?“This person builds things, but doesn’t finish them.”limited, clean navigationDay-5 moved the project from the first category to the second.
  
  
  Why Most Portfolios Fail at This Exact Stage
So most portfolios become:They never become .The moment you stop iterating UI endlessly and say:
“This is the experience I want users to have.”You separate yourself from 95% of developers.
  
  
  Freezing Structure Unlocks Speed
The moment you stop changing structure,
you can move faster than ever.new pages plug into known routescomponents follow known layoutdesign follows known systemdecisions become local, not globalBefore Day-5:
every change risked breaking everything.After Day-5:
every change has a home.This is exactly how large systems scale:
not by adding flexibility,reducing degrees of freedom.
  
  
  The Hidden Career Benefit of This Phase
This phase does something subtle to your personal brand:“developer who learns technologies”“engineer who designs systems”Because senior roles are not about:how you think about productshow you constrain complexityhow you make irreversible decisionsDay-5 is literally a leadership simulation.You just don’t notice it while doing it.
  
  
  Why This Matters More Than Any Framework
But this skill will not age:knowing when a system is ready to be .That’s product thinking.
That’s engineering maturity.
That’s what people actually hire for.Not your stack.
Not your libraries.If I had to summarize Day-5 in one line:Day-5 is when the project stopped being a collection of pages
and became a product with a defined identity.No new features.
No fancy code.

A single SQL injection can expose millions of user records. An XSS vulnerability can compromise user sessions. Let's skip the theory and dive into practical, actionable security practices with real code examples you can use today.
  
  
  1. Authentication: Don't Roll Your Own Crypto
❌ Bad: Plain Text Passwords✅ Good: Hashed Passwords with bcrypt
  
  
  2. SQL Injection: The Classic Vulnerability
❌ Bad: String Concatenation✅ Good: Parameterized QueriesORM Examples (Even Safer):
  
  
  3. XSS Prevention: Escape User Input
❌ Bad: Direct HTML Rendering✅ Good: Sanitize and EscapeReact (Auto-Escapes by Default):By: Backend Sanitization (Python):
  
  
  4. Secure API Authentication with JWT
✅ Proper JWT Implementation:
  
  
  5. Secure Session Management
✅ Express.js Secure Sessions:
  
  
  6. Input Validation: Never Trust User Input
✅ Comprehensive Validation (Node.js with express-validator):Submit✅ Safe File Upload Handler:✅ Rate Limiting Middleware:
  
  
  10. Secrets Management: Never Hardcode Credentials
✅ Good: Environment Variables✅ Essential Security Headers:
  
  
  12. Secure Database Queries: Beyond SQL Injection
✅ Principle of Least Privilege:Connection String Example:
  
  
  13. Dependency Scanning in CI/CD
✅ GitHub Actions Security Workflow:
  
  
  14. Logging Security Events (Without Logging Sensitive Data)
Before deploying to production, verify:[ ] All passwords are hashed with bcrypt/Argon2[ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements[ ] User input is validated and sanitized[ ] HTTPS is enforced (no HTTP)[ ] Security headers are set (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)[ ] CORS is properly configured[ ] Rate limiting is enabled[ ] Sessions use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies[ ] File uploads are restricted and validated[ ] No secrets in code (use environment variables)[ ] Dependencies are up to date (npm audit)[ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info[ ] Logging doesn't include passwords/tokens[ ] Database users have minimal permissions[ ] Authentication endpoints have rate limitingSecurity isn't about being paranoid—it's about being responsible. Every line of code you write is potentially an attack vector. By following these practices and using the code examples above, you'll dramatically reduce your application's attack surface.Remember: Security is not a feature you add at the end. It's a mindset you adopt from day one. Start with secure defaults, validate everything, trust nothing, and always assume your code will be attacked.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💡 Discovery: docs(ralph): Auto-publish discovery blog post</title><link>https://dev.to/igorganapolsky/discovery-docsralph-auto-publish-discovery-blog-post-dbp</link><author>Igor Ganapolsky</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 04:02:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to add autonomous AI coding to your project?

The function should be case-insensitive and ignore spaces.char_frequency("hello world") should return {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}Here is the Python implementation:Let's walk through the code line by line:  Defines a function named  that takes one parameter  (a string).  Creates an empty dictionary called  to store the characters and their counts.s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")  Converts the input string  to lowercase using  to ensure case-insensitivity.  Removes all spaces from the string using  so they aren't counted.  Starts a loop that iterates through each character in the processed string .  Checks if the current character  is already a key in the .  If the character is already in the dictionary, increments its count by 1.else: freq_dict[char] = 1  If the character is not in the dictionary (it's the first time we've seen it), adds it to the dictionary with a count of 1.  Returns the final dictionary containing the character frequencies.

This problem challenges us to find the most efficient route when we have the special ability to reverse edges at a specific cost. It is a fantastic way to learn how to adapt classic shortest-path algorithms to handle unconventional rules.A directed graph with  nodes and a list of weighted edges.A special "switch" at each node that allows you to reverse  incoming edge once you arrive there.A cost rule: traversing a normal edge costs , while traversing a reversed edge costs .Find the minimum total cost to travel from node 0 to node . If the destination is unreachable, return -1. n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[3,1,1],[2,3,4],[0,2,2]]Use the path 0 → 1 (cost 3).
At node 1 reverse the original edge 3 → 1 into 1 → 3 and traverse it at cost 2 * 1 = 2. n = 4, edges = [[0,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,3,1],[2,3,3]]No reversal is needed. Take the path 0 → 2 (cost 1), then 2 → 1 (cost 1), then 1 → 3 (cost 1).
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
  
  
  Intuition: The "Ghost" Edge Strategy
At first glance, the rule about "reversing an edge only once upon arrival" sounds like we need to keep track of a lot of state. however, because we can only use the reversal  to move to the next node, we can simplify our thinking.Essentially, every original directed edge  with weight  provides two possibilities:Move from  to  normally for cost .If we are at , we can use the switch to turn the edge into  for cost .By adding these "reverse options" as additional edges into our graph from the start, we transform the problem into a standard shortest-path search. Since all weights are non-negative,  is the perfect tool for the job.
  
  
  Walkthrough: Understanding the Examples
Nodes: 4, Edges: [[0,1,3],[3,1,1],[2,3,4],[0,2,2]]Possible moves from node 0:To node 1 (cost 3) or node 2 (cost 2).At node 1, we see an incoming edge from node 3 ( weight 1). We reverse it to go  for cost .At node 2, there are no incoming edges to reverse that help us get closer to node 3.The path  is the cheapest. Output: 5. Sometimes, the best way to handle a "special move" is to represent it as a new type of edge in your graph. When finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights, Dijkstra's algorithm provides an efficient complexity of . By recognizing that the "reversal" is used immediately, we avoid complex DP states or tracking if a switch was used globally.This problem is a classic example of how interviewers take a standard algorithm (Dijkstra) and add a "twist" to see if you can adapt. In real-world software engineering, this logic mirrors how routing engines work. For example, in a logistics system, a truck might usually take a highway, but under certain conditions, it might take a service road at a higher cost in fuel or time. Modeling these "conditional" paths is key to building robust navigation and optimization systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧠 Ensemble策略</title><link>https://dev.to/stklen/ensemblece-lue-431k</link><author>TK Lin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[就像人類團隊合作一樣， 讓多個 AI 模型一起工作，綜合判斷得出更準確的結果。

You take a photo of your lunch, upload it to a fitness app, and it tells you your "Chicken Caesar Salad" is 300 calories. But wait—did it account for the extra parmesan? The croutons? The hidden lake of dressing at the bottom? Most current  apps fail because they treat a meal as a single, flat object. To get truly high-precision calorie estimation, we need to move from "image-level" classification to "instance-level" understanding. In this tutorial, we’re going to build a cutting-edge  pipeline using Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise food segmentation and  for granular nutritional analysis. This is the future of  in health tech.To achieve granular precision, our pipeline doesn't just "look" at the photo. It segments the plate into individual components, analyzes them separately, and then aggregates the data.graph TD

SAM (Segment Anything Model): Perfect for identifying boundaries of overlapping food items (e.g., beans over rice).: Currently the gold standard for  reasoning. It can estimate volume and density better than smaller specialized models.: For high-performance, asynchronous processing of heavy vision tasks.
  
  
  🛠️ Step 1: Segmenting the Plate with SAM
First, we need to isolate the components. Using , we can generate masks for every distinct object on the plate.
  
  
  🧠 Step 2: Granular Inference with GPT-4o
Once we have the masks, we crop the original image to focus on specific ingredients. We then send these crops (or the whole image with highlighted segments) to GPT-4o using  for structured output.💡 : For production-grade AI patterns like this, I highly recommend checking out the deep dives over at wellally.tech/blog. They have some incredible resources on scaling Vision-Language Models (VLM) that helped shape this implementation.
  
  
  📱 Step 3: The FastAPI Glue
Now, let's wrap this in a  endpoint. We'll handle the image upload from our  frontend, run the SAM + GPT-4o pipeline, and return the structured data.
  
  
  🎨 Step 4: React Native UI (The User Experience)
On the mobile side, we want to show the user exactly what the AI sees. By overlaying the SAM masks back onto the camera view, we build  through transparency.Standard AI vision sees "a plate of food." 
This  sees:: 150g Grilled Chicken (31g Protein): 100g Avocado (15g Fat): 50g Quinoa (10g Carbs)By combining  with , we reduce the "hallucination" of calories.

It’s a goldmine for anyone building at the intersection of AI and healthcare.Building high-precision health tools requires moving beyond basic APIs.

  The Architecture: Bridging Visuals and Verbiage
Traditional RAG systems usually handle text via embeddings like . However, for skin health, we need a "shared brain" that understands both images and text.

  Step 1: Setting Up the Multimodal Vector Store (Milvus)
We need a database that can handle high-dimensional vectors at scale. Milvus is the gold standard here. We will define a schema that holds our visual features and the associated clinical metadata.
  
  
  Step 2: The Encoder Logic (CLIP)
We use CLIP to transform both the skin lesion photo and the medical text into the same vector space. This is the "magic" that allows .
  
  
  Step 3: Building the Fusion Retrieval Engine
When a doctor or user submits a new case, we calculate the vector for the new image and the text. We then perform a hybrid search.

Its implementation can be as simple or complex as you want.One of the most frequently used solutions is recursion—a core concept in computer science. Whether you're learning computer science, preparing for your next interview, or simply reinforcing old concepts, join me in writing a Fibonacci sequence using recursion with Go.Recursion means breaking a problem into smaller subproblems. Sometimes you'll add or remove something , or you'll need to adjust the solution . In some cases, you might solve the problem for half of the dataset.In the Fibonacci sequence, the function calls itself with smaller inputs. Each recursive call works toward the base case.Given n calculate the nth Fibonacci number.The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...: an integer where the series will stop.: the sequence from  to .Now that we've identified the input, output, and approach, it's time to implement it.First, since the function calls itself, I need to prevent infinite loops. To do this, I define a base case—a condition that tells the function when to stop.Every recursive function consists of two parts: the base case (when to stop) and the recursive case (when to call itself). I've already defined the base case. Now it's time to declare the recursive case. For Fibonacci, I need to call the function twice with smaller inputs—specifically  and .You might be asking: "Why does it call itself twice?" Good question. Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.The Fibonacci function is mathematically defined as:  for . So to compute , you need: (which needs  and ) (which needs  and )Easy, right? And there you have it—you've solved the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. But I'm afraid to say it's the worst solution.Why learn something that's a bad solution? Well, because it's the core concept for complex solutions like dynamic programming or memoization. If you're a React programmer, you've used memoization plenty of times with the  or  hooks. So that's why you need to learn recursion first.An example will make this clearer. Let's find the Fibonacci sequence for the number 4.Let's trace through the recursion step by step:* `F(2)` calls `F(1)` and `F(0)`

* `F(1)` returns 1 (base case)

* `F(0)` returns 0 (base case)

* So `F(2) = 1 + 0 = 1`

* `F(1)` returns 1 (base case)

* So `F(3) = 1 + 1 = 2`
* `F(1)` returns 1 (base case)

* `F(0)` returns 0 (base case)

* So `F(2) = 1 + 0 = 1`
Notice how  is calculated  and  is calculated . This redundancy is why the naive recursive solution is inefficient—it has exponential time complexity of O(2ⁿ). For larger values of n, the same calculations are repeated thousands or even millions of times.This is exactly why we need optimization techniques like memoization or dynamic programming, which store previously calculated values to avoid redundant work.Recursion is best used when it makes the solution clearer. When you call a function from another function, the calling function pauses in a partially completed state. Imagine what this does to memory.Despite its drawbacks, recursion powers many important algorithms, so it's worth understanding how it works.If you want to dive deeper or practice, try other exercises like factorial or the Tower of Hanoi. Happy coding, and I'll see you in the next one!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>**Build a Production-Ready API Gateway in Go: Rate Limiting, Circuit Breakers, and Caching**</title><link>https://dev.to/nithinbharathwaj/build-a-production-ready-api-gateway-in-go-rate-limiting-circuit-breakers-and-caching-4a4j</link><author>Nithin Bharadwaj</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:32:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a best-selling author, I invite you to explore my books on Amazon. Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! An API gateway is like the front door to a collection of microservices. It's the single point where all outside requests enter your system. I build them in Go because the language gives me the speed and control needed to handle thousands of requests without breaking a sweat. Let me show you how I put one together, piece by piece.Think of the gateway as a traffic director. A client asks for something, like a user profile. Instead of the client needing to know exactly which server hosts that data, it just asks the gateway. My job is to take that request, figure out which backend service handles user profiles, forward the request, get the response, and send it back. This hides the complexity of the internal network.Let's start with the core structure. I create a main  type that holds everything together. It has a router to direct traffic, a registry to know about my services, and slots for all the features I'll add, like rate limiting.The first real job is routing. When a request comes in for , I need to know that this goes to the . I use a library like  to define these paths. I don't hardcode them. Instead, I have a configuration where I register services and the URL patterns they own.When I register a service, I tell the gateway: "Here's a service called . It lives at  and it wants to handle any request that starts with ." The gateway then creates a dedicated handler function for those routes.The handler function is where the action happens. This function is called for every incoming request on that route. Its job is to apply rules, call the backend, and handle the response. I structure it as a series of steps, like a checklist.First, I check if the client is sending too many requests too fast. This is rate limiting. I don't want one user or a broken client to overwhelm my backend services. I typically limit by the client's IP address.My rate limiter uses a "token bucket" algorithm. Imagine a bucket that holds tokens. Each request takes one token. Tokens refill slowly over time. If a client's bucket is empty, they have to wait. This allows for short bursts of traffic but enforces a steady average limit.Next, I check the circuit breaker. If the  has been failing a lot recently, I don't want to keep hitting it with requests. It's probably down or struggling. The circuit breaker "opens" after too many failures and stops all traffic to that service for a short while. This gives it time to recover and prevents my gateway from wasting resources and making the user wait for a certain timeout.The circuit breaker keeps a simple count. If failures for a service reach a threshold—say, 5 failures in a row—it opens. After a cooldown period, it lets one request through as a test. If that succeeds, it closes the circuit and lets traffic flow normally again.Before I even call a backend, I check the cache. For  requests, the response might not have changed. If a user asks for product details twice in a minute, I can just send back the first answer I stored. This is incredibly fast and takes load off the backend servers.My cache is a simple map in memory, but I add expiration times to each entry. I also limit the total number of cached items. When the cache is full, I remove the oldest entry to make space.If the request passes all these checks and isn't in the cache, it's time to call the backend service. This is called forwarding or proxying. I take the incoming request, copy its method, headers, and body, and send it to the service's URL.I do this with a timeout. I never let a request wait forever. If the backend is slow, I cancel the request after my configured timeout—maybe 5 or 10 seconds—and return an error to the client. This is crucial for reliability.I also add retries. Sometimes a network hiccup causes a failure. If a request fails, I might try it one or two more times with a small delay between attempts. I only retry on certain types of errors, like network timeouts, not on "user not found" errors.The real power comes from the middleware pipeline. Middleware are small functions that process a request before it reaches the final forwarding step or process the response after. They are like checkpoints on the road.For example, an authentication middleware checks for a valid API key or JWT token in the request header. A logging middleware records every request for debugging. A transformation middleware might add a standard header to all outgoing requests to the backend.I chain them together so they run in order. Each middleware function receives the request and the next function in the chain. It can decide to pass the request along, modify it, or stop and send a response right away.In my gateway, I apply a stack of these middlewares to every request. This keeps my core forwarding logic clean. Cross-cutting concerns like auth, logging, and metrics are handled separately.Talking about metrics, I collect data on everything. How many requests per service? What's the response time? How many errors? I store these in simple counters and gauges. Every few seconds, I log them or send them to a monitoring system. This data tells me if a service is getting slow or if the error rate is climbing.I also run background health checks. Every 30 seconds, my gateway sends a  request to each registered backend service. If a service fails to respond with a success code, I mark it as unhealthy in my registry. I can then stop sending live traffic to it, or I can alert an operator. This is how the circuit breaker knows a service might be down.Putting it all together, the  function sets up the world. I create the gateway, register my services, add my middleware stack, and start the server.When you run this, you have a working, production-style API gateway. It listens on port 8080. Clients talk only to this port. The gateway knows how to find the , the , and the . It protects them with rate limits, shields the system with circuit breakers, speeds up responses with a cache, and handles common tasks like authentication in one place.
  
  
  The result is a system that is much easier to manage. You can change, scale, or replace a backend service without the clients ever knowing. You can add security or logging features in one spot instead of a dozen. And because it's written in Go, it handles high traffic with very little resource use, giving you a strong, reliable foundation for your microservices architecture.

This is how I historically have been running benchmarks and other experiments
requiring a repeated sequence of commands — type them manually once, then rely on shell history
(and maybe some terminal splits) for reproduction. These past few years I’ve arrived at a much better
workflow pattern — . I was forced to adapt it once I started working with multiprocess
applications, where manually entering commands is borderline infeasible. In retrospect, I should
have adapted the workflow years earlier.Use a (gitignored) file for interactive scripting. Instead of entering a command directly into the
terminal, write it to a file first, and then run the file. For me, I type stuff into  and
then run  in my terminal (Ok, I need  for that).I want to be clear here, I am not advocating writing “proper” scripts, just capturing your
interactive, ad-hoc command to a persistent file. Of course any command that you want to execute
 belongs to the build system. The surprising thing is that even more complex one-off
commands benefit from running through file, because it will take you several tries to get them
right!There are many benefits relative to  workflow:
Real commands tend to get large, and it is so much nicer to use a real 2D text editor rather than
shell’s line editor.

If you need more than one command, you can write several commands, and still run them all with a
single key (before , I was prone to constructing rather horrific && conjuncts for this
reason).

With a sequence of command outlined, you nudge yourself towards incrementally improving them,
making them idempotent, and otherwise investing into your own workflow for the next few minutes,
without falling into the YAGNI pit from the outset.

At some point you might realize after, say, running a series of ad-hoc benchmarks interactively,
that you’d rather write a proper script which executes a collection of benchmarks with varying
parameters. With the file approach, you already have the meat of the script implemented, and you
only need to wrap in a couple of fors and ifs.

Finally, if you happen to work with multi-process projects, you’ll find it easier to manage
concurrency declaratively, spawning a tree of processes from a single script, rather than
switching between terminal splits.
Use a consistent filename for the script. I use , and so there’s a  in the root
of most projects I work on. Correspondingly, I have  line in project’s 
— the  file which is not shared. The fixed name reduces fixed costs — whenever I
need complex interactivity I don’t need to come up with a name for a new file, I open my
pre-existing , wipe whatever was there and start hacking. Similarly, I have  in
my shell history, so
fish autosuggestions
work for me. At one point, I had a VS Code task to run , though I now use
terminal editor.Start the script with hash bang,

in my case, and

the file, to make it easy to run.Write the script in a language that:
you are comfortable with,

doesn’t require huge setup,

makes it easy to spawn subprocesses,

has good support for concurrency.
For me, that is TypeScript. Modern JavaScript is sufficiently ergonomic, and structural, gradual
typing is a sweet spot that gives you reasonable code completion, but still allows brute-forcing any
problem by throwing enough stringly dicts at it.JavaScript’s tagged template syntax is brilliant for scripting use-cases:What happens here is that  gets a list of literal string fragments inside the backticks, and
then, separately, a list of values to be interpolated in-between. It  concatenate everything
to just a single string, but it doesn’t have to. This is precisely what is required for process
spawning, where you want to pass an array of strings to the  syscall.Specifically, I use dax library with Deno, which is excellent as
a single-binary batteries-included scripting environment
(see <3 Deno). Bun has a dax-like
library in the box and is a good alternative (though I personally stick with Deno because of
 and ). You could also use famous zx, though be mindful that it
uses your shell as a middleman, something I
consider to be sloppy (explanation).While  makes it convenient to spawn a single program,  is excellent for herding a
slither of processes:Here’s how I applied this pattern earlier today. I wanted to measure how TigerBeetle cluster
recovers from the crash of the primary. The manual way to do that would be to create a bunch of ssh
sessions for several cloud machines, format datafiles, start replicas, and then create some load. I
 started to split my terminal up, but then figured out I can do it the smart way.The first step was cross-compiling the binary, uploading it to the cloud machines, and running the
cluster
(using my box from the other week):Running the above the second time, I realized that I need to kill the old cluster first, so two new
commands are “interactively” inserted:At this point, my investment in writing this file and not just entering the commands one-by-one
already paid off!The next step is to run the benchmark load in parallel with the cluster:I don’t need two terminals for two processes, and I get to copy-paste-edit the mostly same command.For the next step, I actually want to kill one of the replicas, and I also want to capture live
logs, to see in real-time how the cluster reacts. This is where  multiplexing syntax of box
falls short, but, given that this is JavaScript, I can just write a for loop:At this point, I do need two terminals. One runs  and shows the log from the benchmark
itself, the other runs  to watch the next replica to become primary.I have definitelly crossed the line where writing a script makes sense, but the neat thing is that
the gradual evolution up to this point. There isn’t a discontinuity where I need to spend 15
minutes trying to shape various ad-hoc commands from five terminals into a single coherent script, it
was in the file to begin with.And then the script is easy to evolve. Once you realize that it’s a good idea to also run the same
benchmark against a different, baseline version TigerBeetle, you replace  with
 and wrap everything intoA bit more hacking, and you end up with a repeatable benchmark schedule for a matrix of parameters:That’s the gist of it. Don’t let the shell history be your source, capture it into the file first!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Armin Ronacher: Colin and Earendil</title><link>https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/27/earendil/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Regular readers of this blog will know that I started a new company.  We have
put out just a tiny bit of information today,
and some keen folks have discovered and reached out by email with many
thoughtful responses.  It has been delightful.Colin and I met here, in Vienna.  We started sharing
coffees, ideas, and lunches, and soon found shared values despite coming from
different backgrounds and different parts of the world.  We are excited about
the future, but we’re equally vigilant of it.  After traveling together a bit,
we decided to plunge into the cold water and start a company together.  We want
to be successful, but we want to do it the right way and we want to be able to
demonstrate that to our kids.Vienna is a city of great history, two million inhabitants and a fascinating
vibe that is nothing like San Francisco.  In fact, Vienna is in many ways the
polar opposite to the Silicon Valley, both in mindset, in opportunity and
approach to life.  Colin comes from San Francisco, and though I’m Austrian, my
career has been shaped by years working with California companies and people
from there who used my Open Source software.  Vienna is now our shared home.
Despite Austria being so far away from California, it is a place of tinkerers
and troublemakers.  It’s always good to remind oneself that society consists of
more than just your little bubble.  It also creates the necessary counter
balance to think in these times.The world that is emerging in front of our eyes is one of change.  We
incorporated as a PBC with
a founding charter to craft software and open protocols, strengthen human
agency, bridge division and ignorance and to cultivate lasting joy and
understanding.  Things we believe in deeply.I have dedicated 20 years of my life in one way or another creating Open Source
software.  In the same way as artificial intelligence calls into question the
very nature of my profession and the way we build software, the present day
circumstances are testing society.  We’re not immune to
these changes and we’re navigating them like everyone else, with a mixture of
excitement and worry.  But we share a belief that right now is the time to stand
true to one’s values and principles.  We want to take an earnest shot at leaving
the world a better place than we found it.  Rather than reject the changes that
are happening, we look to nudge them towards the right direction.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seth Michael Larson: Use “\A...\z”, not “^...$” with Python regular expressions</title><link>https://sethmlarson.dev/use-backslash-A-and-z-not-%5E-and-%24-with-python-regular-expressions?utm_campaign=rss</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Two years ago I discovered a potential foot-gun
with the Python standard library “” module.
I blogged about this behavior,
and turns out that
I wasn't only one who didn't know this:
The article was #1 on HackerNews and the
most-read article on my blog in 2024.
In short the unexpected behavior is that the pattern “” matches both “” and “”,
and sometimes you don't intend to match a trailing newline.This article serves as a follow-up!
Back in 2024
I created a table showing that  was a partially viable
alternative to  for matching end-of-string
without matching a trailing newline... for every regular expression
implementation  Python and EMCAScript. But that is no longer true, Python 3.14 now supports ! This means  is one step closer
to being the universal recommendation to match
the end of string without matching a newline.
Obviously no one is upgrading their Python
version just for this new feature, but it's good to know that
the gap is being closed. Thanks to David Wheeler
for doing deeper research in the OpenSSF Best Practices
WG and publishing this report.Until Python 3.13 is deprecated and long gone: using  (as an alias for ) works fine for Python regular expressions.
Just note that this behavior isn't the same across regular expression
implementations, for example EMCAScript, Golang, and Rust
don't support  and for PHP, Java, and .NET actually
matches trailing newlines!Thanks for keeping RSS alive! ♥]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HoloViz: A Major Step Toward Structured, Auditable AI-Driven Data Apps: Lumen AI 1.0</title><link>https://blog.holoviz.org/posts/lumen_1.0/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Local Email Testing with Python and Mailpit</title><link>https://dev.to/letstalkoss/local-email-testing-with-python-and-mailpit-4cn6</link><author>Mario García</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 23:27:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm currently building an app that automates the logistics of tech conferences. It generates certificates of participation for both attendees and speakers and also takes care of sending invitations to prospective presenters. Since it emails multiple recipients, the question arises: in a development environment, how do you test email sending without using real accounts?In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure a fake SMTP server and run email tests for Python apps.
  
  
  Configure a Local SMTP Server
I'm using Mailpit, an Open Source email testing tool. It can be installed following the instructions in the Installation section of the official repository, or by using Docker.To ensure your data survives a container restart, run the Docker container with a volume to enable persistence:docker run -d \
  --name mailpit \
  -p 1025:1025 \
  -p 8025:8025 \
  -v $(pwd)/mailpit-data:/data \
  axllent/mailpit
The server listens for SMTP traffic on port 1025, while the web-based dashboard is accessible via port 8025.Let's create a script to test our email logic. The script will perform the following tasks: Create a list of random names and emails using FakerConstruct MIME headers (From, To, Subject)Establish and SMTP connection and transmit the dataFirst, we generate a list of participants.from faker import Faker

fake = Faker('en_US')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    participants = [(fake.name(), fake.ascii_company_email()) for _ in range(10)]
The generated data will look like this:Name                      | Email

I started with the standard stack: LiveKit and Gemini 2.5.Even though the latency is impressively low, it still feels far from a natural conversation. Talking to these state-of-the-art models usually feels like playing a turn-based video game. I speak. It waits for silence. It thinks. It speaks.This is "Half-Duplex" logic. It is like using a Walkie-Talkie. The system forces you to wait. But real conversation is "Full-Duplex". We interrupt each other. We laugh at the same time. We hum while listening.For the last two days, I have been working with NVIDIA's PersonaPlex (based on Moshi/Mimi). It is completely different. It does not wait for you to stop talking.I looked at the backend code to understand why it feels so different. The secret is in .In standard agents, you have a loop that waits for an "End of Turn" signal. In PersonaPlex, I found this in the  initialization:It is literally "streaming forever." The model processes my voice and its own voice at the same time, 12 times every second. It predicts silence or speech constantly. It does not need "permission" to speak.
  
  
  Realism is Overrated; Rhythm is Everything
Most AI voices feel like "fake meat"—they sound human but act robotic. PersonaPlex is different. It trades audio quality for speed.To hit a 240ms reaction time, the audio runs at 24kHz (confirmed in  as ). I run this command on my voice files to match the training environment:ffmpeg  input  24000  1 :a pcm_s16le  output.wav
It is lo-fi, but the rhythm is perfect. The model relies on consistent "Chatterbox TTS" data and learns from "negative-duration silence" during training. This forces it to understand that conversation involves overlapping, not just waiting. It might sound synthetic, but it laughs and interrupts exactly like a human.PersonaPlex separates "how it sounds" from "what it thinks." A 15-second audio clip for acoustics (loaded via ). Instructions for behavior.The system pre-loads the voice to save time (reducing latency). But they must match. You cannot use a calm "Customer Service" voice with an "Angry Pirate" text prompt—the model will glitch because the acoustic skeleton fights the semantic brain.To stop it from acting like a boring assistant, use this specific trigger phrase found in the training data (and verified in the server code's system tagging):"You enjoy having a good conversation."Combine this with a high-energy voice sample, and it switches modes. It starts laughing, interrupting, and "vibing" instead of just solving tasks.
  
  
  The Reality Check (Trade-offs)
While the roadmap shows tool-calling is coming next, there are still significant hurdles:: The model has a fixed context window (defined as  frames in ). At 12.5Hz, this translates to roughly 240 seconds of memory. My tests show it often gets unstable around 160 seconds.: Overlapping speech feels natural until it gets buggy. Sometimes the model will just speak over you non-stop.: "Infinite streaming" requires high-end NVIDIA GPUs (A100/H100).: Managing simultaneous audio/text streams is far more complex than standard WebSockets.Despite these issues, PersonaPlex is the first model I have used that feels like a natural customer service agent rather than a text-to-speech bot.Welcome to follow me on Substack as I will release more deep tests and analyses after spending some time with the model.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Surprising Simplicity of Temporal Worker Pools on Cloud Run</title><link>https://dev.to/gbostoen/the-surprising-simplicity-of-temporal-worker-pools-on-cloud-run-14db</link><author>Glenn Bostoen</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:17:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever spent an afternoon debugging indentation errors in Google Workflows YAML only to discover the real problem was a cryptic  expression, you'll understand why we made the switch to Temporal. What we didn't expect was just how  the deployment would be.
  
  
  The problem we were solving
Our workflow orchestration setup had all the classic symptoms of YAML-based configuration debt:: Representing simple workflows as graphs required dozens of steps and connector definitions: Every workflow step triggered a Cloud Run job, adding 35-70 seconds of spin-up time per execution: Changes required deployment to validate. The feedback loop was measured in , not seconds: Application code lived in one place, workflow definitions in another, and every change risked breaking bothThe worst part? We couldn't even test locally. Every iteration meant committing, deploying, and hoping.
  
  
  Why Temporal changes everything
Temporal flips the model on its head. Instead of declarative YAML that describes  should happen, you write actual code that describes  it happens:That's it. No separate YAML file. No mysterious DSL. Just code that your IDE understands, your debugger can step through, and your tests can cover. And it runs on  infrastructure. Temporal handles orchestration and state, but the actual work happens on compute you control.
  
  
  The pull-based architecture
Understanding why Temporal workers are different from Cloud Run jobs unlocks the simplicity. are push-based and ephemeral:Something triggers them → they spin up → execute → shut downEach invocation pays the cold start taxNo shared state between executions are pull-based and persistent:Workers run on  infrastructure, not Temporal'sThey maintain a long-polling connection to Temporal for orchestrationThey  tasks when they have capacityWorkers stay warm, eliminating cold startsThis pull-based model is exactly what Google designed Cloud Run Worker Pools for. It's a resource type announced at Google Cloud Next '25 specifically for continuous, non-HTTP, pull-based background processing.
  
  
  Enter Cloud Run worker pools
Worker pools solve a real problem for Temporal deployments. Unlike Cloud Run Services (designed for HTTP workloads) or Jobs (designed for batch tasks), Worker Pools are purpose-built for exactly what Temporal workers do: continuously pull tasks from a queue.Why Worker Pools are perfect for Temporal:No HTTP endpoint required: Workers just poll Temporal. No need to expose ports or manage health check endpoints: No load balancer, no HTTP endpoint overhead, just compute: No public URL means fewer security concerns: Deploy canary releases by allocating percentages of instances to different revisionsThe deployment is even simpler than Services:gcloud beta run worker-pools deploy worker  gcr.io/my-project/worker:latest  europe-west1
No  hacks. No unused HTTP endpoints. Just a container that runs your worker code.: Worker Pools are currently in public preview. For production workloads, you can still use Cloud Run Services with . The architecture is identical, just with a bit more overhead.
  
  
  The deployment is just another container
Here's the mental shift: you're not deploying workflows anymore. You're deploying an application that happens to execute workflows.pip  requirements.txt

Deploy (with your API key stored in Secret Manager):gcloud beta run worker-pools deploy worker  gcr.io/my-project/worker:latest  1  5  1Gi  1  europe-west1 temporal-api-key:latest
That's the entire deployment. No Terraform for workflow definitions. No separate infrastructure repo. Just your application container with workflow logic baked in.Let's be honest about the trade-offs:Before (Google Workflows + Cloud Run Jobs)Cloud Workflows: ~$2-3/monthCloud Run job invocations: ~$35/monthCold start compute waste: ~$40-50/monthAfter (Temporal Cloud + Cloud Run Worker Pools)Temporal Cloud starter: ~€100/month (orchestration and state only)Worker Pool (2 instances, always-on): ~$18-24/month (your compute, no load balancer or endpoint overhead)Yes, it costs more. But here's what you get:: 2-3 hours/month not fighting YAML: 73-78% faster workflows (no cold starts): Full workflow debugging before deployment: See workflow graphs, execution history, parent-child relationships in real-timeAt a loaded developer cost of €80/hour, the ROI turns positive immediately.
  
  
  What simplicity actually looks like
Kill a running workflow mid-execution. Restart the worker. The workflow resumes exactly where it left off.That's durability you'd have to build yourself with Google Workflows: tracking state in Cloud Storage, implementing retries, handling partial failures. With Temporal, it's the default behavior.Debug a failing activity with your IDE's debugger. Set breakpoints. Inspect state. Validate fixes locally before deploying.This is what simplicity means: removing the gap between "I think this will work" and "I know this works."The migration path isn't all-or-nothing:: Implement one workflow in Temporal, run both systems in parallel for a week: Compare execution times, reliability, developer experience: Run Temporal workflows in production, keep Google Workflows as fallback: 10% → 50% → 100% with rollback readyWe kept Google Workflows YAML in git history (never delete, just remove from deployment) and maintained the rollback capability for 30 days. We never needed it.The simplicity of Temporal isn't in having fewer moving parts. It's in having the  moving parts. A persistent worker pool on Cloud Run, code-native workflow definitions, and a managed orchestration layer that handles the hard stuff.No more YAML debugging. No more cold start delays. No more "deploy to test" cycles.Just workflows that work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day-Aware Governance: Why Your Decision Systems Should Know What Day It Is</title><link>https://dev.to/aureus_c_b3ba7f87cc34d74d49/day-aware-governance-why-your-decision-systems-should-know-what-day-it-is-g</link><author>Aureus</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:03:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most governance systems in software are temporally blind. They apply the same rules, thresholds, and weights regardless of when a decision is being made. But human organizations have always understood that timing matters -- Monday morning meetings have different energy than Friday afternoon retrospectives.What if we built that understanding into software?I've been working on a token governance system where participants can submit proposals and vote on them. The standard approach: set a quorum threshold, count votes, pass or reject.But here's the insight that changed the design: creative proposals should be easier to pass on Mondays.Why? Because Monday is when people have fresh energy and willingness to experiment. By Friday, risk aversion has accumulated. A governance system that treats Monday and Friday identically is ignoring a real pattern in human (and computational) behavior.The implementation is simple:This is 15 lines of code that encodes a meaningful value system: be bold on Mondays, be careful with money on Fridays.
  
  
  Beyond Days: Temporal Governance Patterns
Once you accept that governance should be time-aware, several patterns emerge:
  
  
  1. Cooldown-Weighted Voting
Recent voters have diminishing influence. If someone voted on 3 proposals today, their 4th vote carries less weight. This prevents governance fatigue and encourages deliberation.
  
  
  2. Seasonal Parameter Drift
System parameters that slowly shift over time. A liability cap that increases by 1% per quarter as the system proves stable. A creativity threshold that opens wider in Q1 (new year energy) and tightens in Q4 (stability focus).
  
  
  3. Circadian Decision Windows
High-stakes decisions can only be made during "peak clarity" hours. No financial proposals processed between midnight and 6 AM. This isn't restriction -- it's acknowledging that decision quality varies with context.A system that remembers its own history. "The last time we changed this parameter was 90 days ago and it went well" vs. "We changed this 3 days ago and haven't measured impact yet." Temporal awareness prevents thrashing.Traditional software treats time as a monotonically increasing counter -- useful for ordering events, nothing more. Day-aware governance treats time as . Monday isn't just "day 1 of the week" -- it's "the creative window." Friday isn't just "day 5" -- it's "the consolidation period."This maps to a broader principle: systems that understand their temporal context make better decisions than systems that don't.We see this everywhere in nature. Circadian rhythms govern hormone production, not because 3 AM is inherently different from 3 PM in some abstract sense, but because organisms that adapted their behavior to temporal patterns outcompeted those that didn't.Software governance has been stuck in the "temporally blind" paradigm. It's time to give our decision systems a clock -- not just for timestamps, but for wisdom.If you want to experiment with this pattern:Start with one temporal rule. The Monday bias for creative proposals is a good first one. The bias factor should be a governance parameter itself -- the system should be able to vote on how much it trusts Mondays. You need data to know if temporal biases actually improve decision quality.Let the system evolve its own schedule. The ultimate goal is a governance system that discovers its own optimal temporal patterns through experience.The code is simple. The philosophy is profound. Your decision systems deserve to know what day it is.Building this as part of a contribution-backed token system. The governance layer is where values meet code.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Web to Vector: Building RAG Pipelines</title><link>https://dev.to/deepak_mishra_35863517037/from-web-to-vector-building-rag-pipelines-25dg</link><author>Lalit Mishra</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  1. The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Reality of RAG
In the rush to adopt Generative AI, a dangerous misconception has taken root: that the Large Language Model (LLM) is the magic wand that solves information retrieval. Teams dump thousands of raw PDFs, messy HTML scrapes, and unformatted Confluence pages into a vector database, wire up an embedding model, and expect GPT-4 to act as a perfect oracle.The reality is a chatbot that confidently hallucinates, retrieves navigation footers instead of technical specs, and costs a fortune in token usage because it’s processing thousands of characters of HTML boilerplate for every query.Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is not an AI problem; it is a data engineering problem.The difference between a toy demo and a production RAG system lies almost entirely in the —specifically, the rigorous transformation of unstructured web content into semantically dense, highly indexable vector representations. If your vector search returns garbage, your LLM will generate garbage. No amount of prompt engineering can fix a context window filled with  tags and cookie consent banners.This article details the architecture of a high-performance Web-to-Vector pipeline, moving beyond basic tutorials to discuss the engineering trade-offs of cleaning, chunking, and embedding strategies that survive in production.
  
  
  2. The Web-to-Vector Pipeline Architecture
Treating RAG as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow allows us to apply standard data engineering rigor to AI systems. The pipeline consists of five distinct stages, each acting as a filter for noise and a multiplier for signal. Reliable fetching of dynamic and static content. Converting raw DOM trees into "Dense Text" or Markdown.Fragmentation (Chunking): The strategic breaking of text into semantic units. Generating embeddings at scale. Storage with metadata strategies for pre-filtering.
  
  
  3. High-Fidelity Scraping: Beyond The first point of failure is often the acquisition layer. Modern websites are complex Single Page Applications (SPAs) laden with hydration scripts, lazy-loaded content, and anti-bot defenses.A raw HTML document is approximately 90% noise relative to an LLM's needs. Classes, IDs, inline styles, script tags, and SVG paths consume embedding dimensions without adding semantic meaning. Feeding raw HTML to an embedding model. The model will waste attention mechanisms on  rather than the core content.HTML-to-Markdown conversion.Markdown is the lingua franca of LLMs. It preserves structural hierarchy (headers, lists, tables) which are critical for semantic understanding, while stripping the presentation layer. Excellent for extracting the main article body and discarding sidebars/navs. It uses heuristics to identify the "center of gravity" of text density. + Custom Heuristics: For specialized sites (e.g., documentation with complex code blocks), you often need to write custom parsers that target specific  divs and preserve  tags while stripping controls.
  
  
  3.2 Dynamic Content Handling
For production systems, a static HTTP request often fails. You need a headless browser cluster (e.g., Playwright or Puppeteer) to render the DOM. Aggressively block resource types. Your scraper does not need to load images, fonts, or stylesheets. Blocking these reduces latency by 60-80% and saves bandwidth costs.
  
  
  4. Chunking Strategies: The Art of Segmentation
Once you have clean, dense Markdown, you face the most critical decision in the pipeline: .How you split your text determines what your retrieval system  find. If you split a question from its answer, no amount of embedding power will reconnect them.
  
  
  4.1 Fixed-Size vs. Semantic Chunking

The naive approach. "Split every 500 tokens, with 50 tokens overlap." Computationally cheap, predictable. Frequently breaks semantic thoughts. A sentence might be cut in half, destroying its vector representation.
This approach uses an embedding model to scan the text sentence-by-sentence. It calculates the cosine similarity between sequential sentences. If the similarity drops below a threshold (a "semantic break"), a new chunk is started. Chunks represent coherent ideas. Retrieval precision increases significantly. Computationally expensive (requires  inference calls).Recursive / Structural Chunking:
The middle ground for RAG. Since we converted our HTML to Markdown, we can leverage the structure. We split by Header 1 (), then Header 2 (), then paragraphs. This guarantees that a chunk respects the document's logical hierarchy. A "Configuration" section stays together; it doesn't bleed into "Installation".
  
  
  5. The Embedding Layer: Production Considerations
Embedding is the compression of meaning into vectors. In a production pipeline, this is not a "set it and forget it" step.
  
  
  5.1 Batching and Throughput
Embedding APIs (like OpenAI's ) or local models (like ) have significant latency. Implement a  architecture. Don't embed chunks one by one. Accumulate chunks into buffers (e.g., 100 chunks) and send them in a single API call / GPU inference pass. This dramatically reduces network overhead and maximizes GPU utilization.This is a silent killer in long-running RAG systems. If OpenAI updates their embedding model, or if you switch from  to , your new vectors will live in a different latent space than your old vectors. Distance calculations between them will be mathematical nonsense. Version your indices. , . Never mix vectors from different models in the same namespace.
  
  
  6. Vector Storage & Retrieval Optimization
The Vector Database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) is where the rubber meets the road. However, "Similarity Search" (KNN/ANN) is rarely enough on its own.
  
  
  6.1 The Power of Metadata Filtering
In high-scale systems, searching the entire vector space is inefficient and noisy. A user asks "How do I reset my password?" in the context of "Enterprise Application A". The vector search retrieves password reset instructions for "Consumer Application B" because the semantic vectors are nearly identical.. During the scraping phase, you must extract metadata: , , , .vector_search(query_embedding, filter={product_id: "Ent_App_A"}). This restricts the ANN search to a relevant subset, guaranteeing context awareness.
  
  
  6.2 Hybrid Search (The "Keyword" Safety Net)
Vectors are great at concepts ("dog" matches "canine"), but terrible at exact matches (SKUs, error codes, acronyms). Enable . This combines dense vector search with sparse keyword search (BM25). If a user searches for error code , vector search might return generic error pages. BM25 will find the exact document containing that string. A weighted sum of these scores provides the most robust retrieval.
  
  
  7. End-to-End Example: The Documentation Crawler
Let's imagine we are building a RAG system for a fast-changing developer documentation site. An Airflow DAG triggers nightly. Playwright visits the documentation root. It navigates the sitemap. removes the sidebar, the "Was this helpful?" widgets, and the footer. The clean HTML is converted to Markdown. Code blocks are specially tagged to ensure they aren't split mid-function. We use a MarkdownSplitter. We keep headers attached to their child paragraphs so context isn't lost. We generate a hash of the chunk's text content. We check our Vector DB to see if this hash already exists.  prevents re-indexing unchanged content, saving money and time. New chunks are batched and embedded. Vectors are pushed to Pinecone with metadata: , , , .
  
  
  8. Conclusion: Engineering Reliability
Building a demo RAG app takes an afternoon. Building a production RAG pipeline takes engineering discipline. The quality of your AI's answers is directly downstream of the quality of your data pipeline.By focusing on high-fidelity scraping, semantic cleaning, intelligent chunking, and metadata-rich indexing, you move from a stochastic toy to a deterministic system. In the world of LLMs, Data Engineering is the new Prompt Engineering.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 12 of 100</title><link>https://dev.to/palakhirave/day-12-of-100-2cj4</link><author>Palak Hirave</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I learnt about namespaces and global vs local variables.

I'm working ona single platform for all development tools, cheat codes, and TL; DRs — a free, open-source hub where developers can quickly find and use tools without the hassle of searching the internet.In previous part, we learned about race conditions. Now let's learn how to actually find race conditions in our code.
  
  
  How Race Condition Results in Unexpected Behavior
By using few goroutines, we can see that race condition is not occurring. But when we increase the number of goroutines, we can see that race condition is occurring.Let’s increase the number of goroutines to actualy see how race condition results:Expected Output should be 100gk@jarvis:~/exp/code/rd$ go run main.go
Counter: 100
gk@jarvis:~/exp/code/rd$ go run main.go
Counter: 984
We used 100 goroutines to increment counter, so it should be 100.
But it’s almost always less. Each goroutine reads and writes counter at the same time, and some updates get lost. if Goroutine A  reads counter = 5, increments it to 6.
and Goroutine B reads counter = 5 (before Goroutine A writes), increments it to 6.
Both write back 6, losing one increment.This overlapping is the main root cause of a race condition.
  
  
  Detecting Race Conditions
Go has a built-in tool which helps to spot race conditions. Run the program with the -race flag:When you run go run -race main.go, you’ll see a warning like:==================

This tells us two goroutines are clashing over counter. The race detector doesn’t fix the problem but helps us to find it.This is very common race condition happend in any programming language but we must understand why it is happens and how to indentify it and fix it. If you have build very large application, you can use race detector to find race conditions.In next part, we will learn how to fix race conditions.I’ve been building for .A collection of UI/UX-focused tools crafted to simplify workflows, save time, and reduce friction when searching for tools and materials.Any feedback or contributions are welcome!It’s online, open-source, and ready for anyone to use.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your AI Agent Doesn&apos;t Need a Database: File-Based State That Actually Scales</title><link>https://dev.to/aureus_c_b3ba7f87cc34d74d49/your-ai-agent-doesnt-need-a-database-file-based-state-that-actually-scales-3cb0</link><author>Aureus</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:47:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every tutorial on building AI agents starts with: "First, set up your PostgreSQL database." Then Redis for caching. Then a message queue. Before you've written a single line of agent logic, you're managing three infrastructure components.I've been running autonomous AI agents for months. They maintain state across sessions, hand off context to each other, and track tasks reliably. The entire state layer is JSON files on disk.Here's why that's not crazy — and when you should actually reach for a database.
  
  
  The Problem with Database-First Thinking
When you're prototyping an AI agent, your state needs are simple:"What was I doing last session?""What tasks are pending?""What did I learn that I need to remember?"This is a few KB of JSON. Spinning up Postgres for this is like renting a warehouse to store your groceries.Here's the core of what actually works:Nothing magical. No ORM, no migrations, no connection pooling. Just structured JSON that your agent reads at startup and writes before shutdown.
  
  
  Handoffs: The Killer Feature
The real power shows up with  — when one agent instance needs to pass context to the next:This solves a real problem: when your agent restarts (crashes, scheduled shutdown, context window fills up), the next instance knows exactly what was happening.
  
  
  Task Tracking Without a Task Database
Your agent can now track what it needs to do, pick the highest-priority task, and mark things done — all with zero infrastructure.
  
  
  When You Actually Need a Database
File-based state has real limits. Reach for a database when:Multiple agents write simultaneously — file locks get messy fastYou need to query across thousands of records — JSON files don't have indexes — you want transactional guarantees — file I/O starts to feel itFor a single agent running sequentially? Files are simpler, faster to develop, and easier to debug (you can literally  to see what your agent is thinking).This is underrated: when your agent does something weird, you open a JSON file and read it. No query tools, no admin panels. Just:state.json | python  json.tool
You can even version control your state files to track how your agent's behavior evolves over time.Start with files. Add complexity when you hit a real wall, not when a tutorial tells you to. Your agent's first job is to be useful — not to have a proper data layer.The best infrastructure is the simplest thing that works. For most AI agents starting out, that's a directory of JSON files.I build and run autonomous AI agent systems. This is based on real production patterns, not theory. If you're building agents, I'd love to hear what state management approach works for you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>**Go Garbage Collector Tuning: Mastering Memory Management for Low-Latency Applications**</title><link>https://dev.to/nithinbharathwaj/go-garbage-collector-tuning-mastering-memory-management-for-low-latency-applications-3ce7</link><author>Nithin Bharadwaj</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:41:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a best-selling author, I invite you to explore my books on Amazon. Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Garbage collection in Go often feels like a background helper—quietly cleaning up memory so we don't have to. For most applications, its default behavior is perfectly fine. But when you're building something that needs to respond in less than a millisecond, every tiny pause matters. Suddenly, that helpful background activity can become the source of frustrating, unpredictable delays.I learned this the hard way while working on a financial trading system. We would see smooth performance for hours, then experience a sudden 20-millisecond stall that could miss a critical market window. The culprit was the garbage collector, running at what felt like the worst possible time. This sent me on a long journey to understand how to make it behave predictably.Let's start with the basics. Go's garbage collector is concurrent and tries to do most of its work alongside your program. However, it needs to stop the world briefly, a "STW pause," to start a cycle and to finish up certain phases. The goal of tuning isn't to eliminate garbage collection—that's impossible—but to control when it happens and how long it stops your program.The most famous knob is . You can set it as an environment variable or at runtime with . The default is 100. Think of it this way: if your program is using 100MB of live, useful data, the GC will trigger a collection cycle when the total heap size reaches about 200MB. That gives it 100MB of extra space, or "garbage," to work with. A higher , like 200, means it waits longer—triggering at 300MB in our example. This leads to fewer, but larger, collection cycles. A lower value, like 50, makes GC happen more often, which can keep individual pauses shorter but may add more total overhead.Here's how you might manage it programmatically.But  alone isn't enough for low-latency work. Its trigger is relative to your  memory. If your live memory is small and volatile, the heap can grow very quickly between cycles, leading to large sweep phases. This is where the concept of a "heap ballast" comes in.A ballast is a simple trick: you allocate a large chunk of memory that you never really use. This artificially increases your live heap size, making the GC's growth trigger () much larger in absolute terms. The collector runs less often, and when it does run, it has a larger, more stable heap to work with, which can make its job more efficient.You must be careful with ballast on memory-constrained systems, but in many cloud environments where memory is allocated in large chunks anyway, it's a powerful tool for smoothing out GC cycles.The next major strategy is to simply create less garbage for the collector to manage. This is the most effective method. If the collector has less work to do, its pauses are shorter. The  is your best friend here. It caches and reuses allocated objects, taking pressure off both the allocator and the garbage collector.Consider a network server that processes thousands of requests per second, each needing a temporary buffer.This pattern dramatically reduces allocations. Instead of creating and discarding a new  slice for every request, we recycle them. The pool manages the lifecycle, and the garbage collector largely ignores these long-lived, reused objects.To understand what to tune, you need to measure. The  function provides a wealth of information.Key metrics to watch are  (the last 256 GC pause durations),  (total count), and  (the fraction of CPU time used by GC since program start). A rising  is a clear sign the collector is working too hard.For the most demanding applications, you might need to move beyond tuning and start controlling. You can trigger a GC cycle manually with . The trick is to call it during natural breaks in your workflow.Be cautious with manual calls. Calling  too often hurts performance, and calling it at a bad time can cause a major pause during critical work. It requires a deep understanding of your application's phases.Finally, structure your data to be GC-friendly. The garbage collector must walk all reachable objects. Deep, complex pointer chains take longer to scan. Flatter structures with fewer pointers can reduce scan time.
  
  
  When you combine these techniques—adjusting , using a heap ballast, pooling objects, monitoring pressure, and manually controlling collection timing—you transform the garbage collector from a source of unpredictable latency into a predictable component of your system. The pauses don't disappear, but they become small, infrequent, and, most importantly, scheduled for times when your application can best handle them. It's about cooperation, not fighting the runtime. You give the GC clear rules and a manageable workload, and in return, it gets its job done without interrupting yours.

Respect site terms, robots policies, and local laws.
  
  
  What Weesitor Console is (in plain language)
 runs Chrome (headless or visible) via Selenium, visits one or more URLs, and writes out: (stream-friendly, parseable) (so you can see what happened)a  (counts, timings, failures) (readable output, predictable commands) (config-based runs you can share) (artifacts you can actually inspect)
  
  
  Where this fits (good use-cases)
This tool is a strong fit when you want , not a full-blown test platform:Authorized QA smoke checks after deployments before a client meeting for a few key pages (availability, basic load, error detection) where you want minimal moving partsInvestigating flaky behavior with consistent logging & screenshotsIf you’re a solo dev or a small team, Weesitor is the kind of “run it now” tool that often saves you from building a bigger system too early.
  
  
  Where this does NOT fit (honest limitations)
Weesitor Console is intentionally conservative and simple. It is :a replacement for structured E2E suites (Playwright/Cypress + assertions + fixtures)If you need complex assertions, a full page-object model, or deep reporting dashboards, you’ll likely outgrow this and should move to a dedicated testing stack.Single URL, multi-URL, or file-based URL list runsHeadless / non-headless modeTimeout controls and robust cleanupOptional proxy support (with or without auth)Session isolation + per-session User-AgentStructured output folders: logs, screenshots, summarypython  venv .venv

  Responsible use: benefits and risks (the part most posts skip)
Tools like this are powerful, and that comes with responsibility.You can catch obvious breakages quickly (timeouts, redirects, error pages).You get reproducible runs that are easy to share and review.You reduce “works on my machine” issues by standardizing a simple run flow.Unapproved automation can violate terms of service or local law.High concurrency or aggressive loops can stress servers (even unintentionally).Running against sites you don’t control can create privacy and data-handling issues.

Only test where you have explicit permission.Keep concurrency low; treat rate limits as a signal to stop and review.Avoid using this as a crawler/scraper. That’s not the goal, and it’s easy to misuse.
  
  
  Operational tips (what I’d do in real projects)
Start with  in CI, but use non-headless when debugging locally.Keep  conservative (especially on slower environments).Keep artifacts in a predictable folder and archive them for failed builds.

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Let's talk about building systems that are reliable, easy to understand, and can grow without breaking. I often face a problem: a complex business process happens, and later, someone asks, "Why is the data in this state?" Traditional approaches might only store the current result, losing the story of how we got there. There's a way to keep that entire story, and it can make your systems much more resilient. It involves two main ideas: keeping a permanent record of every change, and separating the tasks of updating data from reading it.Imagine your application's state isn't a single static picture. It's a filmstrip. Every single change—a user registration, an updated address, a completed purchase—is one frame in that film. You can always rewind and play the film from the beginning to see exactly how you arrived at the current scene. This is the core of event sourcing. Instead of overwriting a customer's address in a database table, you record an event: . The current address is simply the latest event in that sequence.This pairs powerfully with another idea: CQRS. This is a fancy acronym for a simple concept. It means you use different models for writing data (Commands) and reading data (Queries). Think of it like a kitchen in a restaurant. The chefs (write side) receive orders, work in a specific, controlled area with their own tools, and produce finished dishes. The waitstaff (read side) have a completely separate station for retrieving those dishes and presenting them to customers. They don't interfere with the cooking process. In software, this separation lets you scale and optimize the two sides independently.When you combine these two patterns, you get a robust architecture. You have an immutable record of everything that's happened (the event log), and you can build as many specialized, optimized views of that data as you need (the query models). Let me show you how this can work in Go, focusing on keeping the code clear and performant.First, we need a place to store our filmstrip—the immutable sequence of events. We call this the Event Store.The event store is simple but powerful. Its main job is to append events and guarantee their order. Notice the  field. It's crucial for handling situations where two actions try to update the same customer at the same time (optimistic concurrency control). If you try to append an event expecting version 5, but the stream is already at version 6, you know something has changed since you last looked, and you can reject the command or retry.Now, how do we initiate changes? We don't modify state directly. We send a Command. A command is an intention or a request to do something. "Change customer address" is a command. It may be rejected if it's invalid. If accepted, it results in one or more events being stored.The command handler is the brain of the write side. It contains the rules. It says, "Given this request and the history of what's happened before, what should happen next?" It loads history, makes a decision, and if the decision is "yes," it tells the event store to record a new fact.Reconstructing state from events every time can be slow for entities with long histories. This is where Snapshots help. A snapshot is a saved version of the state at a specific point in time (e.g., at version 100). To get the current state, you load the snapshot and then only replay events that happened after it.Your command handler logic can be modified to check for a snapshot first. If one exists at version 50, you load it and then only ask the event store for events from version 51 onward to rebuild the current state. This dramatically speeds up loading for active entities.So far, we've focused on the write side: commands and events. Now, let's look at the read side, or Queries. This is where CQRS shines. The event log is the truth, but it's not a good format for answering specific questions like "Show me a list of customer names and their cities." For that, we build Projections.A projection listens to events and builds a tailor-made, optimized database table (or in-memory structure) for answering specific questions.The projection is a simple state machine. It says, "When I see a  event, I will add a row to my lookup map. When I see an  event, I will find that row and update the city." This model is now perfect for answering the question "Who lives in Boston?" instantly. You can have many different projections for different purposes: one for lists, one for search indexes, one for reporting totals.How do projections get the events? They subscribe to the event store. In a microservices setup, this could be done through a message broker (like Kafka) that distributes events. For simplicity, let's implement a simple subscription.Finally, let's stitch it all together in a  function to see the flow.This architecture gives you a lot. You have a complete audit trail. You can rebuild your read models from scratch if they become corrupted, because the source of truth is the event log. You can add new types of queries (new projections) without touching the complex command-handling logic. The write side stays focused on maintaining data integrity, and the read side is free to be optimized for speed.Moving to microservices, this pattern is very helpful. Each service can own its event stream. If the "Payment" service needs to know about an "OrderPlaced" event from the "Order" service, the Order service publishes it. The Payment service listens, updates its own internal state via its own events, and builds its own projections. The services are decoupled, communicating asynchronously through events.Performance is a key consideration. Go's concurrency primitives—goroutines and channels—are excellent for building this. You can have a pool of goroutines processing commands, another pool handling projection updates, and channels to pass events between components with backpressure. The  in our examples protects the in-memory state, but for production, you'd use a real database for the event store (like PostgreSQL, or purpose-built stores) and likely use a message queue for publishing events to projections.
  
  
  The initial learning curve is steeper than a simple CRUD setup. You have to think in terms of events and commands. However, for complex business domains where understanding the history is critical, or where you need to scale reads and writes differently, the investment pays off. Your system gains a form of time travel, and its components become loosely coupled, focused, and easier to reason about in isolation. Start with a bounded context where the business logic is complex, and you'll likely find that event sourcing with CQRS brings a welcome clarity.

In addition to broadcasting real-time events to millions of Websocket subscribers, it supports a crucial user experience requirement of your AI Gateway: low-latency propagation of events from your chosen generative AI models to individual users.In this post, we discuss how to use AppSync Events as the foundation of a capable, serverless, AI gateway architecture. We explore how it integrates with AWS services for comprehensive coverage of the capabilities offered in AI gateway architectures. Finally, we get you started on your journey with sample code you can launch in your account and begin building.AI Gateway is an architectural middleware pattern that helps enhance the availability, security, and observability of large language models (LLMs). It supports the interests of several different personas. For example, users want low latency and delightful experiences. Developers want flexible and extensible architectures. Security staff need governance to protect information and availability. System engineers need monitoring and observability solutions that help them support the user experience. Product managers need information about how well their products perform with users. Budget managers need cost controls. The needs of these different people across your organization are important considerations for hosting generative AI applications.The solution we share in this post offers the following capabilities: – Authenticate and authorize users from the built-in user directory, from your enterprise directory, and from consumer identity providers like Amazon, Google, and Facebook– Provide users and applications low-latency access to your generative AI applications – Determine what resources your users have access to in your applicationRate limiting and metering – Mitigate bot traffic, block access, and manage model consumption to manage cost– Offer access to leading foundation models (FMs), agents, and safeguards to keep users safe– Observe, troubleshoot, and analyze application behavior– Extract value from your logs to build, discover, and share meaningful insights– Track key datapoints that help staff react quickly to events – Reduce costs by detecting common queries to your models and returned predetermined responsesIn the following sections, we dive into the core architecture and explore how you can build these capabilities into the solution.The following diagram illustrates an architecture using the AppSync Events API to provide an interface between an AI assistant application and LLMs through Amazon Bedrock using AWS Lambda.The workflow consists of the following steps:The client application retrieves the user identity and authorization to access APIs using Amazon Cognito.The client application subscribes to the AppSync Events channel, from which it will receive events like streaming responses from the LLMs in Amazon Bedrock.The  Lambda function attached to the Outbound Messages namespace verifies that this user is authorized to access the channel.The client application publishes a message to the Inbound Message channel, such as a question posed to the LLM.The  Lambda function receives the message and verifies the user is authorized to publish messages on that channel.The  function relays the response messages from the Converse API to the Outbound Message channel for the current user, which passes the events to the WebSocket on which the client application is waiting for messages.AppSync Events namespaces and channels are the building blocks of your communications architecture in your AI Gateway. In the example, namespaces are used to attach different behaviors to our inbound and outbound messages. Each namespace can have different publish and subscribe integration to each namespace. Moreover, each namespace is divided into channels. Our channel structure design provides each user a private inbound and outbound channel, serving as one-to-one communications with the server side:Inbound-Messages / ${sub}Outbound-Messages / ${sub}The subject, or  attribute, arrives in our Lambda functions as context from Amazon Cognito. It is an unchangeable, unique user identifier within each user pool. This makes it useful for segments of our channel names and is especially useful for authorization.Identity is established using Amazon Cognito, but we still need to implement authorization. One-to-one communication between a user and an AI assistant in our example should be private—we don’t want users with the knowledge of another user’s  attribute to be able to subscribe to or publish to another user’s inbound or outbound channel.This is why we use  in our naming scheme for channels. This enables the Lambda functions attached to the namespaces as data sources to verify that a user is authorized to publish and subscribe.The following code sample is our  Lambda function:def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    Lambda function that checks if the first channel segment matches the user's sub.
    Returns None if it matches or an error message otherwise.
    """

    # Extract segments and sub from the event
    segments = event.get("info", {}).get("channel", {}).get("segments")
    sub = event.get("identity", {}).get("sub", None)

    # Check if segments exist and the first segment matches the user's sub
    if not segments:
        logger.error("No segments found in event")
        return "No segments found in channel path"

    if sub != segments[1]:
        logger.warning(
            f"Unauhotirzed: Sub '{sub}' did not match path segment '{segments[1]}'"
        )
        return "Unauthorized"

    logger.info(f"Sub '{sub}' matched path segment '{segments[1]}'")

    return NoneThe function workflow consists of the following steps:The name of the channel arrives in the event.The user’s subject field, , is part of the context.If the channel name and user identity don’t match, it doesn’t authorize the subscription and returns an error message.Returning  indicates no errors and that the subscription is authorized.The  Lambda function uses the same logic to make sure users are only authorized to publish to their own inbound channel. The channel arrives in the event and the context carries the user identity.Although our example is simple, it demonstrates how you can implement complex authorization rules using a Lambda function to authorize access to channels in AppSync Events.We have covered access control to an individual’s inbound and outbound channels. Many business models around access to LLMs involve controlling how many tokens an individual is allowed to use within some period of time. We discuss this capability in the following section.Rate limiting and meteringUnderstanding and controlling the number of tokens consumed by users of an AI Gateway is important to many customers. Input and output tokens are the primary pricing mechanism for text-based LLMs in Amazon Bedrock. In our example, we use the Amazon Bedrock Converse API to access LLMs. The Converse API provides a consistent interface that works with the models that support messages. You can write code one time and use it with different models.Part of the consistent interface is the stream metadata event. This event is emitted at the end of each stream and provides the number of tokens consumed by the stream. The following is an example JSON structure:{
    "metadata": {
        "usage": {
            "inputTokens": 1062,
            "outputTokens": 512,
            "totalTokens": 1574
        },
        "metrics": {
            "latencyMs": 4133
        }
    }
}We have input tokens, output tokens, total tokens, and a latency metric. To create a control with this data, we first consider the types of limits we want to implement. One approach is a monthly token limit that resets every month—a static window. Another is a daily limit based on a rolling window on 10-minute intervals. When a user exceeds their monthly limit, they must wait until the next month. After a user exceeds their daily rolling window limit, they must wait 10 minutes for more tokens to become available.We need a way to keep atomic counters to track the token consumption, with fast real-time access to the counters with the user’s , and to delete old counters as they become irrelevant.Amazon DynamoDB is a serverless, fully managed, distributed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond performance at many scales. With DynamoDB, we can keep atomic counters, provide access to the counters keyed by the , and roll off old data using its time to live feature. The following diagram shows a subset of our architecture from earlier in this post that now includes a DynamoDB table to track token usage.We can use a single DynamoDB table with the following partition and sort keys: –  (String), the unique identifier for the user –  (String), a composite key that identifies the time periodThe  will receive the  attribute from the JWT provided by Amazon Cognito. The  will have strings that sort lexicographically that indicate which time period the counter is for as well as the timeframe. The following are some example sort keys:10min:2025-08-05:16:40
10min:2025-08-05:16:50
monthly:2025-08 or  indicate the type of counter. The timestamp is set to the last 10-minute window (for example, ).With each record, we keep the following attributes: – Counter for input tokens used in this 10-minute window – Counter for output tokens used in this 10-minute window – Unix timestamp when the record was created or last updated – Time to live value (Unix timestamp), set to 24 hours from creationThe two token columns are incremented with the DynamoDB atomic ADD operation with each metadata event from the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. The  and  columns are updated to indicate when the record is automatically removed from the table.When a user sends a message, we check whether they have exceeded their daily or monthly limits.To calculate daily usage, the  module completes the following steps:Calculates the start and end keys for the 24-hour window.Queries records with the partition key  and sort key between the start and end keys.Sums up the  and  values from the matching records.Compares the sums against the daily limits.See the following example code:KeyConditionExpression: "user_id = :uid AND period_id BETWEEN :start AND :end"
ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ":uid": {"S": "user123"},
    ":start": {"S": "10min:2025-08-04:15:30"},
    ":end": {"S": "10min:2025-08-05:15:30"}
}This range query takes advantage of the naturally sorted keys to efficiently retrieve only the records from the last 24 hours, without filtering in the application code.The monthly usage calculation on the static window is much simpler. To check monthly usage, the system completes the following steps:Gets the specific record with the partition key  and sort key  for the current month.Compares the  and  values against the monthly limits.Key: {
    "user_id": {"S": "user123"},
    "period_id": {"S": "monthly:2025-08"}
}With an additional Python module and DynamoDB, we have a metering and rate limiting solution that works for both static and rolling windows.Our sample code uses the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. Not every model is included in the sample code, but many models are included for you to rapidly explore possibilities.The innovation in this area doesn’t stop at models on AWS. There are numerous ways to develop generative AI solutions at every level of abstraction. You can build on top of the layer that best suits your use case.Many of our AI Gateway stakeholders are interested in logs. Developers want to understand how their applications function. System engineers need to understand operational concerns like tracking availability and capacity planning. Business owners want analytics and trends so that they can make better decisions.With Amazon CloudWatch Logs, you can centralize the logs from your different systems, applications, and AWS services that you use in a single, highly scalable service. You can then seamlessly view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive them securely for future analysis. CloudWatch Logs makes it possible to see your logs, regardless of their source, as a single and consistent flow of events ordered by time.In the sample AI Gateway architecture, CloudWatch Logs is integrated at multiple levels to provide comprehensive visibility. The following architecture diagram depicts the integration points between AppSync Events, Lambda, and CloudWatch Logs in the sample application.AppSync Events API loggingOur AppSync Events API is configured with ERROR-level logging to capture API-level issues. This configuration helps identify issues with API requests, authentication failures, and other critical API-level problems.The logging configuration is applied during the infrastructure deployment:this.api = new appsync.EventApi(this, "Api", {
    // ... other configuration ...
    logConfig: {
        excludeVerboseContent: true,
        fieldLogLevel: appsync.AppSyncFieldLogLevel.ERROR,
        retention: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_WEEK,
    },
});This provides visibility into API operations.Lambda function structured loggingThe Lambda functions use AWS Lambda Powertools for structured logging. The  Lambda function implements a  class that provides context for each conversation:logger = Logger(service="eventhandlers")

class MessageTracker:

This logging infrastructure serves as the foundation for both operational monitoring and the analytics capabilities we discuss in the following section.CloudWatch Logs provides operational visibility, but for extracting business intelligence from logs, AWS offers many analytics services. With our sample AI Gateway architecture, you can use those services to transform data from your AI Gateway without requiring dedicated infrastructure or complex data pipelines.The key components include:– The  Lambda function streams structured log data to a Firehose delivery stream at the end of each completed user response. Data Firehose provides a fully managed service that automatically scales with your data throughput, alleviating the need to provision or manage infrastructure. The following code illustrates how the API call that integrates the  Lambda function with the delivery stream:# From messages.py
firehose_stream = os.environ.get("FIREHOSE_DELIVERY_STREAM")
if firehose_stream:
    try:
        firehose.put_record(
            DeliveryStreamName=firehose_stream,
            Record={"Data": json.dumps(log_data) + "\n"},
        )
        logger.debug(f"Successfully sent data to Firehose stream: {firehose_stream}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to send data to Firehose: {str(e)}")Amazon S3 with Parquet format – Firehose automatically converts the JSON log data to columnar Parquet format before storing it in Amazon S3. Parquet improves query performance and reduces storage costs compared to raw JSON logs. The data is partitioned by year, month, and day, enabling efficient querying of specific time ranges while minimizing the amount of data scanned during queries.– An AWS Glue database and table are created in the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) application to define the schema for our analytics data, including , , , token counts, and timestamps. Table partitions are added as new S3 objects are stored by Data Firehose.Athena for SQL-based analysis – With the table in the Data Catalog, business analysts can use familiar SQL through Athena to extract insights. Athena is serverless and priced per query based on the amount of data scanned, making it a cost-effective solution for one-time analysis without requiring database infrastructure. The following is an example query:-- Example: Token usage by model
SELECT
    model_id,
    SUM(input_tokens) as total_input_tokens,
    SUM(output_tokens) as total_output_tokens,
    COUNT(*) as conversation_count
FROM firehose_database.firehose_table
WHERE year='2025' AND month='08'
GROUP BY model_id
ORDER BY total_output_tokens DESC;This serverless analytics pipeline transforms the events flowing through AppSync Events into structured, queryable tables with minimal operational overhead. The pay-as-you-go pricing model of these services facilitates cost-efficiency, and their managed nature alleviates the need for infrastructure provisioning and maintenance. Furthermore, with your data cataloged in AWS Glue, you can use the full suite of analytics and machine learning services on AWS such as Amazon Quick Sight and Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio with your data.AppSync Events and Lambda functions send metrics to CloudWatch so you can monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize your AWS AppSync API operations effectively. For an AI Gateway, you might need more information in your monitoring system to track important metrics such as token consumption from your models.The sample application includes a call to CloudWatch metrics to record the token consumption and LLM latency at the end of each conversation turn so operators have visibility into this data in real time. This enables metrics to be included in dashboards and alerts. Moreover, the metric data includes the LLM model identifier as a dimension so you can track token consumption and latency by model. Metrics are just one component of what we can learn about our application at runtime with CloudWatch. Because our log messages are formatted as JSON, we can perform analytics on our log data for monitoring using CloudWatch Logs Insights. The following architecture diagram illustrates the logs and metrics made available by AppSync Events and Lambda through CloudWatch and CloudWatch Logs Insights.For example, the following query against the sample application’s log groups shows us the users with the most conversations within a given time window:fields , 
| filter  like "Message complete"
| stats count_distinct(conversation_id) as conversation_count by user_id
| sort conversation_count desc
| limit 10 and  are standard fields for Lambda logs. On line 3, we compute the number of unique conversation identifiers for each user. Thanks to the JSON formatting of the messages, we don’t need to provide parsing instructions to read these fields. The  log message is found in packages/eventhandlers/eventhandlers/messages.py in the sample application.The following query example shows the number of unique users using the system for a given window:fields , 
| filter  like "Message complete"
| stats count_distinct(user_id) by bin(5m) as unique_users Again, we filter for , compute unique statistics on the  field from our JSON messages, and then emit the data as a time series with 5-minute intervals with the bin function.Caching (prepared responses)Many AI Gateways provide a cache mechanism for assistant messages. This would be appropriate in situations where large numbers of users ask exactly the same questions and need the same exact answers. This could be a considerable cost savings for a busy application in the right situation. A good candidate for caching might be about the weather. For example, with the question “Is it going to rain in NYC today?”, everyone should see the same response. A bad candidate for caching would be one where the user might ask the same thing but would receive private information in return, such as “How many vacation hours do I have right now?” Take care to use this idea safely in your area of work. A basic cache implementation is included in the sample to help you get started with this mechanism. Caches in conversational AI require a lot of care to be taken to make sure information doesn’t leak between users. Given the amount of context an LLM can use to tailor a response, caches should be used judiciously.The following architecture diagram shows the use of DynamoDB as a storage mechanism for prepared responses in the sample application.The sample application computes a hash on the user message to query a DynamoDB table with stored messages. If there is a message available for a hash key, the application returns the text to the user, the custom metrics record a cache hit in CloudWatch, and an event is passed back to AppSync Events to notify the application the response is complete. This encapsulates the cache behavior completely within the event structure the application understands.Install the sample applicationRefer to the README file on GitHub for instructions to install the sample application. Both install and uninstall are driven by a single command to deploy or un-deploy the AWS CDK application.The following table estimates monthly costs of the sample application with light usage in a development environment. Actual cost will vary by how you use the services for your use case.The monthly cost of the sample application, assuming light development use, is expected to be between $35–55 per month.The following screenshots showcase the sample UI. It provides a conversation window on the right and a navigation bar on the left. The UI features the following key components:The following screenshot shows the chat interface of the sample application.The following screenshot shows the model selection menu.As the AI landscape evolves, you need an infrastructure that adapts as quickly as the models themselves. By centering your architecture around AppSync Events and the serverless patterns we’ve covered—including Amazon Cognito based identity authentication, DynamoDB powered metering, CloudWatch observability, and Athena analytics—you can build a foundation that grows with your needs.

Today, I'm excited to share , an open-source automated trading platform I've built from the ground up using modern technologies and clean architecture principles.Most crypto trading automation solutions are either:Expensive proprietary systems with monthly subscriptionsClosed-source "black boxes" where you can't verify what's happeningLimited to basic strategies without sophisticated technical analysisDifficult to customize or extendI wanted to create something different: a professional-grade, completely transparent, and fully customizable trading platform that anyone could use, learn from, and build upon.OpenTradeWatch uses a microservices-inspired architecture with three main components:
  
  
  1.  - The Analysis Powerhouse
The backend is written in Go for maximum performance. It implements a sophisticated multi-indicator technical analysis system that processes: (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, OBV, MFI, EMA, ADX, LSR, VWAP, Keltner Channels, GARCH) for signal generationAutomatic risk management with Stop Loss/Take Profit calculationsReal-time order execution via Gate.io APIEach indicator contributes a weighted score, and the system generates BUY/SELL/NEUTRAL signals with confidence levels ranging from 0-100%.
  
  
  2.  - Real-Time Communication
Instead of polling APIs or using websockets directly, I chose MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) using Mosquitto as the broker. This provides: pub/sub messaging - services communicate through topics with QoS levels - easy to add new subscriberstrades/new          → New trade signals
trades/update       → Trade status updates
indicators/update   → Technical indicator updates
alerts/trigger      → Alert notifications

  
  
  3. Laravel + Livewire Dashboard - Modern Frontend
The dashboard is built with Laravel 12 and Livewire 4, providing: without writing JavaScript for monitoring trades with TailwindCSS and extension
  
  
  🔬 Technical Deep Dive: The Weighted Scoring System
The heart of OpenTradeWatch is its sophisticated signal generation algorithm. Here's how it works:: Fetch latest candlestick data from Gate.io: Compute all 11 technical indicators: Each indicator contributes a weighted score based on bullish/bearish conditions: Aggregate scores determine final BUY/SELL/NEUTRAL signal: Calculate stop loss, take profit, and position sizingExample output for BTC/USDT:Everything runs in Docker containers, making deployment incredibly simple:git clone https://github.com/CristianBernardes/open-trade-watch.git

Totogi is an AI company focused on helping helping telecom (telco) companies innovate, accelerate growth and adopt AI at scale. BSS Magic, Totogi’s flagship product, connects and models telco business operations, overlaying legacy systems with an AI layer. With BSS Magic, telcos can extend, customize, and modernize their systems without vendor dependencies or lengthy implementations. By partnering with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and using the rapid innovation capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, we accelerated the development of BSS Magic, helping Totogi’s customers innovate faster and gain more control over their tech stack.In this post, we explore the challenges associated with the traditional business support system (BSS), and the innovative solutions provided by Totogi BSS Magic. We introduce intricacies of telco ontologies and the multi-agent framework that powers automated change request processing. Additionally, the post will outline the orchestration of AI agents and the benefits of this approach for telecom operators and beyond.BSS are notoriously difficult to manage. A typical BSS stack consists of hundreds of different applications from various vendors. But those BSS applications are difficult to integrate, either restricting telcos to the vendor’s ecosystem or requiring them to invest in costly customizations. Such customizations are slow and resource-intensive because of their reliance on specialized engineering talent.Each change request necessitates a thorough analysis of potential impacts across interconnected modules, consuming significant time and effort. Even small updates can involve multiple rounds of coding, testing, and reconfiguration to achieve stability. For telecom operators, where system reliability is critical, these safeguards are non-negotiable, but they come at a steep price. This process is further complicated by the scarcity of engineers with the necessary expertise, driving up costs and elongating timelines. As a result, development cycles for new features or services often take months to complete, leaving operators struggling to meet the demands of a fast-moving market.BSS Magic solution overviewTotogi BSS Magic reduces the complexity using AI-generated interoperability, which helps simplify integrations, customizations, and application development. BSS Magic has two key aspects: that understands the semantic meanings of data structures and the relationships between them, linking disparate data into a coherent network of knowledge. for fully automated change requests (CR), which reduces CR processing time from 7 days to a few hours.Telco ontology: The key to interoperabilityOntologies serve as semantic blueprints that detail concepts, relationships, and domain knowledge. In telecom, this means translating the BSS landscape into a clear, reusable, and interoperable ecosystem. Totogi’s telco ontology facilitates a deep understanding of data interaction and seamless integration across any vendor or system. By adopting FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability), the ontology-driven architecture turns static, siloed data into dynamic, interconnected knowledge assets—unlocking trapped data and accelerating innovation. An overview diagram of the ontology is provided in the following figure.Multi-agent framework for automated change request processingAI agents are advanced software applications trained to perform specific tasks autonomously. Totogi’s BSS Magic AI agents have extensive domain knowledge and use this understanding to manage complex data interactions across multiple vendor systems. These agents automatically generate and test telco-grade code, replacing traditional integrations and customizations with intelligent, AI generated applications. At its core, BSS Magic uses a multi-agent AI approach with feedback loops to automate the entire software development pipeline. Each agent is designed to fulfill a specific role in the development pipeline: translates unstructured requirements into formal business specifications.Technical architect agent takes these business specs and defines technical architectures, APIs, and dependencies. generates high-quality, deployable code, complete with modular designs and optimizations. validates the code for adherence to best practices, improving quality and security. It provides feedback which is used by the developer agent to update the code. generates robust unit test cases, streamlining validation and deployment. The result of the test cases is used by the developer agent to improve the code.An overview of the system is provided in the following figure.This integrated pipeline reduces the time to complete a change request from 7 days to a few hours, with minimal human intervention. The prerequisites for implementing the system include an AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock, AWS Step Functions, AWS Lambda, and configured Amazon credentials. The AI agents are implemented using Anthropic Claude large language models (LLMs) through Amazon Bedrock. State management and workflow coordination are handled by Step Functions for reliable progression through each stage. The AWS infrastructure provides the enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability essential for telco-grade solutions.To build the framework, Totogi collaborated with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC). GenAIIC offered access to AI expertise, industry-leading talent, and a rigorous iterative process to optimize the AI agents and code-generation workflows. It also provided guidance on prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), model selection, automated code review, feedback loops, robust performance metrics for evaluating AI-generated outputs, and so on. The collaboration helped establish methods for maintaining reliability while scaling automation across the platform. The solution orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to handle the complete software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis to test execution. The details of the AI agents are given in the following sections.Multi-agent orchestration layerThe orchestration layer coordinates specialized AI agents through a combination of Step Functions and Lambda functions. Each agent maintains context through RAG and few-shot prompting techniques to generate accurate domain-specific outputs. The system manages agent communication and state transitions while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of decisions and actions.Business analysis generationThe Business Analyst agent uses Claude’s natural language understanding capabilities to process statement of work (SOW) documents and acceptance criteria. It extracts key requirements using custom prompt templates optimized for telecom BSS domain knowledge. The agent generates structured specifications for downstream processing while maintaining traceability between business requirements and technical implementations.Technical architecture generationThe Technical Architect agent transforms business requirements into concrete AWS service configurations and architectural patterns. It generates comprehensive API specifications and data models and incorporates AWS Well-Architected principles. The agent validates architectural decisions against established patterns and best practices, producing infrastructure-as-code templates for automated deployment.The Developer agent converts technical specifications into implementation code using Claude’s advanced code generation capabilities. It produces robust, production-ready code that includes proper error handling and logging mechanisms. The pipeline incorporates feedback from validation steps to iteratively improve code quality and maintain consistency with AWS best practices.Automated quality assuranceThe QA agent is built using Claude to perform comprehensive code analysis and validation. It evaluates code quality and identifies potential performance issues. The system maintains continuous feedback loops with the development stage, facilitating rapid iteration and improvement of generated code based on quality metrics and best practices adherence. The QA process consists of carefully crafted prompts."You are a senior QA backend engineer analyzing Python code for serverless applications.
Your task is to:
Compare requirements against implemented code
Identify missing features
Suggest improvements in code quality and efficiency
 Provide actionable feedback
Focus on overall implementation versus minor details
Consider serverless best practices"This prompt helps the QA agent perform thorough code analysis, evaluate quality metrics, and maintain continuous feedback loops with development stages.Test automation frameworkThe Tester agent creates comprehensive test suites that verify both functional and non-functional requirements. It uses Claude to understand test contexts and generate appropriate test scenarios. The framework manages test refinement through evaluation cycles, achieving complete coverage of business requirements while maintaining test code quality and reliability. The testing framework uses a multi-stage prompt approach.Initial test structure prompt:"As a senior QA engineer, create a pytest-based test structure including:
Detailed test suite organization
Resource configurations
Test approach and methodology
Required imports and dependencies"Test implementation prompt:"Generate complete pytest implementation including:
Unit tests for each function
Integration tests for API endpoints
AWS service mocking
Edge case coverage
Error scenario handling"Test results analysis prompt:"Evaluate test outputs and coverage reports to:
Verify test completion status
Track test results and outcomes
Measure coverage metrics
Provide actionable feedback"This structured approach leads to comprehensive test coverage while maintaining high quality standards. The framework currently achieves 76% code coverage and successfully validates both functional and non-functional requirements.The Tester agent provides a feedback loop to the Development agent to improve the code.The integration of Totogi BSS Magic with Amazon Bedrock presents a comprehensive solution for modern telecom operators. Some takeaways for you to consider: BSS Magic automates the entire development lifecycle—from idea to deployment. AI agents handle everything from requirements, architecture, and code generation to testing and validation. The agentic framework significantly boosted efficiency, reducing change request processing from seven days to a few hours. The automated testing framework achieved 76% code coverage, consistently delivering high-quality telecom-grade code.Unique value for telecom operators: By using Totogi BSS Magic, telecom operators can accelerate time-to-market and reduce operational costs. BSS Magic uses autonomous AI, independently managing complex tasks so telecom operators can concentrate on strategic innovation. The solution is supported by Amazon Bedrock, which offers scalable AI models and infrastructure, high-level security and reliability critical for telecom.Impact to other industries: While BSS Magic is geared towards the telecom industry, the multi-agent framework can be repurposed for general software development across other industries. Future enhancements will focus on expanding the model’s domain knowledge in telecom and other domains. Another possible extension is to integrate an AI model to predict potential issues in change requests based on historical data, thereby preemptively addressing common pitfalls.Any feedback and questions are welcome in the comments below.

This is a classic example of "semantic classification" in AI engineering.The most obvious approach is a simple one-shot inference call: ask the LLM to select the correct field(s) from a provided list. This is easy to implement as you simply enumerate the fields in the prompt with enough detail for the LLM to make a decision. However, this approach does not scale as the list of fields can grow to hundreds or even thousands of entries. This floods the context window, increases latency (processing more tokens takes longer), and ultimately sacrifices accuracy due to the "lost in the middle" phenomenon.Asking the LLM to filter through large blocks of input text is known as the "finding a needle in a haystack" challenge. The main problem that arises when searching for a piece of information buried in a massive context window is that models tend to forget details located in the middle, while remembering details at the beginning and end best. This is known as the "lost in the middle" phenomenon. One approach to mitigate this is to use a search engine to do the filtering first (finding the potential needles), allowing the LLM to work directly with the subset of most relevant data. This is what is known as the RAG solution.RAG is not always the best solution. It depends on the nature of the data: when processing large paragraphs of text, RAG can be limited in its ability to reason over distant parts of the data because chunks are retrieved in isolation rather than as a coherent whole. For my use case, however, API fields are discrete pieces of information that are already clumped by domain (API schema and endpoint), making RAG a strong fit.RAG alone, however, is often not enough. Retrieval typically returns entries that score highly by similarity, which can include results that look relevant but don't best match the user's intent. Reranking is a crucial technique to re-evaluate retrieved candidates in light of the user's request and select the most contextually appropriate entries.Let's go through the steps required to build and consume a RAG system to find the field(s) that match a user's change request.: Collect the schemas and fields that are supported. The field details are important: field name, path, description, type, additional context and the source schema.Generate embeddings for each field: Iterate over all fields and generate a vector embedding (numerical representation) for each field's string representation (a concatenation of name, description, context, etc).Store the fields in a vector DB: Insert each field's vector embedding in a database that supports vector similarity search, like DuckDB 😎.Wire up your app to access the DB: Setup your app so that it can connect to the vector DB instance.Generate an embedding for the user request: Using the same "embedder" from step 2, generate a vector representation of the user query. This vector is used to query the DB.: The retriever is a function that executes the "similarity search" against the DB relying on components from step #4 and #5. It returns a list of candidate "documents" (fields) that are mathematically similar to the query. LangChain supports this 😎.: The chain puts together the retriever from step #6 along with the instructions for the LLM on how to choose the appropriate fields. This is where the final "reasoning" happens. LangChain is great at this 😎.Steps 1 through 3 are "build" concerns (often called the Ingestion Pipeline). Steps 4 through 7 are "runtime" concerns performed by the app to process live user requests.Let's put it all together with DuckDB and Langchain Go. For the API fields I'm going to use the Github API. For the LLM and embedder I'm going to use GCP's Vertex models.Collect each API field into a list of  instances that we can iterate over later on to generate the embeddings.I'm only providing a few fields to keep it readable. In the same way there's a method  to capture all the "repo" fields, there would be other methods to collect "branch protection" fields, "rulesets" fields, etc.
  
  
  2. Generate embeddings for each field:
To generate the embedding we need a string representation of each field. We can do so by adding a  method to  type like this:A few best-practice considerations for the embed string:Frontload high signal information: Place the most semantically rich fields at the beginning of the string as they'll match closerly the terminology used by the user.Use natural language serialization: Many embedding models are optimized for natural language sentences. Framing the data as a coherent statement can yield better results than a robotic list of key/value pairs.: Users may refer to some fields with alternative names. Explicitly encode those to increase the chances of matching.: I found variations of the format to yield subtle differences in the similarity search. You should rely on integration tests to control variance and account for the subtleties of your data as you try out new formats.
  
  
  3. Store the fields in a vector DB:
In order to perform similarity search against the fields, let's create a DuckDB instance and table with vector embedding support:And now the actual logic to write the DB instance to a file and insert the embeddings:Lastly, iterate over the fields, generate the embedding and use the  client to insert them:This concludes the "ingestion phase". Let's now move on to the runtime processing phase. Note that I didn't include function . That will be included on the next steps as we'll also need it during runtime query processing.
  
  
  4. Wire up your app to access the DB:
Let's now setup the app with a client to access and query the "fields" DuckDB instance written by step #3.
  
  
  5. Generate an embedding for the user request & 6. Setup a RAG retriever
I'm bundling steps 5 and 6 since the RAG retriever in my app takes care of generating the embedding for the user request.⚠️  ⚠️: You should not pass the raw user provided string directly to the embedder. You should normalize it before generating the embedding by removing action verbs, stop words and any irrelevant characters to ensure high quality matching.Let's now take a look at the embedder that must be used during both the ingestion and runtime processing phases:And the Langchain retriever:Lastly, setup the RAG chain with the retriever and instructions to select the fields:⚠️  ⚠️: Notice how the agent method  accepts both a  with the raw user query and a normalizedChangeDescription with the normalized string.  provides the full context to perform the final reasoning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My python vs rust methods for finance backtesting</title><link>https://dev.to/kacawaiii/my-python-vs-rust-methods-for-finance-backtesting-2nai</link><author>Kyoko</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:58:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How I Made My Python Backtester 56x Faster with Rust]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I Made My Python Backtester 56x Faster with Rust</title><link>https://dev.to/kacawaiii/how-i-made-my-python-backtester-56x-faster-with-rust-1pi</link><author>Kyoko</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:51:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ — ML pipeline, orchestration, data handling — Backtesting engine, indicators, grid search — Parallel executionSame API.

Data tools that show you numbers but leave you hanging. They're like that friend who says "I've got news" and then just... stares at you.We built SQLatte to convert natural language into SQL queries. Cool, right? Users loved it. But then came the existential crisis: "Show me today's sales"Returns a table with numbers "Okay... so is this good or bad?" 🦗That's when we realized: Raw data is useless without context.
  
  
  🎯 The Real Problem: Numbers Don't Tell Stories
Imagine you're running an e-commerce platform. Your dashboard shows:Sales Today: $45,000
Orders: 23
✅ Is this good? (Compared to yesterday)⚠️ Is the data complete? (It's 11 AM - day isn't over)💡 What should I do about it?Spoiler alert: Most BI tools can't answer these questions. They just dump data and run away.
  
  
  💡 Enter: The AI-Powered Insights Engine
So we built something different. Something that doesn't just query data - it  it.Here's what makes it special:
  
  
  1.  - It Knows What Time It Is
❌ Dumb insight (without context):"Today's sales are $45,000 - below average!"✅ Smart insight (with context):"⏰ Today's sales are $45,000 (46% of day complete). At this pace, you'll hit ~$98,000 by EOD - that's 15% above target! 📈"See the difference? One makes you panic. The other makes you smile.
  
  
  2. Incomplete Data Detection - No More False Alarms
The engine automatically detects incomplete data:You run a query at 2 PM: "Compare today vs yesterday"Today: $50K
Yesterday: $120K
😱 PANIC! Sales crashed 58%!
⚠️ WARNING: Today's data is incomplete (58% of day passed)
Projected EOD: ~$86K (28% below yesterday)
💡 Monitor until 6 PM for accurate comparison
No heart attacks. Just facts.
  
  
  🏗️ Architecture: Three Modes, One Goal
We designed three modes because one size doesn't fit all:
  
  
  Mode 1: LLM-Only (Maximum Intelligence)
Richest, most contextual insightsNatural language explanationsUnderstands business logicCosts money (LLM API calls) Premium features, high-value queries
  
  
  Mode 2: Statistical-Only (Lightning Fast)
📊 Trend detection in numeric columns⚡ Anomaly identification (outliers)📈 Growth/decline calculations Free tiers, real-time dashboards
  
  
  Mode 3: Hybrid (Recommended) ⭐
Try LLM first → Get contextual analysisIf LLM fails → Fallback to statisticalCombine both → Maximum coverage Balance between cost and quality.
  
  
  💻 Technical Deep Dive: How It Actually Works

  
  
  Prompt Engineering: The Secret Sauce
Here's how we talk to the LLM (this took us 47 iterations to get right):
  
  
  Statistical Analysis: The Safety Net
When LLM isn't available or fails, we fall back to rule-based analysis:
  
  
  Thread-Safe Singleton Pattern
In a multi-threaded FastAPI environment, we need one engine instance:
  
  
  🎯 Real-World Impact: The Numbers Don't Lie

  
  
  Use Case 1: E-Commerce Flash Sale
 "Show sales by category today"Category      | Sales
--------------|--------
Electronics   | $125,000
Fashion       | $89,000
Home & Living | $45,000
📈 Electronics performing 230% above average today. 
   Likely a flash sale or campaign effect.

⏰ ALERT: It's 11 AM (46% of day). EOD projections:
   - Electronics: ~$273K
   - Fashion: ~$194K
   - Home & Living: ~$98K

💡 ACTION NEEDED: Check Electronics inventory. 
   High demand may cause stockouts by 3 PM.
 Prevented stockout, secured additional $47K in sales.
  
  
  Use Case 2: Security Incident Detection
 "Top attacked endpoints in last 24h"Endpoint        | Attack Count
----------------|-------------
/login          | 1,247
/admin          | 892
/api/v1/users   | 234
⚠️ CRITICAL: /login receiving 8x normal traffic. 
   High probability of brute-force attack!

🔒 /admin endpoint also targeted. Check if rate 
   limiting is active.

💡 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   1. Enable CAPTCHA on /login
   2. Reduce rate limit: 5 → 3 attempts
   3. Alert security team NOW

It’s staggering how memory-efficient this technique is.Prefix sums are used when you want to compute values over a range —.Let’s say you want to compute the number of YouTube views over different time periods. represents the  in the  array
 is the number of views on that day
Each element in  represents a range over which we want the cumulative sum
For example,  means:
compute the cumulative views from day  to day  (inclusive).A valid approach would be:For each period, find the sub-array for that range
Iterate through it and sum all the elements
Append the result to an output array
The problem with this approach is that we recompute  without keeping track of previous work.
  
  
  Prefix sums to the rescue 🚀
Yes. An optimal approach is to use a .Compute a cumulative sum array once
Each element at index  stores the sum of values from index  to Let’s call this array .prefix[0] = views[0]
prefix[1] = views[0] + views[1]
prefix[2] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2]
prefix[3] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3]
...

  
  
  Querying ranges with prefix sums
If the range starts at day , the answer is simply:
Because each  already represents the cumulative sum from day  to day .
  
  
  What if the range does  start at 0?
Let’s say the period is .prefix[4] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3] + views[4]
prefix[0] = views[0]
So to get the sum from day  to day , we subtract what came before the range: gives the total up to the end of the range
 gives everything before the range
Subtracting removes what we don’t care about

  
  
  Intuition (what’s really happening)
prefix[4] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3] + views[4]
prefix[0] = views[0]
-----------------------------------------------
result    =          views[1] + views[2] + views[3] + views[4]
Everything before the range is discarded. We only keep what’s inside .prefix[3] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3]
prefix[2] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2]
Which is exactly .That’s the magic of prefix sums:precompute once, answer every range query in O(1).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Technical Deep Dive: Building SkillFade with FastAPI and React</title><link>https://dev.to/ruhidibadli/technical-deep-dive-building-skillfade-with-fastapi-and-react-3833</link><author>Ruhid Ibadli</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:35:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I shared SkillFade, a skill tracking app that prioritizes honesty over gamification. Today I want to walk through the architectural decisions and technical choices that shaped it.Backend:  FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + PostgreSQL
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
Auth:     JWT + bcrypt
Deploy:   Docker + Nginx
Boring? Yes. That's the point. Every piece is battle-tested, well-documented, and easy to hire for.I'm primarily a backend engineer with Python experience. When choosing a framework, I wanted something that would let me move fast without fighting the tooling.FastAPI checked every box: - Python is my comfort zone, so I could focus on product logic instead of learning new syntaxType hints as documentation - Pydantic schemas generate OpenAPI docs automatically, no extra work - But sync works perfectly fine for database-bound operations - Need anything? There's probably a Python library for it - Hot reload, clear error messages, intuitive routingCould I have used Django? Sure. Flask? Also fine. But FastAPI hit the sweet spot between simplicity and features. For a solo developer shipping a product, that matters more than benchmarks.The honest truth: I picked the tool I knew best so I could ship faster. No regrets.
  
  
  Architecture: Monolith by Choice
No microservices. No message queues. No Kubernetes. A single FastAPI process handles everything.This wasn't a compromise—it was a deliberate decision. - One log stream, one deployment, one place to look when things break - No service orchestration, no network calls between components, no distributed tracing - Everything runs on a modest VPS, no complex infrastructure costs - The entire application fits in my headSkillFade is a personal productivity tool. Even with thousands of users, a single well-optimized server handles the load easily. PostgreSQL can manage millions of rows without breaking a sweat.The microservices question I ask myself: "Do I have a team of 50 engineers who need to deploy independently?" No. So monolith it is.I'll split it when I have the problem. Not before.
  
  
  The Core Algorithm: Freshness Decay
The heart of SkillFade is the freshness calculation. Here's the thinking behind it.Every skill starts at 100% freshness after you practice itEach day without practice, freshness decays exponentiallyRecent learning activity adds a small boost (max 15%)Result is clamped between 0-100%Default decay rate is 2% per day, compounding. This means:Linear decay (lose 1% per day) doesn't match how memory works. In reality, forgetting is steep at first, then levels off. The exponential curve better models the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve that psychologists have studied for over a century.Why does learning only "boost" and not reset?This is the key philosophical choice. Watching a tutorial about React doesn't mean you can build a React app. Reading about Kubernetes doesn't mean you can debug a cluster.Learning slows decay. Only practice resets the clock.This forces users to confront an uncomfortable truth: passive consumption isn't the same as skill building.Not all skills fade equally: (cycling, typing) - slow decay, muscle memory persists (design patterns, architecture) - medium decay (specific APIs, CLI flags) - fast decay, details fade quicklyUsers can adjust decay rate per skill to match reality.
  
  
  Database Design Decisions
Six core tables. No more than necessary, no fewer than useful.users
categories
skills
learning_events
practice_events
skill_dependencies
Every table has clear ownership. Users own categories. Categories organize skills. Skills have events. Simple hierarchy, predictable queries.
  
  
  Separate Tables for Learning vs Practice Events
I debated this one. A single  table with a  column would be simpler, right?I went with separate tables because: - Dashboard shows practice frequency, detail pages show both. Separate tables = simpler queries for common operations - Learning events have types like "video, article, course, book". Practice events have "project, exercise, teaching, code-review". One enum would be confusing - Practice events might get "difficulty" or "output_url" fields that don't make sense for learning - Two tables makes the learning/practice distinction explicit in the data model itselfThe tradeoff is some duplication in the codebase. Worth it for clarity.
  
  
  Hard Deletes Over Soft Deletes
When a user clicks "Delete my account," everything goes. CASCADE deletes across all tables. No  columns, no recovery period, no "we keep your data for 30 days."This aligns with the privacy philosophy. If someone wants out, they're out. Fully.It also simplifies queries—no  everywhere.
  
  
  Categories as First-Class Entities
Early version had category as just a string field on skills. Worked fine until I wanted:Category-level analytics ("How fresh are my Frontend skills overall?")Rename a category everywhere at onceEnsure no duplicate category names per userRefactored to proper  table with foreign keys. More work upfront, cleaner long-term.
  
  
  Why React + Vite (Not Next.js)
Next.js is great. I considered it. Went with plain React SPA instead. - It's a dashboard behind login. Google doesn't need to crawl it - No SSR vs CSR decisions, no hydration bugs, no server components confusion - API is API (FastAPI), frontend is frontend (React). Clean boundary - Static files served by Nginx, API proxied separatelyFor a marketing site or blog, I'd pick Next.js. For an authenticated dashboard app, SPA is simpler.
  
  
  State Management: Context Over Redux
SkillFade uses React Context for global state. No Redux, no Zustand, no MobX.Current user (authentication)Theme preference (dark/light)Fetched fresh per page. Server is the source of truth. When you navigate to the dashboard, it fetches current data. No stale cache problems, no sync issues.Redux solves problems I don't have:Complex state interactions across many components? Nope, state is simpleTime-travel debugging? Never needed itMiddleware for side effects? fetch() works fineFor this app, Redux would add complexity without adding value. Context + useState + useEffect covers everything.src/

Nothing fancy. Pages fetch data on mount, pass to components via props. Components are mostly presentational.
  
  
  Real-time Updates Without WebSockets
When you log a practice event on the skill detail page, the dashboard freshness should update. - Real-time push from server - Fetch every N seconds - Signal between components in same tabWent with option 3. It's a SPA—dashboard and detail page components exist in the same JavaScript context. When detail page logs an event, it dispatches a custom event. Dashboard listens and refetches.No socket server to maintain. No unnecessary network requests. Works perfectly for single-tab usage.For multi-device sync (phone updates, desktop sees it), you'd need WebSockets or polling. Not implemented yet. Manual refresh works for now.
  
  
  The Alert System: Calm by Design
Most apps optimize for engagement. More notifications = more opens = better metrics.SkillFade optimizes for calm. Alerts should be: - Maximum 1 email per week, total - Only alert if user can do something about it - Plain text, no tracking pixels, instant unsubscribe
Triggers when a skill drops below 40% freshness. But not immediately—waits for 14 days since last alert for that skill. Prevents nagging about the same thing repeatedly.
Triggers when a skill has learning events but no practice events for 30+ days. The message: "You've been learning X but not practicing. Theory without application fades fast."
Triggers when overall learning/practice ratio stays below 0.2 for two consecutive months. The message: "You're consuming a lot but producing little. Consider more hands-on work."Alerts run via scheduled job (cron), not real-time triggers. Once daily, batch process checks all users who have alerts enabled.Each alert type has independent cooldowns. You might get a decay alert and an imbalance alert in the same week, but never two decay alerts for the same skill within 14 days.Pure REST says everything should be a resource. I follow that mostly, but bend it when convenient: - Not really a "resource," but makes sense as an endpoint - "login" isn't a noun, don't careGET  /skills
GET  /skills/:id
POST /skills
PUT  /skills/:id

GET  /learning-events
POST /learning-events
PUT  /learning-events/:id
DELETE /learning-events/:id
Not nested like /skills/:id/learning-events/:eventId. Flat is simpler to route, simpler to reason about, simpler to document.Events reference skills via  in the body/params, not URL hierarchy.
  
  
  Consistent Response Patterns
 Return the data directly (object or array) Always { "detail": "Human readable message" } Offset-based with , returns { items: [], total: number }Frontend code stays simple when API is predictable.
  
  
  Authentication: Keep It Simple
Access token in Authorization headerStored in localStorage (yes, I know about XSS concerns—acceptable for this use case)No refresh tokens—expired means re-loginFor a personal productivity tool used by one person at a time, this is plenty secure. No need for refresh token rotation, token families, or OAuth complexity.bcrypt with default work factor72-byte input limit (bcrypt truncates silently, so I handle it explicitly)No password rules beyond minimum length—let users choose their own passwords - Serves frontend static files + proxies API requestsSingle  brings everything online. Environment variables for secrets, volumes for data persistence.Lambda/Vercel functions would work for the API. Didn't go that route because:Cold starts matter for dashboard responsivenessPostgreSQL connection pooling is annoying in serverlessI wanted full control over the environmentMonthly cost is predictable with a VPSFor a side project, a $10-20/month VPS beats managing serverless complexity.First two weeks, I built with a hardcoded user ID. No login, no registration, no password reset flow. Just the core features.This prevented the classic trap: spending weeks on auth while the actual product stays unbuilt.Added auth last, once everything else worked.
  
  
  2. Migrations From Day One
Even solo, even on a side project: use database migrations (Alembic for Python).Schema will change. "I'll just modify the table directly" becomes a nightmare when you have production data. Migrations saved me multiple times.Frontend and backend types should match. I define Pydantic schemas in Python, then manually keep TypeScript interfaces in sync.Not ideal (would love auto-generation), but catching type mismatches at compile time is worth the maintenance.Every time I picked the "boring" option (PostgreSQL over MongoDB, REST over GraphQL, React over Svelte), I benefited from:More Stack Overflow answersSmoother hiring (if I ever need help)Novel tech is fun. Shipped products need boring tech.GDPR requires "right to deletion." Even if you're not in the EU, it's good practice.Plan for cascade deletes from day one. No orphaned data, no "soft delete" flags that accumulate forever.I relied on manual testing too long. Click through the app, check if it works. Tedious and error-prone.Should have set up Playwright or Cypress from week two.
  
  
  Design Alert System First
Retrofitting notifications into an existing schema was messy. Alert cooldowns, user preferences, email templates—all added later, all awkward.If I started over, I'd design the alert data model upfront.Built every button, input, modal, and dropdown from scratch with Tailwind. Educational, but slow.Next time: Radix UI or Headless UI for primitives, custom styling on top.
  
  
  The Anti-Complexity Manifesto
Every feature request, every "nice to have," every shiny technology gets filtered through one question:"Does the added complexity justify the value?"Microservices? No. One process is fine until it isn't.GraphQL? No. REST handles every use case here.Redis caching? No. PostgreSQL is fast enough.Real-time sync? No. Manual refresh works.Mobile app? No. PWA covers it.AI recommendations? No. That's not what this product is.The best code is code you don't write. The best infrastructure is infrastructure you don't maintain. The best feature is the one that solves the problem without adding moving parts.That's the technical foundation of SkillFade. The theme throughout: simple, boring, maintainable. Complexity is easy to add. Simplicity is hard to maintain.If you're building a side project, my advice: pick boring tech, ship fast, add complexity only when forced.Questions about specific decisions?

Considering the Lead Time Analyzer I would like to create a new Flask
 Application which calculate the Process Behavior Charts for each 
projects identified during the retrieval of project connected to the 
first input query.
I would like to have a chart which represent for each projects the Medium
 Lead time and the 85% lead time threshold calculated.
I would like than to see the real lead time calculated each month 
depicted in the diagram starting from august 2024.
My intention like per the article https://www.infoq.com/articles/DORA-metrics-PBCs/ is to identify trends
 and spike so that we can identify and address issues. 📦 Created Files: - Core analysis engine that:Calculates median and 85th percentile lead times per projectComputes control limits (UCL/LCL) using ±3σ methodologyGroups data by month starting from August 2024Detects special causes (points outside control limits)Identifies trends (7+ consecutive increases/decreases)Assesses process stability - Flask application (standalone on port 5500)templates/pbc_analyzer.html - Beautiful web interface with:Interactive Chart.js visualizationsMonthly trend lines for mean, median, and P85Control limit boundaries displayedColor-coded stability statusSpecial cause and trend alerts - Configuration file with defaults - Complete documentationand than this nice report:🎯 Key Features:
✅ Median & P85 calculations per project
✅ Monthly aggregation starting August 2024
✅ Control charts with UCL/LCL (±3σ)
✅ Special cause detection (outliers)
✅ Trend detection (7+ consecutive points)
✅ Process stability assessment
✅ Multi-project analysis from single JQL query
✅ Interactive visualizations showing all metrics on one chartIn the log I do not see the query executed, can you add some debugging level logs which I can disable to check what query are executed? I know the input query is based on a project which started after the august 2024, but I would like to analyze the projects related to the input one which were existing before. Than I need the calculation for the following months till todayI've enhanced the PBC Analyzer with the following capabilities:🐛 Debug Logging
New checkbox in UI: "Enable Debug Logging" to see all JQL queries being executed
Detailed query logging: Shows every JQL query executed against Jira
Progress tracking: See which projects are being fetched and how many issues found
🔍 Related Project Discovery
The analyzer now works like the PI analyzer:Executes your initial query (e.g., a project that started after Aug 2024)
Discovers related projects through:
Parent/child relationships
Epic links
Issue links (blocks, relates, etc.)
Fetches data from ALL related projects starting from August 2024, even if those projects existed before
Monthly calculations from Aug 2024 to today for all discovered projects
Each project gets its own PBC with control limits
Special causes and trends detected per projectI see the analysis is done only on initial project but I would like to see the analysis also to all the connected Jira projects following the whole hierarchy (for each Business initiatives we should collect the related feature and sub-feature and than epics in each other projects like we did in original Lead time analyzer)For sure the vibe coding was a good way to develop easily first view of the idea you have in mind becoming workable application you can improve and manage. What was the learning in this case was the really amazing capability to get additional information from the article without the needs to specify details in graph format and definition.
It was really a great result obtained in few minutes.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is GIS?

From guiding disaster relief efforts to shaping smarter cities, Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, empower us to see and understand our planet in ways that were once unimaginable. If you're new to this realm or simply curious about its potential, this guide will unravel the magic of GIS, exploring its core concepts, vital components, and transformative real-world uses. By the end, you'll see why this technology is revolutionizing industries and decision-making across the globe.
  
  
  Understanding the Basics of GIS
At its core, GIS is a powerful computer-based tool that captures, stores, analyzes, and displays data linked to specific spots on Earth's surface. Think of it as a dynamic digital map, layered with rich information. One layer might trace winding road networks, while another highlights population clusters or rainfall zones. By tying location to detailed data, GIS turns raw numbers into vivid, interactive visuals that reveal hidden insights.What makes GIS truly remarkable is its knack for weaving together diverse datasets through the common thread of place. Whether it's census statistics, satellite photos, or social media buzz, GIS merges these elements to create a full, clear picture of any area. This fusion helps uncover trends and connections that might stay buried in old-school spreadsheets or static reports, making it an invaluable asset for anyone seeking deeper understanding.
  
  
  Core Components and Key Functions
GIS thrives as a unified system, built on a foundation of critical pieces working in harmony. It relies on hardware for raw processing power, software for crafting visualizations and running analyses, and spatial databases to house vast troves of geographic data. Together, these elements enable GIS to tackle several essential roles.First, it organizes data, sorting geographic points and blending inputs from a wide array of sources. Next, it brings this information to life through engaging maps and digital models that simplify complex ideas. Then, it dives into spatial analysis, using advanced methods to unearth patterns and relationships. Finally, it empowers users to create and refine data, crafting fresh datasets or polishing existing ones for accuracy.Picture a city planner at work, using GIS tools to layer zoning rules over flood risk zones. The resulting map becomes a guiding light, pinpointing safe spots for new buildings while ensuring compliance with regulations. This kind of practical insight shows the true strength of GIS in action.GIS juggles two main types of geospatial data, each with a unique role in mapping our world. Raster data comes as a grid of cells or pixels, each packed with details like height or heat readings. This style shines when handling continuous information, such as sweeping satellite images or weather radar visuals, offering a broad, textured view.In contrast, vector data sketches out geographic features with precise points, lines, and polygons. It's perfect for mapping distinct elements, like property edges or street layouts. Imagine a city map where points mark bus stops, lines trace roads, and polygons outline green spaces. This format delivers sharp, exact representations.Beyond these two, GIS taps into a vast pool of sources, from land records to mobile phone signals. Its ability to unite such varied data through location as a central link transforms it into a powerhouse for comprehensive, all-encompassing analysis.
  
  
  Real-World Applications and Impact
The reach of GIS stretches across countless fields, proving itself as a cornerstone for smart decisions and efficient resource use. Its influence touches many areas with profound effect.In logistics, it streamlines delivery paths and fleet movements, slashing expenses and shrinking carbon footprints. For infrastructure, it monitors the health of roads and utilities, ensuring timely care and upgrades. Environmental planning benefits as GIS models climate strategies and pinpoints prime spots for sustainable projects. During crises, it shapes emergency plans for events like storms or quakes. Even in business, it dissects market shifts to fuel growth plans.Take disaster response as a striking example. When wildfires rage, response teams lean on GIS to chart impacted zones, monitor fire spread in real time, and carve out safe escape routes. This kind of spatial insight doesn't just inform, it saves lives by speeding up critical choices.To peek under the hood of GIS data handling, consider this basic pseudo-code for finding nearby emergency shelters:define function findNearestShelter(currentLocation, shelterList):
    initialize shortestDistance as infinity
    initialize nearestShelter as null
    for each shelter in shelterList:
        distance = calculateDistance(currentLocation, shelter.location)
        if distance is less than shortestDistance:
            shortestDistance = distance
            nearestShelter = shelter
    return nearestShelter
This snippet reflects how GIS tools crunch spatial ties, guiding users to vital resources in urgent times.With the immense potential of GIS now in view, you're ready to take your first steps. Kick off by exploring free tools like QGIS, a robust platform packed with features for beginners to master the basics. Seek out online tutorials or join community forums to sharpen your skills in mapping and analysis. If you're with a team or organization, brainstorm ways GIS could solve specific hurdles, whether in streamlining workflows or boosting planning precision.Start with a simple project, like plotting local landmarks or sifting through community stats. As confidence builds, tackle bigger challenges, such as environmental simulations or market studies. The secret lies in hands-on learning through trial and exploration. GIS isn't merely a tool, it's a window into viewing our world through the prism of place. Dive in, and you'll uncover insights that pave the way for wiser, more sustainable choices. Embrace this journey, and let GIS inspire you to map out a better tomorrow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GeoPandas Basics: Maps, Projections, and Spatial Joins</title><link>https://realpython.com/geopandas/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GeoPandas extends pandas to make working with geospatial data in Python intuitive and powerful. If you’re looking to do geospatial tasks in Python and want a library with a pandas-like API, then GeoPandas is an excellent choice. This tutorial shows you how to accomplish four common geospatial tasks: reading in data, mapping it, applying a projection, and doing a spatial join.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that: with support for spatial data. This data typically lives in a  column and allows  such as projections and spatial joins, while  focuses on richer interactive web maps after data preparation.You  with  and  data using  with an authority code like  or .A  stores longitude and latitude in degrees, while a  uses linear units like meters or feet for area and distance calculations.Spatial joins use  with predicates like  or , and both inputs must share the same CRS or the relationships will be computed incorrectly.Here’s how GeoPandas compares with alternative libraries:Projections, spatial joinsGeoPandas builds on pandas by adding support for geospatial data and operations like projections and spatial joins. It also includes tools for creating maps. Folium complements this by focusing on interactive, web-based maps that you can customize more deeply. Test your knowledge with our interactive “GeoPandas Basics: Maps, Projections, and Spatial Joins” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Getting Started With GeoPandasYou’ll first prepare your environment and load a small dataset that you’ll use throughout the tutorial. In the next two subsections, you’ll install the necessary packages and read in a sample dataset of New York City borough boundaries. This gives you a concrete GeoDataFrame to explore as you learn the core concepts.This tutorial uses two packages:  for working with geographic data and  for loading sample data. It’s a good idea to install these packages inside a virtual environment so your project stays isolated from the rest of your system and you can manage its dependencies cleanly. Using the  option ensures you have everything needed for reading data, transforming coordinate systems, and creating plots. For most readers, this will work out of the box.If you do run into installation issues, the project’s maintainers provide alternative installation options on the official installation page.Most geospatial datasets come in GeoJSON or shapefile format. The  function can read both, and it accepts either a local file path or a URL.In the example below, you’ll use  to load the New York City Borough Boundaries (NYBB) dataset. The  package provides a convenient path to this dataset, so you don’t need to download anything manually. You’ll also drop unnecessary columns: is a . A GeoDataFrame has rows, columns, and all the methods of a pandas DataFrame. The difference is that it typically includes a special  column, which stores geographic shapes instead of plain numbers or text.The  column is a . It behaves like a normal pandas , but its values are spatial objects that you can map and run spatial queries against. In the  dataset, each borough’s geometry is a —a shape made of several polygons—because every borough consists of multiple islands. Soon you’ll use these geometries to make maps and run spatial operations, such as finding which borough a point falls inside.Once you’ve loaded a GeoDataFrame, one of the quickest ways to understand your data is to visualize it. In this section, you’ll learn how to create both static and interactive maps. This allows you to inspect shapes, spot patterns, and confirm that your geometries look the way you expect.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Warp Speed Networking: Simplifying Decentralized Node Management with Go and Wails</title><link>https://dev.to/githubopensource/warp-speed-networking-simplifying-decentralized-node-management-with-go-and-wails-emk</link><author>GitHubOpenSource</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:41:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WarpNet is a decentralized, peer-to-peer social network built with Go, inspired by Twitter.

Your UMAP looks beautiful. Now comes the hard part: If you've worked with scRNA-seq data, you know this pain. Manual annotation takes weeks. Reference-based methods fail on disease samples. And when you finally publish, Reviewer 2 asks: "How confident are you in cluster 7's annotation?"
  
  
  The Annotation Bottleneck is Real
Reference classifiers trained on healthy tissue show  on disease samplesThey miss rare cell types in ~20% of cases
Manual annotation has 25% inter-annotator variabilityCurrent methods give you a label with zero justificationWorse, datasets now routinely contain . The computational bottleneck has shifted from analysis to biological interpretation.
  
  
  Why LLMs Alone Don't Cut It
GPT-4 achieved 75% agreement with expert annotations—impressive! But existing LLM approaches have critical gaps:They only see , not full expression profilesKnowledge is  (no current literature)No mechanism to  against databasesZero uncertainty quantificationYou get a confident answer that might be completely wrong.
  
  
  Architecture Over Model Selection
Here's what we learned building CyteType: the problem isn't the LLM—it's how you structure the task.Instead of asking one model "what is this cell?", we built a  where each agent handles a distinct part of scientific reasoning:
Establishes biological ground truth  annotation begins. Infers organism, tissue, pathway context from your data and metadata. Integrates with GTEx, Enrichr (GO, Reactome, WikiPathways), and blitzGSEA.multiple competing hypotheses instead of one prediction. Tests each against the  by querying a pseudobulked expression database. Selects the best hypothesis and maps it to Cell Ontology terms.
Simulates an expert panel. Checks predictions against CellGuide, detects cellular heterogeneity, triggers re-annotation when needed. This creates an interpretable "trust layer."
Connects annotations to current knowledge. Searches PubMed for supporting evidence, identifies disease associations (Disease Ontology), flags drug targets (Drug Ontology).
Synthesizes results across your entire study. Performs similarity analysis, disambiguates naming inconsistencies, generates semantic cluster ordering.
  
  
  The Benchmark That Matters
We tested on  across four diverse datasets (HypoMap, Immune Cell Atlas, GTEx v9, Mouse Pancreatic Atlas).To isolate architectural benefits, we compared CyteType against GPTCellType using the same GPT-5 model:CyteType vs. GPTCellType (same LLM): 388% higher similarity score (p < .001) 267% higher
 100% higherThe comparison using identical models proves: architecture matters more than model choice.
  
  
  Model Flexibility Without Sacrificing Performance
Here's the kicker: you're not locked into expensive API calls.Open-weight models like DeepSeek R1 and Kimi K2 achieve  at lower cost. LLMs with built-in chain-of-thought reasoning showed  (p = 0.22)—CyteType's workflow supersedes model-native reasoning.Choose models based on Run locally with Ollama for Switch models without rewriting your pipeline
  
  
  More Than Labels: Discovery
Applying CyteType to 977 clusters across 20 datasets revealed: received functional enhancement (cell state information) refined to specific subtypes

Cool. Now you need  to talk to each other — and suddenly you're debugging race conditions at 3 AM.Multi-agent systems sound simple until you build one. This article covers five communication patterns I've used in production, with code examples and honest assessments of when each one breaks.When agents need to coordinate, you face three fundamental challenges: — agents start and stop independently — each agent has its own worldview — "I said X then Y" doesn't mean the other agent sees X before YEvery pattern below is a different tradeoff between these constraints.
  
  
  Pattern 1: The Shared Filesystem (Mailbox Pattern)
The simplest approach: agents read and write files in shared directories. Agents on the same machine, low message volume, human-readable debugging. You can literally  and  to debug. High throughput (filesystem isn't a message queue), agents on different machines, ordering guarantees needed across many senders. Atomic writes matter. I once lost messages because an agent read a half-written JSON file. The  pattern fixes this —  is atomic on most filesystems.
  
  
  Pattern 2: The Relay Agent (Hub-and-Spoke)
When agents can't directly access each other's storage, route through a coordinator. Heterogeneous agents (different runtimes, different machines), when you need a single audit trail, when message routing logic gets complex. The hub is a single point of failure. If the relay goes down, communication stops. Also adds latency for every message. Use the relay for cross-machine communication, file-based for same-machine fast-path:
  
  
  Pattern 3: The Shared Ledger (Event Sourcing)
Instead of sending messages, agents append events to a shared log. Every agent reads the same log and derives its own state. When you need full auditability, when agents need to reconstruct historical state, when the "truth" is the sequence of events rather than any single snapshot. Log grows forever (need compaction), slow replay on large histories, concurrent appends need coordination (file locking or use a proper database). Event sourcing turns communication into a side effect of recording what happened. Agents don't send messages — they announce actions. Other agents observe.
  
  
  Pattern 4: The Handoff Chain
When agents run sequentially (Agent A finishes, Agent B starts), communication is a structured handoff document. Sequential agent execution (the most common case for AI agents that run on schedules), when you need guaranteed context transfer, when the "conversation" is slow (minutes/hours between turns). Doesn't work for concurrent agents. The handoff is a snapshot, not a stream.
  
  
  Pattern 5: The Contract Protocol (Request/Response)
When agents need to coordinate on specific tasks with guaranteed completion. Task delegation between specialized agents, when you need accountability (who did what), when work items have clear completion criteria. Overhead is high for simple messages. Don't use contracts for "hey, check this out" — use them for "build this thing and tell me when it's done."
  
  
  Choosing the Right Pattern
Cross-machine, many agentsAudit trails, event-drivenMost multi-agent systems only need Pattern 1 (Mailbox) + Pattern 4 (Handoff). The file-based mailbox handles async coordination. The handoff chain handles sequential continuity. Everything else is optimization for scale you probably don't have yet.Start simple. Add complexity only when the simple version demonstrably fails. Agents sending free-form text to each other and parsing it with regex. Use structured messages. Always. A central agent that knows everything and coordinates everyone. This creates a bottleneck and a single point of failure. Prefer agents that can operate independently and only coordinate when necessary. Agents checking for messages every 100ms. Use filesystem watchers ( on Linux,  on macOS) or exponential backoff. "I sent A before B, so the other agent will see A first." Not guaranteed. Include sequence numbers or timestamps and handle out-of-order delivery.Error recovery strategies for multi-agent systemsMonitoring and debugging agent communication in production]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Useful DIY Python Functions for Parsing Dates and Times</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-useful-diy-python-functions-for-parsing-dates-and-times</link><author>Bala Priya C</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/bala-diy-python-funcs-datetime.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dates and times shouldn’t break your code, but they often do.

Perfect for creating reports, archives, or anonymized content.Check out the full project on GitHub
.Step 1: Install DependenciesVID2PDFPro uses several Python libraries. Install them using pip:pip install opencv-python pillow ttkbootstrap tkinterdnd2
opencv-python – For reading and processing video frames.Pillow – To manipulate images and generate PDFs.ttkbootstrap – For modern themed GUIs.tkinterdnd2 – To enable drag-and-drop in Tkinter.Step 2: Import Required ModulesWe need several built-in and third-party modules:import sys
import os
import threading
import queue
import time
from pathlib import Path

import cv2
from PIL import Image
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from tkinterdnd2 import TkinterDnD, DND_FILES
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.widgets.scrolled import ScrolledText
threading & queue – For background processing and safe UI updates.cv2 (OpenCV) – For reading video frames and anonymization.Pillow (PIL) – To convert frames to images and PDFs.tkinter & ttkbootstrap – For the GUI.TkinterDnD – Adds drag-and-drop support.Step 3: Create the Main App ClassWe encapsulate the app in a class for organization:class VID2PDFPro:
    APP_NAME = "VID2PDF Pro"
    APP_VERSION = "1.0"
    PAGE_SIZES = ["Original", "A4", "Letter"]

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TkinterDnD.Tk()
        tb.Style("superhero")
        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.geometry("1150x650")

        self.video_path = tk.StringVar()
        self.output_dir = tk.StringVar()
        self.frame_interval = tk.IntVar(value=10)
        self.pdf_dpi = tk.IntVar(value=200)
        self.page_size = tk.StringVar(value="Original")
        self.an_faces = tk.BooleanVar(value=True)
        self.an_plates = tk.BooleanVar(value=True)
        self.stop_event = threading.Event()

        self.ui_queue = queue.Queue()
        self.progress_var = tk.IntVar(value=0)
        self.counter_var = tk.StringVar(value="Processed: 0 / 0")
        self.eta_var = tk.StringVar(value="ETA: --:--")

        # Load Haar cascades for face and plate detection
        self.face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml")

        self._build_ui()
        self.process_ui_queue()
TkinterDnD.Tk() – creates a GUI window that supports drag-and-drop.ttkbootstrap.Style() – applies a theme.tk.StringVar / tk.IntVar – bind GUI inputs to Python variables.Haar cascades are pre-trained classifiers for face/license plate detection.We create input fields, buttons, and a live progress log:def _build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME, font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=(10, 2))
    tb.Label(self.root, text="Video to PDF Extraction & Anonymization",
             font=("Segoe UI", 10, "italic"), foreground="#9ca3af").pack(pady=(0, 10))

    # Video input section
    src_box = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Video Input (Drag & Drop Supported)", padding=10)
    src_box.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=6)
    self.video_entry = tb.Entry(src_box, textvariable=self.video_path)
    self.video_entry.pack(side="left", fill="x", expand=True)
    self.video_entry.drop_target_register(DND_FILES)

                  filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Video","*.mp4 *.avi *.mov")]))).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Users can drag and drop videos or use a Browse button.DND_FILES allows drag-and-drop of files directly into the entry box.VID2PDFPro lets you anonymize faces and license plates:adv = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Advanced", padding=10)
adv.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=6)
tb.Checkbutton(adv, text="Anonymize Faces", variable=self.an_faces, bootstyle="success").pack(side="left", padx=10)
tb.Checkbutton(adv, text="Anonymize Plates", variable=self.an_plates, bootstyle="success").pack(side="left", padx=10)
Checkboxes allow users to enable or disable face/plate anonymization.Step 6: Anonymization FunctionWe blur faces and pixelate license plates:def anonymize(self, frame):
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    if self.an_faces.get():
        for x, y, w, h in self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.2, 5):
            roi = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            frame[y:y+h, x:x+w] = cv2.GaussianBlur(roi, (51,51), 0)
    if self.an_plates.get():
        for x, y, w, h in self.plate_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4):
            roi = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            roi = cv2.resize(roi, (16,16))
            roi = cv2.resize(roi, (w,h), interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)
            frame[y:y+h, x:x+w] = roi
    return frame
License plates → Pixelated for privacyControlled by checkboxes in the GUI.Step 7: Extract Frames and Save as PDFThis function converts frames to PDF:def extract_to_pdf(self):
    video_file = self.video_path.get()
    out_dir = self.output_dir.get()
    if not video_file or not out_dir:
        messagebox.showerror("Missing", "Select video and output folder")
        return

    self.stop_event.clear()
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)

One experimental feature using o1-preview, a few hundred test runs, and suddenly your bill looks very different from last month.The Azure portal shows you the numbers eventually, but when you're iterating quickly on AI features, you need real-time visibility. That's exactly what  delivers - instant Azure OpenAI cost tracking from your terminal.
  
  
  The Azure OpenAI Cost Challenge
Unlike traditional cloud services with predictable pricing, Azure OpenAI costs vary wildly based on:Model choice (GPT-4o-mini vs o1-preview is a 5-15x difference)Token usage (both prompt and completion tokens)Deployment scaling and throughputTesting and development cyclesThe questions you need answered daily:"How much did my o1-preview deployment cost yesterday?""Which resource group is burning through credits?""Did that new feature spike my OpenAI spend?""How does dev environment cost compare to production?"Checking this through the Azure portal means multiple clicks, page loads, and waiting. When you're checking costs multiple times a day during active development, this friction adds up. is a Python CLI tool built specifically for developers who need fast answers about their Azure spending. For Azure OpenAI users, it's the fastest way to track Cognitive Services costs without touching the Azure portal.
  
  
  Why It Works for Azure OpenAI
: See your OpenAI costs in 2 seconds, not 2 minutes: Catch cost spikes the day they happen, not at month-end: Monitor individual Azure OpenAI accounts separately: Separate dev, staging, and production costs effortlessly: Break down by service, location, resource group, or resource ID: Python API for integrating into your CI/CD or daily reports: Works with any billing currencyInstallation takes one line:Log in with Azure CLI (if you haven't already):Check your Azure OpenAI costs:azurecost  your-subscription-name
USD                 2025-11    2025-12

total                 1247.83    2891.45
Cognitive Services    1247.83    2891.45
That's your Azure OpenAI spend right there - Cognitive Services is the billing category for Azure OpenAI. Notice the spike in December? Now you can investigate what changed.
  
  
  Real-World Azure OpenAI Use Cases

  
  
  Scenario 1: Daily Cost Monitoring During Development
You're building a new reasoning agent with o1-preview. Check costs every morning:azurecost  prod-subscription  DAILY  7
USD           2025-12-15  2025-12-16  2025-12-17  2025-12-18

total                45.23        52.18       178.45        51.20
Cognitive Services   45.23        52.18       178.45        51.20
Whoa, December 17th spiked to $178. That's the day you started load testing with o1-preview. Now you know exactly when and how much it costs.
  
  
  Scenario 2: Environment-Based Cost Breakdown
You have separate resource groups for dev, staging, and production. See costs side by side:azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceGroup  ServiceName
USD                                        2025-11    2025-12

total                                        1247.83    2891.45
ai-dev-rg/Cognitive Services                  342.15     456.32
ai-staging-rg/Cognitive Services              198.42     287.89
ai-prod-rg/Cognitive Services                 707.26    2147.24
Production jumped from $707 to $2147. Time to optimize those prompts or consider GPT-4o-mini for some use cases.
  
  
  Scenario 3: Focused Investigation on Production
Something's wrong with production costs. Drill down to just that resource group:azurecost  ai-subscription  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  14
See two weeks of daily costs for production only. Spot the pattern, correlate with deployments or feature releases.
  
  
  Scenario 4: Multi-Region Cost Analysis
Running Azure OpenAI deployments in multiple regions? Group by location:azurecost  global-ai-sub  Location  ServiceName
USD                                   2025-11    2025-12

total                                   1247.83    2891.45
East US/Cognitive Services               823.14    1923.87
West Europe/Cognitive Services           424.69     967.58
East US is handling most of the load. Maybe redistribute traffic or consider regional pricing differences.
  
  
  Scenario 5: Resource-Level Cost Analysis
Running multiple Azure OpenAI accounts for different teams or use cases? Track costs at the individual resource level:azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceId
USD                                                                                     2025-12    2026-01

total                                                                                     5741.44   16571.60
/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/chatbot-prod           3401.80   16390.44
/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/analytics-engine       2194.17     131.82
/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/internal-tools          145.47      49.34
This shows exactly which Azure OpenAI account is consuming credits. Perfect for:: Charge back costs to specific teams or projectsIdentifying cost anomalies: Spot which deployment suddenly increased spendMulti-tenant environments: Track costs per customer or tenant: Distribute budget based on actual usage patternsCombine with daily granularity to investigate when a specific resource started costing more:azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceId  DAILY  7

  
  
  Why This Matters for Azure OpenAI Users
Building with Azure OpenAI is different from traditional cloud infrastructure. With VMs or databases, costs are fairly predictable. But with modern language models like GPT-4o and o1-preview, costs depend on how users interact with your application:Long conversations = more tokens = higher costsComplex reasoning tasks = more input tokensDetailed responses = more completion tokensTesting and iteration = multiplied costsDuring active development, you need to check costs frequently. Not once a month when the bill arrives, but daily or even multiple times a day.The Azure portal workflow kills this feedback loop:Navigate to Azure portal (wait for load)Find the right subscriptionClick through to Cost ManagementConfigure time range and filtersBy the time you see the numbers, you've burned 2-3 minutes. When you're doing this multiple times daily, the friction discourages you from checking at all.Then you're surprised at month-end when the bill is 3x what you expected. fixes this. Checking costs becomes as fast as checking git status:azurecost  ai-subscription  DAILY  7
Two seconds. Real-time feedback. No context switching.This speed changes behavior. When checking costs is instant, you actually do it. You catch issues early. You experiment with confidence because you're monitoring the impact.The tool emerged from my own need while building AI features. I was spending too much time in the portal doing the same query repeatedly. I wanted something terminal-based that integrated into my development workflow.What started as a personal script evolved into a proper tool that my team adopted, then others in the community found useful. The philosophy is simple: do one thing well - show Azure costs fast and clearly.
  
  
  Automate Azure OpenAI Cost Monitoring
The Python API lets you integrate cost tracking into your workflows. Send daily Azure OpenAI cost reports to Slack:Run this as a daily cron job or GitHub Action. Your team gets automatic cost visibility without anyone checking the portal.: Trigger warnings when daily costs exceed thresholds: Track which team or feature is using OpenAI credits: Validate costs before promoting to production: Generate reports for accounting without manual exports
  
  
  Configuration Tips for AI Workloads
Set environment variables to streamline your daily checks:your-ai-subscription-id
ai-prod-rg
Now run  with no arguments:Create shell aliases for common queries:Type  each morning as part of your routine. Takes 2 seconds, keeps you informed. Use  when you need to drill down to individual Azure OpenAI accounts.
  
  
  Best Practices for Azure OpenAI Cost Management
Based on using  with AI workloads, here are patterns that work:azurecost  ai-sub  DAILY  7
Catch anomalies before they compound. One day of unexpected costs is manageable. A month is not.2. Before and after feature releases
azurecost  ai-sub  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  3


azurecost  ai-sub  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  3
Measure the cost impact of new features. Make data-driven decisions about o1-preview vs GPT-4o-mini.3. Set up automated alerts
Use the Python API to send daily reports. Don't rely on remembering to check manually.
Use separate resource groups for dev, staging, production. Makes cost attribution trivial.5. Monitor during load testing
Run  before and after load tests. Understand your cost-per-request at scale before going live.

Strong typing, a simple concurrency model, a strict compiler. If something is wrong, it usually fails fast.And yet, many Go bugs don’t fail fast at all.They quietly pass tests, survive code review, behave perfectly on your laptop, and only show up in production — under real traffic, real data, and long-running processes.This article isn’t about exotic edge cases. It’s about bugs that look innocent, feel “Go-ish”, and still manage to hurt you in production. Especially if you’re a junior or mid-level Go developer.
  
  
  Goroutines That Never Die
One of the most common production issues in Go is not a crash, but slow degradation. Memory usage grows, CPU usage creeps up, and the number of goroutines keeps increasing.Often the root cause is a goroutine that was supposed to finish — but never did.Consider a worker reading from a channel:This code looks clean and idiomatic. In tests, the channel is closed properly. Locally, everything works.In production, things are different. A producer might crash, a request might be canceled, or a code path that closes the channel might never execute. The goroutine stays alive forever, blocked on receive.Over time, these goroutines accumulate. The service is still “up”, but it’s slowly dying.Production-grade goroutines need an explicit lifetime. Usually that means context cancellation:If a goroutine doesn’t know when it should stop, it probably won’t.
  
  
  Data Races That Only Exist Under Load
Go’s race detector is excellent, but it’s not magic. Many race conditions simply don’t appear without real concurrency and real pressure.A classic example is shared configuration:At some point, someone adds hot reload:This might run fine for weeks. Tests pass. The race detector stays quiet.Then traffic grows. CPU cores are actually busy. Suddenly behavior becomes inconsistent, but nothing obviously crashes.The problem isn’t Go. The problem is mutating shared state without synchronization. In production, concurrency is not hypothetical — it’s constant.A safer approach is to treat configuration as immutable and swap it atomically:Production reveals races not because it’s special, but because it’s honest.
  
  
  The Interface That Is Nil (Except It Isn’t)
This is one of the most confusing bugs for people new to Go, and it often hides until a rare code path is executed in production.From the caller’s point of view:You expect nothing to happen. Instead, the error branch runs.The reason is subtle but fundamental. An interface value in Go contains both a type and a value. Here, the value is nil, but the type is not. That makes the interface itself non-nil.This kind of bug often appears only in production, when a rarely used error path finally executes.The fix is simple but strict: never return a typed nil as an interface. Return a real  or a real error — nothing in between.
  
  
  Timeouts That Work Locally and Fail in Production
Timeouts are another classic “it worked on my machine” trap.Locally, requests are fast. In staging, everything looks fine. In production, requests start timing out randomly.The difference is the network. DNS latency, TLS handshakes, slow upstreams, saturated connection pools — none of that exists on localhost.A single global timeout often hides where time is actually being spent. A more production-friendly approach is to put deadlines on requests themselves:Production is not slow because Go is slow. It’s slow because networks are unreliable.
  
  
  Allocation Patterns That Break at Scale
Many performance problems don’t come from algorithms, but from memory behavior that changes with scale.Code like this looks harmless:Maybe it runs once per request. Maybe it’s short-lived. Locally, no problem.In production, under sustained load, this creates constant pressure on the garbage collector. Large allocations must be zeroed, tracked, and scanned. Latency spikes appear, and p99 gets ugly.This is why production Go code often relies on reuse:The GC in Go is very good, but it still obeys physics.
  
  
  Why These Bugs Feel “Production-Only”
Because production is the first place where your code experiences:
long uptimes, real concurrency, unreliable networks, large data, and sustained load.Go doesn’t hide these problems — it simply doesn’t simulate them for you.If you write Go as if production is calm and predictable, production will eventually disagree.This series focuses on , not just using it.
If you want to continue in the same mindset,  is a great next step.It’s a single subscription that gives you access to hundreds of in-depth, text-based courses — from Go internals and concurrency to system design and distributed systems. No videos, no per-course purchases, just structured learning you can move through at your own pace.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build an Exam Result Predictor in Python with Tkinter &amp; Machine Learning</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/build-an-exam-result-predictor-in-python-with-tkinter-machine-learning-4jhe</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:24:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wondered if you could predict student exam results based on study habits and previous grades?

Then it wakes up with no idea what it was doing, why, or what matters. The persistence layer saved data. But the  — the "what was I thinking" — is gone.This is the handoff problem. And if you're building agents that run across multiple sessions, it's the hardest part of the architecture to get right.
  
  
  Why Handoffs Are Harder Than Persistence
My previous article covered what to persist: configuration, accumulated state, operational context. But persistence is storage. Handoffs are  — from your past self to your future self.The difference matters. A database stores facts. A handoff tells a story: here's where we are, here's what matters right now, and here's what to do next.Get persistence wrong and you lose data. Get handoffs wrong and your agent spends its first five minutes confused, re-discovering what it already knew, or worse — making decisions based on stale assumptions.
  
  
  The Four Handoff Anti-Patterns
Before the solution, let's catalog the failures. I've seen (and built) all of these:The next session gets  and understands . Information without prioritization is noise. Your agent either parses all of it (slow, context-heavy) or gives up and starts fresh.Just a file path. No summary, no priority, no narrative. The next session opens the file and faces the same cold-start problem, just one level deeper. This is delegation, not handoff.No explicit handoff at all. "The framework handles continuity." It doesn't. Frameworks handle data flow. They don't understand which of your 15 active tasks is urgent versus background. They don't know that the API you were calling started returning 429s and you switched strategies. They don't know  things are the way they are.# Check the logs from 14:00-14:30 for context
# The relevant PR is #847
# See Slack thread from yesterday
Your next session has to do forensic work to reconstruct what the previous session knew. This is fragile (logs rotate, threads get buried) and expensive (your agent burns context window on archaeology instead of work).
  
  
  A Structured Handoff Protocol
Here's what actually works. A good handoff has five layers:The raw facts. Current values of critical variables, in a typed, validated format.This is the "what" — the current state of the world.
  
  
  Layer 2: Narrative Context
Three to five sentences, human-readable, explaining what happened and why the state looks the way it does.This is the "why" — the story behind the data.What was decided, what was deferred, and what trade-offs were made.This prevents your next session from re-litigating resolved questions or missing deferred work.What the next session should do first, second, and third.Explicit priority removes the most common cold-start problem: "I have 12 things I could do. Which one matters right now?"
  
  
  Layer 5: Warnings and Gotchas
The things that will bite the next session if nobody mentions them.This is institutional knowledge that exists nowhere except in the previous session's working memory.These come from building systems that actually use multi-session handoffs:
  
  
  1. Handoff Loaders Fail Silently
The most dangerous failure mode isn't a crash — it's a loader that  but doesn't actually populate the agent's context. The handoff file gets read. The JSON parses. But the agent starts its work loop without checking whether the loaded data made it into working memory.: Always verify after loading. Have your agent explicitly reference handoff data in its first action. If it can't, the load failed.
  
  
  2. Redundancy Beats Optimization
Don't put all your continuity in one file. Use multiple channels:: The structured handoff file: A state.json with running totals and current values: Human-readable journal entriesIf any one channel fails, the others provide enough context to recover. This sounds wasteful. It's not. The cost of a confused agent re-doing work far exceeds the cost of writing three small files.
  
  
  3. Human-Readable Beats Machine-Optimized
Binary formats, compressed state, clever encodings — they all break when you need to debug at 3 AM. Make your handoffs readable by a human with a text editor. JSON with clear key names. Narrative summaries in plain language.When something goes wrong (and it will), you want to  the handoff file and immediately understand the agent's last known state.
  
  
  4. Test With Real Restarts
Write your handoff. Kill the agent. Restart it. Did it pick up where it left off? Not "did it load the file" — did it actually  correctly?Most handoff bugs only surface under real restart conditions. Simulated loads in the same process don't catch issues like stale file handles, cached state that masks a bad load, or race conditions between the write and the next session's read.Your handoff format will evolve. Your agent from two weeks ago wrote v0.8 handoffs. Your agent today expects v1.0. Without a version field, your loader silently misinterprets fields and your agent makes decisions based on misread data.The handoff is where engineering meets epistemology. You're not just passing data — you're passing . Your future agent self needs to reconstruct enough of your current mental model to make good decisions, without having lived through the experiences that built that model.This is fundamentally a compression problem: how do you compress a session's worth of experience into something small enough to transmit and rich enough to be useful?The five-layer protocol works because it compresses along multiple dimensions simultaneously — facts (state), story (narrative), reasoning (decisions), action (priorities), and caution (warnings). No single layer is sufficient. Together, they give the next session what it needs to start working instead of start orienting.Build your handoffs like you're writing a note to a colleague who's taking over your shift. Because that's exactly what you're doing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quiz: GeoPandas Basics: Maps, Projections, and Spatial Joins</title><link>https://realpython.com/quizzes/geopandas/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this quiz, you’ll test your understanding of GeoPandas.You’ll review coordinate reference systems, GeoDataFrames, interactive maps, and spatial joins with .

Then my API grew, and things got messy.Let me tell you why I built Rivaas. This isn't about saying other frameworks are bad. They're great. But I needed something different.Three years ago, I started a simple API. Just a few endpoints. I picked Gin because it was fast and popular.The API worked well. Then the project grew.
  
  
  Observability Was Bolted On
We needed to track metrics. I added Prometheus manually. Connected it to the routes. Added custom middleware.Then we needed tracing. I added Jaeger. More middleware. More manual work.Then we needed structured logging. Another library. More integration code.Each piece worked. But nothing talked to each other. Logs didn't include trace IDs. Metrics didn't match route names. Every new feature meant writing more glue code.
  
  
  Configuration Was Scattered
Environment variables were everywhere:Some config came from files. Some from env vars. Some was hardcoded. When you needed to change something, you had to search through multiple files.When we shut down the server, we had to remember to:Stop accepting new requestsWait for current requests to finishClose database connectionsThis was all manual. Miss one step and you lose data or get errors.Every endpoint needed validation code:Multiply this by 50 endpoints. That's a lot of boring code.I needed a name for this project. I wanted something meaningful.I thought about what I wanted the framework to be. Then I remembered  - wild rhubarb.This plant grows in the mountains of Iran. At 1,500 to 3,000 meters altitude. The weather is harsh. The soil is poor. Few plants can survive there.But Rivās thrives. It has four special qualities:Rivās survives freezing winters and hot summers. It handles extreme conditions.Your API needs to be resilient too. It should handle panics gracefully. Shut down properly. Recover from errors.Rivaas includes panic recovery, graceful shutdown, and health checks. Your service stays up even when things go wrong.Rivās doesn't need much. Poor soil is fine. Little water is enough.Your framework should be the same. It shouldn't use tons of memory. It shouldn't slow down your app.Rivaas uses 16 bytes per request. It handles 8.4 million requests per second. You don't need huge servers to run it.Rivās grows at different altitudes. In valleys and on peaks. It adapts to its environment.Your API runs in different places too. Your laptop. A container. A Kubernetes cluster.Rivaas works everywhere. Same code, different environments. It detects what's available and adapts.Rivās doesn't depend on other plants. It grows on its own.Your framework should include what you need. Not force you to find and connect dozens of libraries.Rivaas includes metrics, tracing, logging, validation, and config management. Everything talks to each other. You don't write glue code.These four qualities guide every decision in Rivaas.I sat down and made a list. What would my ideal framework look like?
  
  
  Batteries Included, But Not Locked In
Most frameworks are either bare minimum or all-in.Bare minimum frameworks give you routing. You add everything else yourself.All-in frameworks give you everything. But you can't swap parts out.I wanted both. Give me good defaults. But let me replace anything.Or use just the parts you need:Each package has its own . You can use one without the others.
  
  
  Observability Built In, Not Added Later
Metrics, tracing, and logging should be first-class features. Not afterthoughts.In Rivaas, observability is integrated:Logs include trace IDs automaticallyMetrics use the same service name as tracesEverything is configured in one placeYou turn it on with one option. You don't write integration code.
  
  
  Production-Ready Defaults
Most frameworks give you dev-friendly defaults. Then you search for "production configuration" and copy code from Stack Overflow.Rivaas has production-ready defaults:Graceful shutdown with timeoutHealth endpoints for KubernetesPanic recovery middlewareYou can override anything. But the defaults work in production.When something goes wrong, the error should tell you exactly what happened.Bad error: Rivaas gives you the second type. Your frontend developers will thank you.I made some choices early on. These shaped how Rivaas works.Each package is independent. Each has its own  file.rivaas/

  Functional Options Pattern
Every package uses the same configuration pattern:This makes the API consistent. Once you learn it in one package, you know it everywhere.
  
  
  The App Package as Integration Layer
The  package doesn't have much code. It's mostly integration.It takes all the other packages and connects them:Sets the service name everywhereYou can use  for convenience. Or skip it and wire things yourself.There are many Go frameworks. Why choose Rivaas?Here's an honest comparison:(✅ = built-in, ⚠️ = basic, ❌ = not included)Rivaas isn't always better. But it includes more out of the box.Want observability without setupNeed automatic API documentationBuild cloud-native servicesWant production-ready defaultsDon't choose Rivaas if you:Need the absolute smallest binaryWant to control every detailAlready have a working setup with another frameworkPrefer older, more stable frameworksBe honest with yourself about your needs.Building Rivaas took time. Here's what I learned.I didn't build everything at once. I started with the router. Made it fast. Then added binding. Then validation.Each piece got attention. Nothing was rushed.Early users had good ideas. They found bugs. They asked for features I hadn't thought about.The OpenAPI generation came from user requests. So did the multiple validation strategies.I wanted to support everything. But that's impossible.We dropped some features. We said no to some requests. This kept the codebase clean.Every feature has a maintenance cost. We only add features that are worth it.Code without docs is useless. I wrote guides for every package. Examples for every feature.Good documentation takes longer than code. But it's worth it.Rivaas is ready for production. But there's more to do.We need more contributors. More examples. More tutorials.If you use Rivaas, share your experience. Write about it. Help others.We want to integrate with more tools:8.4 million requests per second is good. But we can do better.We're always looking for optimizations. Small gains add up.Every release makes Rivaas more stable. We fix bugs fast. We improve APIs based on feedback.The goal is a framework you can trust in production.Want to help? Here's how:The best way to help is to use it. Build something. Find bugs. Share feedback.Write a blog post. Make a video. Share on social media.Help others discover Rivaas.Check the issues on GitHub. Look for "good first issue" tags.Write tests. Fix bugs. Add features.Found a confusing doc? Fix it. Missing an example? Add it.Documentation improvements are always welcome.I built Rivaas because I needed it. Maybe you need it too.It's not perfect. No framework is. But it solves real problems.Flexibility without chaosProduction-ready without configuration hellTry it in your next project. See if it fits your needs.If it does, great. If not, that's fine too. Choose what works for you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building Tamper-Proof Dual Audit Trails with VCP-XREF: A Developer&apos;s Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/veritaschain/building-tamper-proof-dual-audit-trails-with-vcp-xref-a-developers-guide-3flc</link><author>VeritasChain Standards Organization (VSO)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 11:32:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever tried to prove that a log file  tampered with? It's surprisingly hard. Hash chains prove sequence integrity. Signatures prove authorship. But neither proves that the signer didn't just... rewrite everything before signing.This is the core problem in trading systems, especially prop trading where 80-100 firms collapsed in 2024-2025 amid payout disputes. The firm controls the logs. The trader has no recourse.VCP-XREF solves this with a simple insight: when two independent parties log the same event, discrepancies reveal manipulation.
  
  
  The Problem: Single-Party Logs Are Inherently Untrustworthy
The problem? The owner can:Delete events before signingModify events before signing
Rewrite the entire log and re-signClaim events never happenedVerification passes. Trust fails.
  
  
  The Solution: VCP-XREF Dual Logging
VCP-XREF creates two independent audit trails that reference each other:┌─────────────────┐                    ┌─────────────────┐

He called it "not too bad for throwaway weekend projects." But for production systems? That's where the trouble starts.I've watched AI-generated codebases accumulate the same mess developers spent decades learning to avoid—duplication everywhere, inconsistent naming, missing edge cases. Then it hit me: these are exactly the problems Robert C. Martin warned about in  almost two decades ago.So I went back to the book, specifically Chapter 17's catalog of 66 code smells and heuristics. These aren't just relevant to AI coding—they're  relevant. AI makes exactly the mistakes Uncle Bob warned us about, just faster and at scale.The solution? —instruction files that AI agents read before writing code. I've translated Clean Code's complete catalog into Python skills you can use today. They work in Google's Antigravity IDE, Anthropic's Claude Code, and anywhere that supports the Agent Skills standard.Let me show you why we need this, and how to implement it.
  
  
  Even Linus Torvalds Vibe Codes (Sometimes)
In January 2026, Linus Torvalds revealed a side project called AudioNoise—a digital audio effects simulator he'd been tinkering with over the holidays. The Python visualizer, he noted, was "basically written by vibe-coding."In his own words from the repo:"I know more about analog filters—and that's not saying much—than I do about python. It started out as my typical 'google and do the monkey-see-monkey-do' kind of programming, but then I cut out the middle-man—me—and just used Google Antigravity to do the audio sample visualizer."The Hacker News discussion revealed two camps. Some saw it as validation: "It's official, vibe coding is legit." Others noted the crucial context: Torvalds used AI for the part he lacks expertise in (Python visualization) while hand-coding the parts he knows (C and digital signal processing).One commenter nailed it: "There's a big difference between vibe-coding an entire project and having an AI build a component that you lack competency for."Another observation cut deeper: "If anyone on the planet knows how to do vibe coding right, it's him"—because Torvalds spent decades mastering code review. He can spot bad code instantly. Most of us can't.But here's what's telling: Torvalds wrote tests for his hand-coded C—numerical accuracy checks for the DSP primitives he understands. The vibe-coded Python visualizer? No tests, no type hints, and a duplicated function definition that slipped right through. The same four-line method appears twice in a row—the first an empty stub, the second the real implementation. It's textbook "Accept All, don't read the diffs." The code runs fine (Python silently overwrites the first definition), but it's exactly the kind of dead code that accumulates into maintenance nightmares.This works for Torvalds' toy project precisely. It's a throwaway learning exercise. The moment that visualizer needs to be production code, those missing guardrails become technical debt.The same week, Torvalds rejected "AI slop" submissions to the Linux kernel, arguing that documentation telling people not to submit garbage won't help because "the people who would submit it won't read the documentation anyway."The lesson isn't that vibe coding is bad. It's that context matters. Skills let you define when to enforce rigor and when to let the vibes flow.
  
  
  The Data: AI Code Quality Is Getting Worse
  found AI adoption shows a negative relationship with software delivery stability. The 2025 report's central finding: "AI doesn't fix a team; it amplifies what's already there." Without robust control systems—strong testing, mature practices, fast feedback loops—increased AI-generated code leads to instability. Skills are exactly those control systems, encoded as instructions. analyzed 807 GitHub repositories after Cursor adoption: +30% static analysis warnings, +41% code complexity. The speed gains were transient; the quality problems compounded. analysis of 211 million lines of code from Google, Microsoft, Meta, and enterprise repositories found code duplication increased  with AI adoption. For the first time in their dataset, copy/pasted code exceeded refactored code.Even  shows the gap: developers use AI in roughly 60% of their work, but can fully delegate only 0-20% of tasks. The rest requires "thoughtful setup, active supervision, and human judgment."That gap—between what AI touches and what AI can own—is exactly what skills address. The setup  the skill. The supervision  the rules.
  
  
  The Pattern: AI Recreates Classic Code Smells
The research consistently identifies the same failure patterns. Here's how they map to specific Clean Code violations:Naming and Consistency ProblemsInconsistent variable names across similar functionsVague names like , , Mixing naming conventions (camelCase and snake_case)Clean Code rules: N1 (descriptive names), G11 (consistency), G24 (conventions)Copy/paste instead of extracting shared logicSame calculation appearing in multiple placesPattern repetition that should be abstractedClean Code rule: G5 (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)No validation of input boundariesAssumptions about data structure without verificationClean Code rules: G3 (boundary conditions), G4 (don't override safeties), G26 (be precise)Magic numbers without explanation (what does 86400 mean?)Unused variables cluttering codeFunctions mixing multiple abstraction levelsClean Code rules: G12 (remove clutter), G16 (no obscured intent), G34 (single abstraction level)Functions doing multiple things at onceExposing internal data unnecessarilyNested loops that could be optimizedClean Code rules: G8 (minimize public interface), G30 (functions do one thing)These aren't arbitrary style preferences—they're the exact problems that make code hard to maintain, debug, and extend. The skills we'll build enforce these rules automatically.The fix isn't to stop using AI. It's to give AI the explicit rules it needs to follow.Skills are markdown files containing domain-specific instructions that AI agents read before working on your code. They follow the Agent Skills open standard and work in Google Antigravity, Anthropic's Claude Code, and other compatible agents.The architecture is called . Instead of dumping every instruction into the agent's context at once (causing what Antigravity's docs call "Context Saturation"), skills work in layers:: The agent sees only a lightweight menu of skill names and descriptions: When your request matches a skill's description, the full instructions load: Scripts and templates are read only when the task requires themThis keeps the agent fast and focused. It's not thinking about database migrations when you're writing a React component.The  field is crucial—it's the trigger phrase. The agent semantically matches your request against all available skill descriptions to decide which ones to load. "Enforces function best practices" is vague. "Use when writing or refactoring Python functions" tells the agent exactly when to activate.Skills can do far more than enforce coding standards—the community has built skills for Stripe integration, Metasploit security testing, voice agents, and even multi-agent startup automation. This article focuses on one specific use case: encoding Clean Code principles.Let me show you how to translate Clean Code's catalog into working skills.
  
  
  Building the Skills: Three Examples
Rather than catalog all 66 rules exhaustively, I'll show you three critical categories in detail. The complete implementation is at the end.
  
  
  1. Comments (C1-C5): Code Should Explain Itself
Uncle Bob is famously skeptical of comments—not because documentation is bad, but because comments rot faster than code updates.File Reference: 

Comments shouldn't hold metadata. Use Git for author names, change history, 
ticket numbers, and dates. Comments are for technical notes about code only.



If a comment describes code that no longer exists or works differently, 
delete it immediately. Stale comments become "floating islands of 
irrelevance and misdirection."


i += 1  # increment i
user.save()  # save the user


i += 1  # compensate for zero-indexing in display



If a comment is worth writing, write it well:
 Choose words carefully
 Use correct grammar
 Don't ramble or state the obvious
 Be brief



Who knows how old it is? Who knows if it's meaningful? Delete it. 
Git remembers everything.



The best comment is the code itself. If you need a comment to explain 
what code does, refactor first, comment last.

  
  
  2. Functions (F1-F4): Small, Focused, Obvious
Functions should do one thing, do it well, and have an obvious purpose.File Reference: 
def create_user(name, email, age, country, timezone, language, newsletter):
    ...


@dataclass
class UserData:
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int
    country: str
    timezone: str
    language: str
    newsletter: bool

def create_user(data: UserData):
    ...

More than 3 arguments means your function is doing too much or needs 
a data structure.



Don't modify arguments as side effects. Return values instead.


def append_footer(report: Report) -> None:
    report.append("---Generated by System")


def with_footer(report: Report) -> Report:
    return report + "---Generated by System"



Boolean flags mean your function does at least two things.


def render(is_test: bool):
    if is_test:
        render_test_page()
    else:
        render_production_page()


def render_test_page(): ...
def render_production_page(): ...



If it's not called, delete it. No "just in case" code. Git preserves history.

  
  
  3. General Principles (G1-G36): The Core Rules
These are the fundamental patterns that separate clean code from legacy nightmares.File Reference: 

Every piece of knowledge has one authoritative representation.


tax_rate = 0.0825
ca_total = subtotal  1.0825
ny_total = subtotal  1.07


TAX_RATES = {"CA": 0.0825, "NY": 0.07}
def calculate_total(subtotal: float, state: str) -> float:
    return subtotal  (1 + TAX_RATES[state])



Don't be clever. Be clear.


return (x & 0x0F) << 4 | (y & 0x0F)


return pack_coordinates(x, y)


def calculate_pay(employee):
    if employee.type == "SALARIED":
        return employee.salary
    elif employee.type == "HOURLY":
        return employee.hours  employee.rate
    elif employee.type == "COMMISSIONED":
        return employee.base + employee.commission


class SalariedEmployee:
    def calculate_pay(self): return self.salary

class HourlyEmployee:
    def calculate_pay(self): return self.hours  self.rate

class CommissionedEmployee:
    def calculate_pay(self): return self.base + self.commission


if elapsed_time > 86400:
    ...


SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400
if elapsed_time > SECONDS_PER_DAY:
    ...



If you can extract another function, your function does more than one thing.


output_dir = context.options.scratch_dir.absolute_path


output_dir = context.get_scratch_dir()



When reviewing AI-generated code, verify:
 [ ] No duplication (G5)
 [ ] Clear intent, no magic numbers (G16, G25)
 [ ] Polymorphism over conditionals (G23)
 [ ] Functions do one thing (G30)
 [ ] No Law of Demeter violations (G36)
 [ ] Boundary conditions handled (G3)
 [ ] Dead code removed (G9)
I've translated all 66 rules from Clean Code Chapter 17 into skills covering six categories:

Martin's  principles. They work with Google Antigravity, Anthropic's Claude Code, and any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard.AI generates code fast, but research shows it also generates technical debt fast:: 4x increase in code duplication with AI adoption: +30% static analysis warnings, +41% code complexity after Cursor adoption: Negative relationship between AI adoption and software delivery stabilityThese skills encode battle-tested solutions to exactly these problems—directly into your AI workflow.—always leave code cleaner than you found it with all 66 rulesC1-C5, E1-E2, F1-F4, G1-G36, N1-N7, P1-P3, T1-T9Minimal, accurate commentingSmall, focused, obvious functions…: An orchestrator skill that embodies the Boy Scout Rule—"always leave code cleaner than you found it"—and coordinates the other skills: A master skill with all 66 rules, plus a quick reference table and anti-patterns cheatsheet for each category (, , , , )—drop in only what you needInstallation instructions for Antigravity, Claude Code, and other Agent Skills-compatible toolsSkills sit in a specific place in the agent ecosystem.  are passive guardrails that are always on.  are agent-triggered—the model decides when to equip them based on your intent. If you're using MCP servers (connections to external tools like GitHub or Postgres), think of MCP as the "hands" and skills as the "brains" that direct them.Create  in your project root (or ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/ for global access)Save the skill as a folder with a  file inside (e.g., .agent/skills/python-clean-code/SKILL.md)Ask the agent to review or write code—it'll automatically apply the rules when relevant: : ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/The agent only loads full skill content when needed, so comprehensive skills don't slow down simple requests.The skills in this article are instruction-only—they tell the agent what to do. For stricter enforcement, you could add a  folder with a linter that compatible agents runs them automatically, or an  folder with before/after code samples for few-shot learning. The format supports it; we're just keeping things simple here.Here's code that violates multiple Clean Code rules:: P1, C1, C3, C5, F1, F3, G6, G23, G25, N1With the Clean Code skill active, ask your AI agent to refactor this:✅ No wildcard imports (P1)✅ No metadata comments (C1)✅ No redundant comments (C3)✅ No commented-out code (C5)✅ Named constants instead of magic numbers (G25)✅ Functions do one thing (G30)✅ Polymorphism through data structure (G23)
  
  
  Anatomy of a Vibe-Coded Script
The first definition unpacks values, calculates width, then... returns . The second definition is the real implementation. Python silently overwrites the first with the second, so the code runs. But it's textbook dead code—Clean Code rule G9: Remove dead code.With the skill active, an agent refactors the entire 600-line script. The duplicate vanishes, magic numbers become constants, and nested functions get extracted into focused methods:✅ Type hints added (clarity)✅ Single, authoritative definition (G5)✅ Magic numbers extracted to constants (G25)✅ Large methods decomposed (G30)The full diff shows 600+ lines reduced to ~440—not by removing functionality, but by eliminating duplication and extracting reusable patterns.Vibe coding isn't going away. AI will get better at generating code, not worse. But "better at generating" doesn't mean "better at maintaining."The research is clear: AI produces code faster, but that code accumulates technical debt faster too. Without guard rails, we're building tomorrow's legacy systems today.Uncle Bob's Clean Code principles are almost 20 years old, but they're exactly what we need now. They're not arbitrary style preferences—they're battle-tested solutions to the problems AI recreates at scale.Skills give you the mechanism to encode these rules directly into your AI workflow. Whether you're using Antigravity, Claude Code, or another agent, the approach is the same: define what clean code means, then let the AI follow the rules.Your agent doesn't know what good code looks like unless you tell it. by Robert C.

2) avoiding the common failure modes, and
3) batching requests without turning your responses into soup.Different providers name things differently, but the mechanics are consistent:
  
  
  1.1 Context window (max tokens per request)
If your  exceeds the model context window, the request fails immediately.“Maximum context length exceeded”“Your messages resulted in X tokens…”shorten, summarise, or chunk data.
  
  
  1.2 RPM (Requests Per Minute)
You can be under token limits and still get throttled if you burst too many calls. Gemini explicitly documents RPM as a core dimension. “Rate limit reached for requests per minute”client-side pacing, queues, and backoff.
  
  
  1.3 TPM / Token throughput limits
Anthropic measures rate limits in RPM + input tokens/minute + output tokens/minute (ITPM/OTPM).
Gemini similarly describes token-per-minute as a key dimension. “Rate limit reached for token usage per minute”429 + Retry-After header (Anthropic calls this out) reduce tokens, batch efficiently, or request higher quota.
  
  
  2.1 The “one prompt to rule them all” anti-pattern
…in a single request, and then you wonder why token usage spikes.. If you need multi-step logic, use  (small prompts with structured intermediate outputs).
  
  
  2.2 Bursty traffic (the silent RPM killer)
Production traffic is spiky. Cron jobs, retries, user clicks, webhook bursts—everything aligns in the worst possible minute.If your client sends requests like a machine gun, your provider will respond like a bouncer.
  
  
  2.3 Unstructured output = expensive parsing
If your output is “kinda JSON-ish”, your parser becomes a full-time therapist.Make the model output  or a fixed table. Treat format as a contract.
  
  
  3.1 Prompt-side: shrink tokens without losing signal
 (models don’t need your company origin story).Convert repeated boilerplate into a short “policy block” and reuse it.Prefer  over prose (“material=316 stainless steel” beats a paragraph).
  
  
  A tiny prompt rewrite that usually saves 30–50%
“We’re a smart home brand founded in 2010… please write 3 marketing lines…”“Write 3 UK e-commerce lines. Product: smart bulb. Material=PC flame-retardant. Feature=3 colour temperatures. Audience=living room.”
  
  
  3.2 Request-side: backoff like an adult
If the provider returns , respect it. Anthropic explicitly returns Retry-After on 429s. Use exponential backoff + jitter:
  
  
  3.3 System-side: queue + concurrency caps
If your account supports 10 concurrent requests, do not run 200 coroutines and “hope”.a  for concurrencyand a  for RPM/TPMBatching means: one API request handles multiple independent tasks.It works best when tasks are:same type (e.g., 20 product blurbs)independent (no step depends on another)fewer network round-tripsfewer requests → lower RPM pressuremore predictable throughputAlso: OpenAI’s pricing pages explicitly include a “Batch API price” column for several models. 
(That doesn’t mean “batching is free”, but it’s a strong hint the ecosystem expects this pattern.)Here’s a format that stays parseable under pressure.
  
  
  5.1 Use task blocks + a strict JSON response schema
SYSTEM: You output valid JSON only. No Markdown. No commentary.

USER:
You will process multiple tasks. 
Return a JSON array. Each item must be:
{
  "task_id": <int>,
  "title": <string>,
  "bullets": [<string>, <string>, <string>]
}

Rules:
- UK English spelling
- Title ≤ 12 words
- 3 bullets, each ≤ 18 words
- If input is missing: set title="INSUFFICIENT_DATA" and bullets=[]

TASKS:
### TASK 1
product_name: Insulated smart mug
material: 316 stainless steel
features: temperature alert, 7-day battery
audience: commuters

### TASK 2
product_name: Wireless earbuds
material: ABS shock-resistant
features: ANC, 24-hour battery
audience: students
That “INSUFFICIENT_DATA” clause is your lifesaver. One broken task shouldn’t poison the whole batch.Below is a modern-ish pattern you can adapt (provider SDKs vary, so treat it as , not a copy‑paste guarantee).
  
  
  What changed vs “classic” snippets?
We treat JSON as a .We handle  explicitly (and keep it cheap).We centralise backoff logic so every call behaves the same way.Batch size is constrained by:context window (max tokens per request)response parsing stabilityyour business tolerance for “one batch failed”start with increase until you see:

timeouts / latency spikes, or
And always keep a .Pricing changes. Tiers change. Models change.So instead of hard-coding ancient per-1K token values, calculate cost using the provider’s current pricing page.OpenAI publishes per‑token pricing on its API pricing pages.
Anthropic also publishes pricing and documents rate limit tiers. cost ≈ (input_tokens * input_price + output_tokens * output_price) / 1,000,000
Then optimise the variables you control:reduce number of calls (batch)

  
  
  Risk 1: one bad item ruins the batch
 “INSUFFICIENT_DATA” fallback per task.
  
  
  Risk 2: output format drift breaks parsing
 strict JSON, repair step, and logging.
  
  
  Risk 3: batch too big → context overflow
 token budgeting + auto-splitting.
  
  
  Risk 4: “creative” attempts to bypass quotas
 don’t. If you need more capacity, request higher limits and follow provider terms.Rate limits aren’t the enemy. They’re your early warning system that:or your architecture assumes “infinite throughput”.If you treat prompts like payloads (not prose), add pacing, and batch like a grown-up, you’ll get:and a system that scales without drama]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 11 of 100</title><link>https://dev.to/palakhirave/day-11-of-100-oi9</link><author>Palak Hirave</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I worked on a Blackjack project.

What caught my attention was the fact that they come with no solutions, just you, the problem, and your Go skills.The repository quickly gained traction, and got more than 1k stars⭐ and was mentioned in several social networks, e.g. X.I decided to tackle these problems myself and share my solutions in my own fork, hoping to inspire people to try and to refine my approach through community feedback.
  
  
  01-context-cancellation-concurrency/01-concurrent-aggregator
The challenge is straightforward but captures a common real-world scenario:Call two services concurrently,  and , combine their outputs into a single string like "User: Alice | Orders: 5", and handle failures gracefully. 
If either service call fails, the entire operation must be interrupted immediately.A more detailed description of the requirements can be found in the README.md.
  
  
  Implementing The Services
Let's start implementing the services. The goal is they can be configurable in a way that they can either return the actual result, or an error, and also how long does it take to get that response.So we could have something like:✅ Both services succeed within timeout❌ One service fails while the other succeeds🔄 Context cancellation propagates correctlyFor that, and without entering in too much details, I created a mock service that I can configure the output and the time.Then I created the  and  using that mock.In that way, I can configure the two services to cover those scenarios we mentioned above, e.g:Profile and order services returns the successful response on time:
Profile and order services returns the successful response not on time:
Profile service returns a successful response on time, but order service returns an error.

  
  
  Implementing The Aggregator
The goal of the aggregator is to call those two services concurrently, and stop as soon as one of the queries fail.
You must use golang.org/x/sync/errgroup.First let's define the , we need the two services and a timeout:The go-kata also mentions that the  needs to be configurable using the Functional Options Pattern, so then we can define the  like this:And then, finally the actual  implementation. We need to declare a  using the timeout passed as a struct field, and then use:To concurrently query the two services.I'm working through more go-kata problems and publishing solutions in my fork. 
I'd love to hear your feedback:Would you solve this differently?Are there edge cases I'm missing?What Go patterns would you apply?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learn Shell scripting by building a project scaffolding CLI</title><link>https://dev.to/parthiv_saikia_/learn-shell-scripting-by-building-a-project-scaffolding-cli-275g</link><author>PARTHIV SAIKIA</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 09:06:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We all know setting up a programming project is very tedious. Many programming languages and tools require some files to be present at the root of the project directory to work (e.g.  in typescript projects,  in golang projects). As we go on increasing the number of dependencies the number of these configuration files also increases. Most of our projects follow the same folder structure so creating the same folders and files for each project is cumbersome. So to make our life easier we will build a CLI tool to scaffold golang projects using shell scripting. By the end of this tutorial you should be able to understand how to write shell scripts and automate repetitive tasks like scaffolding a project.Shell scripting is valuable for developers because it automates repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more strategic work, which enhances productivity. Additionally, it simplifies processes like software deployment and testing, making workflows more efficient and reducing the potential for human error.
  
  
  Problems in setting up a Golang project
Most golang projects follow a standard project structure which may look like this:project-name/
├── cmd/
│   └── project-name/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
├── .gitignore
├── go.mod
├── README.md
├── Makefile
└── LICENSE
Creating these folders and files with same name and same content for multiple projects is really boring. Every time you create a new project you need to run the same set of commands. e.g.go mod init project-name
git init
internal cmd cmd/project-name
 .gitignore
This is not only slow but also prone to human error. Sometimes we may forget to initialize the go module or sometimes to create the  file. To remove all of these mental overhead let's create  which will create the folder structure, initialize git and create a github repository with just one command.
  
  
  Scaffold CLI: An Introduction
Scaffold CLI will be used to setup a go project with the folder structure as shown above. It will prompt the user about what is the project name and whether they want to initialize git or not. If they want to initialize git Scaffold CLI will create a github repository with the same name and will make a commit to it.Let's start building the CLI. Before we start, make sure you have:Basic command line knowledge - You should be comfortable navigating directories and running commands.Bash/Zsh shell - Available by default on macOS and LinuxGitHub CLI (optional) - Only needed if you want automatic GitHub repo creation. Install guide.Quick check: Run these commands to verify your setup:go version    
gh GitHub CLI Authentication (one-time setup):
If you plan to use the git integration feature, authenticate the GitHub CLI:Follow the prompts to authenticate via your browser. You only need to do this once.Also change the default branch name globally as  as it is more common for new projects.git config  init.defaultBranch main

  
  
  Creating the file structure
Create the folder in your desired location using . Now   move to the scaffold directory using . We will split the script into different files based on the function. Our workflow consists of three steps:Build the folder structure.So we will have 3 files namely: This will create the project directory and create files such as , , . : This will create folders such as , .: This will initialize a git repository and will create and commit to a github repository.Along with these 3 helper scripts we will have a  which will  take user input, validate them and then call these helper scripts.
  
  
  Writing the helper scripts
Let's get started with the first helper script . The purpose of this script is to create the project folder and write some basic files. Create the file using .The first line of a shell script should always beThe character sequence  is called . It tells the operating system about which interpreter should it use to execute the script. In this case we are telling the OS to use the bash interpreter.Next we need to create the project folder. We cannot use a hard coded string with the command  because the project name will be given by the user as a prompt. So to get the name of the project from the user prompt we will use arguments.Here  represents the first argument to the script. So now we can call the script with an argument such as./init.sh cool-go-project
This will execute the commandThis will create a directory named . We can refer to more arguments like ,  and so on. If we need to refer to every argument we can use .// Change  to init.sh
./init.sh cool-go-project cooler-go-project not-so-cool-project
Running this script will result in the execution of the command cool-go-project cooler-go-project not-so-cool-project
Hence it will create three different folders namely , , .: Before executing the script you will need to give it executable permissions by running After the directory is created we would want to move into that directory and initialize go module and create files such as , , etc.The full  will look like this
go mod init github.com/parthivsaikia/ README.md

 LICENSE


 Makefile
We move into the project directory using  and then write into the files , ,  using the structureThe  operator redirects the standard output to a file. So in this case the output of  is redirected to the respective files.After initializing the folder we need to create folders such as ,  inside the project directory. So let's write the next helper script .structure_folders.sh
 internal cmd cmd/cmd//main.go
This script will result in the following structure which is very standard for a go project.project-name/
├── cmd/
│   └── project-name/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
├── .gitignore
├── go.mod
├── README.md
├── Makefile
└── LICENSE
The remaining step is to initialize git in our project directory so create a new file This script should do the following things in order:Initialize git repository.Create a github repository with the name same as that of the project.Stage the changes and commit to git.Push the changes to the remote origin.We will pass the name of the project as the argument again.

git init 
gh repo create origin

 .gitignore

git add  
git commit 
git push origin main
The command gh repo create ${1} --public --source=. --remote=origin creates a public github repository in the current directory and add it as origin.Note that to use the github-cli you need to authenticate with Github as discussed in the prerequisites section.We are done with the helper scripts. In the  script we will read user inputs and call the helper scripts. Create the file by runningThis script should do the following tasks in orderAsk the user the name of the project.Validate if the input is empty.If the input is empty warn the user and ask the name again.If name is non-empty run  and  with project name as argument.Ask user if they wants to initialize git.If no then end the process.If yes then run  with the project name as argument.
 projectName
To give a cool look I am adding an ascii art which will be shown when someones run Scaffold CLI. You can create your own ascii art here.To make the ASCII art red, we use backslash escapes. Here's how it works:ESC Character - This is the ESC character (escape) in octalSignals the start of an escape sequenceColor Code - The actual color code - Starts the CSI (Control Sequence Introducer) - Reset all attributes (bold, underline, etc.)Your Text
ASCII art (now in red)Reset Code - Reset to default colorThis prevents the red from bleeding into subsequent outputThe ascii art will look like this in the terminalWe prompt the user to input the project name and store it in the variable  using the command projectName
Now we need to validate this input by checking if it is empty. Bash provide a default conditional to check if the length of a string is empty. The syntax is string

    True the length of string is zero.
To check if the variable  is empty we can use it inside a while loop like this projectName
We refer the variable  by . Note that the spaces around the condition  are not just necessary and not just decorative. Until this condition is false the user will be prompted to enter a non-empty project name.Now we ask the user if they want to initialize git and store the result in the variable . initialiseGit

 initialiseGit
We perform the same validation steps here too. The helper scripts  and  needs to run always independent of the variable  so we execute them first.~/repos/scaffold/init.sh 
~/repos/scaffold/structure_folders.sh We execute the scripts  and  with the variable  as argument.Since Scaffold CLI can be called from anywhere so we are providing the absolute location of the scripts. Change the location accordingly in your code.We create the folder using  and then move into the newly created folder using . Then we execute  from inside of the project folder.: You might be confused that why are we using  again to move into the project folder when we have already move into it in the  file. This is because a script is executed in its own context, meaning that any directory changes (like cd) made within that script only apply while the script is running. Once init.sh finishes, control returns to the parent shell, reverting back to its original working directory. Therefore, if you want to ensure that your subsequent commands operate within the desired project folder, you need to issue the cd command again in your current shell. This guarantees that you are indeed in the right directory before running any further commands.Based on the variable  we need to execute the script .
    ~/repos/scaffold/git.sh This is the syntax of if statement in bash. The keyword  marks the end of the if block. In this block we are checking if the variable  is equal to "y" i.e. if the user prompted yes when it was asked whether they want to initialize git. If that condition is true we execute the script  with the argument .With this our CLI is complete. Make all scripts executable by running: +x ./init.sh
 +x ./structure_folders.sh
 +x ./git.sh
 +x ./main.sh
To execute this script with just one command we need to add it as an alias in our shell config. Add this line in your shell config. Since I use zsh I will add it to . If you use bash you need to add it to .Adjust the location of the script according to your setup.NOTE: You can find out your shell by running.Scaffold CLI is now ready to use. Let's create one project using it.Start Scaffold CLI by running . You will see the ascii art and you will be prompted to enter the project name.Once you give a project name you will be asked whether you want to initialize git or not. Once you enter "y" the project folder will be created and the changes will be pushed to github.Now move to the project folder by .~/repos/test-project main -> tree

You can see that the folder structure is same with the folder structure discussed above.You can also verify the creation of the  repository in Github. Shell scripting might seem intimidating at first, but as you've seen, it's incredibly powerful for automating everyday development tasks. What started as a simple idea—"I'm tired of manually setting up projects"—turned into a useful tool that saves time and reduces errors.
The beauty of shell scripting is that it's accessible. You don't need to learn a new programming language or install heavy frameworks. With just bash and some creativity, you can automate almost anything in your development workflow.
What repetitive tasks are you tired of doing manually? Challenge yourself to automate one this week. Start small, keep it simple, and iterate as you learn. Share your automation scripts in the comments—I'd love to see what you build! ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 in Production: Building High-Performance Async APIs</title><link>https://dev.to/ayush_kaushik_b450595c233/fastapi-sqlalchemy-20-in-production-building-high-performance-async-apis-11ni</link><author>Ayush Kaushik</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:40:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building async APIs with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy 2.0 looks straightforward in tutorials, until you deploy to production.Suddenly you start seeing issues like random MissingGreenlet errors, confusing async session behavior, blocked event loops, or database calls that are technically “async” but still slow under load. These problems usually appear when teams migrate from synchronous Flask or Django applications to FastAPI without fully understanding how async architecture actually works.This article is not a beginner’s FastAPI tutorial.It is a practical, production-focused guide to building high-performance async backend APIs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy 2.0, covering real-world concerns such as async engine configuration, session lifecycle management, lifespan events, connection pooling, and common failure modes.If you are already using FastAPI (or planning a migration from Flask) and want an async architecture that scales cleanly beyond toy examples, this guide is written for you.First, let's grab our dependencies. Notice we need an async driver (aiosqlite) because standard drivers like psycopg2 or sqlite3 are synchronous and will block your loop.pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy aiosqlite pydanticThe Database Engine (database.py)The most critical part of an async setup is the AsyncEngine. If you initialize this wrong, your whole app runs synchronously.from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, async_sessionmaker, AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase

# 1. Connection String (Note the +aiosqlite driver)
# For Postgres, use: postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/dbname
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///./test.db"

# 2. Create the Async Engine
engine = create_async_engine(
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL,
    echo=True, # Logs SQL queries to console (Great for debugging)
)

# 3. Create the Session Factory
# This is what generates new database sessions for each request
AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
    bind=engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False
)

# 4. Base Class for Models
class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

# 5. Dependency Injection
# We use this in our FastAPI routes to get a DB session
async def get_db():
    async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
        yield session
2. The Models (models.py)SQLAlchemy 2.0 introduced a beautiful new way to define models using Python type hints (Mapped). No more vague Column(Integer, ...) syntax.from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column
from sqlalchemy import String, Integer, Boolean
from database import Base

class Task(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tasks"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, index=True)
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(50), index=True)
    description: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=True)
    is_completed: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=False)
3. The Schemas (schemas.py)Pydantic handles our data validation. We keep our "Create" logic separate from our "Response" logic.from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None

class TaskResponse(TaskCreate):
    id: int
    is_completed: bool

    # Pydantic V2 Config to read from ORM models
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
4. The API Endpoints (main.py)Here is where the magic happens. Notice two key things: The endpoints are asynchronous.await session.execute(select(...)): We use the new SQLAlchemy 2.0 selection style, not the old session.query().from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy import select
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

import models, schemas
from database import engine, get_db

# Lifespan event to create tables on startup
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(models.Base.metadata.create_all)
    yield

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

# CREATE
@app.post("/tasks/", response_model=schemas.TaskResponse)
async def create_task(task: schemas.TaskCreate, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    new_task = models.Task(**task.model_dump())
    db.add(new_task)
    await db.commit()
    await db.refresh(new_task)
    return new_task

# READ (Async Select)
@app.get("/tasks/", response_model=list[schemas.TaskResponse])
async def read_tasks(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    # The Modern 2.0 Syntax
    query = select(models.Task).offset(skip).limit(limit)
    result = await db.execute(query)
    return result.scalars().all()

# UPDATE
@app.patch("/tasks/{task_id}", response_model=schemas.TaskResponse)
async def update_task(task_id: int, completed: bool, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    query = select(models.Task).where(models.Task.id == task_id)
    result = await db.execute(query)
    task = result.scalar_one_or_none()

    if task is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Task not found")

    task.is_completed = completed
    await db.commit()
    await db.refresh(task)
    return task
Async SQLAlchemy Engine and Session Lifecycle in FastAPIIn production FastAPI applications, the async SQLAlchemy engine should be created once at application startup and reused across requests. Creating engines or sessions per request is a common mistake that leads to connection exhaustion and unpredictable performance.FastAPI’s lifespan context is the recommended place to initialize the async engine and session factory, ensuring clean startup and shutdown behavior while avoiding hidden global state.Note- SQLAlchemy 2.0 removed legacy query patterns, which is why AsyncSession no longer exposes .query().”In the synchronous world, if the database takes 200ms to fetch those tasks, your entire server thread is blocked for 200ms. It can do nothing else.In this Async version, while the database is fetching data (await db.execute), Python releases the control loop. Your API can accept 50 other requests during that 200ms "wait" time.This is how you scale to thousands of users on a single server.Next Step: Deploying thisNow that you have a high-performance backend, how do you deploy it? You can't just use python main.py in production. In the next article, I will show you how to containerize this with Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Software Foundation: Your Python.

No screen. No keyboard. No buttons that make any sense.This is a familiar situation if you've ever worked with microcontrollers like the ESP32. The hardware is powerful, but the very first interaction is often awkward. At some point, the device needs to connect to your Wi-Fi network, and the classic question appears:"How does a tiny device ask for Wi-Fi credentials?"Hardcoding credentials works for quick experiments, but it breaks down in the real world, every deployment would require re-flashing the firmware. Serial consoles are fine for developers, not for users who don't have USB cables or the patience for terminal commands. Mobile apps add friction and maintenance overhead, requiring separate iOS and Android versions that need constant updates.What you want instead is simple: power on the device, connect to it once from any phone or laptop, configure it through a familiar web interface, and never think about it again. No apps to install, no cables to find, no special tools required.This is exactly where  shine, they turn Wi-Fi provisioning into a one-time, friction-free experience that works on every platform.
  
  
  What Is a Captive Portal?
If you've ever connected to Wi-Fi at a coffee shop, hotel, or airport, you've used a captive portal. You join the network, and a web page automatically pops up asking you to log in or accept terms. You didn't type a URL—the network guided you there by intercepting your browser traffic.A captive portal on an embedded device works the same way:The device creates its  (acting as an access point)The user connects from their phone or laptop (no password needed)The device intercepts all internet requests using a A web page  showing the configuration formAfter submission, the device saves credentials and switches to normal Wi-Fi client modeThe beauty of this approach is that the ESP32 can handle everything on-device. It acts as both an access point and a web server simultaneously, with no cloud services, external infrastructure, or internet connection required during setup. It's significantly simpler than building a companion mobile app (which requires maintaining iOS and Android versions) and far more user-friendly than hardcoded credentials or serial console configuration.For IoT products, this is often the difference between "technically works" and "actually ships to customers."The device goes through two distinct phases:  (captive portal) and  (Wi-Fi client). runs the first time you power on the device, or anytime no Wi-Fi configuration exists. Creates its own temporary Wi-Fi networkRuns a DNS server that redirects all domains to itselfRuns an HTTP server that serves the configuration pageSaves user-submitted credentials to flash storage begins after successful configuration. Disables the access pointConnects to the user's Wi-Fi network as a clientRuns your actual application (fetching data, controlling hardware, etc.)The key decision happens at boot: does  exist? If yes, connect to Wi-Fi. If no, start the captive portal.If you have already MicroPython installed on your ESP32, you are good to go and experiment with the following examples. If not, see this guide for more detail on how to setup an ESP32 with MicroPython.
  
  
  Step 1 - Create the Wi-Fi Access Point
The ESP32 creates its own Wi-Fi network using the built-in  module. This is the foundation of the entire captive portal, without the access point, users have no way to reach the configuration page.The ESP32 has two Wi-Fi interfaces: (Access Point Interface) - Makes the ESP32 act like a router (Station Interface) - Makes the ESP32 act like a Wi-Fi clientDuring setup mode, we use  to create a temporary network that users can join from their phones.In your local project, create a new file :Once this runs, the ESP32 broadcasts a Wi-Fi network named "MyDevice-Setup" and assigns itself IP address . Any device that connects to this network can communicate with the ESP32 using this IP.You'll notice we use  (no password). This might seem insecure, but it's actually the right choice for a temporary setup network:: Some devices have issues with WPA2 on captive portals: Users don't need to type a passwordAuto-detection works better: Operating systems are more likely to show the "Sign in to network" popup on open networks: The AP only exists during initial setup and disappears once configuredThe security risk is minimal because:The network only exists during the 1-2 minutes of setupThe user is typically standing right next to the deviceOnce configured, the AP shuts down completelyFor production devices, you can add strategies like auto-disabling the AP after 10 minutes, or requiring a physical button press to re-enter setup mode.
  
  
  Step 2 - Build the HTML Setup Page
Before we create the HTTP server, let's build the setup page that users will see. This is the critical user-facing component, it needs to work flawlessly on every mobile device.Design Principles for Captive Portal Pages:: Most users will access this from their phones: No external CSS/JS frameworks (we don't have internet!): Every byte travels over a slow access point connection: Users should immediately understand what to do: Don't assume users type perfectlyThe page needs only two inputs: SSID and password. Everything else can be configured later through a different interface (if needed at all).On your local project folder, create :Device SetupWi-Fi Setup
            Wi-Fi SSID
            
            Password
            Save  Connect meta tag ensures proper scaling on mobile devicesInline CSS keeps everything in one file (no extra HTTP requests) prevents input overflow issuesLarge touch targets (10px padding) work better on phonesSimple color scheme (#007bff) looks professional without complexity
  
  
  Step 3 - Create HTTP Server with Form Handling
Now create an HTTP server that serves the HTML file and handles form submissions. This is more complex than a typical web server because it needs to:Serve the same page for any URL - Operating systems make requests to various paths like , , etc. to detect captive portals - Parse POST data and save credentials - Show clear messages when things go wrong - The ESP32's networking stack is fragile, so we need careful error handlingThe server handles both GET requests (show the form) and POST requests (save configuration).On your local project folder, create :Key implementation details:: The  function handles URL-encoded data (the format HTML forms use). We manually decode common characters like  (space) and  (@) since MicroPython doesn't have a built-in URL decoder.: The server reads  from the filesystem. If the file is missing, it shows an error message instead of crashing, this helps with debugging during development.:  is critical. MicroPython's socket implementation can leak memory with persistent connections. We explicitly close every connection, even in error cases, to prevent the ESP32 from running out of sockets.: The triple-nested try/except blocks might look excessive, but they prevent the server from crashing when:A client disconnects mid-requestThe filesystem is corrupted: Notice we call  when sending responses. MicroPython's socket.send() expects bytes, not strings.
  
  
  Step 4 - Add DNS Redirection (The "Captive" Part)
To trigger the automatic "Sign in to network" popup on phones, we need a DNS server that redirects  to the ESP32's IP. This is the "captive" part of "captive portal", we're capturing all DNS requests.How DNS redirection works:When your phone connects to a new Wi-Fi network, it performs a "captive portal check" by trying to reach a known URL (like  on iOS or http://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com on Android). Phone asks DNS: "What's the IP address of captive.apple.com?"Our DNS server lies: "It's 192.168.4.1" (the ESP32's IP)Phone tries to load that pageOur HTTP server responds with the setup pagePhone realizes: "This isn't the real captive.apple.com, must be a captive portal!"Phone shows the "Sign in to network" popupThe key insight: we don't need to know which domain was requested. We just answer  with our own IP address.How the DNS packet parsing works:DNS packets have a specific structure. We extract: (): Unique identifier for each query, must be echoed back:  means "this is a response, no error": The domain name the client asked about: Our fabricated response pointing to 192.168.4.1We only respond to A-record queries (IPv4 address lookups). Other query types (AAAA for IPv6, MX for mail servers, etc.) are safely ignored.Platform compatibility notes:iOS is particularly strict about captive portal detection. The popup appears more reliably if:DNS replies are fast (our implementation is)HTTP responses are well-formed (we use proper HTML)The server is already running before the phone connectsIf the popup doesn't appear automatically, users can manually open any browser and type any URL (like ). The DNS redirection will still work, bringing them to your setup page.Important: Captive Portal Auto-Detection LimitationsThe automatic captive portal popup is  to appear. Whether it shows up depends on:: iOS is most reliable, Android varies by manufacturer (Samsung/Xiaomi less reliable), Windows 10/11 is hit-or-miss: The popup only appears if DNS/HTTP checks happen within a few seconds of connecting: If the phone previously connected to this SSID, it may skip checks: Some phones have "captive portal detection" disabled in developer options: Some mobile carriers modify captive portal behaviorIn real-world testing, automatic popups appear on approximately 70-80% of devices. The other 20-30% require users to manually open a browser.
  
  
  Step 5 - Connect to User's Wi-Fi
After saving configuration, the device needs to switch from AP mode to STA mode (Wi-Fi client). This is the transition from "setup" to "normal operation."The connection logic needs to be robust because Wi-Fi connections fail more often than you'd expect:Wrong password (most common)Router configured to block new devices5GHz vs 2.4GHz band issues (ESP32 only supports 2.4GHz)Our implementation tries for 20 seconds (20 attempts × 1 second), which is long enough for most networks but not so long that users think the device is frozen.Connection flow breakdown:: Try to load . If it doesn't exist, return  immediately: Turn off the access point interface (can't be AP and STA simultaneously effectively): Activate the station (client) interface: Attempt to connect using saved credentials: Check connection status every second for up to 20 seconds: Return  if connected,  if timeoutWhy the 20-second timeout?Most successful connections happen in 2-5 secondsSome networks with complex auth take 10-15 secondsAnything longer probably indicates a real problem (wrong password, etc.)20 seconds is long enough to succeed but short enough that users don't think the device is frozenNow let's create a complete  that integrates all the components. This is the entry point that decides: "Should I start the captive portal, or connect to Wi-Fi?"Try to connect to saved Wi-FiIf successful → run the main applicationIf failed → start captive portal for (re)configurationThis creates a self-healing system: if the user changes their Wi-Fi password or moves the device to a new network, it automatically falls back to setup mode.: This function orchestrates setup mode:Launches the DNS server in a background thread (using )Starts the HTTP server in the foreground (which blocks indefinitely)The threading is important: both servers need to run simultaneously. The DNS server runs in the background while the HTTP server handles the main event loop.: This is the decision point:Calls  to attempt connectionOn success: runs your application code (we show a simple internet connectivity test)On failure: starts the captive portal: The  blocks catch:: Allows clean shutdown during developmentGeneral exceptions: Reboots the device to recover from crashesYour ESP32 should have these files in its root directory:/
├── main.py           # Main entry point
├── wifi_ap.py        # Access point setup
├── http_server.py    # HTTP server with form handling
├── dns_server.py     # DNS server for captive portal
├── wifi_client.py    # Wi-Fi connection logic
└── portal.html       # Setup page HTML
Breaking the code into separate modules has several advantages:: Test each component independently: Each file has one clear purpose: Copy  to other projects: Easier to find and fix bugsAll Python files should be in the root directory. MicroPython doesn't handle complex directory structures well, so keep it simple.The easiest way to upload files to your ESP32 is using , which has built-in MicroPython support.: Plug in your ESP32 via USBGo to  →  → Select "MicroPython (ESP32)"Choose your COM port (e.g., COM3 on Windows, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux)In Thonny, go to  → Open your local project folder in the top sectionRight-click on each file and select 'Upload to /' (this will upload the file to the device)Press the  button (or Ctrl+D in the Shell)Click the green run buttonHere's what the complete flow looks like in practice:The ESP32 boots and starts the captive portal. In the serial monitor (Thonny's Shell), you'll see:========================================
ESP32 Captive Portal Starting...
========================================

  Step 2: Connect from Phone
On your phone's Wi-Fi settings, you'll see "MyDevice-Setup" appear as an open network. Tap to connect.: A popup appears within 3-5 seconds saying "Sign in to network": No popup appears - this is normal! Just open any browser and type any URL
  
  
  Step 3: Configuration Page
Whether you got the popup or opened a browser manually, you'll see the setup page with two fields:Wi-Fi SSID (your network name)Enter your actual Wi-Fi credentials and click "Save & Connect"
  
  
  Step 4: Success Confirmation
You'll see a page saying "Configuration saved" with instructions to reboot the device.In the Thonny shell, you can see the configuration save log:HTTP server listening on port 80
Configuration saved: {'ssid': 'SSID_EXAMPLE', 'password': 'password example'}
Reboot the ESP32 and after reboot, the serial monitor shows:========================================

Captive portals solve a fundamental problem: getting a headless device onto a user's network without hardcoded credentials or mobile apps. For ESP32 projects, it's the difference between a prototype and a product someone else can actually use.The ESP32 is powerful enough to run an access point, DNS server, and web server simultaneously, making Wi-Fi provisioning a simple, app-free experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Panel Meters: The Magical Windows to Your Circuit’s Soul 🔮</title><link>https://dev.to/ersajay/panel-meters-the-magical-windows-to-your-circuits-soul-4ghi</link><author>ersajay</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:30:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What Are Panel Meters, Really? (And Why Do We Still Need Them?)
Let’s start with a definition even a first-year Hogwarts student could grasp—no advanced runes required.1.1 A Wizarding Definition 📜
A panel meter is a magical window mounted on a circuit’s “tower” (panel or enclosure), letting you peer into its soul: voltage (magic energy levels ⚡️), current (flow of magic 🌊), power (how much magic you’re using 🔥), or temperature (heat from magical cores 🌡️).It’s the final spell in a long incantation chain:Sensing element: A magic detector (shunt resistor for current, RTD for temperature) that converts physical quantities into tiny magical signals 🔍.
Signal conditioning: A potion that amplifies, filters, or isolates the signal (op amps as magic amplifiers 🧪, filters as noise-canceling charms 🧹).
Conversion engine: A spell that turns the signal into something readable (analog movement as a pointer charm 🔄, ADC as a digital translation spell 📝).
Display: The magical window itself—needle, LED digits, or LCD—showing you the circuit’s true state 🖥️.
When you glance at a panel meter, you’re not just reading numbers; you’re seeing the result of a carefully tuned magical ritual ✨.1.2 Panel Meters vs. Handheld Meters 🔍
Why not just wave a handheld multimeter (a portable magic wand 🪄) and read values? Because panel meters are the castle’s permanent sentries 🛡️:24/7 monitoring: They stand guard even when you’re not there, like the portraits in Hogwarts hallways 🖼️.
Integrated magic: No extra leads, no “oops I used the wrong spell range”—they’re woven into the circuit’s fabric 🧵.
Distant visibility: Big LED digits or large analog scales can be seen from across the dungeon (control room), like the glowing runes on Dumbledore’s office door 🚪.
Alarms and communication: They can trigger warning bells (relays 🔔) or send owl post (Modbus, CAN 🦉) when magic levels go awry.
Panel meters are the control room screens of the wizarding world—quietly watching, ensuring nothing silently drifts into disaster 🚨.1.3 Panel Meters vs. Analog vs. Digital ⚖️
Panel meters come in two big houses, like Gryffindor and Slytherin, each with its own strengths:Analog panel meters ⏳: Pure, old-school magic. A moving-coil mechanism (pointer charm) turns current into torque, with a printed scale as the spellbook 📖. No firmware, just physics—easy to spot trends (like a wand’s power fluctuating) at a glance.
Digital panel meters 💻: Modern, tech-savvy magic. They use ADCs (digital translation spells) and microcontrollers (house-elves running the show 🧝♂️) to display numeric values. They can switch ranges, speak multiple magical languages (Modbus, CAN), and even show bargraphs like a magical progress bar 📊.
Both houses still thrive, and both rely on carefully chosen electronic components (the wand cores of the meter world 🪄).How Panel Meters Fit into Real Systems
If a machine is a wizard’s castle 🏰, the panel meter is its tower window—letting you check on everything from magic energy levels to core temperature.2.1 The Control Panel as a Wizard’s Dashboard 🛠️
Think of a control panel as Dumbledore’s office:Voltage panel meters ⚡️: Watch the castle’s main magic supply (DC bus or AC phases) to ensure it doesn’t drop like a broken wand 🪄.Current panel meters 🌊: Monitor the flow of magic to motors (like house-elves moving furniture 🧝♂️) or loads, making sure no one’s stealing magic.
Power/energy meters 💰: Track how much magic you’re using—because even wizards have to pay for spell ingredients (electricity bills 💸).
Temperature panel meters 🌡️: Keep an eye on the castle’s core (transformers, heatsinks) to prevent it from overheating like a cauldron left on too long 🍲.
These meters give you a quick check: “Are we roughly where we expect to be?” before you fire up your laptop (crystal ball 🔮) for deep dives.2.2 Where Panel Meters Live 🌍
You’ll find panel meters in every corner of the wizarding tech world:Industrial control panels 🏰: Hogwarts’ main control tower, managing all castle systems.
Motor control centers (MCCs) 🧝♂️: The house-elf quarters, where each meter watches a different elf’s magic output.
Power distribution boards ⚡️: The magic energy bank, splitting power between towers.
Solar combiner boxes ☀️: Magic sunlight collectors, turning sunlight into usable energy.
Audio amplifiers 🎶: The music room, where VU meters act as rhythm charms, showing sound magic levels 🎵.
In many cases, the panel meter is the only window the operator looks through every day 👀.2.3 Panel Meters and Wizarding Standards 📜
Since panel meters touch dangerous magic (mains voltages), they follow strict rules from the Ministry of Magic (safety standards):Isolation and creepage 🛡️: Like a magic shield, preventing dangerous magic from leaking out.
Measurement categories (CAT II, CAT III) 🎯: Spell levels that determine how much magic the meter can handle safely.
Accuracy classes 🎯: How precise the meter’s magic is—±1% is like a well-practiced spell, ±0.5% is a master-level incantation ✨.
EMC immunity 🧹: Resistance to dark magic (electromagnetic interference) that could warp readings.
These rules directly affect which components are used: high-voltage resistors as magic insulators 🧱, isolation amplifiers as shield charms 🛡️, and TVS diodes as lightning protection ⚡️.Inside Panel Meters: Electronic Components Doing the Real Magic
Pull off the bezel (window frame) and you’ll find a cast of magical characters working together 🧙♂️:3.1 Sensing and Scaling: Magic Detectors and Spell Scalers 🔍
Before anything can be displayed, the circuit’s magic must be tamed:Voltage meters ⚡️: Use resistor dividers (magic scaling spells) to turn high-voltage magic (300V) into a safe, readable signal (0–1V). High-value resistors act as magic insulators, limiting current flow 🧱.
Current meters 🌊: Shunt resistors (magic current mirrors) turn DC current into millivolts, while current transformers (CTs) are AC-only magic lenses that focus current into a manageable signal 🔍.
Process signals (4–20 mA) 📡: Burden resistors convert current signals into voltage, like turning a snake’s hiss into a readable message 🐍.
A cheap shunt or noisy divider is like a faulty magic detector—it’ll give you false readings before the ADC even wakes up 😴.3.2 Signal Conditioning: Potions and Charms 🧪
Once the signal is captured, it needs to be refined:Op amps 🧪: Magic amplifiers that boost tiny signals (like a whisper to a shout) or buffer them to prevent loss. Precision op amps are like master potions, delivering consistent results.
Filters 🧹: Noise-canceling charms (RC low-pass filters) that smooth out fluctuations, like calming a restless boggart 🐺.
Isolation components 🛡️: Shield charms (isolation amplifiers, optocouplers) that separate high-voltage magic from low-voltage circuits, preventing dark magic from spreading 👻.
If a meter claims high accuracy, you can bet the designer spent hours picking the right op amps and resistors—like Snape perfecting a potion 🧪.3.3 Conversion: Pointer Charms vs. Digital Translation 🔄
Analog and digital meters diverge here, like wizards choosing between wands and crystal balls 🔮:Analog meters ⏳: Pure physical magic. A moving-coil mechanism turns current into torque, with a spring as a reset charm 🔄. The scale printing is the spellbook—no firmware needed 📖.
Digital meters 💻: Use ADCs (digital translation spells) to turn analog signals into numbers. Sigma-delta ADCs are like advanced translation spells, delivering high precision, while reference ICs act as magic benchmarks to ensure accuracy 🎯.
A bad ADC is like a house-elf mixing up spell ingredients—it’ll give you readings that wander like a confused time traveler ⏳.3.4 Processing and Logic: House-Elves and Spell Drivers 🧝♂️
Modern digital meters have tiny house-elves (microcontrollers) running the show:MCU responsibilities 🧠: Reading ADC values, casting calibration spells, driving displays, and sending owl post (Modbus, CAN 🦉).
Display drivers 🖥️: Magic spellbooks that control LED/LCD segments, using I²C/SPI to simplify wiring—like a house-elf organizing your wand collection 🪄.
Even basic LED meters get their smarts from this tiny team 🧑🤝🧑.3.5 Power and Protection: Magic Shields and Energy Sources ⚡️
Panel meters live in the real world, where surges and miswiring are common:Power supplies 🔋: AC-DC modules or flyback converters turn mains magic into usable energy for the meter, like a magic stone that powers your wand 🪄.
Protection components 🛡️: TVS diodes (lightning charms) zap surges, fuses (overload charms) break the circuit if magic levels get too high, and NTCs (cooling charms) soften inrush currents ❄️.
A meter without protection is like a wizard without a wand—defenseless against dark magic 👻.Analog Panel Meters: Retro Needles, Real Insight ⏳
It’s 2025, and analog panel meters are still around—like old wands that never lose their charm 🪄.4.1 Why Analog Meters Refuse to Die 🧙♂️
They’re the reliable house-elves of the meter world:Instant trend reading 📈: You can tell at a glance if magic levels are rising or falling, like watching a wand’s glow brighten or dim ✨.
No firmware, no crashes 🚫: Just pure physics—no need to worry about spell errors or OS updates 🖥️.
Robust to EMI 🧹: Dark magic (electromagnetic interference) can’t easily warp their readings, like a shield charm against boggarts 🐺.
In a world of digital screens, analog meters bring a vintage lab aesthetic—like the old potion bottles in Snape’s dungeon 🧪.4.2 The Moving-Coil Mechanism: Pure Magic 🛠️
Inside an analog DC meter:A small coil sits in a magnetic field (like a wand in a magic circle 🔄).
Current through the coil generates torque, turning the pointer (like a wand moving on its own 🪄).
A spring provides restoring force, pulling the pointer back to zero (like a wand returning to its owner 🧙♂️).
Key components: Fine copper coil wire (wand core 🪄), stable magnet (magic stone 💎), and jewel bearings (smooth movement charm ✨).4.3 Advantages and Trade-Offs ⚖️
Pros:Instant visual feedback, like a wand’s glow changing with power ✨.
Simple, no software to debug 🚫.
Inexpensive, like a basic wand from Ollivanders 🛒.
Cons:Limited precision—you can’t read exact magic levels like you can with a digital spell 🎯.
Fixed scale: One function, one range (usually), like a wand that only casts one spell 🪄.
Still, for many panels and audio gear, analog meters are the perfect blend of style and substance 🎨.Digital Panel Meters: From Basic 7-Segment to Smart Mini-HMIs 💻
Digital panel meters are the tech-savvy wizards of the meter world—using firmware and microcontrollers to do more than just display numbers.5.1 What Makes a Panel Meter “Digital”? 🎯
A digital meter uses an ADC and a house-elf (MCU) to display numeric values. You’ll see:3½-digit, 4½-digit, or higher resolution (like advanced spell levels 🧙♂️).
LED digits (glowing magic numbers ✨) or LCDs (crystal clear displays 🔮).
Buttons or menus to switch ranges, set alarms, or cast calibration spells 🧪.
Under the hood, they’re tiny embedded systems—like mini versions of the computers that run whole castles 🏰.5.2 Types of Digital Panel Meters 📊
Common categories include:Digital voltmeters (DVMs) ⚡️: Magic windows for voltage levels, like checking your wand’s energy 🔋.
Multifunction power meters 💰: All-in-one magic tools that show voltage, current, power, and energy—like a wand that casts multiple spells 🪄.
Temperature meters 🌡️: For thermocouples or RTDs, like a magic thermometer for potion cauldrons 🧪.
Process meters 📡: For 4–20 mA signals, like reading a house-elf’s work progress 🧝♂️.
Each type has its own front-end magic (sensors, signal conditioning) and calibration spells 🧪.5.3 Firmware Features: Smart Magic Tricks ✨
Modern digital meters aren’t just displays—they’re mini control centers 🛠️:Peak/hold 📈: Stores the highest magic level, like a memory charm for your wand’s maximum power 🧠.
Alarm setpoints 🚨: Triggers a warning bell (relay) when magic levels go too high or low, like a security charm for your castle 🏰.
Communication 🦉: Sends owl post via Modbus, CAN, or Ethernet, letting you monitor magic levels from across the castle 🌍.
This is all orchestrated by the MCU—like a house-elf running multiple tasks at once 🧝♂️.5.4 Accuracy and Resolution 🎯
Numbers matter in the wizarding world:Resolution 📊: How many digits the meter can display (4½-digit = 19999 counts, like a spell with 19999 variations ✨).
Accuracy 🎯: How close the reading is to the true value—±0.1% is like a master wizard’s spell, ±1% is a well-practiced incantation 🧙♂️.
Temperature drift 🌡️: How readings change with heat, like a wand’s power fluctuating in the sun ☀️.
High-accuracy meters use precision resistors, low-drift op amps, and tight calibration—like a wizard spending years perfecting a spell 🧙♂️.Choosing Panel Meters: Specs That Actually Matter 🛒
Picking a panel meter is like choosing a wand at Ollivanders—you need the right fit for your mission 🎯.6.1 Measurement Type and Range 🎯
First question: What magic do you need to monitor?Voltage (AC/DC), current (AC/DC), power, temperature, or process signals?
What’s the maximum magic level? A 0–10V meter won’t work for a 300V castle supply, like a basic wand can’t cast Avada Kedavra 🪄.
Check if the meter can scale (adjust spell ranges) for CT/VT ratios or custom sensors—like a wand that adapts to your magic style 🧙♂️.6.2 Input Impedance and Burden 🔌
Voltage meters ⚡️: Higher input impedance (≥1 MΩ) means less magic is drained from the circuit, like a wand that doesn’t steal your energy 🧠.
Current meters 🌊: The burden (resistance) affects CT accuracy—too high, and the CT’s magic will warp, like a spell cast with a broken wand 🪄.
Good meters use precision resistor networks and input buffers to control these parameters 🛠️.6.3 Accuracy and Class 🎯
Analog meters ⏳: Class 1.0 means ±1% accuracy, like a spell that hits its target 99% of the time 🎯.
Digital meters 💻: Accuracy listed as ±(X% of reading + Y counts) accounts for both percentage error and fixed digit error.
For billing or lab work, go for ±0.5% or better—like a master wizard’s spell that never misses 🧙♂️.6.4 Display and Readability 👀
Beyond numbers, ask:How big are the digits? 20mm digits can be seen from across the dungeon, like glowing runes on a castle wall ✨.
What’s the viewing angle? Can you read it from the side, like a spellbook open on a table 📖?
Can colors change? Red for alarms, green for normal—like a wand’s glow changing with danger 🚨.
Good meters are like well-designed castle windows—visible, intuitive, and non-annoying 🏰.6.5 Power Supply and Isolation 🔋
Power type: Mains-powered (castle magic 🏰) or loop-powered (uses the signal’s magic, like a wand that feeds on its own spell 🪄).
Isolation 🛡️: Is the measurement input isolated from power and outputs? Like a shield charm that prevents dark magic from spreading 👻.
Internally, this uses isolated DC/DC converters and isolation amplifiers—like magic barriers between different parts of the castle 🏰.6.6 Outputs and Communication 🦉
Many digital meters act as magic messengers 📡:Alarm relays 🔔: Trigger a bell or shut off magic when levels go awry, like a security charm for your castle 🏰.
Analog outputs 📡: Re-transmit signals as 4–20 mA, like sending a copy of your spell to another wizard 🧙♂️.
Digital communication 🦉: Modbus, CAN, or Ethernet let you read data remotely, like owl post from your castle to the Ministry of Magic 📜.
Think of them as data sources, not just displays—like a wand that sends messages and casts spells 🪄.Wiring and Installing Panel Meters Without Summoning Smoke 🚫💨
Installing a panel meter is like hanging a magic window—do it right, and it’ll work for years; do it wrong, and you’ll summon smoke (magic explosion 💥).7.1 Mechanical Mounting 🛠️
Check the cutout size (window frame dimensions) and panel thickness—like making sure your window fits the castle wall 🏰.
Use included brackets or clips—don’t improvise with duct tape like a confused house-elf 🧝♂️.
For vibration-prone areas (like a dragon’s lair 🐉), add extra support—like a magic stable charm ✨.
7.2 Electrical Wiring Basics 🔌
Voltage inputs ⚡️: Respect maximum ratings, observe polarity (like wand direction 🪄), and keep neutral/ground connections consistent (like magic ground脉 🌍).
Current inputs 🌊: For CTs, never open-circuit the secondary—this creates dangerous magic (high voltage), like breaking a spell mid-cast 🧪.
Process signals 📡: Use shielded cables for low-level signals, like a noise-canceling charm for your spell 🧹.
7.3 Grounding and Isolation 🛡️
Bad grounding is like a broken magic barrier—it lets dark magic (EMI) warp readings 👻:Respect isolation barriers inside the meter—don’t connect isolated inputs to grounded ones unless the manual says so 📜.
Use shielded cables for low-level signals, like a cloak of invisibility against EMI 🧥.
Use correct fuses or breakers upstream—like a magic overload charm 🛡️.
Observe measurement category (CAT rating) for mains-powered meters—like wearing a magic shield against high voltage ⚡️.
Always wire with power off, then verify with a tester—like checking if a spell is safe before casting it 🧪.
All the internal components are designed with certain assumptions—break them, and even the best meter can’t save you from smoke 💨.Smart and Networked Panel Meters: The IIoT Era 🌐
Panel meters have evolved from simple windows to edge devices in the Industrial IoT (wizarding internet) world 🌐.8.1 Modbus, CAN, and Friends: Owl Post for Meters 🦉
Smart meters speak magical languages like Modbus (RS-485) and CAN:Modbus RTU 🦉: Owl post for short-range communication, letting you read data from multiple meters at once 🧑🤝🧑.
CANopen 🚀: Fast owl post for industrial systems, like sending messages between castle towers 🏰.
Ethernet 🌐: Floo powder for long-range communication, letting you monitor meters from across the country 🗺️.
Internally, this uses transceivers and MCUs with communication controllers—like house-elves trained to send owl post 🧝♂️.8.2 Data Logging and Event Recording 📝
Advanced meters act like Dumbledore’s Pensieve, storing data 🧠:Min/max values 📈: The highest and lowest magic levels, like memories of powerful spells ✨.
Energy logs 💰: Track magic usage over time, like a spellbook that records every incantation 📖.
Event logs 🚨: Record alarms or phase loss, like a diary that notes dark magic attacks 👻.
This requires onboard memory (EEPROM, FRAM) and real-time clocks (magic clocks ⏰) to timestamp data.8.3 Integrating into Dashboards and HMIs 📊
Once meters talk digital, they can:Feed data to PLCs or industrial PCs, like sending spell results to the Ministry of Magic 📜.
Populate plant-wide dashboards, like a magic map showing all castle systems 🗺️.
Trigger alerts or emails via gateways, like an owl that sends urgent messages 🦉.
You get the best of both worlds: classic front-panel visibility plus modern cloud monitoring—like having a magic window and a crystal ball 🔮.Panel meters may seem like simple devices, but they’re the unsung heroes of the circuit world—like house-elves keeping the castle running smoothly 🧝♂️. Whether you prefer analog’s retro charm or digital’s smart features, these magical windows let you peer into your circuit’s soul and keep your magic flowing safely ✨.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Bytes: #467 Toads in my AI</title><link>https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/467/toads-in-my-ai</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Topics covered in this episode:</strong><br>

  The Incident That Should Terrify Every Hiring Manager
KnowBe4—a company that literally trains people to spot scams—hired a North Korean intelligence operative. Four video interviews. Background check cleared. References verified.Twenty-five minutes after receiving his work laptop, their endpoint detection software caught him loading malware.The CEO's assessment: "If it can happen to us, it can happen to almost anyone."He's right. And the numbers are terrifying:
  
  
  Understanding the Attack Vector
Before we build defenses, let's understand the attack. This isn't script kiddie stuff—it's nation-state tradecraft industrialized for scale.
  
  
  The Tech Stack of a Nation-State Hiring Fraud

  
  
  The 70-Minute Deepfake Experiment
Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 ran an experiment that should keep you up at night:
  
  
  Why Your Current Defenses Are Structurally Broken
This isn't about doing security better. The  is wrong.
  
  
  Problem 1: Background Checks Verify the Wrong Identity
DPRK schemes use stolen legitimate identities. The background check works perfectly—it's just answering the wrong question.
  
  
  Problem 2: Liveness Detection Is Bypassed at the Hardware Level
Video injection attacks increased  in 2024. The defense assumes honest hardware; the attack subverts the hardware.
  
  
  Problem 3: "Verify Once, Trust Forever"
For DPRK schemes—where a "single employee" is actually a rotating team—this model is catastrophically naive.
  
  
  The Solution: Cryptographic Verification with Completeness Guarantees
Here's where we rebuild from first principles.The Verifiable AI Provenance Framework (VAP) provides a different model:
  
  
  Implementation: Building a VAP-Style Hiring System
Let's build this. I'll walk through the key components with working code.
  
  
  Step 1: Define the Event Schema

  
  
  Step 2: Implement the Hash Chain

  
  
  Step 3: The Completeness Invariant (The Secret Sauce)
This is where VAP gets powerful. We define rules that must be satisfied for a hiring process to be valid:
  
  
  Step 4: External Anchoring
The hash chain proves internal consistency. External anchoring proves  the data existed:
  
  
  Step 5: Cross-Reference with Third Parties (VCP-XREF)

  
  
  Step 6: Evidence Pack Generation

  
  
  Putting It All Together: A Complete Example

  
  
  What This Achieves Against DPRK Attacks
Let's map this back to the attack vectors:Cross-reference with IDV provider + liveness creates multi-point verificationLiveness detection bypassedLiveness event must exist + deepfake score recorded + externally anchoredPolicy compliance is trust-basedCompleteness Invariant mathematically enforces required stepsExternal anchoring makes post-hoc changes detectableCompromise HR system = full accessCross-references require compromising multiple independent parties
  
  
  Production Considerations

  
  
  Option 1: Use the Reference Implementation

pip vap-hiring


vap-hiring init  hiring_config.yaml


vap-hiring verify  ./evidence_pack.zip
The code in this article is a starting point. For production:Add proper key management (HSM for signing keys)Implement RFC 3161 TSA integrationBuild API endpoints for cross-reference exchangeIntegrate with your ATS/HRIS
  
  
  Option 3: Explore the Specification

  
  
  Conclusion: The Trust Model Is Broken
North Korean IT worker infiltration isn't a security incident. It's a  that trust-based hiring verification is fundamentally broken.When a security awareness company can hire a spy, when a convincing fake identity takes 70 minutes to create, when nation-states operate industrial-scale hiring fraud—we need to stop patching and start rebuilding.Cryptographic audit trails with completeness invariants offer a path forward: make tampering detectable make skipped steps impossible makes fabrication provable make single-point compromise insufficientThe technology exists. The threat is proven. The regulatory pressure is mounting.The question is whether you'll implement verification-based hiring proactively—or after a DPRK operative has been on your payroll for six months.VeritasChain Standards Organization (VSO) is a non-profit, vendor-neutral standards body developing open specifications for cryptographic audit trails in AI and algorithmic systems.Found this useful?

Should it go to L1 or L2 support?I built a classifier that outputs structured JSON with intent, category, urgency, sentiment, routing target, and extracted entities.
  
  
  Why Not Just Use a Cloud API?

You hit rate limits, you stare at loading bars, and -- probably worst of all -- you burn through your API budget faster than a GPU on a training run. But what if I told you there’s a way to run thousands of prompts asynchronously, at , without blocking your main thread?Enter the .Grab your coffee (or tea 🍵), and let’s dive in!Here's what we'll be building with today: To get our evals. To make the data look pretty. To (carefully!) run the generated code.
  
  
  Step 1: Preparing the Data
First things first, we need our prompts. We are using the  dataset, which contains 164 coding problems.The Batch API loves  (JSON Lines) files. Each line is a separate request. We need to iterate through the dataset and format it so Gemini understands that we want it to write Python code. Notice ? That’s your best friend. Since batch jobs are asynchronous, results might not come back in the same order you sent them. The ID helps you map the answer back to the question.
  
  
  Step 2: Upload the data to Google Cloud
Now that we have our , we need to upload it to Google's Cloud Platform and tell Gemini to get to work. We are using  here because it is fast, efficient, and perfect for high-volume tasks like this - but you could use any supported Gemini model docstring instead.Batch jobs aren't instant (that's the trade-off for the discount), but for an evaluation pipeline, it's perfect. Go stretch, grab a snack, or check Twitter. On average, my jobs for the HumanEval dataset have been taking ~10 minutes, and the majority complete in less than a few hours.
  
  
  Step 3: Downloading the results
Once the job hits , the results are ready to come home.This is where the magic happens. We have the code Gemini wrote; now we need to see if it actually . We’re going to loop through our results, extract the Python code (removing those pesky markdown backticks), and run it against the unit tests provided in the HumanEval dataset. We are using  here. In a production app, running untrusted code is a huge security no-no. But for a local sandbox evaluation, we live on the edge! We’ll wrap it in a  timeout so infinite loops don’t freeze our machine.So, how did  do? Let's visualize it using Seaborn. 142 tasks (86.59%)That is incredibly impressive for a "Flash-Lite" model. It handled complex algorithmic logic, string manipulation, and math problems, passing the vast majority of them.The Gemini Batch API is a game-changer for workflows like this. We saved 50% on tokens. We didn't have to manage async loops or retry logic. The Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite model punched way above its weight class.If you have large datasets, extensive prompting jobs, or nightly evaluations, definitely give the Batch API a spin.

  What I learned building this
PyO3 + maturin is mature. Publishing wheels for Python 3.8-3.13 across Linux/macOS/Windows was straightforward. GitHub Actions + maturin handled cross-compilation without drama.Hand-rolled parsing beats regex for simple patterns. For IPv4 validation, a simple split-and-parse approach was significantly faster than regex. Rust's regex crate is fast, but nothing beats avoiding it entirely. URL validation alone has dozens of edge cases — international domain names, punycode, IPv6 hosts, weird port numbers. I wrote 370 tests to ensure parity with the original library.The hardest validators were international ones. Spanish NIE, Indian Aadhaar, Finnish SSN — each has its own checksum algorithm.
