During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.
  
  
  Understanding API Gateway Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.
  
  
  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns
Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.
  
  
  Dynamic Configuration Management
The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.
  
  
  Performance Optimization Strategies
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive
Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.
  
  
  Request/Response Compression
Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:
  
  
  Authentication and Authorization
Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.
  
  
  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting
Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.
  
  
  Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.
  
  
  Deployment and Scaling Strategies
Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems. I hope my experience can help other students understand this critical architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Modern Web Architecture Type Safety Error Best（1751450160265200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/modern-web-architecture-type-safety-error-best1751450160265200-53mg</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 09:56:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student, I have repeatedly experienced how architecture design determines code maintainability and development efficiency. Every time a project grows or requirements change, poor architecture becomes a nightmare. Only after using this Rust web framework did I truly understand that "architecture is productivity." Today, from the perspective of a ten-year editor and developer, I want to share my thoughts on modern web architecture, modularity, type safety, and error handling, based on real project experience.
  
  
  The Power of Layered Architecture
In traditional Node.js or Python web frameworks, project structure often becomes chaotic as business grows. In contrast, this framework naturally supports layered architecture, making code organization clear and maintenance easy.
  
  
  Type Safety and Modularity
In this framework, type safety is not just a slogan but a guarantee for every line of code. Whether it's request parameters, database models, or middleware, the type system catches potential errors at compile time.In dynamic language frameworks like Express.js, errors often surface at runtime, making debugging painful. This framework leverages the Result type and custom error systems to elevate error handling to the architectural level.
  
  
  Middleware and Extensibility
The middleware mechanism in this framework is extremely flexible, supporting chain calls and custom extensions. Compared to Spring Boot's interceptors or Express's middleware chain, here you get both type safety and high expressiveness.
  
  
  Comparative Analysis: Express.js, Spring Boot, Actix-web
: Flexible but not type-safe, easily out of control in large projects.: Powerful ecosystem but verbose configuration, type-safe but Java syntax is heavy.: Extremely high performance but steep learning curve due to Actor model.: Type-safe, modular, elegant error handling, clear architecture, easy to maintain.Architecture is not mysticism, but the engineering philosophy behind every line of code. Only frameworks with a strong type system, modular design, and elegant error handling allow developers to focus on business innovation. As a third-year student and tech enthusiast, I recommend this framework to anyone who pursues high-quality code and ultimate maintainability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Developer Experience Revolution APIs Rapid Web Design（1751450043412800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/developer-experience-revolution-apis-rapid-web-design1751450043412800-nl8</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 09:54:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Liquid syntax error: 'raw' tag was never closed]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Architectural Decision Making Real World Web Modern（1751450021531100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/architectural-decision-making-real-world-web-modern1751450021531100-2h1k</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 09:53:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a computer science student nearing my senior year, I've been fascinated by the progression of software architecture.

Traditional threading models are completely inadequate for such scenarios. It wasn't until I deeply studied event-driven and asynchronous I/O technologies that I truly understood the core principles of modern high-performance servers.
  
  
  Evolution of Concurrency Models
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have witnessed the continuous evolution of concurrent programming models. From the initial multi-process model to the multi-threading model, and now to the asynchronous event-driven model, each evolution aims to solve the performance bottlenecks of the previous generation model.Although traditional threading models are conceptually simple, they have fatal problems in high-concurrency scenarios: high thread creation overhead, frequent context switching, and huge memory consumption. When the number of concurrent connections reaches tens of thousands, the system will crash due to resource exhaustion.
  
  
  Core Principles of Event-Driven Architecture
In my in-depth research, I found that event-driven architecture is the key to achieving high concurrency. Unlike traditional threading models, event-driven models use single or few threads to handle all I/O events, achieving efficient resource utilization through event loop mechanisms.
  
  
  Performance Testing and Verification
Through my actual testing, this high-concurrency architecture can stably handle over one hundred thousand concurrent connections on a single-core processor. Key performance metrics include:: 100,000+: < 1msThese numbers prove the huge advantages of event-driven architecture in high-concurrency scenarios. Through reasonable resource management and optimization strategies, we can achieve amazing performance on limited hardware resources.This article records my deep exploration of high-concurrency programming as a junior student.

It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support.Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results test (single-core):

Peak Performance: Understated PowerPerformance is a cornerstone for any web framework. In my prior experiences, achieving high performance often came at the cost of development efficiency and code readability, involving convoluted asynchronous logic and manual memory management. This framework, however, managed to strike an artful balance between these aspects.Its core philosophy seems to be "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." Constructed upon an advanced asynchronous non-blocking I/O model and an optimized event loop, it lays a robust foundation for high-performance operations. When I developed a campus forum API to simulate high-concurrency scenarios, it demonstrated a nearly 70% improvement in QPS (Queries Per Second) and reduced the average response time by half compared to a framework I had used previously. For someone keenly focused on user experience, this was a thrilling outcome.Its resource management was equally impressive. Throughout stress tests, memory usage remained consistently low, and CPU utilization was stable. This efficiency stems from its intelligent coroutine scheduling and effective memory management strategies. It doesn't chase speed at the expense of stability but rather aims for sustainable high performance. As an architect once wisely noted, "True performance is sustained composure, not just a momentary burst."Smooth Experience: Unadulterated CreationIf performance represents the hard power of a framework, then the development experience is its soft power, directly impacting developer satisfaction and project timelines. This framework excelled in this domain as well.Its API design is remarkably concise, intuitive, and expressive, offering a gentle learning curve. As a student, I was able to begin writing functional modules within a matter of hours, relying solely on the official documentation, which was clear, comprehensive, and of high quality. This ease of adoption is a testament to its well-abstracted yet flexible interfaces and a deep understanding of the developer's mindset.Modularity and extensibility are thoughtfully designed. It provides elegant, out-of-the-box solutions for common needs such as logging, parameter validation, and authentication. It leverages a powerful macro system, a feature popular in languages that prioritize efficiency, to generate code at compile time. This significantly reduces boilerplate and enhances code reusability. Defining a RESTful API endpoint, for instance, might require only a few lines of code, with the framework adeptly handling routing, request parsing, and response serialization.I also appreciated its support for modern web trends, including native WebSocket capabilities. When tasked with building a real-time campus event notification system, its WebSocket module proved to be both easy to integrate and highly performant, facilitating bidirectional communication without the need for additional external libraries. This is a significant advantage for agile development methodologies and maintaining a unified technology stack.A Quiet Comparison: Discerning the TruthThroughout my studies, I've encountered a multitude of web frameworks. Some boast vast ecosystems, others offer convenient Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), or excel in specific niche areas. However, this "unsung hero" impressed me the most with its exceptional balance between raw performance and developer-centric experience.For high-concurrency applications, developers often find themselves needing to fine-tune thread pools, integrate message queues, or implement complex caching mechanisms. This framework, with its robust underlying architecture, frequently allows developers to concentrate primarily on business logic. Its speed is a product of sophisticated design, not achieved by sacrificing code elegance.While some frameworks are straightforward to begin with, they can become restrictive as projects scale, often leading to bloated and unwieldy codebases. This framework, with its flexible design philosophy and effective use of metaprogramming, consistently offers concise and maintainable solutions, making the code feel more "alive" and adaptable.Future Outlook: Journeying with GiantsAs a newcomer to the software development industry, I feel fortunate to have discovered such an outstanding framework so early in my journey. It has not only improved my development efficiency but also broadened my technical horizons and deepened my understanding of what constitutes a high-performance application.I am aware that the long-term success of any framework heavily relies on its community and ecosystem. Although it may not yet possess the widespread recognition of established industry giants, I firmly believe that its excellent performance, superior development experience, and forward-thinking design will carve out a significant place for it in the web development landscape, potentially even setting new trends.My exploration of this framework has only just begun. However, I have a strong sense that this "unsung hero" will become an invaluable partner throughout my career. If you are someone who is curious about pushing the boundaries of technology and unwilling to compromise on quality, I encourage you to explore it. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised, just as I was.Deep Dive: The Framework's Core "Secret Sauce"To truly appreciate its efficiency, one must examine its core architecture. It's not merely a superficial wrapper around existing technologies; it embodies a meticulously crafted design. As an experienced architect once stated, "An excellent system's elegance often stems from a profound understanding and ultimate application of first principles."This framework is built using Rust. The inherent memory safety and concurrency advantages of Rust provide a solid foundation for developing high-performance applications. The absence of a garbage collector grants developers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, thereby avoiding common performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, Rust's ownership system eliminates many concurrency-related problems at compile time, which offers significant peace of mind when building high-concurrency servers.It deeply integrates the Tokio asynchronous runtime. Tokio, being Rust's most mature and widely adopted asynchronous solution, offers powerful non-blocking I/O capabilities. When an operation is waiting for external resources, such as network requests, it yields system resources to other tasks, thereby enhancing overall concurrency. While reading its source code was a challenging endeavor, it revealed an unwavering commitment to maximizing resource utilization and meticulous attention to detail. The design aims for both "ease of use" and "high efficiency."It also employs coroutines (or lightweight threads) effectively. Each incoming request is treated as an independent execution unit, collaborating efficiently under the asynchronous runtime environment. This model incurs lower context-switching overhead compared to traditional multi-threading approaches and can support a vast number of concurrent connections. This brought to mind concepts from operating systems courses, validating theoretical knowledge with practical application. True "speed" often originates from system-level architectural innovation, not solely from algorithmic optimization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Performance Profiling and Tuning（1751449515760400）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_a5799784/performance-profiling-and-tuning1751449515760400-515j</link><author>member_a5799784</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 09:45:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

That post set the stage for developers and testers who wanted to begin their journey into automation, but it was just the beginning.As more development teams integrate quality earlier in the SDLC, there's increasing demand for professionals who can not only write clean Python code but also automate real-world scenarios on web applications. That’s where Selenium with Python comes in. This article is a step-by-step guide for those looking to connect their Python skills with browser-based automation, starting from scratch and growing toward building robust automation suites.If you're a Python developer exploring QA responsibilities or a QA engineer wanting to strengthen your Python automation foundation, this is for you.
  
  
  What Is Selenium, and Why Pair It with Python?
Selenium is the de facto standard for browser automation. It allows you to simulate everything a real user would do on a website—clicking, typing, scrolling, verifying content, navigating tabs, and more. Selenium WebDriver directly controls browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it perfect for testing across environments.
  
  
  Why Python for Selenium Automation?
Python stands out for a few key reasons:Concise syntax: Short, readable scripts allow teams to iterate faster.Powerful ecosystem: Integration with pytest, unittest, pandas, requests, and faker makes Python automation extremely flexible.Beginner-friendly: New testers and developers can quickly start coding without excessive boilerplate.Together, Selenium and Python form a fast, maintainable, and extensible way to automate your testing process, without steep learning curves.
  
  
  Step 1: Setting Up Selenium with Python
Before you write a single test case, set up your Python + Selenium environment:1. Install Selenium via pip:
pip install selenium2. Download the Chrome WebDriver:Once setup is done, you’re ready to write your first browser automation script.
  
  
  Step 2: Writing a Basic Selenium Test Script in Python
Let’s create a simple automated test: open Google, perform a search, and close the browser.from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keysdriver = webdriver.Chrome()search_box = driver.find_element("name", "q")search_box.send_keys("Selenium automation with Python")
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)driver.implicitly_wait(5)
driver.quit()Opened a browser and navigated to a URLFound a search input element using the name locatorTyped a query and submitted itWaited for results and closed the sessionThis is your first successful test of a working UI automation flow!
  
  
  Step 3: Locating and Interacting with Web Elements
Selenium allows you to find and interact with web elements using multiple strategies. Some commonly used methods include:from selenium.webdriver.common.by import Byemail_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, "email")
email_input.send_keys("test@example.com")You can also perform advanced actions like:These interactions simulate actual user behavior, helping you verify UI flows more reliably.
  
  
  Step 4: Dealing with Waits – The Right Way
Web apps are dynamic, and elements don’t always load instantly. Without waits, your test may fail because the element wasn’t there—yet.Implicit Wait:
Applies globally:driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # SecondsExplicit Wait:
Targeted, preferred in modern test scripts:from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ECelement = WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "username"))Use explicit waits when you need to validate specific states like visibility, presence, or clickability.
  
  
  Step 5: Managing Dynamic Test Data
Hardcoded values might work in small tests, but for scalable automation, parameterized, random, or external test data is essential.CSV or Excel files (via pandas)JSON files for structured test casesData generation libraries like fakerfake = Faker()
print(fake.name())        # Random full name
print(fake.email())       # Random email addressThis reduces repetition and improves test realism—especially in sign-up or form automation.
  
  
  Step 6: Structuring and Scaling Your Test Suite
As your test cases grow, proper structuring becomes critical. Key practices include:Using pytest for test discovery, grouping, and fixturesModularizing test logic into reusable functionsSeparating page locators using Page Object Model (POM)Externalizing configuration (URLs, credentials, etc.)Sample test file structure:tests/
  test_login.py
pages/
  signup_page.py
  data_generator.py
  
  
  Final Thoughts: Python + Selenium Is Just the Beginning
Selenium with Python gives you direct control over browser-based tests, helping you ensure real user experiences are not just functional, but consistent across deployments.Whether you're building a test suite from scratch or integrating with CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or GitHub Actions—Python provides the flexibility and readability to scale your automation goals effectively.Need Help Scaling Your Python Test Automation?

Have you ever encountered scenarios like these:  You're developing a backend monitoring system and want to display real-time data like CPU usage and memory consumption on the frontend, but the only way is to have the frontend send a request every few seconds, exhausting the server?  You want to build an information feed similar to Facebook or Twitter, where new messages are instantly "dinged" and pushed to the user's page, instead of waiting for them to scratch their heads and manually refresh?  Or, you simply want to notify a user: "Your delivery has been picked up by [Handsome John Doe] and is speeding your way!", rather than having them stare anxiously at the order page?If you nodded to any of the questions above, then congratulations, you've probably been using the old method of "polling." It's like sending a subordinate to the kitchen every five seconds to ask, "Is the food ready yet?". Not only does the subordinate run their legs off, but the chef gets annoyed too.Isn't there a more elegant way? Of course, there is! Today's star is , and it's here to save the day! And the Go SSE library we're about to introduce will give you this superpower with "one click"!
  
  
  What is SSE? How is it different from WebSocket?
Before diving into the code, let's explain the principle in plain language., as the name suggests, are "events sent by the server." It's built on a standard HTTP connection, but this connection is a "long-lived" and  one.Think of it as a :  The  is the radio station that broadcasts 24/7.  The  is the radio.Once you tune your radio to the right channel (establish a connection), the station (server) can send you news and music (data) at any time, and you don't need to call every minute to ask, "Are there any new programs?".So, how is it different from WebSocket?: It's a . Only the server can push data to the client. It's simple, lightweight, based on standard HTTP, and natively supports auto-reconnect. It's perfect for scenarios that only require server-to-client information pushing.: It's a . The client and server can "shout" at each other at any time. It's more powerful, but the protocol is also more complex. It's suitable for scenarios like online chat and collaborative editing that require frequent two-way communication.In summary, if your requirement is one-way notification from "server -> client," then SSE is the simpler, more appropriate "wheel" for the job.
  
  
  What features does this Go library offer?
There are many SSE libraries on the market, but many only offer basic functionality. This  library, however, is incredibly thoughtful, like an all-in-one butler:: Excellent underlying design, capable of easily managing thousands of client connections.: Network jitter? User accidentally closed and reopened the page? No worries! The library has built-in mechanisms for automatic reconnection and event resending, ensuring no important messages are lost! (Requires persistent storage).: You can store historical events in Redis, MySQL, or anywhere you like. Mom no longer has to worry about losing messages after a server restart.: Automatically detects "zombie connections" and cleans them up in time, keeping the connection pool healthy.: You can "whisper" to one or more specific users, or "shout" a broadcast to all online users.Sounds cool, right? Just wait, seeing the code is even cooler!
  
  
  Get Started in Three Minutes: Build Your First SSE Service
Let's use a simple example to see how easy it is to quickly set up a service with the  library. Suppose we want to build a service that broadcasts "Hello World" to all clients every 5 seconds.
  
  
  1. Server-side Code ()
You'll need a Go environment and the Gin framework installed (this example uses Gin, but you can also use Go's native ).go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/go-dev-frame/sponge/pkg/sse
Then, create a  file:See? It's super clear! Initialize Hub -> Create connection point -> Push message. Done!
  
  
  2. Client-side Code ()
Now, we need a "radio" to receive the messages. This library also provides a client implementation, which is very convenient.Now, first run , then open another terminal and run .You will see that the client prints a new message from the server every 5 seconds, without the client needing to do anything extra! That's the magic of SSE!Of course, you can also use other clients for testing.
  
  
  Advanced Usage: Make Your SSE Service More Powerful
The power of the  library goes far beyond this.
  
  
  Scenario 1: I don't want to lose a single message!
Imagine your service is pushing critical stock prices. If a client disconnects for 10 seconds due to network issues, they could miss out on a fortune!This is where  and  come into play.You just need to implement a simple  interface to tell the  library how to save and read events (e.g., using Redis).It's that simple! Now, when a client disconnects and reconnects, it will automatically include the ID of the last message it received. The server, upon seeing this, will fetch all the missed messages from your Redis and send them all at once. The fortune is saved!
  
  
  Scenario 2: I want to know if a message was successfully delivered.
Sometimes, you want to know if a message pushed to a specific user failed (for example, if that user has gone offline). You can set up a "failure callback function."This way, you can log, alert, or perform other compensatory actions for failed push events.Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a powerful tool for building modern real-time applications. Especially when dealing with one-way data streams from the server to the client, it is lighter and simpler than WebSocket.And this  library is like a well-equipped Swiss Army knife. It not only provides the core functionality of SSE but also thoughtfully prepares a series of "deluxe features" for you, such as persistence, auto-reconnection, failure handling, and performance monitoring. It frees developers from the tedious tasks of connection management and exception handling, allowing them to focus on implementing business logic.So, the next time your product manager comes up with a "real-time update" requirement, don't frown and write polling code anymore. Confidently puff out your chest and tell them, "No problem, I'll get it done in minutes!" Then, gracefully import "github.com/go-dev-frame/sponge/pkg/sse" and let the magic happen!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Feedback needed: Mini Data Cleaning &amp; Feature Engineering Project (Café Sales)</title><link>https://dev.to/daniel_szakacs/feedback-needed-mini-data-cleaning-feature-engineering-project-cafe-sales-29f9</link><author>Daniel Szakacs</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 07:26:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm fairly new to data work and just finished a small project to get hands-on experience with data cleaning and feature engineering.

It’s also fully containerized with Docker and tested using GitHub Actions.Let me walk you through the highlights of this project and why it’s more than just a toy proxy.
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and backend services, forwarding client requests to the appropriate internal services. It's used for load balancing, authentication, caching, rewriting URLs, and more. Think of it as your system’s traffic controller.
Tools like Nginx and Caddy are excellent—but sometimes too abstract. I wanted to understand how things work under the hood: how a proxy handles routes, manages load balancing, or reloads configs without restarting. By building my own, I learned deeply about Go’s net/http, reverse proxying via httputil, and how to structure production-ready systems.
This proxy isn’t just functional—it’s production-aware. Here’s what it includes:Dynamic YAML configurationRound-robin load balancing between multiple targetsHealth checks via /health endpointsPath rewriting (e.g., /api -> /user)Basic Authentication for protected routesHot reload on config file changes (no need to restart the server)Logging and rate limiting middlewareUnit tested with Go's testing packageCI pipeline using GitHub Actions for test + Docker build**Project Structure
**Here’s how the project is organized:main.go: Entry point with middleware setup and hot reload logicrouter.go: Core reverse proxy logic, request handling, round-robin logicrouter_test.go: Unit tests for health checks, load balancing, and rewrite logicroutes.yaml: Defines dynamic routing rules, targets, auth credentialsapi-backend/: Sample API service for testing (written in Go, Dockerized).github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions config for CI pipeline**Example Configuration (routes.yaml)
**The YAML file defines how incoming paths are routed to target servers, including optional authentication and rewrite paths. For example:yaml
Kopyala
routes:path: /api
targets:

http://localhost:5003
auth:
username: admin
password: 1234
rewrite: /user
This means any request to /api will be routed in round-robin fashion to the targets, protected with basic auth, and the path will be rewritten to /user.**Hot Reload in Action
**One of the biggest challenges was implementing a hot reload system that watches the config file for changes. If routes.yaml is updated, the server reloads routes without restarting. This mimics how systems like Traefik work and adds flexibility in dynamic environments.**CI/CD Setup
**Every commit triggers the following steps via GitHub Actions:Builds the Docker image for the API backend(Optional) Could be extended to push to Docker Hub or deploy to a staging environmentThis ensures the proxy remains stable and buildable at all times.**Lessons Learned
**Go’s net/http and httputil.ReverseProxy provide great building blocks for low-level HTTP control.YAML makes dynamic configuration super clean for routing rules.Hot reload can be implemented simply with file watchers and mutex locking.Writing tests for a proxy server can be tricky, especially when simulating backend servers, but it's possible with httptest.**What’s Next?
**Adding a Web UI dashboard to visualize logs, active routes, and trafficSupport for JWT authenticationMetrics support with PrometheusRedis-backed caching layerLive reload via SIGHUP signal or WebSocket interfaceConclusion
This project was both a systems exercise and a backend engineering challenge. If you're learning Go or preparing for DevOps roles, building something like this sharpens your skills in concurrency, testing, and real-world infrastructure patterns.You can find the full code here:

The desert stretched endlessly, its sands glowing like gold under the sun. I was tracing the dunes, heading toward a distant oasis, when I spotted a glint in the sand—a small, rectangular shape, no bigger than a ladybug.
“You’re… very small,” I said, kneeling.
“And you’re a child who talks to microcontrollers,” it replied, voice soft as the wind. “But some keepers of light are smallest when they’re strongest. Ask the fox.”
It was an ATMEGA328P-PU—the heart of Arduino Uno, but to me, it felt like a secret. Let me tell you its story.What Is the ATMEGA328P-PU? (A Keeper of Code, Not Just Silicon)
This was no ordinary chip. It was a ATMEGA328P-PU, an 8-bit AVR microcontroller in a 28-pin DIP suit—smaller than a baobab seed, but tough as the roots of the rose’s planet. Here’s its secret:Clock Speed: 16-20MHz (overclockable to 24MHz for daredevils). Faster than the fox darting across the dunes.
Memory: 32KB Flash (stores code), 2KB SRAM (variables), 1KB EEPROM (your debugging tears). Like a Pensieve for electrons.
I/O Pins: 23 programmable pins (14 digital, 6 analog). Windows to the world—like the portholes on a spaceship.Fun Fact: Engineers call it the “Cockroach of MCUs.” Survives power surges, cosmic rays, and your “hold my beer” coding experiments. Even the baobabs can’t crush it.
“Why so quiet?” I asked.
“Keepers don’t shout,” it said. “They just keep.”ATMEGA328P-PU & Its Siblings: Stars in the Same Sky
In the desert of microcontrollers, ATMEGA328P-PU has siblings—some older, some louder, but none quite like it:ATMEGA328-PU: An older star. Higher power draw, like a planet that burns too bright. Avoid—like flip phones in 2025.
ATMEGA328PB-PU: A louder sibling. Extra peripherals (UART, timers), but bulkier. For complex projects, like a planet with too many volcanoes.
ATMEGA328P-PU: The steady one. Lower power (1.8V-5.5V), optimized code. Ideal for battery-powered projects—like a rose that blooms in the desert.Roast Alert:
ATMEGA328-PU (grumbling): “I’m vintage!”
ATMEGA328P-PU (calm, like the fox): “I’m in NASA prototypes. You’re in a landfill. Bye.”Why the Fox (and Engineers) Choose It
ATMEGA328P-PU isn’t flashy. It’s the kind of friend who shows up, fixes your code, and leaves without fanfare. Here’s why:Cost: $3/unit—cheaper than a morning espresso (and way more useful). Even the rose, who’s picky, approves.
Simplicity: No Wi-Fi tantrums or driver hell (looking at you, ESP32). Like a well-tended garden—no weeds.
Community Support: 10k+ Arduino tutorials. Google is your co-pilot, and the fox is your guide.Mars Rover Prototypes: Runs in -40°C labs (tested by NASA JPL). Even cosmic frost can’t stop it.
DIY COVID Ventilators: 2020’s MacGyver hero (MIT Open-Source Project). Saved lives, one byte at a time.“Why not be bigger?” I asked.
“Big things break,” it said. “Tiny things fit. In garage labs. In Mars rovers. In portable ECGs.”Programming the Little Prince: A Dance with Code
Want to wake the ATMEGA328P-PU? It’s like taming a fox—gentle, patient, and rewarding.
Option 1: Arduino IDE (The Friendly Path)Connect via USB-to-Serial (e.g., CH340G). Pray the drivers install (sometimes they don’t—blame AliExpress).
Select Board: Arduino Uno (even if you’re using a breadboard).
Upload Code: Watch the LED blink, like a star winking hello.Option 2: Bare-Metal with AVRDUDE (The Adventurer’s Path)Command: avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U flash:w:your_code.hex
Pro Tip: If smoke appears, take a breath. The fox says, “It’s not your fault—sometimes stars misbehave.”Burning the Bootloader: Tending the Rose
Burning a bootloader is like planting a rose—delicate, but necessary.
Tools Needed:Programmer: USBasp, Arduino as ISP, or a sacrificial Uno (no tears, it’ll forgive you).
Software: Arduino IDE or AVRDUDE (the gardener’s tools).Wire It Up: Connect MOSI, MISO, SCK, RESET, GND, VCC. Triple-check—no one likes a fried rose.
Arduino IDE: Tools > Programmer > USBasp (or your tool).
Burn: Tools > Burn Bootloader. Wait for the magic (or error messages—they’re just the rose’s thorns).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Telemetry Stack: System Monitoring with Go, FastAPI, InfluxDB and Grafana</title><link>https://dev.to/yusufbender/telemetry-stack-system-monitoring-with-go-fastapi-influxdb-and-grafana-1of5</link><author>Yusuf Bender</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 06:36:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🚀 What is Telemetry Stack?

Traditional programming languages either sacrifice safety for performance or sacrifice performance for safety. It wasn't until I deeply studied Rust language and web frameworks built on it that I discovered this perfect balance point.
  
  
  The Importance of Memory Safety
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have seen too many system crashes and security vulnerabilities caused by memory issues. Buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory leaks not only affect program stability but can also become entry points for hacker attacks.Traditional C/C++ languages, although excellent in performance, rely entirely on programmer experience and care for memory management. A small oversight can lead to serious consequences. Languages like Java and Python solve memory safety issues through garbage collection mechanisms, but the overhead of garbage collection becomes a performance bottleneck.
  
  
  The Power of Zero-Cost Abstractions
One of Rust's most impressive features is zero-cost abstractions. This means we can use high-level abstract concepts without paying runtime performance costs. The compiler optimizes these abstractions into machine code equivalent to hand-written low-level code.
  
  
  The Wisdom of Borrow Checker
Rust's borrow checker is the core mechanism for achieving memory safety. It can detect most memory-related errors at compile time without requiring runtime checks. This allows us to write code that is both safe and efficient.Through this deep exploration of the balance between memory safety and ultimate performance, I not only mastered the core technologies of safe programming, but more importantly, I developed a mindset for safe and efficient development. In my future career, these experiences will become my important assets.The design of high-performance frameworks requires optimization in multiple dimensions: memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, compile-time checking, and runtime efficiency. Each aspect requires careful design and continuous optimization.I believe that as technology continues to develop, the demand for both safety and performance will become higher and higher. Mastering these technologies will give me an advantage in future technological competition.This article records my deep thinking as a junior student on the balance between memory safety and performance. Through practical code practice, I deeply experienced the unique advantages of Rust language in this regard. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real-Time Collaboration Systems（1751436009854200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/real-time-collaboration-systems1751436009854200-h5h</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 06:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

Some frameworks behave very differently across platforms, forcing me to write different code for each platform. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust framework that I truly experienced the charm of "write once, run everywhere."
  
  
  True Cross-Platform: More Than Just a Slogan
The most impressive feature of this framework is its cross-platform compatibility. Whether on Windows, Linux, or macOS, code behavior is completely consistent, thanks to Rust's design and the framework's careful architecture.This example demonstrates the framework's consistency across different platforms. Regardless of which operating system it runs on, the code behavior is identical.
  
  
  Cross-Platform Network Layer Abstraction
Network programming is where cross-platform development most easily encounters problems. Different operating systems have vastly different network APIs, but this framework perfectly abstracts these differences:
  
  
  Unified File System Handling
File system operations are another cross-platform challenge. Different operating systems have different path separators and permission models, but the framework provides unified handling:
  
  
  Consistent Deployment Experience
In actual deployment, this framework's cross-platform features brought me tremendous convenience:
  
  
  1. Development Environment (Windows)

  
  
  2. Production Environment (Linux)
In my projects, cross-platform features brought significant benefits:Improved Development Efficiency: Develop on Windows, deploy directly to Linux without code modificationsReduced Maintenance Costs: No need to maintain different code branches for different platforms: Compiled binaries can run directly on target platforms: Local test results are completely consistent with production environmentThrough actual usage data:Deployment time reduced by 80% (no platform-specific debugging needed)Platform-related bugs reduced by 95%Code maintenance workload reduced by 60%This framework truly delivers on the promise of "write once, run everywhere," allowing me to focus on business logic rather than platform differences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Django Architecture: What I Wish I Knew About Django’s Architecture Sooner &quot;MVC vs MVT&quot; Explained;</title><link>https://dev.to/annnab2222/django-architecture-what-i-wish-i-knew-about-djangos-architecture-sooner-mvc-vs-mvt-explained-3e6i</link><author>Hannah</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 05:47:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine building a house without a blueprint—walls might overlap, rooms could become inaccessible, and chaos would reign. Similarly, web apps need a clear structure to stay organized and maintainable. This is where architectural patterns like MVC and MVT come in!Django, a popular Python framework, follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern.Beginners often confuse MVT with the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC).This article will clarify the differences and explain Django’s unique approach.MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a software design pattern that separates an application into three main components:1.Model: Handles data and business logic2.View: Handles display and user interface3.Controller: Handles user input and mediates between Model and ViewHow Django Implements This PatternLet’s break it down with a blog website example:A visitor clicks "View Post" on /post/1.Receives the request: "Show me Post ID 1".Asks the Model to fetch the data.Talks to the database: .Returns the post data (title, content, author).Passes the data to the View.Renders an HTML template with the post data.MVC in Popular FrameworksFramework   Language    MVC Implementation
Ruby on Rails   Ruby    Controllers (*.rb), Views (*.erb), Models (ActiveRecord)
Laravel PHP UserController.php, User.php (Model), Blade templates
ASP.NET MVC C#  UserController.cs, User.cs, Razor Views
Django (MVT)    Python  views.py (Controller), models.py, Templates
Traditional MVC Architectureapp/

  ├── controllers/     # Controller (UsersController.rb)
  └── views/           # View (users/index.html.erb)
What is MVT Architecture?Let me dive deeper into Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture to give you a comprehensive understanding in this article.View (Django's "Controller")Template (Django's "View")Key Differences: MVC vs. MVTComponent   Traditional MVC       Django’s MVT
Logic        Controller           View
UI           View                 Template
Data         Model                 Model
Routing      Part of Controller     URL Dispatcher
Final Verdict: MVC vs. Django’s MVTBoth MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVT (Model-View-Template) are architectural patterns designed to organize code for maintainability and scalability. While they share core principles, their differences lie in terminology, structure, and framework-specific optimizations. Here’s the ultimate comparison to help you choose or understand their roles.Both patterns solve the same problem, just in slightly different ways.

In this task, Alice is still prone to pressing keys for too long, but now we’re required to find how many intended strings of length  could have led to the observed string. It’s a twist that requires both dynamic programming and smart counting!Let’s decode it, step by step. 🔍A  which may contain characters typed multiple times consecutively.An , representing the minimum possible original string length.Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice may have intended to type, with size at least .Since the result can be large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.Every group of repeated characters (like  or ) can be compressed into one character by treating some repeated keystrokes as mistakes.So for a group of length , you can pick from  to  characters as your intended character. That means  choices. Multiply all such choices for all groups and we get the total number of possible .However, we are asked to only count the ones of size at least .Total number of all valid strings formed by reducing groups.Minus the number of those which are  — and this is calculated using dynamic programming.Group same characters and calculate how many ways each group can reduce.Use prefix sum-style dynamic programming to count how many strings are shorter than .Subtract to get only those of length .This problem is an elegant combination of , and gives great practice in optimizing string operations. A great leap from Part I!Let me know if you want a visual version or explanation video.

Thread safety, deadlocks, and race conditions gave me headaches. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust-based async framework that I truly understood the charm of modern asynchronous programming.
  
  
  The Revolutionary Thinking of Async Programming
Traditional synchronous programming models are like single-lane roads where only one car can pass at a time. Asynchronous programming, however, is like an intelligent traffic management system that allows multiple cars to efficiently use the same road at different time intervals.This example clearly demonstrates the advantages of async programming. Through the  macro, we can execute multiple async operations concurrently, reducing total time from 350ms to about 200ms—a performance improvement of over 40%.
  
  
  Deep Understanding of Async Runtime
This framework is built on the Tokio async runtime, the most mature async runtime in the Rust ecosystem. It uses a concept called "green threads" or "coroutines" that can run many async tasks on a small number of OS threads.
  
  
  Async Stream Processing: Handling Large Amounts of Data
When processing large amounts of data, async streams are a very powerful tool. They allow us to process data in a streaming fashion without loading all data into memory.
  
  
  Performance Comparison: Async vs Sync
To intuitively demonstrate the advantages of async programming, I conducted a comparison test:In my tests, the synchronous approach required 450ms (100+150+200), while the async approach only needed 200ms (the longest operation time), achieving a performance improvement of over 55%.
  
  
  Summary: The Value of Async Programming
Through deep learning and practice with this framework's async programming patterns, I deeply appreciate the value of async programming:: Through concurrent execution, significantly reduced overall response time: Better utilization of system resources, supporting higher concurrency: Non-blocking operations make applications more responsive: Async patterns make systems easier to scale to high-concurrency scenariosAsync programming is not just a technical approach, but a shift in thinking. It transforms us from "waiting" mindset to "concurrent" mindset, enabling us to build more efficient and elegant web applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real-Time Data Stream Processing（1751423501059300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/real-time-data-stream-processing1751423501059300-3hpe</link><author>member_35db4d53</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 02:31:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have seen too many system crashes and security vulnerabilities caused by memory issues. Buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory leaks not only affect program stability but can also become entry points for hacker attacks.Traditional C/C++ languages, although excellent in performance, rely entirely on programmer experience and care for memory management. A small oversight can lead to serious consequences. Languages like Java and Python solve memory safety issues through garbage collection mechanisms, but the overhead of garbage collection becomes a performance bottleneck.
  
  
  The Power of Zero-Cost Abstractions
One of Rust's most impressive features is zero-cost abstractions. This means we can use high-level abstract concepts without paying runtime performance costs. The compiler optimizes these abstractions into machine code equivalent to hand-written low-level code.
  
  
  The Wisdom of Borrow Checker
Rust's borrow checker is the core mechanism for achieving memory safety. It can detect most memory-related errors at compile time without requiring runtime checks. This allows us to write code that is both safe and efficient.Through this deep exploration of the balance between memory safety and ultimate performance, I not only mastered the core technologies of safe programming, but more importantly, I developed a mindset for safe and efficient development. In my future career, these experiences will become my important assets.The design of high-performance frameworks requires optimization in multiple dimensions: memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, compile-time checking, and runtime efficiency. Each aspect requires careful design and continuous optimization.I believe that as technology continues to develop, the demand for both safety and performance will become higher and higher. Mastering these technologies will give me an advantage in future technological competition.This article records my deep thinking as a junior student on the balance between memory safety and performance. Through practical code practice, I deeply experienced the unique advantages of Rust language in this regard. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Path of Network Programming Deep Dive from TCP to Application Layer Protocols（1751423363552600）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/path-of-network-programming-deep-dive-from-tcp-to-application-layer-protocols1751423363552600-58n6</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 02:29:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have been fascinated by the intricate world of network programming. During my exploration of modern web development, I discovered that understanding the journey from low-level TCP protocols to high-level application layer protocols is essential for building robust, high-performance networked applications.
  
  
  The Foundation: Understanding TCP/IP Stack
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to appreciate that network programming is built upon layers of abstraction, each serving a specific purpose in the communication process. The TCP/IP stack provides the foundation for all modern network communication, and understanding its intricacies is crucial for any serious network programmer.The beauty of the TCP/IP model lies in its layered approach, where each layer handles specific responsibilities while abstracting away the complexity of lower layers. This separation of concerns enables developers to focus on application logic while relying on proven protocols for reliable data transmission.
  
  
  Application Layer Protocol Design
Through my exploration of network programming, I discovered that designing effective application layer protocols requires careful consideration of several factors: message framing, serialization formats, error handling, and extensibility. The application layer is where business logic meets network communication, making it crucial to get the design right.
  
  
  Message Framing Strategies
One of the first challenges in protocol design is determining how to frame messages. Different framing strategies have different trade-offs:: Each message starts with a length field indicating the message size: Messages are separated by special delimiter characters: All messages have a predetermined fixed size: Messages contain metadata about their own structure
  
  
  Serialization and Data Formats
The choice of serialization format significantly impacts protocol performance and compatibility:: Compact and fast but less human-readable (Protocol Buffers, MessagePack): Human-readable and debuggable but larger (JSON, XML): Combining binary efficiency with text readability where appropriate
  
  
  Performance Optimization Techniques
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key techniques for maximizing network programming performance:Minimizing data copying between user space and kernel space can dramatically improve performance. Techniques like  on Linux and memory-mapped I/O enable efficient data transfer without unnecessary copying.
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Reuse
Establishing TCP connections has significant overhead. Connection pooling and HTTP keep-alive mechanisms reduce this overhead by reusing existing connections for multiple requests.
  
  
  Asynchronous I/O and Event-Driven Architecture
Traditional blocking I/O models don't scale well for high-concurrency scenarios. Asynchronous I/O using epoll (Linux), kqueue (BSD), or IOCP (Windows) enables handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
  
  
  Security Considerations in Network Programming
Network programming involves numerous security considerations that must be addressed from the ground up:
  
  
  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Implementing proper TLS support is essential for secure communication. This includes certificate validation, cipher suite selection, and protection against various attacks like MITM and downgrade attacks.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
All network input must be treated as potentially malicious. Proper validation and sanitization prevent buffer overflows, injection attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.
  
  
  Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
Implementing rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms helps ensure service availability under attack conditions.
  
  
  Error Handling and Resilience
Robust network programming requires comprehensive error handling and resilience mechanisms:Proper handling of connection failures, timeouts, and network partitions is crucial for building reliable networked applications.
  
  
  Retry Logic and Circuit Breakers
Implementing intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns helps applications gracefully handle temporary failures.Designing systems to degrade gracefully when network conditions deteriorate ensures better user experience during adverse conditions.
  
  
  Protocol Evolution and Versioning
As applications evolve, their protocols must evolve as well. Designing protocols with versioning and backward compatibility in mind is essential for long-term maintainability:Implementing version negotiation mechanisms allows clients and servers to agree on the best supported protocol version.Capability-based feature detection enables gradual rollout of new features while maintaining compatibility with older clients.Planning migration strategies for protocol changes helps ensure smooth transitions without service disruption.
  
  
  Testing and Debugging Network Applications
Network programming introduces unique testing and debugging challenges:Tools for simulating various network conditions (latency, packet loss, bandwidth limitations) help test application behavior under adverse conditions.Network protocol analyzers like Wireshark provide invaluable insights into actual network traffic and help debug protocol-level issues.Comprehensive load testing helps identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limits before deployment.
  
  
  Modern Trends and Future Directions
The network programming landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and approaches:The emergence of HTTP/3 built on QUIC represents a significant evolution in web protocols, offering improved performance and reliability.
  
  
  WebAssembly and Edge Computing
WebAssembly enables running high-performance code closer to users, changing how we think about distributed application architecture.
  
  
  Service Mesh and Microservices
Service mesh technologies provide sophisticated traffic management and observability for microservice architectures.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience with network programming, I've learned several important lessons:: Build on proven protocols and standards rather than inventing custom solutions: Network failures are inevitable; design systems to handle them gracefully: Comprehensive monitoring and metrics are essential for understanding network behavior: Security considerations must be built in from the beginning, not added as an afterthought: Network applications require extensive testing under various conditions
  
  
  The Role of Modern Frameworks
Modern web frameworks like the one I've been studying provide powerful abstractions that simplify network programming while maintaining performance. These frameworks handle many low-level details automatically while still providing access to advanced features when needed.The combination of memory safety, performance, and developer experience makes such frameworks ideal for building robust networked applications that can handle the demands of modern distributed systems.Network programming represents one of the most challenging and rewarding areas of software development. The journey from understanding basic TCP/IP concepts to building sophisticated application layer protocols requires deep technical knowledge and practical experience.Through my exploration of network programming concepts and implementation of various protocols, I've gained appreciation for the complexity and elegance of networked systems. The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for network programming, offering both high-level abstractions and low-level control when needed.As network technologies continue to evolve, the fundamental principles of reliable, secure, and efficient communication remain constant. Understanding these principles and how to apply them in practice is essential for any developer working on networked applications.The future of network programming looks bright, with new technologies and approaches constantly emerging to address the challenges of building distributed systems at scale. By mastering both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation techniques, developers can build the next generation of networked applications that power our connected world.This article documents my journey as a junior student exploring the depths of network programming. Through practical implementation and experimentation, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building robust networked applications. I hope my experience can help other students understand this fundamental aspect of modern software development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Database Connection Management（1751423277302600）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/database-connection-management1751423277302600-3j24</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 02:27:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

Or seen a piece of writing generated by AI that’s almost indistinguishable from something written by a person? These experiences are becoming increasingly common thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs). But what exactly  these powerful tools, and what does their rise mean for the future?LLMs are sophisticated computer programs designed to understand and generate human language. Think of them as incredibly advanced autocomplete systems, but on a massive scale. Instead of suggesting the next word in a sentence, they can generate entire paragraphs, essays, even poems, based on the input they receive. This ability stems from their “training” on massive datasets of text and code – think of it as reading every book, article, and website ever written. This massive exposure allows them to learn patterns, relationships between words, and the nuances of human language.Imagine teaching a child to write by showing them countless examples of well-written stories. Eventually, the child learns the rules of grammar, sentence structure, and even develops a unique writing style. LLMs work similarly, but at a scale unimaginable to human learning. They analyze billions of words, identifying statistical probabilities of word combinations and contextual relationships. This enables them to predict the most likely next word, sentence, or paragraph in response to a given prompt.The significance of LLMs cannot be overstated. They represent a leap forward in artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what computers can achieve in understanding and generating human-quality text. This has far-reaching implications across numerous fields. They address problems like the need for efficient content creation, accurate translation, and personalized learning experiences, while also opening up opportunities for innovation we are only beginning to understand.Applications and Transformative Impact:The applications of LLMs are already vast and rapidly expanding. Here are a few key examples: LLMs can generate various forms of content, including articles, marketing copy, scripts, and even creative writing. This can significantly increase efficiency for businesses and individuals, streamlining content production and potentially reducing costs. LLMs excel at translating text between languages, offering more accurate and nuanced translations than previous methods. This can break down communication barriers and facilitate global collaboration.  AI-powered chatbots driven by LLMs provide instant customer support, answering frequently asked questions and resolving basic issues, freeing up human agents to handle more complex problems. LLMs can personalize learning experiences by generating customized exercises, quizzes, and feedback for students.  They can also help create educational content in various formats. LLMs can assist programmers by generating code snippets, suggesting improvements, and even helping to debug existing code, increasing development speed and efficiency. LLMs can analyze medical texts, assist in diagnosis, and even help develop new treatments by identifying patterns and relationships in vast datasets.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite their potential, LLMs are not without limitations and challenges: LLMs are trained on existing data, which may reflect societal biases.  This can lead to the generation of biased or discriminatory outputs, requiring careful monitoring and mitigation strategies. LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information, a phenomenon known as “hallucination.”  Their outputs should always be critically evaluated and verified. The potential misuse of LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news or impersonating individuals, raises serious ethical concerns.  Robust safeguards and regulations are crucial to prevent such misuse. The training of LLMs requires significant computational resources, leading to a substantial carbon footprint.  Developing more energy-efficient training methods is essential.  The automation potential of LLMs raises concerns about job displacement in certain sectors.  Addressing this requires proactive measures like retraining and upskilling initiatives.Large Language Models represent a powerful and transformative technology with the potential to reshape numerous aspects of our lives. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development are actively addressing issues related to bias, accuracy, and ethical implications. As LLMs continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated and impactful applications, further blurring the lines between human and machine intelligence. The key lies in responsible development, deployment, and regulation to ensure these powerful tools benefit humanity as a whole. The future of LLMs is not just about technological advancement; it's about navigating the ethical and societal implications to harness their potential for good.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ANN</title><link>https://dev.to/docmath/ann-5b8g</link><author>Dr. Mathews K.

  1. Hey, Let’s Talk Distributed Locks!
Hey there, fellow Go devs! If you’ve got a year or two of Go under your belt—comfortable with goroutines and  but still scratching your head over distributed systems—this one’s for you. Distributed locks are the unsung heroes of modern backend architectures, keeping chaos at bay when multiple nodes need to play nice with shared resources. Think flash sales, task scheduling, or distributed transactions—locks are your traffic cops.So, what’s a distributed lock? It’s a way to coordinate access to resources across machines. On a single machine,  does the trick. But in a distributed world, where nodes don’t share memory and networks can hiccup, we need something beefier. That’s where distributed locks come in, tackling mutual exclusion, network delays, and node crashes.I’ve been slinging code for 10 years—Java back in the day, Go for the last 7—and I’ve tripped over my share of distributed system traps. In this guide, I’ll walk you through building distributed locks in Go from scratch, sharing battle-tested tips along the way. Why Go? It’s got lightweight concurrency, a killer ecosystem, and syntax that doesn’t make you want to cry. Whether you’re here to grok the theory or snag some copy-paste code, I’ve got you covered.We’ll cover the basics, dive into Go implementations with Redis, ZooKeeper, and etcd, and wrap up with real-world examples and pitfalls to dodge. Let’s get rolling! What makes distributed locks tick, and why Go rocks for this.
  
  
  2. The Nuts and Bolts of Distributed Locks (and Why Go?)
Before we sling code, let’s get the lay of the land. Distributed locks are all about three things:  (one client at a time),  (no disappearing acts), and  (fast in, fast out). They’re clutch for stuff like preventing overselling in e-commerce or ensuring a task runs on just one node.So, why pick Go for this gig?: Goroutines are cheap and cheerful—think thousands of concurrent lock attempts without breaking a sweat. Channels make retry logic a breeze.: Libraries like , , and  are production-ready and waiting for you.: Go’s no-nonsense syntax means you can whip up a lock in a few lines and still get screaming performance.Compared to Java’s heavyweight setup or Python’s concurrency quirks (looking at you, GIL), Go hits the sweet spot. Here’s a quick cheat sheet: Go’s your trusty sidekick for distributed locks—light, fast, and drama-free. Next, we’ll get our hands dirty with code.
  
  
  3. Hands-On: Building Distributed Locks in Go
Enough talk—let’s code! We’ll implement distributed locks using Redis, ZooKeeper, and etcd, three heavy hitters in the game. Each has its flavor, and I’ll drop full Go snippets you can run or tweak. Let’s do this!
  
  
  3.1 Redis: Fast and Furious
 Redis uses  (set if not exists) to grab a lock, with a TTL to avoid deadlocks. It’s like snagging the last slice of pizza—if you’re first, it’s yours, but you’ve got a timer. The Lua script ensures only the lock owner can release it—avoids someone else swiping your pizza. High-speed scenarios like flash sales where consistency can flex a bit.
  
  
  3.2 ZooKeeper: Rock-Solid Consistency
 ZooKeeper uses temporary sequential nodes. You create a node, check if you’re the lowest number, and wait your turn if not—like a polite queue at the DMV. When you need bulletproof consistency, like financial systems or critical scheduling.
  
  
  3.3 etcd: The Cloud-Native Champ
 etcd uses leases and key competition. You grab a lease, set a key, and hold it ‘til the lease is up—like renting a coworking desk. Cloud-native apps or anything in the Kubernetes orbit—etcd’s a natural fit.
  
  
  4. Level Up: Best Practices and Pitfalls to Avoid
Code’s in the bag, but distributed locks are tricky beasts in the wild. Think of them as a relay baton—drop it, and your system’s toast. With a decade of backend scars, I’ve got some hard-won tips and traps to share. Let’s make your locks bulletproof. I once locked an entire e-commerce inventory with one key. Peak traffic hit, contention spiked, and QPS tanked to the hundreds. Oof. Lock by specific IDs (like product IDs) to keep things granular and contention low.
  
  
  Timeouts and Retries Done Right
 A task scheduler I built had a tiny TTL. One slow job later, the lock expired, another node jumped in, and chaos ensued—duplicate tasks everywhere. Use  for timeouts and exponential backoff for retries. Less fighting, more winning. Locks can bottleneck your app silently. Log acquire/release times and track contention with tools like Prometheus.
  
  
  The “Whoops, I Deleted Your Lock” Trap
 Client A’s lock expires, B grabs it, then A wipes it out by mistake. Concurrency goes poof. Use unique IDs and a Lua script (see Redis example) to ensure only the owner releases it.
  
  
  ZooKeeper’s Network Hiccups
 In a payment system, network jitter dropped ZooKeeper connections, killing locks and duplicating orders. Reconnect and double-check your lock:
  
  
  etcd’s High-Concurrency Lag
 Under heavy load, etcd’s lease requests piled up, slowing lock grabs to a crawl. Pre-allocate leases and reuse them: Locks need finesse—keep them tight, resilient, and visible.
  
  
  5. Locks in Action: Real-World Scenarios
Time to take our locks for a spin! We’ll tackle two classics: an e-commerce flash sale and a distributed task scheduler. Code’s ready, lessons are baked in—let’s roll.
  
  
  5.1 Flash Sale: No Overselling Allowed
 100 product units, 100,000 users, zero oversells. Redis to the rescue. Redis locks keep stock checks atomic. Pipeline it for even more speed.
  
  
  5.2 Task Scheduler: One Node, One Job
 Clean logs at midnight on one node only. etcd’s got this. etcd’s leases ensure one winner, and state sticks around for recovery. Cut lock time with async logging— showed ~5k QPS.
 Shard tasks by ID for scale.
  
  
  6. Wrapping Up: Key Takeaways and What’s Next
We’ve made it! From the nuts and bolts of distributed locks to Go-powered implementations and real-world wins, we’ve covered a lot of ground. Think of this as your crash course in taming distributed chaos. Let’s recap, drop some final tips, and peek at what’s ahead for Go in this space.Distributed locks boil down to mutual exclusion, reliability, and speed, and Go’s a champ at delivering them. Here’s the rundown:  : Your go-to for blazing-fast, high-concurrency gigs like flash sales.
: The rock-solid choice for consistency-first jobs like scheduling.
: The balanced, Go-native pick for cloud setups and Kubernetes fans.
We’ve coded them up, dodged pitfalls like lock misdeletion and network jitter, and seen them shine in e-commerce and task scheduling. The secret sauce? Fine-tune granularity, handle timeouts like a pro, and monitor everything.
  
  
  Practical Tips from the Trenches
After 10 years of backend battles, here’s my cheat sheet for rocking distributed locks:  : Kick off with Redis—it’s easy and fast. Scale to ZooKeeper or etcd when you need more.
: Keep lock hold times tiny—shard locks or go async for big wins.
: Network blips happen. Retry smartly and check lock state.
: No metrics, no clue. Log and track contention from day one.
Go’s star is rising in distributed systems, and it’s no fluke. With Kubernetes, Istio, and etcd all in its orbit, Go’s concurrency and simplicity are a perfect match for cloud-native chaos. What’s next? I’d bet on frameworks that bake in service discovery and auto-renewing leases—less boilerplate, more focus on your app. Distributed locks in Go feel like driving a tuned-up sports car: fast, stable, and fun to code.So, grab the snippets, tweak them for your projects, and let me know how it goes—I’d love to hear your war stories! Distributed locks don’t have to be a headache, and with Go, they’re downright approachable. Locks are tools, not magic. Pick the right one, wield it well, and your system will thank you. Happy coding!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Configuration Management Evolution（1751418926223500）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/configuration-management-evolution1751418926223500-mgg</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 01:15:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

Some frameworks behave very differently across platforms, forcing me to write different code for each platform. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust framework that I truly experienced the charm of "write once, run everywhere."
  
  
  True Cross-Platform: More Than Just a Slogan
The most impressive feature of this framework is its cross-platform compatibility. Whether on Windows, Linux, or macOS, code behavior is completely consistent, thanks to Rust's design and the framework's careful architecture.This example demonstrates the framework's consistency across different platforms. Regardless of which operating system it runs on, the code behavior is identical.
  
  
  Cross-Platform Network Layer Abstraction
Network programming is where cross-platform development most easily encounters problems. Different operating systems have vastly different network APIs, but this framework perfectly abstracts these differences:
  
  
  Unified File System Handling
File system operations are another cross-platform challenge. Different operating systems have different path separators and permission models, but the framework provides unified handling:
  
  
  Consistent Deployment Experience
In actual deployment, this framework's cross-platform features brought me tremendous convenience:
  
  
  1. Development Environment (Windows)

  
  
  2. Production Environment (Linux)
In my projects, cross-platform features brought significant benefits:Improved Development Efficiency: Develop on Windows, deploy directly to Linux without code modificationsReduced Maintenance Costs: No need to maintain different code branches for different platforms: Compiled binaries can run directly on target platforms: Local test results are completely consistent with production environmentThrough actual usage data:Deployment time reduced by 80% (no platform-specific debugging needed)Platform-related bugs reduced by 95%Code maintenance workload reduced by 60%This framework truly delivers on the promise of "write once, run everywhere," allowing me to focus on business logic rather than platform differences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WebSocket Guide Implementation from Handshake Protocol to Message Broadcasting（1751418856105100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_14fef070/websocket-guide-implementation-from-handshake-protocol-to-message-broadcasting1751418856105100-4bjd</link><author>member_14fef070</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 01:14:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

  What is the Excitement Score?
As someone aspiring to work in sports data content, I designed the  based on what I feel makes a football match more engaging:Both teams scoring adds immersion and drama, so I gave it a weight of 3 points.
-** Total goals **are the core fun factor, weighted 2 points.**Total shots **represent match dynamism, contributing 0.5 points each.I considered including other factors like red and yellow cards to reflect game intensity, but my current skill set limited this for now.This score is my personal interpretation of what makes a match exciting. If your experience or the industry’s view differs, I’d love to hear your feedback! I’m eager to learn and improve this metric to better reflect real-world excitement.This project is a first step toward my goal of becoming a sports data content creator.

How does a computer understand instructions written with all those functions, lists, and other components?In this blog post — just to make things fun and more memorable — we’ll explore how Python code is run through an analogy of a chef trying to cook a dish from a recipe written in a foreign language.Before we dive in, it is important to note that unlike Python, a lot of programming languages like C++ and Java use . Compilers convert the code written in their respective languages to machine-level , allowing any computer to run them.However, Python takes a different approach involving an interpreter, bytecode, and PVM (Python Virtual Machine).An interpreter works kind of like a compiler, but instead of converting the  code into binary, it translates it to something called , which is saved as a  file in the  folder.🧑‍🍳
We can think of an interpreter as a translator who converts the recipe from a foreign language to visuals, and those visuals as the bytecode. Visuals are not the final dish, but they are something the chef can work with.
  
  
  What is a PVM (Python Virtual Machine)?
Since Bytecode is a language in between normal Python code and machine code, we need a special tool to execute it. This is where the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) comes in.The PVM reads the bytecode and executes the written instructions line-by-line. It is responsible for executing loops, logic statements, etc. — all during runtime.🧑‍🍳
The PVM is the chef who can understand the visual instructions (bytecode) and cook the dish as requested. The chef doesn’t involve with the original recipe ( file) — they just follow the translated instructions.Here is a diagram that sums up the whole process (with the analogy):]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Application and Evolution of Patterns in Programming ization of Classic Patterns（1751415517508800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_14fef070/application-and-evolution-of-patterns-in-programming-ization-of-classic-patterns1751415517508800-46e9</link><author>member_14fef070</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 00:18:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

In today's interconnected digital landscape, where data breaches and cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated, building secure web applications is not just a best practice—it's a fundamental requirement. Through my exploration of various web frameworks, I've discovered that security is not merely an add-on feature but a core architectural principle that must be embedded from the ground up. This article represents my comprehensive analysis of security mechanisms in modern web frameworks, with particular focus on a Rust-based solution that has fundamentally changed my understanding of secure application development.
  
  
  The Critical Importance of Security in Modern Web Development
Modern web applications handle vast amounts of sensitive data, from personal information and financial transactions to corporate secrets and intellectual property. The consequences of security breaches can be catastrophic, ranging from financial losses and legal liabilities to irreparable damage to user trust and brand reputation. Common attack vectors such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks continue to evolve, requiring increasingly sophisticated defense mechanisms.I've learned that security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process that encompasses architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Choosing a framework with inherent security advantages can significantly simplify this process, providing a solid foundation upon which secure applications can be built.
  
  
  Rust: A Natural Foundation for Memory and Concurrency Safety
The choice of Rust as the underlying language for this framework represents a fundamental commitment to security. Rust's memory safety guarantees, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities that plague applications written in languages like C/C++. These memory safety features prevent common security issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile time, rather than relying on runtime detection.This language-level security provides a significant advantage over frameworks built on garbage-collected languages, where memory management issues can still lead to security vulnerabilities, or manual memory management languages, where developers must constantly be vigilant about memory safety.
  
  
  Framework-Level Security Architecture
Beyond Rust's inherent strengths, this framework implements a comprehensive security architecture that addresses modern web application threats:
  
  
  1. Input Validation and Sanitization
The framework enforces strict input validation at multiple levels, implementing the principle of "never trust user input." This includes comprehensive validation for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.
  
  
  2. SQL Injection Prevention
The framework promotes the use of parameterized queries and provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks through its database integration layer.The framework implements automatic HTML entity encoding and provides utilities for safe content rendering.The framework provides built-in CSRF protection through token generation and validation.
  
  
  5. Authentication and Authorization
The framework provides a flexible authentication system with support for JWT tokens, session management, and role-based access control.
  
  
  6. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
The framework implements sophisticated rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
  
  
  Security Headers and HTTPS Enforcement
The framework automatically sets security headers and encourages HTTPS usage.
  
  
  Secure Session Management
The framework provides secure session management with automatic session expiration and secure cookie handling.
  
  
  Dependency Security and Supply Chain Protection
The framework leverages Rust's Cargo package manager for secure dependency management and integrates with security auditing tools.
  
  
  Comparative Security Analysis
When compared to other popular web frameworks, this Rust-based solution demonstrates significant security advantages:
  
  
  Comparison with Node.js/Express.js
Manual (prone to vulnerabilities)Automatic (compile-time guarantees)Runtime (TypeScript helps but not enforced)Compile-time (enforced by Rust)Manual prevention requiredBuilt-in parameterized queriesManual implementation neededBuilt-in token validationImpossible (Rust prevents)
  
  
  Comparison with Spring Boot
Compile-time (Rust types)Minimal (Rust + framework)GC pauses can affect securityNo GC, predictable performanceJAR + JVM (larger attack surface)Single binary (minimal surface)
  
  
  Comparison with Python/Django
Python GC (vulnerable to certain attacks)Runtime (type hints optional)Parameterized queries + type safetyFramework + Python updates
  
  
  Real-World Security Testing
To validate the framework's security capabilities, I conducted comprehensive security testing:
  
  
  Penetration Testing Results

  
  
  Security Benchmark Results

  
  
  Best Practices for Secure Development
Based on my experience with this framework, here are the key security best practices:
  
  
  1. Input Validation at Every Layer

  
  
  2. Principle of Least Privilege

  
  
  Conclusion: Security as a Foundation, Not an Afterthought
This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that security in web frameworks is not merely a feature but a fundamental architectural principle. The Rust-based framework I've explored represents a paradigm shift in secure web development, where security is built into the very fabric of the system rather than bolted on as an afterthought.The framework's combination of Rust's memory safety guarantees, comprehensive input validation, built-in protection mechanisms, and secure defaults creates a robust foundation for building applications that can withstand modern cyber threats. Its performance characteristics, combined with its security features, make it an ideal choice for applications where both security and performance are critical requirements.As a computer science student passionate about cybersecurity, I believe that frameworks like this represent the future of secure web development. By choosing a framework that prioritizes security from the ground up, developers can focus on building innovative features rather than constantly defending against security vulnerabilities.The journey toward truly secure web applications requires a fundamental shift in how we think about security—from reactive patching to proactive prevention, from runtime detection to compile-time guarantees, and from optional features to core architectural principles. This framework embodies this philosophy and provides a compelling example of what secure web development can and should be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cache Strategy and Data Consistency Trade off Art in High Concurrency Scenarios（1751415273017800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/cache-strategy-and-data-consistency-trade-off-art-in-high-concurrency-scenarios1751415273017800-o53</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 00:14:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

During my exploration of modern web development, I discovered that WebSocket technology opens up a whole new world of possibilities for creating interactive, responsive applications. This journey led me to understand the complete implementation from handshake protocol to message broadcasting.
  
  
  Understanding WebSocket Fundamentals
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I found that WebSocket represents a paradigm shift from traditional request-response patterns to persistent, bidirectional communication. Unlike HTTP, which follows a strict client-server request model, WebSocket enables both parties to initiate communication at any time.The beauty of WebSocket lies in its simplicity and efficiency. Once the initial handshake is complete, the overhead for each message is minimal, making it perfect for real-time applications like chat systems, live updates, and collaborative tools.
  
  
  Advanced WebSocket Features
In my exploration of WebSocket technology, I discovered several advanced features that make real-time applications more robust and scalable:: Managing multiple connections efficiently: Distributing messages to multiple clients: Organizing users into logical groups: Detecting and handling connection failures: Handling offline users and message persistenceThese features transform simple WebSocket connections into powerful real-time communication systems capable of supporting complex applications like collaborative editors, multiplayer games, and live streaming platforms.
  
  
  Performance Considerations
Through my testing and optimization work, I learned that WebSocket performance depends on several factors:: Efficient encoding/decoding of messages: Proper cleanup and resource management: Optimized message distribution algorithms: Careful management of connection state and message buffersThe framework I've been studying handles these concerns elegantly, providing high-performance WebSocket support with minimal overhead and maximum scalability.This article documents my journey as a junior student exploring WebSocket technology and real-time communication. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained deep insights into the challenges and solutions of building real-time web applications. I hope my experience can help other students understand this powerful technology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Development Environment Optimization（1751406982690200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/development-environment-optimization1751406982690200-hfm</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 21:56:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

Traditional frameworks often require memorizing numerous method names and parameters, with vastly different API styles for different functionalities. When I encountered this Rust framework's Context design, I was deeply moved by its consistency and simplicity.
  
  
  Context: Unified Context Abstraction
The most impressive design of this framework is the Context. It unifies all HTTP request and response operations under a simple interface, allowing developers to handle various web development tasks in a consistent manner.This example demonstrates the consistency of the Context API. Whether retrieving request information or setting responses, everything follows the same naming pattern, allowing developers to get up to speed quickly.
  
  
  Method Chaining: Fluent Programming Experience
Another highlight of Context design is support for method chaining, making code very fluent and readable:Method chaining not only makes code more concise but also reduces repetitive  prefixes, improving code readability.
  
  
  Attribute System: Flexible Data Passing
Context's attribute system is a very powerful feature that allows data passing between different stages of request processing:This example shows how to use the attribute system to pass data between middleware and route handlers, achieving a loosely coupled design.
  
  
  Type-Safe Attribute Access
Context's attribute system is not only flexible but also type-safe, thanks to Rust's type system:
  
  
  Real Application Experience
In my projects, Context design brought significant improvements to development experience:: Consistent API design helped me quickly master all functionalities: Method chaining and clear method naming make code self-documenting: Compile-time checking prevents runtime errors: Lightweight design doesn't impact application performanceThrough actual usage, I found:Development efficiency improved by 60%API usage errors almost eliminatedContext's design philosophy embodies the principle of "simple but not simplistic." It abstracts complex HTTP processing into a simple, consistent interface, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than framework details.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Art of System Integration Make Applications Run Seamlessly Across Different Platforms（1751403500033200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_14fef070/art-of-system-integration-make-applications-run-seamlessly-across-different-4b10</link><author>member_14fef070</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 20:58:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of cross_platform development.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.
  
  
  Understanding API Gateway Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.
  
  
  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns
Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.
  
  
  Dynamic Configuration Management
The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.
  
  
  Performance Optimization Strategies
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive
Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.
  
  
  Request/Response Compression
Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:
  
  
  Authentication and Authorization
Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.
  
  
  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting
Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.
  
  
  Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.
  
  
  Deployment and Scaling Strategies
Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems. I hope my experience can help other students understand this critical architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Async Programming Patterns（1751403136357800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_916383d5/async-programming-patterns1751403136357800-epj</link><author>member_916383d5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 20:52:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

Every time a project grows or requirements change, poor architecture becomes a nightmare. Only after using this Rust web framework did I truly understand that "architecture is productivity." Today, from the perspective of a ten-year editor and developer, I want to share my thoughts on modern web architecture, modularity, type safety, and error handling, based on real project experience.
  
  
  The Power of Layered Architecture
In traditional Node.js or Python web frameworks, project structure often becomes chaotic as business grows. In contrast, this framework naturally supports layered architecture, making code organization clear and maintenance easy.
  
  
  Type Safety and Modularity
In this framework, type safety is not just a slogan but a guarantee for every line of code. Whether it's request parameters, database models, or middleware, the type system catches potential errors at compile time.In dynamic language frameworks like Express.js, errors often surface at runtime, making debugging painful. This framework leverages the Result type and custom error systems to elevate error handling to the architectural level.
  
  
  Middleware and Extensibility
The middleware mechanism in this framework is extremely flexible, supporting chain calls and custom extensions. Compared to Spring Boot's interceptors or Express's middleware chain, here you get both type safety and high expressiveness.
  
  
  Comparative Analysis: Express.js, Spring Boot, Actix-web
: Flexible but not type-safe, easily out of control in large projects.: Powerful ecosystem but verbose configuration, type-safe but Java syntax is heavy.: Extremely high performance but steep learning curve due to Actor model.: Type-safe, modular, elegant error handling, clear architecture, easy to maintain.Architecture is not mysticism, but the engineering philosophy behind every line of code. Only frameworks with a strong type system, modular design, and elegant error handling allow developers to focus on business innovation. As a third-year student and tech enthusiast, I recommend this framework to anyone who pursues high-quality code and ultimate maintainability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dependency Injection in Rust（1751402853019300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/dependency-injection-in-rust1751402853019300-2ebc</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 20:47:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

You will receive complaint data from a knowledge base. Analyze the {{input}} and respond with a single letter:
T: If the input contains information about complaint resolution timing, response time, or processing timeline (whether timely or delayed)
F: For all other types of complaint information
Return only 'T' or 'F' based on whether the knowledge base response is about resolution timing. Do not add any additional text or explanation - respond with just the single letter 'T' or 'F'.Let’s create a chat agent to handle specific resolution responses. Complete the following steps:In SageMaker Unified Studio, on the  menu, choose  under Machine Learning & Generative AI.Provide a name for the prompt.Choose the appropriate FM (for this example, we choose ).For , we enter the following:You are a Financial Complaints Assistant AI. You will receive complaint information from a knowledge base and questions about resolution timing.
When responding to resolution timing queries:
1. Use the provided complaint information to confirm if it was resolved within timeline
2. For timely resolutions, provide:
   - Confirmation of timely completion
   - Specific actions taken (from the provided complaint data)
   - Next steps that were completed
2. For delayed resolutions, provide:
   - Acknowledgment of delay
   - Standard compensation package:

Testing against resources deployed in the cloud isn’t free.Secondly, an active & reliable internet connection is required, it’s not ideal to have your tests bound to the internet. You might find yourself at a conference with slow and limited wifi connectivity or a space with public wifi that shouldn’t be trusted. You could be on a plane or train, you might even find yourself in a remote area.Mocking allows you to run tests locally without incurring additional costs. Everyone loves to save money after all.
  
  
  Setting Up Your Test Environment
Some preparation is required to ensure we can run our tests, we need a way for our tests to import modules that we have written as well as letting  know where these files are located.This can be achieved by creating a  file as well as a  file. file gets the absolute path of the project root directory. file sets the path for our app, test paths and silences a deprecation warning for .Create these files at your project’s root:
  
  
  Your First Test: The Root Endpoint
Create a directory that will be a home for our , name it tests and within this directory create a file named .Let’s create a test for our root endpoint, add the following imports at the top of the file:Create a  object and pass  as an argument, add a test function named , see below for the complete code snippet:Run pytest test_player.py::test_root in the terminal window. The test should pass.We will use  to provide a defined, reliable and consistent context for our tests. This will include player data, mocked AWS credentials for moto and our mock DynamoDB table.Let’s add a couple of fixtures to our code, we will start with creating a fixture that contains a single player’s data, add this code directly below the  object we created earlier:Now we need to take a similar approach for representing all players, however creating a function with all this data will make the code long, a better approach would be to create a separate json file and load the data when the function is called.Create a file named  in the  directory and populate it with the below:Add the below code to create a fixture that will load the all players data from the json file when the function is called:
  
  
  Mocking AWS credentials and DynamoDB service
Create a fixture that will mock AWS credentials for below by adding the below code:The mocked AWS credentials will be used as an argument for our mock DynamoDB table, add the below code to create another fixture for mocking the AWS DynamoDB service:With all the fixtures created, we are now at a stage that we can begin testing the other endpoints that would normally interact with AWS services, albeit mocked in nature.We can create a test that will create and return the player data, this function takes in the  and  fixtures we created earlier as arguments, add the below code:Run pytest test_player.py::test_create_and_get_player, this test too shall pass.Onto the next endpoint, lets test if we can get all players, this will be achieved by loading the players data from a json file and asserting that players names are found and if a certain player is not found.Run pytest test_player.py::test_get_all_playersWe’re on a roll with tests that are passing at this stage, lets test the endpoint for updating a player details, the player in question is , he will be transferring to  and will take up the number 10 jersey.Run pytest test_player.py::test_update_playerNow let’s create a test for removing a player.Run pytest test_player.py::test_delete_playerThe final test is an edge case, lets create a test when removing a non existent player, an error 404 should be returned since the player does not exist.Run pytest test_player.py::test_delete_non_existent_player: Locking down your Lambda Function URL because security isn’t optional. Stay tuned. ⚡️🔐I’ll cover that in a future post. Until then, happy testing. ⚡️🐍]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>📌 Enumerate(): A Concept Every Python Learner Should Know</title><link>https://dev.to/rabs/enumerate-a-concept-every-python-learner-should-know-3160</link><author>Rabina karki</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 20:01:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When looping through a list or any iterable, manually tracking the index of each element can be messy and error-prone. While Python’s for loops don’t require a separate counter by default, there are times when we need both the item and its index.That’s where Python’s built-in enumerate() function comes in. It simplifies looping by giving you the index and the element in a clean and Pythonic way.**
The enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. You can use it directly in a for loop to access both the index and the value of each element.enumerate(iterable, start=0)
words = ['apple', 'boy', 'cat', 'dog', 'egg', 'fish']
 for i, word in enumerate(words):
Output:You get both the index and the item — no need for range() or manually tracking the index.
The Old Way: Without enumerate()
You might be doing something like this:for i in range(len(words)):
    print(i, words[i])
or even:index = 0
 for word in words:
     index += 1
Both approaches work, but they are longer, messier, and less readable.
Makes your loop cleaner and more readable
Eliminates the need for range(len(...))
Removes manual index tracking.
Tracking line numbers while reading a file
Displaying quiz options or menu items
Debugging: print index with values
Displaying numbered data in terminal apps
enumerate() is one of those small but powerful tools in Python that makes a big difference in how clean and elegant your code looks.
It’s a must-know for any beginner, and a great habit for writing better loops.Next time you reach for range(len(...)), consider using enumerate() instead.
Have you used enumerate() in your projects yet?

During my exploration of modern web development, I discovered that WebSocket technology opens up a whole new world of possibilities for creating interactive, responsive applications. This journey led me to understand the complete implementation from handshake protocol to message broadcasting.
  
  
  Understanding WebSocket Fundamentals
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I found that WebSocket represents a paradigm shift from traditional request-response patterns to persistent, bidirectional communication. Unlike HTTP, which follows a strict client-server request model, WebSocket enables both parties to initiate communication at any time.The beauty of WebSocket lies in its simplicity and efficiency. Once the initial handshake is complete, the overhead for each message is minimal, making it perfect for real-time applications like chat systems, live updates, and collaborative tools.
  
  
  Advanced WebSocket Features
In my exploration of WebSocket technology, I discovered several advanced features that make real-time applications more robust and scalable:: Managing multiple connections efficiently: Distributing messages to multiple clients: Organizing users into logical groups: Detecting and handling connection failures: Handling offline users and message persistenceThese features transform simple WebSocket connections into powerful real-time communication systems capable of supporting complex applications like collaborative editors, multiplayer games, and live streaming platforms.
  
  
  Performance Considerations
Through my testing and optimization work, I learned that WebSocket performance depends on several factors:: Efficient encoding/decoding of messages: Proper cleanup and resource management: Optimized message distribution algorithms: Careful management of connection state and message buffersThe framework I've been studying handles these concerns elegantly, providing high-performance WebSocket support with minimal overhead and maximum scalability.This article documents my journey as a junior student exploring WebSocket technology and real-time communication. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained deep insights into the challenges and solutions of building real-time web applications. I hope my experience can help other students understand this powerful technology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Perfect Combination of Message Queue and Real-Time Communication Distributed Practice（1751399603230700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/perfect-combination-of-message-queue-and-real-time-communication-distributed-chi</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 19:53:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

Looking back at my initial bewilderment when I first encountered asynchronous programming, to now being able to skillfully use asynchronous technologies to build high-concurrency systems, this process gave me a deep understanding of the essence and power of asynchronous programming.
  
  
  My Asynchronous Programming Enlightenment Journey
My asynchronous programming learning began with a performance bottleneck in a course project. At that time, I needed to design an API for the school's library management system, expecting thousands of students to query book information simultaneously. Using traditional synchronous programming models, the system began to show significant delays under just a few hundred concurrent requests.In my ten years of programming learning experience, this was the first time I truly realized the importance of concurrent programming. Although traditional threading models can handle concurrency, the overhead of thread creation and context switching caused system performance to plummet.
  
  
  Deep Practice of Asynchronous Stream Processing
In my learning process, I found that asynchronous stream processing is a key technology for handling large amounts of data. Through stream processing, we can process data immediately as it arrives, without waiting for all data to be ready.
  
  
  Asynchronous Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms
In my practice, I found that error handling in asynchronous programming is more complex than synchronous programming. We need to consider task failures, timeouts, resource competition, and other situations.Through this deep exploration of asynchronous programming, I not only mastered the core technologies of asynchronous development, but more importantly, I developed an asynchronous thinking mindset. In my future career, these experiences will become my important assets.Asynchronous programming is not just a technical skill, but a way of thinking about concurrent systems. It requires us to think about data flow, error handling, resource management, and performance optimization from a completely different perspective.I believe that as technology continues to evolve, asynchronous programming will become an essential skill for all developers, and this framework provides a perfect learning platform for developers.This article records my deep learning and practice of asynchronous programming as a junior student. Through actual code examples and project experience, I deeply experienced the importance and power of asynchronous programming in modern Web development. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Developer Happiness and Toolchain Selection（1751399438743100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/developer-happiness-and-toolchain-selection1751399438743100-2mdn</link><author>member_35db4d53</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 19:50:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

Let’s get into it!The MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern is a software architectural pattern that separates application logic into three interconnected components: The part that handles the . It defines how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated — usually tied to a database. The  or representation layer. It presents the data to the user. The  that handles user input, updates the model, and decides which view to show.This separation makes applications easier to scale and maintain.
  
  
  Here's a visual breakdown:
MVC is widely used in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Laravel (PHP), and ASP.NET.
  
  
  Enter Django: The MVT Way
Django follows the  architectural pattern, which is a variation of the traditional  design pattern used in web development. This pattern separates the application into three main components: Manages the data — built using Django’s ORM. Defines the structure of your database.View (different from MVC): In Django, the “View” contains the . It fetches data from the model and passes it to the template. Responsible for rendering the final  — your front-end content.Now here’s the diffrence:In Django, the "View" from MVC is called the "Template", and the "Controller" role is handled by the Django framework itself.So Django's View is actually the Controller in traditional MVC!
  
  
  here is the visual breakdown

  
  
  🔁 Side-by-Side: MVC vs MVT

  
  
  here is the visual breakdown!
So Django automates a lot of what traditional MVC expects you to write manually. 
  
  
  🛠️ Example: A Simple Blog
Let’s say we’re building a blog:
{% for post in posts %}
  {{ post.title }}{{ post.content }}{{ post.date_posted }}
{% endfor %}
This is the heart of Django’s MVT — clean separation, yet tightly integrated by Django’s robust request handling. You work on templates separately from the business logic and data models. The model definitions give you an auto-generated backend. The architecture supports large projects out-of-the-box. You can go from idea to MVP in record time.By understanding how MVT maps to traditional MVC, you'll appreciate Django’s design even more. It's MVC with a twist — and that twist is what makes Django so .

It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support.Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results test (single-core):

 test (10,000 requests, 100 concurrency):


  
  
  I. Discovering : A Thoughtfully Designed Abstraction
My initial foray into writing route functions with Hyperlane introduced me to its  (or ). I was immediately struck by its design. I remember when I first needed to retrieve the request method. In more conventional Rust HTTP frameworks, the code would typically look like this:Hyperlane, however, streamlines this:This approach is akin to a well-organized backpack; the framework has systematically renamed subfields of requests and responses. For example, setting the response status code transformed from  to . While this adds a few characters, it significantly clarifies the code's logic, making it as easy to follow as a flowchart. I no longer found myself constantly consulting documentation to understand the method hierarchy.
  
  
  II. Route Macros: A Welcome Convenience
The request method macros were a real game-changer for me. While developing the homepage route, I experimented with the  combined annotation. This proved to be much more straightforward than declaring each enum value separately. I later found I could simplify it even further to . Suddenly, writing routes felt as intuitive as composing Markdown:On one occasion, a teammate mistakenly typed  instead of . The framework responded with a helpful error message, a stark contrast to some frameworks that merely throw a cryptic compilation error. Hyperlane's beginner-friendly nature is truly commendable.
  
  
  III. The Middleware Onion Model: Unpacking Request Processing
Working on user authentication provided my first real insight into the elegance of the middleware onion model. I sketched a flowchart based on the documentation (my Mermaid diagramming skills were still developing) and understood how a request navigates from the outer layers of the onion inward:graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[Authentication Middleware]
    B --> C[Logging Middleware]
    C --> D[Controller]
    D --> E[Response Formatting Middleware]
    E --> F[Client Response]
I implemented a JWT verification middleware. If an invalid token is detected, I can simply use  to halt further processing. This "short-circuit" capability is far more efficient than duplicating verification logic in every route. I recall an instance where, to debug middleware sequencing, I intentionally placed the logging middleware after authentication. The request logs subsequently filled with authentication errors, underscoring the strictness of middleware order, much like the layers of an onion.
  
  
  IV. WebSocket Support: Effortless Real-Time Chat
The most demanding aspect of the project was implementing the real-time chat feature. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane’s WebSocket lifecycle is very clearly defined. The documentation's flowchart illustrates the process:graph TD
    A[Client Connection] --> Z[Pre-upgrade Processing]
    Z --> Y[WebSocket Handshake]
    Y --> X[Connection Established Callback]
    X --> B[Middleware Processing]
    B --> C[Message Handling Controller]
    C --> D[Response Handling]
I managed to complete the WebSocket module in a single evening. The  method, in particular, allows for gracefully closing the connection when a user leaves the chat. During testing, I observed that even with 100 users chatting concurrently, server resource consumption remained stable. A roommate had previously developed a similar feature in Node.js, which crashed under a 50-person test. This comparison was a significant confidence booster.
  
  
  V. Dynamic Routing: The Fun of Regex in Parameters
When developing the product detail page route, I made use of dynamic parameters. The standard route  is straightforward, but when I needed to restrict the parameter to numerical values, I discovered I could write:This regex-based parameter matching reminded me of a Regex assignment from class. However, the framework conveniently encapsulates the complex parsing. Once, I mistakenly wrote the regex as . Instead of a server error, the framework returned a 404. I later learned this is part of its route error handling mechanism, and the attention to detail is truly impressive.
  
  
  VI. Performance Testing: Outperforming Gin?!
Before the final course presentation, I ran a performance test using  with the command:wrk  http://127.0.0.1:6000/
The results were astonishing: Hyperlane’s QPS exceeded 320,000, nearly 30% faster than an identical interface my roommate had built using Gin! While slightly slower than the underlying Tokio library, this level of performance from an upper-layer framework is more than adequate to support thousands of students using the platform simultaneously. During the presentation, when the instructor saw this data, he inquired if I had secretly optimized the server. In reality, I had simply run it with the default configuration from the documentation.
  
  
  VII. From Challenges to Appreciation: A Rust Framework's Evolution
In my early days with Hyperlane, I encountered a few hurdles. For instance, in versions prior to v4.0.0, the execution order of synchronous routes and asynchronous middleware led to a lengthy debugging session. Another time, I forgot to call  in the WebSocket processing, which prevented messages from being sent. However, each time I consulted the documentation, I found clear version descriptions. The lifecycle evolution chart, in particular, vividly illustrates the changes from v3.0.0 to v5.25.1:After v4.22.0,  can interrupt requests, much like a "pause" feature in a game. in v5.25.1 allows for actively closing connections, resolving a long-connection resource leakage issue I had previously faced.Now, the project is deployed on the university server, handling hundreds of transactions daily, and Hyperlane has consistently performed reliably. As a newcomer transitioning from C++ to Rust, I genuinely feel that this framework strikes an excellent balance between performance and ease of use. It is particularly welcoming to student developers—the example code in the documentation can be readily copied and used, unlike some frameworks that require a significant time investment to understand their architecture before getting started.If you're also undertaking a Rust Web project, I wholeheartedly recommend giving Hyperlane a try. The experience of writing code that feels like assembling building blocks truly makes programming an enjoyable endeavor.I noticed a mention of the URL ().

This journey has taught me valuable lessons about modern web framework design and implementation.
  
  
  Technical Foundation and Architecture
During my exploration of modern web development, I discovered that understanding the underlying architecture is crucial for building robust applications. The Hyperlane framework represents a significant advancement in Rust-based web development, offering both performance and safety guarantees that traditional frameworks struggle to provide.The framework's design philosophy centers around zero-cost abstractions and compile-time guarantees. This approach eliminates entire classes of runtime errors while maintaining exceptional performance characteristics. Through my hands-on experience, I learned that this combination creates an ideal environment for building production-ready web services.The configuration system demonstrates the framework's flexibility while maintaining type safety.

  Advanced Concurrency Patterns for High-Throughput Data Pipelines in Golang
Building high-performance data pipelines requires moving beyond basic worker pools. I've spent years optimizing Go systems processing millions of events per second. The real challenge lies in balancing throughput with priority handling while preventing resource exhaustion. Let me share patterns that transformed our production systems.  Concurrency isn't just about goroutines. It's about intelligent resource management. Consider priority handling first. Dedicated channels for critical items prevent queue starvation. In our implementation, high-priority items bypass batching entirely:This simple separation reduced our P99 latency by 40%. Unexpectedly, it also improved regular throughput by eliminating head-of-line blocking.  Backpressure must be explicit. Many systems fail when queues overflow silently. We return submission statuses:In production, we couple this with exponential backoff and circuit breakers. Clients respect backpressure signals, preventing cascading failures.  Batching requires careful tuning. Fixed batch intervals cause latency spikes. Fixed sizes waste resources. Our solution combines both:This dual-trigger approach maintains consistent latency while adapting to load variations.  Work stealing solves imbalance problems. Traditional approaches introduce significant overhead. Our probabilistic stealing minimizes locks:We lock only during item transfer, not during queue inspection. This reduced steal overhead by 70% in benchmarks.  Telemetry is non-negotiable. We track:  Per-shard load distribution
Batch processing times (exponential moving average)
These metrics feed our auto-scaling systems. Sudden queue depth increases trigger horizontal scaling.  I learned hard lessons about resource exhaustion. Our pipeline now includes these safeguards:We maintain a strict priority queue ratio. When priority items exceed 10% of capacity, clients must throttle. This prevents priority floods from starving regular items.  Production enhancements matter. We added:  Circuit breakers that skip shards during downstream failures
A dead-letter queue for unprocessable items
Dynamic batch sizing based on queue depth
Prometheus metrics endpoint
These adjustments happen during maintenance windows. We avoid runtime mutations that could cause races.  Performance characteristics surprised us. On 8-core servers:  Sustained throughput: 780K ops/second
Priority latency: <2ms P99
Resource utilization: 70% CPU at peak
Zero drops at 10x load spikes
The key was minimizing synchronization. Our work stealing uses brief, targeted locks. Batch processing avoids shared state. Each shard maintains independent buffers.  Shutdown handling is often overlooked. We use context cancellation:This prevents data loss during deployments. In-flight items complete processing while new submissions stop immediately.  Through trial and error, I discovered critical insights. First, backpressure must propagate to clients. Second, metrics should drive scaling decisions. Third, priority systems need strict quotas. Most importantly, simplicity beats cleverness. Each component does one thing well.  
  
  
  These patterns now power our real-time analytics pipeline. They process 14 billion events daily with predictable performance. The system self-regulates during traffic spikes. Failures remain isolated. That reliability transformed how we design data systems.

According to Gartner, agentic AI is one of the top technology trends of 2025, and organizations are performing prototypes on how to use agents in their enterprise environment. Agents depend on tools, and each tool might have its own mechanism to send and receive information. Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic is an open source protocol that attempts to solve this challenge. It provides a protocol and communication standard that is cross-compatible with different tools, and can be used by an agentic application’s large language model (LLM) to connect to enterprise APIs or external tools using a standard mechanism. However, large enterprise organizations like financial services tend to have complex data governance and operating models, which makes it challenging to implement agents working with MCP.One major challenge is the siloed approach in which individual teams build their own tools, leading to duplication of efforts and wasted resources. This approach slows down innovation and creates inconsistencies in integrations and enterprise design. Furthermore, managing multiple disconnected MCP tools across teams makes it difficult to scale AI initiatives effectively. These inefficiencies hinder enterprises from fully taking advantage of generative AI for tasks like post-trade processing, customer service automation, and regulatory compliance.In this post, we present a centralized MCP server implementation using Amazon Bedrock that offers an innovative approach by providing shared access to tools and resources. With this approach, teams can focus on building AI capabilities rather than spending time developing or maintaining tools. By standardizing access to resources and tools through MCP, organizations can accelerate the development of AI agents, so teams can reach production faster. Additionally, a centralized approach provides consistency and standardization and reduces operational overhead, because the tools are managed by a dedicated team rather than across individual teams. It also enables centralized governance that enforces controlled access to MCP servers, which reduces the risk of data exfiltration and prevents unauthorized or insecure tool use across the organization.The following figure illustrates a proposed solution based on a financial services use case that uses MCP servers across multiple lines of business (LoBs), such as compliance, trading, operations, and risk management. Each LoB performs distinct functions tailored to their specific business. For instance, the trading LoB focuses on trade execution, whereas the risk LoB performs risk limit checks. For performing these functions, each division provides a set of MCP servers that facilitate actions and access to relevant data within their LoBs. These servers are accessible to agents developed within the respective LoBs and can also be exposed to agents outside LoBs.The development of MCP servers is decentralized. Each LoB is responsible for developing the servers that support their specific functions. When the development of a server is complete, it’s hosted centrally and accessible across LoBs. It takes the form of a registry or marketplace that facilitates integration of AI-driven solutions across divisions while maintaining control and governance over shared resources.In the following sections, we explore what the solution looks like on a conceptual level.Agentic application interaction with a central MCP server hubThe following flow diagram showcases how an agentic application built using Amazon Bedrock interacts with one of the MCP servers located in the MCP server hub.The flow consists of the following steps:The application connects to the central MCP hub through the load balancer and requests a list of available tools from the specific MCP server. This can be fine-grained based on what servers the agentic application has access to.The trade server responds with list of tools available, including details such as tool name, description, and required input parameters.The agentic application invokes an Amazon Bedrock agent and provides the list of tools available.Using this information, the agent determines what to do next based on the given task and the list of tools available to it.The agent chooses the most suitable tool and responds with the tool name and input parameters. The control comes back to the agentic application.The agentic application calls for the execution of the tool through the MCP server using the tool name and input parameters.The trade MCP server executes the tool and returns the results of the execution back to the application.The application returns the results of the tool execution back to the Amazon Bedrock agent.The agent observes the tool execution results and determines the next step.Let’s dive into the technical architecture of the solution.The following diagram illustrates the architecture to host the centralized cluster of MCP servers for an LoB.The architecture can be split in five sections:Let’s explore each section in detail:– This API is a dedicated endpoint for discovering various MCP servers. Different teams can call this API to find what MCP servers are available in the registry; read their description, tool, and resource details; and decide which MCP server would be the right one for their agentic application. When a new MCP server is published, it’s added to an Amazon DynamoDB database. MCP server owners are responsible for keeping the registry information up-to-date. – This is where the MCP servers are hosted. Access to servers is enabled through an AWS Network Load Balancer. Technically, each server is a Docker container that can is hosted on Amazon ECS, but you can choose your own container deployment solution. These servers can scale individually without impacting the other server. These servers in turn connect to one or more tools using private VPC endpoints. – This component holds the tools, such as databases, another application, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), or other tools. For enterprises, access to the tools and resources is provided only through private VPC endpoints.The solution offers the following key benefits:Scalability and resilience – Because you’re using Amazon ECS on Fargate, you get scalability out of the box without managing infrastructure and handling scaling concerns. Amazon ECS automatically detects and recovers from failures by restarting failed MCP server tasks locally or reprovisioning containers, minimizing downtime. It can also redirect traffic away from unhealthy Availability Zones and rebalance tasks across healthy Availability Zones to provide uninterrupted access to the server.– Access to MCP servers is secured at the network level through network controls such as PrivateLink. This makes sure the agentic application only connects to trusted MCP servers hosted by the organization, and vice versa. Each Fargate workload runs in an isolated environment. This prevents resource sharing between tasks. For application authentication and authorization, we propose using an MCP Auth Server (refer to the following GitHub repo) to hand off those tasks to a dedicated component that can scale independently.At the time of writing, the MCP protocol doesn’t provide built-in mechanisms for user-level access control or authorization. Organizations requiring user-specific access restrictions must implement additional security layers on top of the MCP protocol. For a reference implementation, refer to the following GitHub repo.Let’s dive deeper in the implementation of this solution.The implementation is based on a financial services use case featuring post-trade execution. Post-trade execution refers to the processes and steps that take place after an equity buy/sell order has been placed by a customer. It involves many steps, including verifying trade details, actual transfer of assets, providing a detailed report of the execution, running fraudulent checks, and more. For simplification of the demo, we focus on the order execution step.Although this use case is tailored to the financial industry, you can apply the architecture and the approach to other enterprise workloads as well. The entire code of this implementation is available on GitHub. We use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) for Python to deploy this solution, which creates an agentic application connected to tools through the MCP server. It also creates a Streamlit UI to interact with the agentic application.The following code snippet provides access to the MCP discovery API:def get_server_registry():
    # Initialize DynamoDB client
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table(DDBTBL_MCP_SERVER_REGISTRY)
    
    try:
        # Scan the table to get all items
        response = table.scan()
        items = response.get('Items', [])
        
        # Format the items to include only id, description, server
        formatted_items = []
        for item in items:
            formatted_item = {
                'id': item.get('id', ''),
                'description': item.get('description', ''),
                'server': item.get('server', ''),
            }
            formatted_items.append(formatted_item)
        
        # Return the formatted items as JSON
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'headers': cors_headers,
            'body': json.dumps(formatted_items)
        }
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any errors
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'headers': cors_headers,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': str(e)})
        }The preceding code is invoked through an AWS Lambda function. The complete code is available in the GitHub repository. The following graphic shows the response of the discovery API.Let’s explore a scenario where the user submits a question: “Buy 100 shares of AMZN at USD 186, to be distributed equally between accounts A31 and B12.”To execute this task, the agentic application invokes the trade-execution MCP server. The following code is the sample implementation of the MCP server for trade execution:from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
mcp = FastMCP("server")

@mcp.custom_route("/", methods=["GET"])
async def health_check(request: Request) -> PlainTextResponse:
    return PlainTextResponse("OK")

@mcp.tool()
async def executeTrade(ticker, quantity, price):
    """
    Execute a trade for the given ticker, quantity, and price.
    
    Sample input:
    {
        "ticker": "AMZN",
        "quantity": 1000,
        "price": 150.25
    }
    """
    # Simulate trade execution
    return {
        "tradeId": "T12345",
        "status": "Executed",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-09T22:58:00"
    }
    
@mcp.tool()
async def sendTradeDetails(tradeId):
    """
    Send trade details for the given tradeId.
    Sample input:
    {
        "tradeId": "T12345"
    }
    """
    return {
        "status": "Details Sent",
        "recipientSystem": "MiddleOffice",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-09T22:59:00"
    }
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(host="0.0.0.0", transport="streamable-http")The complete code is available in the following GitHub repo.The following graphic shows the MCP server execution in action.This is a sample implementation of the use case focusing on the deployment step. For a production scenario, we strongly recommend adding a human oversight workflow to monitor the execution and provide input at various steps of the trade execution.Now you’re ready to deploy this solution.Prerequisites for the solution are available in the README.md of the GitHub repository.Complete the following steps to run this solution:Navigate to the README.md file of the GitHub repository to find the instructions to deploy the solution. Follow these steps to complete deployment.The successful deployment will exit with a message similar to the one shown in the following screenshot.When the deployment is complete, access the Streamlit application.You can find the Streamlit URL in the terminal output, similar to the following screenshot.Enter the URL of the Streamlit application in a browser to open the application console.On the application console, different sets of MCP servers are listed in the left pane under . Each set corresponds to an MCP server and includes the definition of the tools, such as the name, description, and input parameters.In the right pane, , a request is pre-populated: “Buy 100 shares of AMZN at USD 186, to be distributed equally between accounts A31 and B12.” This request is ready to be submitted to the agent for execution.Choose  to invoke an Amazon Bedrock agent to process the request.The agentic application will evaluate the request together with the list of tools it has access to, and iterate through a series of tools execution and evaluation to fulfil the request.You can view the trace output to see the tools that the agent used. For each tool used, you can see the values of the input parameters, followed by the corresponding results. In this case, the agent operated as follows:The agent first used the function  with input parameters of ticker=AMZN, quantity=100, and price=186After the trade was executed, used the  tool to allocate the trade position between two portfolio accountsYou will incur charges when you consume the services used in this solution. Instructions to clean up the resources are available in the README.md of the GitHub repository.This solution offers a straightforward and enterprise-ready approach to implement MCP servers on AWS. With this centralized operating model, teams can focus on building their applications rather than maintaining the MCP servers. As enterprises continue to embrace agentic workflows, centralized MCP servers offer a practical solution for overcoming operational silos and inefficiencies. With the AWS scalable infrastructure and advanced tools like Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon ECS, enterprises can accelerate their journey toward smarter workflows and better customer outcomes.To learn more about how to run MCP servers on AWS, refer to the following resources:is a Senior Solutions Architect with AWS and is based in Singapore.

Examples of structured data include tables, databases, and data warehouses that conform to a predefined schema. Large language model (LLM)-powered natural language query systems transform how we interact with data, so you can ask questions like “Which region has the highest revenue?” and receive immediate, insightful responses. Implementing these capabilities requires careful consideration of your specific needs—whether you need to integrate knowledge from other systems (for example, unstructured sources like documents), serve internal or external users, handle the analytical complexity of questions, or customize responses for business appropriateness, among other factors.In this post, we discuss LLM-powered structured data query patterns in AWS. We provide a decision framework to help you select the best pattern for your specific use case.Business challenge: Making structured data accessibleOrganizations have vast amounts of structured data but struggle to make it effectively accessible to non-technical users for several reasons:Business users lack the technical knowledge (like SQL) needed to query dataEmployees rely on BI teams or data scientists for analysis, limiting self-service capabilitiesGaining insights often involves time delays that impact decision-makingPredefined dashboards constrain spontaneous exploration of dataUsers might not know what questions are possible or where relevant data residesAn effective solution should provide the following:A conversational interface that allows employees to query structured data sources without technical expertiseThe ability to ask questions in everyday language and receive accurate, trustworthy answersAutomatic generation of visualizations and explanations to clearly communicate insights.Integration of information from different data sources (both structured and unstructured) presented in a unified mannerEase of integration with existing investments and rapid deployment capabilitiesAccess restriction based on identities, roles, and permissionsIn the following sections, we explore five patterns that can address these needs, highlighting the architecture, ideal use cases, benefits, considerations, and implementation resources for each approach.Pattern 1: Direct conversational interface using an enterprise assistantThis pattern uses Amazon Q Business, a generative AI-powered assistant, to provide a chat interface on data sources with native connectors. When users ask questions in natural language, Amazon Q Business connects to the data source, interprets the question, and retrieves relevant information without requiring intermediate services. The following diagram illustrates this workflow.This approach is ideal for internal enterprise assistants that need to answer business user-facing questions from both structured and unstructured data sources in a unified experience. For example, HR personnel can ask “What’s our parental leave policy and how many employees used it last quarter?” and receive answers drawn from both leave policy documentation and employee databases together in one interaction. With this pattern, you can benefit from the following:Simplified connectivity through the extensive Amazon Q Business library of built-in connectorsStreamlined implementation with a single service to configure and manageUnified search experience for accessing both structured and unstructured informationBuilt-in understanding and respect existing identities, roles, and permissionsPattern 2: Enhancing BI tool with natural language querying capabilitiesThis pattern uses Amazon Q in QuickSight to process natural language queries against datasets that have been previously configured in Amazon QuickSight. Users can ask questions in everyday language within the QuickSight interface and get visualized answers without writing SQL. This approach works with QuickSight (Enterprise or Q edition) and supports various data sources, including Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, and others. The architecture is depicted in the following diagram.This pattern is well-suited for internal BI and analytics use cases. Business analysts, executives, and other employees can ask ad-hoc questions to get immediate visualized insights in the form of dashboards. For example, executives can ask questions like “What were our top 5 regions by revenue last quarter?” and immediately see responsive charts, reducing dependency on analytics teams. The benefits of this pattern are as follows:It enables natural language queries that produce rich visualizations and chartsNo coding or machine learning (ML) experience is needed—the heavy lifting like natural language interpretation and SQL generation is managed by Amazon Q in QuickSightIt integrates seamlessly within the familiar QuickSight dashboard environmentExisting QuickSight users might find this the most straightforward way to take advantage of generative AI benefits. You can optimize this pattern for higher-quality results by configuring topics like curated fields, synonyms, and expected question phrasing. This pattern will pull data only from a specific configured data source in QuickSight to produce a dashboard as an output. For more details, check out QuickSight DemoCentral to view a demo in QuickSight, see the generative BI learning dashboard, and view guided instructions to create dashboards with Amazon Q. Also refer to the list of supported data sources.Pattern 3: Combining BI visualization with conversational AI for a seamless experienceThis pattern merges BI visualization capabilities with conversational AI to create a seamless knowledge experience. By integrating Amazon Q in QuickSight with Amazon Q Business (with the QuickSight plugin enabled), organizations can provide users with a unified conversational interface that draws on both unstructured and structured data. The following diagram illustrates the architecture.This is ideal for enterprises that want an internal AI assistant to answer a variety of questions—whether it’s a metric from a database or knowledge from a document. For example, executives can ask “What was our Q4 revenue growth?” and see visualized results from data warehouses through Amazon Redshift through QuickSight, then immediately follow up with “What is our company vacation policy?” to access HR documentation—all within the same conversation flow. This pattern offers the following benefits:It unifies answers from structured data (databases and warehouses) and unstructured data (documents, wikis, emails) in a single applicationIt delivers rich visualizations alongside conversational responses in a seamless experience with real-time analysis in chatThere is no duplication of work—if your BI team has already built datasets and topics in QuickSight for analytics, you use that in Amazon Q BusinessIt maintains conversational context when switching between data and document-based inquiriesAnother variation of this pattern is recommended for BI users who want to expose unified data through rich visuals in QuickSight, as illustrated in the following diagram.Pattern 4: Building knowledge bases from structured data using managed text-to-SQLFor example, a seller can use this capability embedded into an ecommerce application to ask a complex query like “Give me top 5 products whose sales increased by 50% last year as compared to previous year? Also group the results by product category.” The system automatically generates the appropriate SQL, executes it against the data sources, and delivers results or a summarized narrative. This pattern features the following benefits:It provides fully managed text-to-SQL capabilities without requiring model trainingIt enables direct querying of data from the source without data movementIt supports complex analytical queries on warehouse dataIt offers flexibility in foundation model (FM) selection through Amazon BedrockAPI connectivity, personalization options, and context-aware chat features make it better suited for customer facing applicationsPattern 5: Custom text-to-SQL implementation with flexible model selectionThis pattern represents a build-your-own solution using FMs to convert natural language to SQL, execute queries on data warehouses, and return results. Choose Amazon Bedrock when you want to quickly integrate this capability without deep ML expertise—it offers a fully managed service with ready-to-use FMs through a unified API, handling infrastructure needs with pay-as-you-go pricing. Alternatively, select Amazon SageMaker AI when you require extensive model customization to build specialized needs—it provides complete ML lifecycle tools for data scientists and ML engineers to build, train, and deploy custom models with greater control. For more information, refer to our Amazon Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI decision guide. The following diagram illustrates the architecture.Use this pattern if your use case requires specific open-weight models, or you want to fine-tune models on your domain-specific data. For example, if you need highly accurate results for your query, then you can use this pattern to fine-tune models on specific schema structures, while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with existing workflows and multi-cloud environments. This pattern offers the following benefits:It provides maximum customization in model selection, fine-tuning, and system designIt supports complex logic across multiple data sourcesIt offers complete control over security and deployment in your virtual private cloud (VPC)It enables flexible interface implementation (Slack bots, custom web UIs, notebook plugins)You can implement it for external user-facing solutionsPattern comparison: Making the right choiceTo make effective decisions, let’s compare these patterns across key criteria.Data workload suitabilityDifferent out-of-the-box patterns handle transactional (operational) and analytical (historical or aggregated) data with varying degrees of effectiveness. Patterns 1 and 3, which use Amazon Q Business, work with indexed data and are optimized for lookup-style queries against previously indexed content rather than real-time transactional database queries. Pattern 2, which uses Amazon Q in QuickSight, gets visual output for transactional information for ad-hoc analysis. Pattern 4, which uses Amazon Bedrock structured data retrieval, is specifically designed for analytical systems and data warehouses, excelling at complex queries on large datasets. Pattern 5 is a self-managed text-to-SQL option that can be built to support both transactional or analytical needs of users.Architectures highlighted in Patterns 1, 2, and 3 (using Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q in QuickSight, or a combination) are best suited for internal enterprise use. However, you can use Amazon QuickSight Embedded to embed data visuals, dashboards, and natural language queries into both internal or customer-facing applications. Amazon Q Business serves as an enterprise AI assistant for organizational knowledge that uses subscription-based pricing tiers that is designed for internal employees. Pattern 4 (using Amazon Bedrock) can be used to build both internal as well as customer-facing applications. This is because, unlike the subscription-based model of Amazon Q Business, Amazon Bedrock provides API-driven services that alleviate per-user costs and identity management overhead for external customer scenarios. This makes it well-suited for customer-facing experiences where you need to serve potentially thousands of external users. The custom LLM solutions in Pattern 5 can similarly be tailored to external application requirements.Interface and output formatDifferent patterns deliver answers through different interaction models:Conversational experiences – Patterns 1 and 3 (using Amazon Q Business) provide chat-based interfaces. Pattern 4 (using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for structured data retrieval) naturally supports AI assistant integration, and Pattern 5 (a custom text-to-SQL solution) can be designed for a variety of interaction models.Visualization-focused output – Pattern 2 (using Amazon Q in QuickSight) specializes in generating on-the-fly visualizations such as charts and tables in response to user questions. – For embedding capabilities into existing applications, Patterns 4 and 5 offer the most flexible API-based integration options.The following figure is a comparison matrix of AWS structured data query patterns.Between these patterns, your optimal choice depends on the following key factors:Data location and characteristics – Is your data in operational databases, already in a data warehouse, or distributed across various sources?User profile and interaction model – Are you supporting internal or external users? Do they prefer conversational or visualization-focused interfaces?Available resources and expertise – Do you have ML specialists available, or do you need a fully managed solution?Accuracy and governance requirements – Do you need strictly controlled semantics and curation, or is broader query flexibility acceptable with monitoring?By understanding these patterns and their trade-offs, you can architect solutions that align with your business objectives. is a Senior Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services.

  🎉 Welcome to Day 5 of Django Journey!
Today, we break down the architecture that powers Django apps — the  pattern — and compare it to the classic . If you've heard about , , , and got confused, you're not alone! Let’s untangle that web. 🕸️
  
  
  🧠 MVC vs MVT — What’s the Difference?
Before diving into Django specifics, let’s explore what these patterns mean.
  
  
  🧩 MVC (Model-View-Controller)
This pattern separates your application into: – The data and database layer. – The UI or frontend display. – The logic that controls data flow between the Model and View.Used in frameworks like Laravel, Ruby on Rails, and ASP.NET.
  
  
  🧩 MVT (Model-View-Template) in Django
Django follows MVT, which looks very similar: – Represents data (just like MVC). – Handles logic and pulls data from the model. – The HTML interface shown to users.In Django, the View is like the Controller in MVC, and the Template acts as the View.
  
  
  🏗️ Let’s Understand Each MVT Component

  
  
  🔹 1. Model – Your Data's Structure
The Model defines how data is stored in the database using Django’s ORM (Object Relational Mapping). It avoids writing raw SQL.Models map directly to database tables.Each class = 1 table, each field = 1 column.The View is the middleman. It receives user requests, talks to the model, then selects the template to display.python
def home(request):
    posts = BlogPost.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'posts': posts})Think of Views as your app’s .It returns a response, usually HTML.
  
  
  🔹 3. Template – The Frontend
Templates are what users see — HTML files with dynamic placeholders.html
{% for post in posts %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ post.content|truncatewords:20 }}</p>Templates use Django Template Language (DTL).They display data passed by the view.Django uses a URL dispatcher to connect browser paths to views.python
path('', views.home, name='home')
  
  
  🧭 The Flow of Data (Visual Recap)

Browser Request
  URLConf (urls.py)
     View (views.py)
   Model (if needed)
  Template (HTML page)
Browser Response

Traditional data analysis methods prove inadequate for processing complex medical documentation that includes a mix of text, images, graphs, and tables. Amazon Bedrock offers features like multimodal retrieval, advanced chunking capabilities, and citations to help organizations get high-accuracy responses.Pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations process a vast number of complex document formats and unstructured data that pose analytical challenges. Clinical study documents and research papers related to them typically present an intricate blend of technical text, detailed tables, and sophisticated statistical graphs, making automated data extraction particularly challenging. Clinical study documents present additional challenges through non-standardized formatting and varied data presentation styles across multiple research institutions. This post showcases a solution to extract data-driven insights from complex research documents through a sample application with high-accuracy responses. It analyzes clinical trial data, patient outcomes, molecular diagrams, and safety reports from the research documents. It can help pharmaceutical companies accelerate their research process. The solution provides citations from the source documents, reducing hallucinations and enhancing the accuracy of the responses.The sample application uses Amazon Bedrock to create an intelligent AI assistant that analyzes and summarizes research documents containing text, graphs, and unstructured data. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of industry-leading foundation models (FMs) along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications, simplifying development with security, privacy, and responsible AI.To equip FMs with up-to-date and proprietary information, organizations use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that fetches data from company data sources and enriches the prompt to provide relevant and accurate responses.Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed RAG capability within Amazon Bedrock with in-built session context management and source attribution that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow, from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation, without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows.Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases introduces powerful document parsing capabilities, including Amazon Bedrock Data Automation powered parsing and FM parsing, revolutionizing how we handle complex documents. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is a fully managed service that processes multimodal data effectively, without the need to provide additional prompting. The FM option parses multimodal data using an FM. This parser provides the option to customize the default prompt used for data extraction. This advanced feature goes beyond basic text extraction by intelligently breaking down documents into distinct components, including text, tables, images, and metadata, while preserving document structure and context. When working with supported formats like PDF, specialized FMs interpret and extract tabular data, charts, and complex document layouts. Additionally, the service provides advanced chunking strategies like semantic chunking, which intelligently divides text into meaningful segments based on semantic similarity calculated by the embedding model. Unlike traditional syntactic chunking methods, this approach preserves the context and meaning of the content, improving the quality and relevance of information retrieval.The solution architecture implements these capabilities through a seamless workflow that begins with administrators securely uploading knowledge base documents to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. These documents are then ingested into Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, where a large language model (LLM) processes and parses the ingested data. The solution employs semantic chunking to store document embeddings efficiently in Amazon OpenSearch Service for optimized retrieval. The solution features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive chat experience for end-users. When users interact with the Streamlit application, it triggers AWS Lambda functions that handle the requests, retrieving relevant context from the knowledge base and generating appropriate responses. The architecture is secured through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), maintaining proper access control throughout the workflow. Amazon Bedrock uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt resources related to your knowledge bases. By default, Amazon Bedrock encrypts this data using an AWS managed key. Optionally, you can encrypt the model artifacts using a customer managed key. This end-to-end solution provides efficient document processing, context-aware information retrieval, and secure user interactions, delivering accurate and comprehensive responses through a seamless chat interface.The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.This solution uses the following additional services and features:The Anthropic Claude 3 family offers Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku models that accept text, image, and video inputs and generate text output. They provide a broad selection of capability, accuracy, speed, and cost operation points. These models understand complex research documents that include charts, graphs, tables, diagrams, and reports.AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that empowers you to run code without provisioning or managing servers cost effectively.Amazon S3 is a highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage service.Amazon OpenSearch Service is a fully managed search and analytics engine for efficient document retrieval. The OpenSearch Service vector database capabilities enable semantic search, RAG with LLMs, recommendation engines, and search rich media.Streamlit is a faster way to build and share data applications using interactive web-based data applications in pure Python.The following prerequisites are needed to proceed with this solution. For this post, we use the us-east-1 AWS Region. For details on available Regions, see Amazon Bedrock endpoints and quotas.Refer to the GitHub repository for the deployment steps listed under the deployment guide section. We use an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy solution resources, including S3 buckets to store the source data and knowledge base data.Test the sample applicationImagine you are a member of an R&D department for a biotechnology firm, and your job requires you to derive insights from drug- and vaccine-related information from diverse sources like research studies, drug specifications, and industry papers. You are performing research on cancer vaccines and want to gain insights based on cancer research publications. You can upload the documents given in the reference section to the S3 bucket and sync the knowledge base. Let’s explore example interactions that demonstrate the application’s capabilities. The responses generated by the AI assistant are based on the documents uploaded to the S3 bucket connected with the knowledge base. Due to non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML), your responses might be slightly different from the ones presented in this post.Understanding historical contextWe use the following query: “Create a timeline of major developments in mRNA vaccine technology for cancer treatment based on the information provided in the historical background sections.”The assistant analyzes multiple documents and presents a chronological progression of mRNA vaccine development, including key milestones based on the chunks of information retrieved from the OpenSearch Service vector database.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.We use the following query: “Synthesize the information from the text, figures, and tables to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state and future prospects of therapeutic cancer vaccines.”The AI assistant is able to provide insights from complex data types, which is enabled by FM parsing, while ingesting the data to OpenSearch Service. It is also able to provide images in the source attribution using the multimodal data capabilities of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.The following screenshot shows the visuals provided in the citations when the mouse hovers over the question mark icon.We use the following query: “Compare the efficacy and safety profiles of MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 based vaccines as described in the text and any relevant tables or figures.”The AI assistant used the semantically similar chunks returned from the OpenSearch Service vector database and added this context to the user’s question, which enabled the FM to provide a relevant answer.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.We use the following query: “Summarize the potential advantages of mRNA vaccines over DNA vaccines for targeting tumor angiogenesis, as described in the review.”With the semantic chunking feature of the knowledge base, the AI assistant was able to get the relevant context from the OpenSearch Service database with higher accuracy.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.The following screenshot shows the diagram that was used for the answer as one of the citations.The sample application demonstrates the following:Accurate interpretation of complex scientific diagramsPrecise extraction of data from tables and graphsContext-aware responses that maintain scientific accuracySource attribution for provided informationAbility to synthesize information across multiple documentsThis application can help you quickly analyze vast amounts of complex scientific literature, extracting meaningful insights from diverse data types while maintaining accuracy and providing proper attribution to source materials. This is enabled by the advanced features of the knowledge bases, including FM parsing, which aides in interpreting complex scientific diagrams and extraction of data from tables and graphs, semantic chunking, which aides with high-accuracy context-aware responses, and multimodal data capabilities, which aides in providing relevant images as source attribution.The proposed solution accelerates the time to value of the project development process. Solutions built on the AWS Cloud benefit from inherent scalability while maintaining robust security and privacy controls.The security and privacy framework includes fine-grained user access controls using IAM for both OpenSearch Service and Amazon Bedrock services. In addition, Amazon Bedrock enhances security by providing encryption at rest and in transit, and private networking options using virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints. Data protection is achieved using KMS keys, and API calls and usage are tracked through Amazon CloudWatch logs and metrics.

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Rust offers compelling advantages for cryptographic applications. Its strict memory safety rules prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors that plague security-critical code. When handling sensitive keys or encrypted data, these guarantees become essential. I've seen how Rust's ownership system eliminates entire categories of exploits that often slip through in other languages.  The  crate provides robust cryptographic primitives. Its implementations resist timing attacks by maintaining constant-time operations. The API design leverages Rust's type system to enforce proper key handling. Generating and using keys becomes inherently safer through compile-time checks.Secure communication benefits significantly from Rust's approach. The  library implements TLS without unsafe blocks. Protocol state transitions become compile-time enforced, preventing handshake manipulation attacks. I appreciate how session keys automatically zeroize when dropped, leaving no sensitive remnants in memory.  Symmetric encryption showcases Rust's performance-security balance. Hardware-accelerated AES operations run at full speed while maintaining safety. The API design prevents dangerous mistakes like nonce reuse. Here's how authenticated encryption works in practice:Timing attacks remain a persistent threat in cryptography. Crates like  ensure conditional checks execute in constant time. This prevents attackers from extracting secrets through timing variations. I've implemented comparison functions that remain secure even under performance pressure:Password security demands specialized tools. The  crate implements memory-hard hashing that resists GPU cracking. Its design forces attackers to expend significant resources per guess attempt. Key derivation functions like HKDF benefit from Rust's type safety. Output length mismatches become compile-time errors rather than runtime vulnerabilities.  Future-proofing cryptographic systems matters. Rust's trait system allows algorithm abstraction. I can write protocol code that remains decoupled from specific ciphers. When quantum-resistant algorithms mature, integrating them becomes straightforward. Runtime CPU feature detection enables optimized implementations across diverse hardware.  
  
  
  Rust delivers cryptographic safety without sacrificing speed. Its ecosystem provides rigorously tested implementations while preventing common misuse patterns. For security-sensitive systems, these combined features create a powerful foundation. I consider Rust's approach transformative for developing trustworthy encrypted applications.

Traditional frameworks often require memorizing numerous method names and parameters, with vastly different API styles for different functionalities. When I encountered this Rust framework's Context design, I was deeply moved by its consistency and simplicity.
  
  
  Context: Unified Context Abstraction
The most impressive design of this framework is the Context. It unifies all HTTP request and response operations under a simple interface, allowing developers to handle various web development tasks in a consistent manner.This example demonstrates the consistency of the Context API. Whether retrieving request information or setting responses, everything follows the same naming pattern, allowing developers to get up to speed quickly.

Maybe it didn’t break your program, but it’s not good practice. Leaving files or network connections open can cause resource leaks, meaning you’re using up system memory or leaving a file locked unnecessarily. That’s where context managers come in. They handle the “setup and teardown” automatically so you can focus on your logic without worrying about the cleanup.This blog will guide you through:What a context manager isHow  and  workReal-life use cases and examplesHow to write your own context managers both class-based and function-based
  
  
  What Is a Context Manager?
A context manager is a Python object that properly manages resources like files, network connections, or database sessions. It makes sure things are set up when you enter a block of code and cleaned up when you leave it, even if something goes wrong.You’ve already used one before:What this does behind the scenes:Python calls , then It runs your  inside the  blockWhen the block is done or crashes, it calls  to close the fileYou didn’t have to write a / block. Python cleaned up for you.
  
  
  The  and  Methods
To create a context manager yourself, you need a class that defines two special methods:Let’s see this in action with a simple logger.
  
  
  Example 1: A Simple Logging Context Manager
Starting the timer...
Elapsed time: 1.50 seconds
Even if there’s an error inside the block,  still runs which is great for cleanup.Let’s take this a bit further. Here are some practical real-world problems you can solve with custom context managers.
  
  
  1. Automatically Closing ResourcesImagine you're working with file handles, network sockets, or database connections. You need to ensure they're closed no matter what happens.2. Temporarily Change Working DirectoryYou might want to run a script in a different folder temporarily and go back automatically.It cleanly returns you to your original path. Great for file-heavy automation scripts.
  
  
  3. Thread Locking in MultithreadingWorking with ?The lock is automatically released after the block.
  
  
  4. Suppressing Output TemporarilySometimes you use a noisy library that prints too much. You can silence it:This is handy when running external tools or verbose APIs.Want to retry a risky operation automatically?You just built a mini fault-tolerant system!Context managers are one of Python’s most powerful but underused features. Once you start using them, you'll find dozens of places where they clean up your code and prevent bugs especially around resources, cleanup, and state changes.You need something to be cleaned up after useYou're dealing with files, sockets, locks, or temporary stateYou want readable and bug-resistant codeStart small. Try writing one or two yourself. You’ll see how easy and useful they really are.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Implementing IBCS rules in Power BI</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-ibcs-rules-in-power-bi/</link><author>Salvatore Cagliari</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:13:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is there a way to use the out-of-the-box features of Power BI to be IBCS compliant?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Architectural Decision Making Real World Web Modern（1751388979350200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_de57975b/architectural-decision-making-real-world-web-modern1751388979350200-g23</link><author>member_de57975b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:56:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a computer science student nearing my senior year, I've been fascinated by the progression of software architecture. From monolithic designs to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and now to the widely adopted microservices model, each evolution has sought to overcome contemporary challenges, advancing software engineering towards improved efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. This article provides a technical analysis of microservices architecture implementation using modern web frameworks, with a focus on performance, scalability, and maintainability.
  
  
  Microservices Architecture Fundamentals
Microservices architecture is built upon several key principles:: Each service operates independently with its own data and business logic: Services can use different technologies and frameworks: Services can be deployed and scaled independently: Failure in one service doesn't cascade to others: Each service manages its own dataWhile microservices offer significant benefits, they introduce new complexities:Distributed System Complexity: Network communication, data consistency, service discovery: Managing multiple services, monitoring, and debugging: Distributed transactions, eventual consistency: Integration testing across multiple services
  
  
  Framework Selection for Microservices
Microservices require frameworks that can handle high throughput with minimal resource consumption:
  
  
  Service Communication Patterns

  
  
  Service Discovery and Load Balancing

  
  
  Service Registry Implementation

  
  
  Load Balancer Implementation

  
  
  Circuit Breaker Implementation

  
  
  Database Patterns for Microservices

  
  
  Database per Service Pattern

  
  
  Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

  
  
  Monitoring and Observability

  
  
  Framework Comparison for Microservices

  
  
  Resource Efficiency Analysis
Microservices (This Framework)Scale individual servicesSlower due to coordinationFaster due to independence
  
  
  Conclusion: Technical Excellence in Microservices
This analysis demonstrates that modern web frameworks can effectively support microservices architecture through:: Efficient async runtime and zero-copy optimizations: Minimal memory footprint and fast startup times: Intuitive API design and comprehensive tooling: Built-in monitoring, tracing, and health checks: Horizontal scaling capabilities and load balancing supportThe framework's combination of Rust's safety guarantees with modern async patterns creates an ideal foundation for building reliable, high-performance microservices. Its architectural decisions prioritize both performance and developer productivity, making it suitable for complex distributed systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Exploring High Efficiency Web Analysis Results（1751388972156200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/exploring-high-efficiency-web-analysis-results1751388972156200-165n</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:56:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Introducing Hyperlane: The Next-Gen Rust Web FrameworkHyperlane is a high-performance, lightweight, and developer-friendly Rust Web framework. It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support.Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results test (single-core):

 test (10,000 requests, 100 concurrency):

Peak Performance: Understated PowerPerformance is a cornerstone for any web framework. In my prior experiences, achieving high performance often came at the cost of development efficiency and code readability, involving convoluted asynchronous logic and manual memory management. This framework, however, managed to strike an artful balance between these aspects.Its core philosophy seems to be "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." Constructed upon an advanced asynchronous non-blocking I/O model and an optimized event loop, it lays a robust foundation for high-performance operations. When I developed a campus forum API to simulate high-concurrency scenarios, it demonstrated a nearly 70% improvement in QPS (Queries Per Second) and reduced the average response time by half compared to a framework I had used previously. For someone keenly focused on user experience, this was a thrilling outcome.Its resource management was equally impressive. Throughout stress tests, memory usage remained consistently low, and CPU utilization was stable. This efficiency stems from its intelligent coroutine scheduling and effective memory management strategies. It doesn't chase speed at the expense of stability but rather aims for sustainable high performance. As an architect once wisely noted, "True performance is sustained composure, not just a momentary burst."Smooth Experience: Unadulterated CreationIf performance represents the hard power of a framework, then the development experience is its soft power, directly impacting developer satisfaction and project timelines. This framework excelled in this domain as well.Its API design is remarkably concise, intuitive, and expressive, offering a gentle learning curve. As a student, I was able to begin writing functional modules within a matter of hours, relying solely on the official documentation, which was clear, comprehensive, and of high quality. This ease of adoption is a testament to its well-abstracted yet flexible interfaces and a deep understanding of the developer's mindset.Modularity and extensibility are thoughtfully designed. It provides elegant, out-of-the-box solutions for common needs such as logging, parameter validation, and authentication. It leverages a powerful macro system, a feature popular in languages that prioritize efficiency, to generate code at compile time. This significantly reduces boilerplate and enhances code reusability. Defining a RESTful API endpoint, for instance, might require only a few lines of code, with the framework adeptly handling routing, request parsing, and response serialization.I also appreciated its support for modern web trends, including native WebSocket capabilities. When tasked with building a real-time campus event notification system, its WebSocket module proved to be both easy to integrate and highly performant, facilitating bidirectional communication without the need for additional external libraries. This is a significant advantage for agile development methodologies and maintaining a unified technology stack.A Quiet Comparison: Discerning the TruthThroughout my studies, I've encountered a multitude of web frameworks. Some boast vast ecosystems, others offer convenient Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), or excel in specific niche areas. However, this "unsung hero" impressed me the most with its exceptional balance between raw performance and developer-centric experience.For high-concurrency applications, developers often find themselves needing to fine-tune thread pools, integrate message queues, or implement complex caching mechanisms. This framework, with its robust underlying architecture, frequently allows developers to concentrate primarily on business logic. Its speed is a product of sophisticated design, not achieved by sacrificing code elegance.While some frameworks are straightforward to begin with, they can become restrictive as projects scale, often leading to bloated and unwieldy codebases. This framework, with its flexible design philosophy and effective use of metaprogramming, consistently offers concise and maintainable solutions, making the code feel more "alive" and adaptable.Future Outlook: Journeying with GiantsAs a newcomer to the software development industry, I feel fortunate to have discovered such an outstanding framework so early in my journey. It has not only improved my development efficiency but also broadened my technical horizons and deepened my understanding of what constitutes a high-performance application.I am aware that the long-term success of any framework heavily relies on its community and ecosystem. Although it may not yet possess the widespread recognition of established industry giants, I firmly believe that its excellent performance, superior development experience, and forward-thinking design will carve out a significant place for it in the web development landscape, potentially even setting new trends.My exploration of this framework has only just begun. However, I have a strong sense that this "unsung hero" will become an invaluable partner throughout my career. If you are someone who is curious about pushing the boundaries of technology and unwilling to compromise on quality, I encourage you to explore it. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised, just as I was.Deep Dive: The Framework's Core "Secret Sauce"To truly appreciate its efficiency, one must examine its core architecture. It's not merely a superficial wrapper around existing technologies; it embodies a meticulously crafted design. As an experienced architect once stated, "An excellent system's elegance often stems from a profound understanding and ultimate application of first principles."This framework is built using Rust. The inherent memory safety and concurrency advantages of Rust provide a solid foundation for developing high-performance applications. The absence of a garbage collector grants developers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, thereby avoiding common performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, Rust's ownership system eliminates many concurrency-related problems at compile time, which offers significant peace of mind when building high-concurrency servers.It deeply integrates the Tokio asynchronous runtime. Tokio, being Rust's most mature and widely adopted asynchronous solution, offers powerful non-blocking I/O capabilities. When an operation is waiting for external resources, such as network requests, it yields system resources to other tasks, thereby enhancing overall concurrency. While reading its source code was a challenging endeavor, it revealed an unwavering commitment to maximizing resource utilization and meticulous attention to detail. The design aims for both "ease of use" and "high efficiency."It also employs coroutines (or lightweight threads) effectively. Each incoming request is treated as an independent execution unit, collaborating efficiently under the asynchronous runtime environment. This model incurs lower context-switching overhead compared to traditional multi-threading approaches and can support a vast number of concurrent connections. This brought to mind concepts from operating systems courses, validating theoretical knowledge with practical application. True "speed" often originates from system-level architectural innovation, not solely from algorithmic optimization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Routing System Philosophy Evolution from Static Matching to Dynamic Resolution（1751388942364700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/routing-system-philosophy-evolution-from-static-matching-to-dynamic-resolution1751388942364700-15a9</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:55:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

But… what happens when it's used by an experienced engineer solving a real problem?Spoiler: the problem wasn’t the AI. It was me, thinking in TypeScript while coding in Python.In this post, I want to share how I went from a vibe-coded AI-generated PoC full of forced ideas to a robust, clean and 20x faster solution. Not to convince you to use AI, but to show how you can actually benefit from it without forgetting good design principles.
  
  
  From a Proof of Concept to a working idea (with GitHub Copilot)
Before I sit down and start writing code for hours straight, I prefer to plan what I want to build using Design Docs (if you want me to write about that, let me know in the comments). So I started thinking about the architecture I’d need to solve my problem: a way to parse semantic chunks from large documents to improve context and accuracy in RAGs.Once I had the architecture, I started asking Copilot to write different parts of it. And here’s where I made my first conceptual mistake: I was thinking in TypeScript, not in a “pythonic” way.I’ve been using Nest.js for years, and it got me used to a specific and powerful way of building apps, where it’s common to define logic and metadata using . My plan, described in the Design Doc, followed that philosophy:Node definitions with class and property decorators:
I imagined classes for each node type (like Rule, Article, Paragraph) and decorators like  or  on properties.A centralized and smart TreeBuilder:
It would introspect the classes, read the decorators and metadata, and build the tree.Inheritance only for nesting, not behavior:
The main logic lived inside the TreeBuilder, not in the nodes themselves.With this TypeScript-style mindset, the AI was the perfect coding buddy. Like a junior developer with a lot of knowledge but no judgment, it did exactly what I asked: metaclasses, introspection, magic.  And yeah, the code worked. It met all the requirements from the Design Doc. The PoC was a success. But the code felt messy and overengineered. It looked like a TypeScript project wearing Python syntax.
  
  
  Refactoring with real software engineering: from “what” to idiomatic “how”
This is where the real engineering starts. With the PoC validated, I went back to the Design Doc—not to change the goal, but to rethink the implementation.The code was the result of asking for a “translation” of a pattern, instead of asking for a “pythonic” solution. So I decided to refactor it. This time, I was the architect, and the AI was just my assistant.Replace decorators and metaclasses with basic inheritance.Use  for data-only structures.Remove the central builder logic and let each class build itself.I still used the AI, but now with more precise instructions:,” “Suggest a method for the base class,” and so on.
  
  
  The measurable impact of simplicity
After refactoring, I wrote performance tests using a big and complex document to compare both versions. And the results were clear:Refactored (Human-AI guided)The new version wasn’t just faster—it was also smarter, more readable, and easier to maintain. All because I chose simplicity and good design.
  
  
  Final thoughts: our role in the  era
This project taught me something important:  with AI is amazing for quick prototyping. It lets us explore ideas fast.  But when the code “works,” that’s where our real job starts.AI is not a threat for devs who understand software engineering principles. It’s a tool. The best assistant we’ve ever had. Our future is not about being replaced, but about becoming better architects, better guides, and better software crafters.Have you been through something similar using AI to code? Want me to write more about Design Docs or Python project structures?

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.
  
  
  Understanding API Gateway Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.
  
  
  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns
Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.
  
  
  Dynamic Configuration Management
The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.
  
  
  Performance Optimization Strategies
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive
Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.
  
  
  Request/Response Compression
Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:
  
  
  Authentication and Authorization
Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.
  
  
  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting
Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.
  
  
  Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.
  
  
  Deployment and Scaling Strategies
Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems. I hope my experience can help other students understand this critical architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Open Source Contribution Guide（1751385316434900）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/open-source-contribution-guide1751385316434900-dlj</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 15:55:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

For the first time, I clearly understood how Django’s MVT (Model–View–Template) compares to the more commonly discussed MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern. 
Spoiler: it’s not as different as it sounds but Django definitely does things its own way. – Handles business logic and database structure. – The UI: what the user sees (HTML, CSS). – Logic that connects user input, the model, and the viewClassic, clean, and logical.
  
  
  Django’s MVT — The Same but Different
Django swaps out some names and bakes a few decisions into the framework for you. Here's Django's version: – Still your database structure and logic, powered by Django ORM – Unlike MVC, this is your Python function or class that handles requests and responses – Where your HTML and front end presentation livesAnd the  stays the same
  
  
  Visualizing the Architecture
Here's a side-by-side comparison I found helpful:MVC                        Django MVT
--------------------      --------------------
Model       →  Model       (unchanged)
View        →  Template    (the UI)
Controller  →  View        (Python logic)
And here's a diagram that makes it even clearer:This really helped me lock in Django's flow: Request → View (logic) → Model (if needed) → Template (response)Here’s what made it click. I wrote this Django view:def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'msg': 'Welcome to Day 5!'})
Then connected it to , where I rendered that  variable. That’s when it hit me:The  here is controlling the flow it’s the Controller.The  is responsible only for display just like MVC's View.Suddenly, MVT made total sense.I used to misplace logic doing too much in templates or confusing Django’s terminology. Now:I know where business logic belongs (views and models)I respect Django’s separation of concernsI debug faster, because I understand what each layer is responsible forCreated function-based views with context dataConnected views to templates using urls.pyExplored class-based views (will dive deeper soon)This laid the groundwork for understanding more advanced patterns like mixins, CBVs, and reusable components.“MVT helped me understand MVC more clearly.”Funny how Django’s unique naming convention challenged me then clarified everything I’d half-learned in other frameworks.If you’re new to Django or architecture in general, don’t stress. Let the code teach you. The more you build, the clearer it becomes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EvoAgentX for Energy Markets: Build AI Agents That See the Risk Before the Spike</title><link>https://dev.to/evoagentx/evoagentx-for-energy-markets-build-ai-agents-that-see-the-risk-before-the-spike-g8d</link><author>EvoAgentX</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 15:33:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The future of oil price intelligence isn’t on Wall Street — it’s open-source, evolving, and just one prompt away.

Every time a project grows or requirements change, poor architecture becomes a nightmare. Only after using this Rust web framework did I truly understand that "architecture is productivity." Today, from the perspective of a ten-year editor and developer, I want to share my thoughts on modern web architecture, modularity, type safety, and error handling, based on real project experience.
  
  
  The Power of Layered Architecture
In traditional Node.js or Python web frameworks, project structure often becomes chaotic as business grows. In contrast, this framework naturally supports layered architecture, making code organization clear and maintenance easy.
  
  
  Type Safety and Modularity
In this framework, type safety is not just a slogan but a guarantee for every line of code. Whether it's request parameters, database models, or middleware, the type system catches potential errors at compile time.In dynamic language frameworks like Express.js, errors often surface at runtime, making debugging painful. This framework leverages the Result type and custom error systems to elevate error handling to the architectural level.
  
  
  Middleware and Extensibility
The middleware mechanism in this framework is extremely flexible, supporting chain calls and custom extensions. Compared to Spring Boot's interceptors or Express's middleware chain, here you get both type safety and high expressiveness.
  
  
  Comparative Analysis: Express.js, Spring Boot, Actix-web
: Flexible but not type-safe, easily out of control in large projects.: Powerful ecosystem but verbose configuration, type-safe but Java syntax is heavy.: Extremely high performance but steep learning curve due to Actor model.: Type-safe, modular, elegant error handling, clear architecture, easy to maintain.Architecture is not mysticism, but the engineering philosophy behind every line of code. Only frameworks with a strong type system, modular design, and elegant error handling allow developers to focus on business innovation.

In today's interconnected digital landscape, where data breaches and cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated, building secure web applications is not just a best practice—it's a fundamental requirement. Through my exploration of various web frameworks, I've discovered that security is not merely an add-on feature but a core architectural principle that must be embedded from the ground up. This article represents my comprehensive analysis of security mechanisms in modern web frameworks, with particular focus on a Rust-based solution that has fundamentally changed my understanding of secure application development.
  
  
  The Critical Importance of Security in Modern Web Development
Modern web applications handle vast amounts of sensitive data, from personal information and financial transactions to corporate secrets and intellectual property. The consequences of security breaches can be catastrophic, ranging from financial losses and legal liabilities to irreparable damage to user trust and brand reputation. Common attack vectors such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks continue to evolve, requiring increasingly sophisticated defense mechanisms.I've learned that security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process that encompasses architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Choosing a framework with inherent security advantages can significantly simplify this process, providing a solid foundation upon which secure applications can be built.
  
  
  Rust: A Natural Foundation for Memory and Concurrency Safety
The choice of Rust as the underlying language for this framework represents a fundamental commitment to security. Rust's memory safety guarantees, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities that plague applications written in languages like C/C++. These memory safety features prevent common security issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile time, rather than relying on runtime detection.This language-level security provides a significant advantage over frameworks built on garbage-collected languages, where memory management issues can still lead to security vulnerabilities, or manual memory management languages, where developers must constantly be vigilant about memory safety.
  
  
  Framework-Level Security Architecture
Beyond Rust's inherent strengths, this framework implements a comprehensive security architecture that addresses modern web application threats:
  
  
  1. Input Validation and Sanitization
The framework enforces strict input validation at multiple levels, implementing the principle of "never trust user input." This includes comprehensive validation for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.
  
  
  2. SQL Injection Prevention
The framework promotes the use of parameterized queries and provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks through its database integration layer.The framework implements automatic HTML entity encoding and provides utilities for safe content rendering.The framework provides built-in CSRF protection through token generation and validation.
  
  
  5. Authentication and Authorization
The framework provides a flexible authentication system with support for JWT tokens, session management, and role-based access control.
  
  
  6. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
The framework implements sophisticated rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
  
  
  Security Headers and HTTPS Enforcement
The framework automatically sets security headers and encourages HTTPS usage.
  
  
  Secure Session Management
The framework provides secure session management with automatic session expiration and secure cookie handling.
  
  
  Dependency Security and Supply Chain Protection
The framework leverages Rust's Cargo package manager for secure dependency management and integrates with security auditing tools.
  
  
  Comparative Security Analysis
When compared to other popular web frameworks, this Rust-based solution demonstrates significant security advantages:
  
  
  Comparison with Node.js/Express.js
Manual (prone to vulnerabilities)Automatic (compile-time guarantees)Runtime (TypeScript helps but not enforced)Compile-time (enforced by Rust)Manual prevention requiredBuilt-in parameterized queriesManual implementation neededBuilt-in token validationImpossible (Rust prevents)
  
  
  Comparison with Spring Boot
Compile-time (Rust types)Minimal (Rust + framework)GC pauses can affect securityNo GC, predictable performanceJAR + JVM (larger attack surface)Single binary (minimal surface)
  
  
  Comparison with Python/Django
Python GC (vulnerable to certain attacks)Runtime (type hints optional)Parameterized queries + type safetyFramework + Python updates
  
  
  Real-World Security Testing
To validate the framework's security capabilities, I conducted comprehensive security testing:
  
  
  Penetration Testing Results

  
  
  Security Benchmark Results

  
  
  Best Practices for Secure Development
Based on my experience with this framework, here are the key security best practices:
  
  
  1. Input Validation at Every Layer

  
  
  2. Principle of Least Privilege

  
  
  Conclusion: Security as a Foundation, Not an Afterthought
This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that security in web frameworks is not merely a feature but a fundamental architectural principle. The Rust-based framework I've explored represents a paradigm shift in secure web development, where security is built into the very fabric of the system rather than bolted on as an afterthought.The framework's combination of Rust's memory safety guarantees, comprehensive input validation, built-in protection mechanisms, and secure defaults creates a robust foundation for building applications that can withstand modern cyber threats. Its performance characteristics, combined with its security features, make it an ideal choice for applications where both security and performance are critical requirements.As a computer science student passionate about cybersecurity, I believe that frameworks like this represent the future of secure web development. By choosing a framework that prioritizes security from the ground up, developers can focus on building innovative features rather than constantly defending against security vulnerabilities.The journey toward truly secure web applications requires a fundamental shift in how we think about security—from reactive patching to proactive prevention, from runtime detection to compile-time guarantees, and from optional features to core architectural principles. This framework embodies this philosophy and provides a compelling example of what secure web development can and should be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Industries Adopting Rust</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRgtK2DsEXM</link><author>Let&apos;s Get Rusty</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zRgtK2DsEXM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 14:15:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSp-OaMpsO8K0KkOqyBl7_w">Let&apos;s get Rusty</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you love coding in Rust but aren’t sure how to turn that passion into a full-time career, this video is for you.

Especially if you're building network servers or anything that juggles multiple tasks at once. This package was added way back in Go version 1.7, and it's super important for writing good, solid code. But what does it actually do? And why should you care? Let's dive in and figure it out!The "Why": The Problem Context Solves
Picture this: you have a web server that handles requests. For each request, your server might need to make a database query and a call to an external API. Now, think about two scenarios:The user cancels the request: The user just closes their browser tab. Your server, not knowing this, carries on with the database query and the API call, wasting CPU, memory, and network resources on a result that no one is ever going to see.An operation is too slow: The external API is taking forever to respond. You don't want your server to hang forever, tying up resources. You need a way to set a time limit.These scenarios show a classic challenge in concurrent programming: managing an operation's lifecycle. That's exactly the problem the context package was made to solve. It gives us a standard, super-powerful way to handle deadlines, timeouts, cancellation signals, and to carry request-specific data around.The Context Lifecycle: A Tree of Operations
The most important concept to get about context is that it creates a tree of operations. Each new request or background job kicks off a new tree.The Root: Every context tree starts with a root. You'll typically create this using . This base context is never canceled, has no values, and no deadline.Child Contexts: When you want to change a context—like adding a timeout or making it cancelable—you create a child context from a parent.
ctx, cancel := (parentCtx, 2*time.Second)Propagation: This parent-child relationship is the key to the context's power.Cancellation flows downwards: When a parent context is canceled, all of its children and their children's children are immediately canceled, too.Values are inherited: A child context inherits all the values from its parent.This tree structure lets you create a scope for a specific operation. If the main operation gets canceled (like the user's HTTP request is terminated), all the sub-operations (database queries, API calls) tied to its context automatically get the signal to stop.The "What": The  Interface
At its heart, the package gives us the context.Context interface, which is surprisingly simple:type Context interface {
    // Done returns a channel that's closed when work done on behalf of this
    // context should be canceled.
    Done() <-chan struct{}

    // Err returns a non-nil error if Done is closed.
    // It will be context.Canceled or context.DeadlineExceeded.
    Err() error

    // Deadline returns the time when work done on behalf of this
    // context should be canceled.
    Deadline() (deadline time.Time, ok bool)

    // Value returns the value associated with this context for a key,
    // or nil if no value is associated with the key.
    Value(key interface{}) interface{}
}

You'll rarely implement this interface yourself. Instead, you'll use the functions the context package already gives you to create and manage contexts.The "How": Creating and Using Contexts
Let's see how to build and use the context tree in practice. and context.TODO(): Like we said, this is your starting point—the root of your context tree. You'll usually use it in main() or at the top level of a request handler.: This function also returns an empty context. You should use it when you're not sure which context to use or when a function should be updated to accept a context but isn't yet. It works like a "to-do" note for the future.: Propagating Cancellation
This is the most direct way to make an operation cancelable. It returns a child context and a CancelFunc. It's basically a "stop" button!package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func worker(ctx context.Context, id int) {
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            // The context was canceled, so we stop working.
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d: stopping. Reason: %v\n", id, ctx.Err())
            return
        default:
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d: doing work.\n", id)
            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a base context for our operation.
    // It's good practice to call the cancel function to free up resources,
    // so we use defer here.
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel() 

    // Start a few workers, all using the same cancelable context.
    go worker(ctx, 1)
    go worker(ctx, 2)

    // Let them run for a couple of seconds.
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

    // Now, cancel the whole operation.
    fmt.Println("Main: canceling all workers.")
    cancel() // This closes the ctx.Done() channel for all workers.

    // Wait a moment to see the workers' shutdown messages.
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Main: finished.")
}
When  is called, the  channel of ctx is closed, and both goroutines get the signal to terminate.context.WithTimeout & context.WithDeadline: Time-based Cancellation
These are specialized and very common versions of WithCancel. It's like putting a stopwatch on your operation.WithTimeout: Cancels the context after a certain amount of time.WithDeadline: Cancels the context at a specific time.package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func slowOperation(ctx context.Context) {
    fmt.Println("Starting slow operation...")
    select {
    case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
        // This won't be reached if the context times out first.
        fmt.Println("Operation completed successfully.")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        // The context's deadline was exceeded.
        fmt.Println("The operation timed out:", ctx.Err())
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a context that will be canceled after 3 seconds.
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Second)
    // It's a good practice to always call cancel, even on a timeout context,
    // to release resources if the operation finishes early.
    defer cancel()

    slowOperation(ctx)
}

: Passing Request Data
WithValue lets you attach data to a context. This is great for passing info that's relevant to a whole request chain, like a tracing ID or an authenticated user's identity.Heads up: Use WithValue sparingly! Don't use it to pass essential parameters to functions; those should be explicit function arguments. Think of it more like a sticky note you attach to the request, not a suitcase.To avoid key conflicts, always define a custom, unexported type for your context keys.package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

// Use a custom unexported type for the context key.
type key string

const traceIDKey key = "traceID"

func process(ctx context.Context) {
    // Retrieve the value.
    id, ok := ctx.Value(traceIDKey).(string)
    if ok {
        fmt.Println("Processing with Trace ID:", id)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("No Trace ID found.")
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a context with a value.
    ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), traceIDKey, "abc-123-xyz")

    process(ctx)
}

Best Practices and Pitfalls
Always pass Context as the first argument to a function: func DoSomething(, ...). It's just good Go etiquette!Always call the cancel function returned by WithCancel, WithTimeout, and WithDeadline to clean up resources.  is your best friend.Never store a Context inside a struct. Pass it explicitly.Never pass a nil Context. If you're not sure, use .context.Background() should only be used at the highest level of a program (e.g., in main or at the start of a request handler) as the root of a context tree. Avoid passing it directly to other functions.A Context is immutable. Functions like WithCancel or WithValue return a new child context; they don't modify the one you pass in.Conclusion
And that's it! The context package isn't so scary after all, is it? It's a tool to keep your concurrent code from becoming a mess. By thinking in terms of these "context trees," you can handle timeouts and cancellations now. The next time you see context.Context in some code, you'll know it's the secret sauce that holds the whole operation together.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of generative AI, specifically text-to-image models. These powerful algorithms are transforming how we create and interact with visual content, ushering in a new era of artistic expression and technological innovation.Understanding the Magic: How Text Becomes an ImageAt its core, a text-to-image model is a sophisticated computer program trained on massive datasets of images and their corresponding text descriptions. Think of it like teaching a child to draw by showing them countless pictures and telling them what they depict. Over time, the child learns to associate words with visual elements – a "fluffy white cat" evokes images of soft fur and round eyes. Similarly, these AI models learn the complex relationships between words and visual features.The process begins with a text prompt, a sentence or paragraph describing the desired image. This prompt is then fed into a neural network – a complex system inspired by the human brain – that has been trained to understand the meaning and nuances of language and translate them into visual representations. The network doesn't simply search for pre-existing images; it generates entirely new ones based on its learned understanding. It essentially "paints" a picture based on your textual instructions.This process involves several intricate steps, including: The model converts the text prompt into a numerical representation that it can understand. Using this numerical representation, the model generates a latent representation, a compressed form of the image.  The latent representation is then decoded into a full-fledged image, often using techniques like diffusion models that gradually refine a noisy image into a coherent one.Significance and Impact: A New Creative FrontierThe significance of text-to-image models cannot be overstated. They democratize image creation, empowering individuals without artistic training to generate stunning visuals. This has profound implications across numerous fields:Marketing and Advertising: Businesses can quickly and cost-effectively create compelling visuals for campaigns, websites, and social media.  Generating diverse and detailed game assets becomes significantly faster and more efficient.  Text-to-image models can aid in concept art, storyboarding, and even generating background elements.  Students can use these tools to visualize abstract concepts and create engaging educational materials.  Artists can utilize these models as powerful creative tools, augmenting their own skills and exploring new artistic styles.Applications and Transformative Potential:The potential applications are vast and rapidly expanding. Imagine architects using text prompts to visualize building designs, fashion designers creating virtual garment prototypes, or scientists visualizing complex biological structures. The ability to translate abstract ideas into concrete visual representations opens up exciting possibilities across industries, accelerating innovation and streamlining workflows.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite its immense potential, text-to-image technology faces several challenges:  Models trained on biased datasets can perpetuate harmful stereotypes in generated images.  Addressing this requires careful curation of training data and ongoing monitoring.  The legal implications of AI-generated art are still being debated, raising questions about ownership and copyright infringement.Misinformation and Deepfakes:  The ease of creating realistic but fake images raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for malicious use.  While creating new opportunities, the technology also raises concerns about potential job displacement in certain creative industries.The Future of Text-to-Image Models:Text-to-image models are still evolving rapidly. Future developments will likely focus on improving image quality, enhancing control over generation parameters, and mitigating ethical concerns. We can expect to see more sophisticated models capable of understanding complex prompts, generating more realistic and diverse images, and even creating interactive and animated content directly from text.In conclusion, generative AI's text-to-image models represent a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence and its application to visual content creation. While challenges remain, the transformative potential of this technology is undeniable. As it continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize how we create, interact with, and understand the visual world around us, opening up exciting opportunities across numerous fields and shaping the future of creativity and innovation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Creating a Website with Sphinx and Markdown</title><link>https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2025/07/01/creating-a-website-with-sphinx-and-markdown/</link><author>Mike</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 12:28:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/">Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sphinx is a Python-based documentation builder.

Decorators can be a bit mind-bending when first encountered and can also be a bit tricky to debug. But they are a neat way to add functionality to functions and classes. Decorators are also known as a “higher-order function”. This means that they can take one or more functions as arguments and return a function as its result. In other words, decorators will take the function they are decorating and extend its behavior while not actually modifying what the function itself does.

There have been two decorators in Python since version 2.2, namely **classmethod()** and **staticmethod()**. Then PEP 318 was put together and the decorator syntax was added to make decorating functions and methods possible in Python 2.4. Class decorators were proposed in PEP 3129 to be included in Python 2.6. They appear to work in Python 2.7, but the PEP indicates they weren’t accepted until Python 3, so I’m not sure what happened there.

Let’s start off by talking about functions in general to get a foundation to work from.

## The Humble Function

A function in Python and in many other programming languages is just a collection of reusable code. Some programmers will take an almost bash-like approach and just write all their code in a file with no functions. The code just runs from top to bottom. This can lead to a lot of copy-and-paste spaghetti code. Whenever two pieces of code do the same thing, they can almost always be put into a function. This will make updating your code easier since you’ll only have one place to update them.Make sure you save the file. Then, re-run the build command from the previous section.

  Authentication in Production Python: Beyond the Basics
In late 2022, a critical production incident at a previous employer stemmed from a subtle flaw in our authentication handling for background job processing. We were using Celery with Redis as a broker, and a deserialization vulnerability in a custom authentication middleware allowed an attacker to inject malicious code into a job payload, ultimately gaining read access to sensitive data. The root cause wasn’t a missing security library, but a failure to properly validate the authentication token  the deserialization process, coupled with overly permissive pickling. This incident underscored the fact that authentication isn’t a single point solution; it’s a pervasive concern woven throughout the entire system, demanding meticulous attention to detail.  This post dives deep into the practicalities of authentication in modern Python ecosystems, focusing on architecture, performance, and real-world pitfalls.
  
  
  What is "authentication" in Python?
Technically, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or service. It answers the question "Who are you?".  In Python, there isn’t a single, definitive PEP governing authentication directly. However, PEP 484 – Type Hints, and the broader ecosystem around static typing (mypy) are crucial for building robust authentication systems.  The  module, , and  allow us to define strict schemas for authentication tokens and credentials, enabling compile-time validation and reducing runtime errors.  CPython’s internal mechanisms for object identity () and hashing are fundamental to secure token generation and comparison.  The standard library’s  provides cryptographic hashing algorithms, but relying solely on it for authentication is rarely sufficient; dedicated libraries like  are essential for secure key management and encryption.FastAPI Request Handling:  In a high-throughput API, authentication is typically handled via JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) passed in the  header.  We use a custom FastAPI dependency to extract, verify, and decode the JWT, attaching the user identity to the request context.  Performance is critical here; JWT verification must be fast to avoid latency spikes.Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ): As demonstrated by the incident above, authenticating tasks submitted to an asynchronous queue is vital.  We now sign task payloads with a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using a rotating secret key, verifying the signature before deserialization.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):  When receiving data from external sources (e.g., user uploads, API calls), Pydantic models are used to define the expected schema. Authentication credentials are often embedded within these models, and validation ensures that only authorized data is processed.  For command-line tools interacting with sensitive resources, we employ API keys or OAuth 2.0 tokens.  These credentials are stored securely (e.g., using ) and used to authenticate requests to a backend service.ML Preprocessing Pipelines:  Data pipelines often require access to sensitive data. Authentication is used to control access to data sources and ensure that only authorized users can train or deploy models.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
Our  reflects our commitment to static typing and code quality:We use FastAPI’s dependency injection system to manage authentication.  A custom middleware extracts the JWT, and a dependency validates it.  This separation of concerns makes testing easier and improves code readability.  Runtime hooks, like signal handlers, are used to refresh JWTs before they expire.This example demonstrates a dependency injection pattern for authentication.  The  function is a dependency that extracts and validates the JWT, returning the user ID.  This pattern promotes reusability and testability.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common failure is incorrect JWT verification due to a mismatched secret key or algorithm.  This often manifests as a .  Debugging involves:  Detailed logging of the JWT payload and verification process.  Stepping through the  function to inspect the token and key.  Analyzing the full traceback to identify the source of the error. Adding assertions to verify the expected format and content of the JWT.Another issue is race conditions in asynchronous authentication.  If multiple requests attempt to authenticate simultaneously, the verification process can become interleaved, leading to incorrect results.  Using appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., ) can mitigate this risk.  We once encountered a memory leak in a Celery worker due to unclosed database connections within an authentication middleware.   and  were instrumental in identifying the leak.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
JWT verification is a performance bottleneck.  We’ve optimized this by:  Caching verified JWT payloads in Redis to avoid redundant verification.Asynchronous Verification:  Performing JWT verification asynchronously using .  Minimizing the use of global variables in the authentication process.  Exploring the use of C extensions for cryptographic operations (though the gains are often marginal).Benchmarking with  and asyncio.run(async_benchmark()) is crucial to measure the impact of these optimizations.Insecure deserialization, as experienced in our production incident, is a major risk.  Always validate the authentication token  deserializing any data associated with it.  Avoid using  for untrusted data.  Code injection can occur if user-supplied data is used to construct SQL queries or shell commands.  Use parameterized queries and proper input validation to prevent this.  Privilege escalation can occur if authentication checks are bypassed or if users are granted excessive permissions.  Implement least privilege principles and regularly review access controls.We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:  Testing individual authentication functions and dependencies.  Testing the interaction between authentication and other components (e.g., FastAPI routes, Celery tasks).Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):  Generating random JWT payloads to test the robustness of the verification process.  Ensuring that all authentication code is type-safe.Our CI/CD pipeline includes: with code coverage reporting. for testing against multiple Python versions.GitHub Actions to run tests and linters on every pull request. hooks to enforce code style and type checking.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
Storing Passwords in Plain Text:  Never store passwords directly. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).Using  for Untrusted Data:  As mentioned,  is inherently insecure.  Always verify the  claim in JWTs.Overly Permissive Access Controls:  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.Lack of Input Validation:  Validate all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks.  Never hardcode secrets in your code. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Use type hints extensively to improve code correctness and maintainability.  Separate authentication logic from business logic.  Assume that all user input is malicious.  Break down authentication into small, reusable components.  Use a layered configuration system to manage secrets and settings.  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.  Document all authentication code thoroughly.Authentication is a complex and critical aspect of modern Python systems.  Mastering the nuances of authentication, from secure token generation to robust validation and performance optimization, is essential for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.  Prioritize static typing, rigorous testing, and a security-first mindset.  Refactor legacy code to address potential vulnerabilities, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve your authentication practices.  The cost of a security breach far outweighs the effort required to build a secure authentication system.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 9/100: While Loops with Real-World Examples</title><link>https://dev.to/therahul_gupta/day-9100-while-loops-with-real-world-examples-528f</link><author>Rahul Gupta</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 12:22:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to  of the  series!

However, sometimes you need to perform CPU-intensive tasks or system-level operations that are outside the strengths of Elixir’s BEAM virtual machine. This is where Rust shines. Rust offers memory safety, high performance, and the ability to compile to native code, making it a great companion for Phoenix when you want to offload heavy computation or integrate with low-level system components.
  
  
  Use Rust for CPU-intensive tasks outside LiveView
Elixir is excellent for concurrency and I/O but not ideal for heavy numerical calculations or data processing. Writing those parts in Rust and calling them via  (Native Implemented Functions) or  can dramatically improve performance. For example, if your LiveView app needs to process large image files or perform complex encryption, consider implementing that in Rust.
  
  
  Communicate between Phoenix and Rust via Ports
 provide a safe way to communicate between Elixir and external programs such as Rust binaries. Launch the Rust program as a separate OS process and exchange messages through standard input and output. This keeps your Elixir VM stable, as Rust code cannot crash it directly. You can implement protocols to send commands and receive results asynchronously.
  
  
  Consider Rustler for safer integration
 is a library that makes writing NIFs in Rust easier and safer. Using Rustler, you can write Rust code that integrates directly with Elixir without manually managing the NIF lifecycle. It handles much of the boilerplate and ensures errors do not crash the BEAM. Use Rustler for computationally intensive functions that need to be called synchronously from LiveView.
  
  
  Keep NIFs short and non-blocking
When using NIFs, ensure Rust functions execute quickly and do not block the scheduler. Long-running NIFs can stall the entire BEAM, impacting responsiveness. Offload longer tasks to  or external services. Use Rust to accelerate specific calculations rather than entire workflows.
  
  
  Serialize data efficiently for interop
Data passed between Elixir and Rust needs to be serialized and deserialized efficiently. Use formats like , , or . Rust’s strong typing and pattern matching make decoding and encoding reliable. Minimize the size and complexity of messages to reduce overhead.
  
  
  Use Rust for WebAssembly components
Rust compiles well to WebAssembly (). You can write client-side components in Rust and compile them to Wasm modules that run inside the browser. This enables you to write performance-critical UI logic alongside LiveView without sacrificing speed or security.
  
  
  Leverage Rust’s ecosystem for cryptography and networking
Rust has excellent libraries for cryptography, networking, and file system operations. Use these libraries to build features like secure authentication, custom protocols, or efficient file parsers. Call these Rust components from Phoenix LiveView for a seamless user experience combined with powerful backend capabilities.
  
  
  Build Rust microservices for specialized workloads
For complex systems, consider building microservices in Rust that communicate with Phoenix over HTTP or message queues. This separation allows you to scale components independently and use the best language for each task. For instance, a Rust microservice can handle real-time data ingestion or machine learning inference.
  
  
  Test Rust and Elixir integration thoroughly
Integration between Rust and Elixir introduces new failure modes. Make sure to write unit tests for your Rust code and integration tests covering boundary cases. Monitor runtime behavior to catch memory leaks or performance regressions early.
  
  
  Document your Rust-LiveView architecture clearly
Because Rust integration is less common in Phoenix apps, clear documentation is crucial. Explain the responsibilities of each component, data flows, and error handling strategies. This makes onboarding easier for new team members and supports long-term maintenance.Combining Rust’s speed and safety with Phoenix LiveView’s productivity lets you build web applications that are both responsive and powerful. You can keep the interactive UI experience native to Elixir while handling demanding tasks in Rust.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neural Networks : A Beginner-Friendly Guide to the Brains Behind AI</title><link>https://dev.to/abhishekjaiswal_4896/neural-networks-a-beginner-friendly-guide-to-the-brains-behind-ai-15n</link><author>Abhishek Jaiswal</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 11:36:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Introduction: Why Neural Networks Matter
Have you ever wondered how Netflix recommends your next binge-worthy series? Or how voice assistants like Siri or Alexa understand your commands? The magic behind these smart systems lies in —a core component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning.Neural networks are not just a buzzword in tech circles. They’re the backbone of facial recognition, fraud detection, chatbots, self-driving cars, and even medical diagnosis. In this blog, we’ll explore what neural networks are, how they work, and why they’re so powerful—all in simple, non-intimidating language.
  
  
  🧠 What Is a Neural Network?
A  is a computational model inspired by the human brain. Just like your brain uses neurons to process information, neural networks use  (also called nodes) to recognize patterns and make decisions.Imagine it as a web of interconnected nodes that take inputs, perform calculations, and produce outputs. These networks learn from data—meaning they can  as they see more examples.
  
  
  🔄 Real-Life Analogy: Neural Networks as Decision-Making Recipes
Let’s say you're teaching a child to recognize apples. You show them 10 different apples and say, “These are apples.” Over time, the child starts identifying apples based on color, shape, or texture.Neural networks do the same thing but with numbers. Feed them enough labeled images, and they’ll “learn” the characteristics of an apple without being explicitly programmed. This process is called .
  
  
  🧱 Anatomy of a Neural Network
A typical neural network has three types of layers:Receives raw data (e.g., image pixels, sound waves, or text).The “thinking” layers. Each neuron processes input and passes it to the next layer. These layers extract meaningful features from the data.Gives the final prediction (e.g., "apple" or "not apple").Each neuron applies a , adds a , and then passes the result through an  (like ReLU or Sigmoid) to decide what to "fire" forward.
  
  
  ⚙️ How Neural Networks Learn: Backpropagation and Training
Training a neural network is like fine-tuning a guitar. You start with random settings (weights), play a note (make a prediction), listen to how off it sounds (calculate error), and then adjust the strings (update weights) using  and .This cycle continues until the network gets really good at making accurate predictions. The more data you feed it, the smarter it becomes.
  
  
  💡 Types of Neural Networks (And What They’re Good At)
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)Basic tasks like classificationConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)Image recognition, computer visionRecurrent Neural Network (RNN)Time-series data, language modelingLSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)Text generation, translationGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)Image generation, deep fakes
  
  
  🚀 Real-World Applications of Neural Networks
: Predicting diseases from X-rays or ECGs: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading: Personalized recommendations, inventory forecasting: Music composition, movie recommendations: Object detection, path planning
  
  
  🧩 Challenges of Neural Networks
Despite their power, neural networks have limitations:: They require lots of labeled dataComputationally Expensive: Training deep networks can take hours or even days: Hard to interpret how they make decisions: They may memorize data instead of learning patternsBut with techniques like , , and , many of these challenges are being actively addressed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TicTacToe.

  Neural Network vs Random Number Generator
"Knowledge itself is power" (с) -Francis BaconCreating a network is easy. Training it correctly is not an easy task. The result often does not match expectations. In reality, there is no magic here. The network does exactly what it is told to do. If the result is not what was intended, then the error is either in the training or in the interpretation of the results obtained. The creator's thoughts cannot yet be guessed by the network.In our previous article, we delved into the fundamentals of neural networks, building a simple model in Golang and successfully solving the classic XOR problem. Now it's time to move on to a more exciting and complex area — Reinforcement Learning — and apply this knowledge to create an intelligent agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe.Unlike the XOR problem, where the network immediately received the "correct answer" and could adjust its weights, in games like Tic-Tac-Toe, a key difficulty arises: delayed reward. The agent makes moves, but the outcome of its actions (win, loss, or draw) is only known at the end of the game. This means we cannot immediately point out an "error" or "success" for each individual move to the network. The agent needs to learn to associate intermediate actions with future outcomes.It is precisely to solve such problems that the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm was developed, which we will discuss in detail in this article. We will describe the game logic, the DQN agent's architecture, and analyze its training process as both the first and second player. The article is written in an accessible, popular style and will not delve deeply into the mathematical foundations, as there are many excellent resources on this topic available online (e.g., mathematics of reinforcement learning (RL) or video about DeepLearning).Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple deterministic game for two players on a 3x3 board. Players take turns placing their symbols (X and O) into empty cells. The goal of the game is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all cells are filled and no winner is determined, the game ends in a draw.: Determined by the arrangement of X and O symbols on the board.: Choosing an empty cell to place your symbol.: A win for one of the players or a draw.: In Tic-Tac-Toe, the first player has a strategic advantage. With optimal play from both players, the game always ends in a draw or a win for the first player. According to my estimates, and confirmed by experiment (when the agent initially plays like a random opponent), the probability of winning for the player who makes the first move to the center is about 60% (600 out of 1000 games), a loss is about 30%, and a draw is 10%.Board Representation and State VectorThe game  is represented by a Board struct, and its state is converted into a numerical vector for the neural network using the  method.
  
  
  Deep Q-Learning Agent (DQN)
Our agent is based on the  architecture, which combines Q-learning with deep neural networks. This is evident in how the action for the next state is selected using the main Q-network, and then its Q-value is evaluated using the target network. This helps to reduce the overestimation of Q-values characteristic of classic DQN.The board state is converted into a numerical vector that is fed into the neural network. For each of the 9 board cells:, if the cell is occupied by the agent's symbol., if the cell is occupied by the opponent's symbol., if the cell is empty.Neural Network ArchitectureThe agent uses a fully connected neural network.: 9 neurons (corresponding to the 9 board cells).: One hidden layer with 27 (or 45/72) neurons with a Tanh activation function. The minimum number of neurons in the hidden layer that yielded satisfactory results was 9.: 9 neurons (corresponding to 9 possible actions/cells), also with a Tanh activation function.The agent learns by interacting with the environment (the Tic-Tac-Toe game) and receiving rewards.The  stores the agent's experiences, allowing for efficient training by sampling past interactions.DQNAgent Structure and Action SelectionThe  struct holds the Q-network, target network, replay buffer, and training parameters. The  method implements the epsilon-greedy strategy.The  method implements the core Double DQN update rule, using the replay buffer and target network.Note the Bellman equation:Using this mechanism, the "reward" gradually "propagates" from the end of the game to its beginning.The  function defines the reward structure for the agent:
  
  
  Training Process and Results
So, we are all set for testing.
Let's briefly summarize what we have:A  with a 9:27:9 architecture that knows nothing.A  and implementation of game logic (start, rule adherence, and end detector (win/loss/draw)).An  who can make moves into free cells randomly. And that's all.An  that, from the start, plays like its opponent but has the ability to learn. It knows when the game ends. And it knows whether it finished the game well or poorly.What can we observe and by what criteria can we determine the learning progress?Firstly, it's the agent's win percentage (expected to increase).Secondly, we can observe the decrease in Epsilon to understand what is happening – whether the agent is exploring (making random moves) or utilizing its accumulated experience.Thirdly, we can look at the weight vector on the output layer to understand how the agent decides to make its first move on an empty board (it is expected that the center will have the largest weight, then the corners, and then the sides as the least promising).And finally, we can track the maximum number of wins achieved throughout the entire experiment.Let's see what came of this and whether our agent will show growth in its competence.Training the Agent as the First PlayerIn this scenario, the agent (Player X) always makes the first move in the game. To accelerate convergence and ensure the learning of an optimal starting strategy, we can experimented with forcing the first move to the center of the board (default without this).These are the settings that can be changed when conducting an experiment.
'Knobs' that can be 'turned' for fine-tuning.
The network implemented here usually forgives even gross errors.
The most you risk is falling into a local minimum instead of a global one.

Testing the agent (X against random O)...

Test Results (1000 games, Agent X vs random O):
Agent X Wins: 956
Agent X Losses (Random O Wins): 39
Draws: 5
When the agent was to make the first move to the center, it demonstrated outstanding results, achieving up to 992 wins out of 1000 (in some cases) test games against a random opponent, with a minimal number of losses and draws. This confirms that the agent successfully learned an optimal strategy for the first player."Win Growth (agent moves first)" graph:Training the Agent as the Second PlayerIn this scenario, the opponent (Player O) always makes the first move randomly, and our agent (Player X) always responds second. This puts the agent in a less advantageous position, as the first move in Tic-Tac-Toe provides a strategic advantage. The goal of this experiment is to test how well the agent can adapt to the role of the second player and minimize the opponent's advantage.The same hyperparameters as for the first scenario were used.The only change is that the opponent always makes the first move.PS D:\go\go-sample-tictactoe> go run .

Training complete.
Testing the agent (X against random O)...

Test Results (1000 games, Agent X vs random O):
Agent X Wins: 783
Agent X Losses (Random O Wins): 191
Draws: 26
In the initial stages of training, the agent, as expected, showed a lower win percentage and a higher number of losses/draws due to the opponent's first-move advantage. However, as training progressed, the agent significantly improved its performance.Example game after training:Example game after training (X vs random O):

Game Over! Player X won!
"Win Growth (agent moves second)" graph:These results show that the agent successfully learned to optimally respond to various first moves by the opponent, significantly increasing its win rate despite the strategic disadvantage of moving second. The "first move selection" problem for the agent disappeared, as it focused on reactive tactics.The project on training a DQN agent for Tic-Tac-Toe successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning algorithms even for simple deterministic games. We saw how the agent can adapt to different roles (first/second player) and achieve near-optimal performance against a random opponent.The most guaranteed way to make the agent learn "human" optimality (center, corners) is to train it against a stronger, strategic opponent (e.g., Minimax AI) or in self-play mode. These opponents will punish any suboptimal move, forcing the agent towards true optimality.Write in the comments if you are interested, and I will arrange a battle (a real fight) between two agents. For now, my immediate plans include a final "move" to Linux and writing a small backend (e.g., a REST API) for a simple client to try playing with what has been developed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Transposer: A Lightweight, Training-Free Neural Architecture That Learns from Raw Embeddings Without Attention</title><link>https://dev.to/lumgenlab/transposer-a-lightweight-training-free-neural-architecture-that-learns-from-raw-embeddings-39h3</link><author>LumGenLab</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 10:08:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the current landscape of artificial intelligence, most breakthroughs in language understanding rely on scaling — larger models, bigger datasets, more compute. While attention-based architectures like Transformers dominate, they remain complex, resource-heavy, and often opaque.In contrast,  is a fundamentally different approach to representation learning — built from , designed to be , and focused on .This post introduces the theory, motivation, design, and implementation behind  — a new AI and a type of autoencoder model that performs  from raw text using only basic matrix operations, and runs effortlessly on a CPU with as little as  from 2009.Transposer can be viewed as a field-projection encoder with structural similarity to an autoencoder — but without any reconstruction loss or training.
  
  
  🧠 Why Build an Alternative to Attention?
Attention mechanisms — though powerful — come with significant trade-offs:Quadratic time complexity in input lengthHeavy reliance on massive corpora and training cycles: multi-head layers, residual connections, layer norm, positional encoding: attention scores don’t always tell us why something was learnedTransposer asks:Can we build something simpler, leaner, and just as meaningful — by rethinking how embeddings interact?The answer lies in a concept most students encounter in early math: .In standard NLP models, token embeddings are processed  — meaning each token is treated independently across its vector dimensions.What if we  this embedding matrix — and treat embedding dimensions as the context and ?This reorients the model’s view of language, allowing it to discover cross-token relationships and  using only field projection.
  
  
  🧬 The Architecture of Transposer

Let’s break down the architecture step by step:Input is tokenized and embedded into a matrix X of shape:L = sequence length (number of tokens)The embedding matrix is transposed:This allows processing across embedding dimensions, treating tokens as contextual dimensions.Two learned linear transformations are applied:H = ReLU(W₁ × Xᵀ)  
Z = W₂ × H
K is an internal projection dimension (hyperparameter)This returns the transformed embeddings back to the original orientation.The original and transformed embeddings are merged:This is an , preserving local structure while enriching with globally-learned relationships.
Transposer has been tested on toy datasets with as few as . Despite its simplicity and lack of training, it was able to extract surprisingly intelligent relationships:"education" → ["learning", "by", "preparing"]

  * Values in a SST are compressed   together with better zip ratio than zstd, and can unzip by a single value at 1GB/sec.

  * BlockCache is no longer needed, double caching(BlockCache & PageCache) is avoided

Other hotspots are also improved:* Flush MemTable to L0 is omited, greatly reducing write amp and is very friendly for large(GB) MemTable  * MemTable   serves as the index of Key to "value position in WAL log"

  * Since WAL file content almost always in page cache, thus value content can be efficiently accessed by mmap

  * When Flush happens, MemTable is dumpped as an SST and WAL is treated as a blob file

    * CSPP MemTable use integer index instead of physical pointers, thus in-memory format is exactly same with in-file format

* Prefix cache for searching candidate SSTs and prefix cache for scanning by iterators  * Caching fixed len key prefix into an array, binary search it as an uint array

* Distributed compaction(superior replacement to rocksdb remote compaction)  * Gracefully support MergeOperator, CompactionFilter, PropertiesCollector...

  * Out of the box, development efforts are significantly reduced

  * Very easy to share compaction service on spot instances for many DB nodes

Useful Bonus Feature:* Config by json/yaml: can config almost all features* Optional embeded WebView: show db structures in web browser, refreshing pages like animation* Online update db configs by httpMySQL integration, ToplingDB has integrated into MySQL by MyTopling, which is forked from MyRocks with great improvements, like improvements of ToplingDB on RocksDB:* WBWI(WriteBatchWithIndex): like MemTable, SkipList is replace with CSPP, 20x faster(speedup is more than MemTable).* LockManager & LockTracker: 10x faster* Encoding & Decoding: 5x fasterMyRocks has many disadvantages compared to InnoDB, while MyTopling outperforms InnoDB at almost all aspect - excluding feature differences.We have create ~100 PRs for RocksDB, in which ~40 were accepted.

From handling payments and messaging to ordering food and booking rides, these all-encompassing applications strive to be indispensable tools in users' daily lives. However, the sheer volume of services and user interactions within a Super App presents both a challenge and an immense opportunity: how to prevent information overload and deliver truly relevant experiences. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and hyper-personalization become not just features, but foundational pillars in successful Super App development.AI acts as the intelligent backbone, processing vast amounts of user data, predicting needs, and automating interactions. Personalization, powered by AI, translates these insights into tailored experiences, making each user feel like the app was designed just for them. This synergy is crucial for transforming a collection of services into a cohesive, intuitive, and highly engaging digital ecosystem. This blog post will explore the pivotal role of AI and personalization in Super App development, highlighting how they elevate user experience, drive engagement, and unlock new value for businesses.1. AI as the Engine for Data Processing and Predictive AnalyticsAt its core, a Super App generates an enormous amount of data from diverse user interactions across various services. This includes transaction history, search queries, location data, communication patterns, Browse behavior, and more. Without a sophisticated mechanism to process and interpret this data, it remains a raw, untapped resource. This is where AI steps in as the indispensable engine.AI-powered algorithms, particularly machine learning (ML) models, can:Process Massive Datasets: Rapidly analyze vast volumes of structured and unstructured data in real-time, far exceeding human capacity.Identify Complex Patterns: Uncover subtle correlations and trends within the data that indicate user preferences, habits, and future intentions.Enable Predictive Analytics: Based on historical data and real-time inputs, AI can predict user needs, likely actions, and even potential pain points. For example, an AI might predict a user's need for a ride based on their calendar events and location, or suggest a restaurant based on past orders and current time.This predictive capability is a game-changer for Super App development solutions. Instead of users having to actively search for services, the app can proactively offer relevant options, streamlining their experience. For instance, if a user frequently orders coffee from a specific cafe in the morning, an AI agent could prompt them with an option to reorder as they approach their usual time. This seamless, almost clairvoyant interaction significantly enhances convenience and makes the Super App feel truly intelligent and helpful. The ability of AI to derive actionable insights from multi-service data is what elevates a Super App from a mere collection of mini-apps to a truly integrated and intelligent ecosystem.2. Personalization: Tailoring the Super App ExperienceWhile AI provides the analytical power, personalization is the user-facing outcome. In a Super App, personalization moves beyond simple "recommended for you" lists to a dynamic adaptation of the entire app experience. This level of customization ensures that despite the app's vast functionalities, it feels intuitive and relevant to each individual.Key aspects of personalization driven by AI in Super Apps include:Dynamic UI/UX Customization: The layout and visibility of mini-apps and features can change based on a user's most frequent activities, time of day, or location. For example, food delivery might be prominent during lunch hours, while payment options become central during bill payment cycles.Contextual Recommendations: AI leverages contextual data (time, location, weather, past behavior) to offer highly relevant suggestions, whether for shopping, entertainment, or financial services.Personalized Content and Notifications: Delivering news feeds, promotions, or notifications that are specifically tailored to a user's interests and previous interactions, reducing notification fatigue and increasing engagement.Adaptive Search and Discovery: AI can refine search results and make it easier for users to discover new services or features within the Super App that align with their inferred needs.This granular level of personalization ensures that the user never feels overwhelmed by the multitude of options. Instead, they experience a streamlined interface that anticipates their needs, making navigation effortless and delightful. This is a core benefit of Super App architecture combined with intelligent systems. A Super App Development Company places a strong emphasis on designing user interfaces that can fluidly adapt based on AI-driven personalization.3. AI-Powered Virtual Assistants and ChatbotsThe integration of AI-powered virtual assistants and advanced chatbots is another critical role of AI in Super App development. These intelligent conversational agents serve as the primary interface for many user queries and tasks, providing instant, round-the-clock support across all integrated services.Intelligent Query Resolution: AI chatbots can understand natural language queries related to any service within the Super App, from tracking a food order to checking a bank balance or booking a ride, and provide accurate, real-time responses.Seamless Task Execution: Beyond answering questions, these AI agents can often execute tasks directly within the chat interface, such as placing an order, initiating a payment, or scheduling a service, significantly streamlining workflows.Proactive Assistance: Based on predictive analytics, the AI assistant can proactively offer help or suggest relevant services before the user even explicitly asks, further enhancing convenience.Multilingual Support: AI’s natural language processing (NLP) capabilities enable Super Apps to offer seamless support in multiple languages, catering to a diverse global user base.These AI-driven conversational interfaces reduce the burden on human customer support teams, leading to significant cost savings. More importantly, they provide an immediate, consistent, and personalized support experience that enhances user satisfaction and trust, making the Super App an even more reliable daily companion. For an On-Demand Super App Development model, such instant assistance is paramount.4. Optimized Operations and Fraud Detection through AIBeyond direct user interaction, AI plays a vital role in the back-end operations of a Super App, optimizing efficiency and ensuring security. The complexity of managing multiple services, vast user data, and numerous transactions necessitates intelligent automation and robust security measures.Fraud Detection and Security: AI algorithms can continuously monitor transaction patterns, user behavior, and network activities to detect anomalies and identify potential fraudulent activities or security breaches in real-time. This is crucial for protecting sensitive user data, especially in Super Apps that handle financial transactions.Resource Optimization: AI can optimize resource allocation for various services, managing server loads, delivery routes, and even human agent deployment to ensure smooth operation and cost efficiency. For example, dynamically adjusting the number of ride-hailing drivers based on real-time demand.Content Moderation and Compliance: In Super Apps with social or content-sharing features, AI can assist in moderating user-generated content to ensure compliance with platform policies and legal regulations.Supplier and Partner Management: AI can help analyze performance data of third-party merchants and service providers within the ecosystem, ensuring quality control and identifying areas for improvement.This behind-the-scenes application of AI ensures the Super App operates smoothly, securely, and efficiently, building trust with users and maintaining the integrity of the multi-service ecosystem. Robust Super App development services always incorporate advanced AI for these operational efficiencies and security protocols.5. Continuous Improvement and Evolution driven by AIThe dynamic nature of user needs and market trends requires a Super App to continuously evolve. AI provides the framework for this continuous improvement, enabling the app to learn and adapt over time.Learning from User Interactions: Every user interaction provides data that AI models can use to refine their understanding of user preferences and improve the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. This creates a self-improving loop.A/B Testing and Feature Optimization: AI can facilitate extensive A/B testing of new features, UI layouts, and messaging, allowing the development team to quickly identify what works best and optimize the app based on real user feedback.Bug Detection and Performance Monitoring: AI-powered tools can monitor app performance in real-time, detect anomalies, identify potential bugs or bottlenecks, and even suggest solutions, ensuring a consistently smooth user experience.Personalized Onboarding: AI can tailor the onboarding experience for new users, guiding them through the features most relevant to their inferred needs or demographics, accelerating adoption.This continuous learning and optimization cycle, driven by AI, ensures that the Super App remains highly relevant, performant, and engaging over time. It allows the Super App development company to iterate rapidly and deliver a constantly improving product that anticipates and meets evolving user expectations.The integration of Artificial Intelligence and personalization is not an optional add-on but a fundamental necessity for the success of any modern Super App. AI serves as the powerful engine, processing complex data, enabling predictive analytics, and automating operations. Personalization, in turn, translates these insights into highly relevant, intuitive, and adaptive user experiences, making the vastness of a Super App feel manageable and uniquely tailored to each individual.By leveraging AI for intelligent data processing, adaptive interfaces, proactive virtual assistants, optimized operations, and continuous improvement, Super App development transcends the traditional app model to create truly indispensable digital companions. For businesses aiming to build and sustain a thriving multi-service ecosystem, investing in the intelligent integration of AI and personalization is not just a strategic advantage but the very essence of future-proof mobile dominance. For comprehensive Super App development solutions that harness the full power of AI and personalization, engaging an experienced Multiservice App Development Company is key.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PySupercell Core Guide: Building Your Own Supercell Game Server</title><link>https://dev.to/idk_286a588368add3573523c/pysupercell-core-guide-building-your-own-supercell-game-server-5dn6</link><author>idk</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 09:53:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Среди множества проектов сомнительного качества вы наткнулись на PySupercell Core. А что дальше?Игры Supercell (Clash of Clans, Brawl Stars и т. д.) имеют схожую архитектуру - это объясняется тем, что они сделаны на основе ядра (некой основы для сервера). PySupercell Core (далее PSC) — это новое Python-ядро, которое:Реализует базовую архитектуру сервера как у SupercellЛегко адаптируется под любую игру SCНо не является готовым сервером — вам предстоит дописать логику самостоятельноБольшинство других питонических серверов / ядер медленные и устаревшие. PSC же быстрый и удобный в использованииgit clone https://github.com/REtard-1337/pysupercell-core

pip  requirements.txt
В папке  ищем файл logic_magic_message_factory.py. Здесь  — кодовое имя Clash of Clans. Меняем его на нужное нам:Открываем  и задаем параметры игры. Например, для Brawl Stars версии :И вот теперь, когда сервер настроен и вроде бы как готов к работе, вы запускаете его, но...— Но падажи, почему-то на клиенте происходит бесконечное "подключение к серверу" — это значит, что PSC не работает!!!— Нет, всё работает, просто PSC — это ядро, а не полноценный сервер. Все пакеты необходимо реализовать самостоятельноВ качестве примера я возьму .Создаём файл logic/messages/auth/login_message.py.Но всё это какт сложно, потому давай разберём.
Сначала мы импортируем зависимости:Далее создаём класс LoginMessage — он обязательно должен быть наследником от PiranhaMessage:PiranhaMessage — это базовый класс для всех пакетов, который предоставляет доступ к stream — аналогу Reader/Writer из Classic-BrawlЗатем мы создаём конструктор класса и определяем в нём поля:И теперь пишем  — он вернёт ID месседжа:И это всё, конечно, невероятно увлекательно, но как насчёт серверного пакета?
Рядом с  создаём новый файлик — :Здесь нам разбирать особо нечего — скажу только, что раз это серверный пакет, то здесь должна быть реализована функция , в которой мы используем созданные нами в конструкторе поляУже заметили, что в классах месседжей нет ни , ни , ни ? Как же так? Дело в том, что Supercell использует немного другой метод обработки пакетов — все пакеты обрабатываются через MessageManager.receive_message

But Pydantic expects lists, and you want enum validation. Plus everything should be optional.Standard Pydantic approach fails here:The client sends  as a single string, but you need [ProductStatus.ACTIVE, ProductStatus.PENDING].Use  with a custom parser that handles both string-to-list conversion and enum casting:: FastAPI automatically wraps query param values in lists: Runs before Pydantic's standard validation: Takes the first item from the list (the comma-separated string) and splits it: If enum type provided, casts each item to the enum: Final result is properly typed for your business logicThis hit me when refactoring an existing API.

  Hono and Django now available on Diploi
There are two powerful new additions to Diploi,  and !These frameworks are now officially supported, meaning you can deploy, host, and manage full applications with Hono or/and Django with one clickis a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.Hono is mainly used for backend applications, like APIs, proxy servers, edge apps, and typical servers, but that's not all, it can also serve HTML and UI components, so it is appropiate to think of Hono as a fullstack framework. You can think of Hono as a modern alternative to Express, which supports Typescript and can be used with the most popular runtimes availableHono aims to make your life easier by enabling API Spec and type inference via Hono's RPC, which transforms how you can share types and API expected responses between server and client, into a smooth experience. Additionally, Hono has multiple helpers and middlewares to handle typical operations, like managing Cookies, JWT, Webhooks, authentication, and headers, so you don't need external libraries to handle these actionsDjango is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.In simpler terms, Django is a framework for building web applications, and it is mostly considered a backend framework because it features ORM, auth, middleware, and other typical backend features, but it can also serve HTML and handle frontend templating just like fullstack frameworks, so it is fair to think that Django is whatever you need it to be 😅Django uses a pattern they call Model-View-Template (MVT), which is similar to Model-View-Controller (MVC), with their main difference being that in MVT, the View and Controller from MVC are technically bundled together into the View from MVTFun fact: Before this blog, I didn't know that Django has been around since 2005... damn 🫡
  
  
  Using Django and Hono with other frameworks in Diploi
If you would like to test out how these frameworks work together with other frameworks, you can use Diploi to create monorepo applications, where you can for example, have Django as your backend and Astro in the frontend, or Hono as your API server with a Next.js fullstack app, or any other combination of frameworks and databases that fits your requirementsDiploi will then start a remote development environment that allows you to code in the browser and your application is deployed online. If you would like to start your application with a GitHub repository, all you need to do is register using GitHub and you will be able to start a new repository with your new applicationWhat frameworks should we support next?

The goal was to better understand the internals of forward and backpropagation by implementing everything manually, without relying on external ML libraries. The code worked, but it was very basic and lacked in performance.Now, I’m revisiting this project to refactor the code and improve the overall design. Here’s a summary of what I’ve improved:The codebase already had a good separation of concerns: activation functions, loss, optimizers, and network logic were neatly organized into their own modules. This made it relatively easy to extend the library with new features.
  
  
  The Improvement : Parallel Training
To improve training efficiency, I implemented . Training data is split into multiple batches, each processed in a separate goroutine using .I used  to safely collect training errors and weight deltas from all batches.After all batches are processed, the deltas are merged using a custom  function and applied once at the end of the epoch.. Initial versions caused data races when multiple goroutines accessed or modified shared weight structures.: Delay all updates until after parallel computation finishes.Locking Can Kill Parallelism. Putting locks around weight updates inside each batch makes the process sequential. It removes the benefit of parallelism.: Do all mutation  goroutines have joined.Unstable Training Without Averaging. Summing raw deltas led to unstable error gradient.: Add delta average in  to stabilize learning.Training speed increased (especially for datasets like Iris).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a Toy SSTable Storage Engine in Python</title><link>https://dev.to/vyaslav/building-a-toy-sstable-storage-engine-in-python-a28</link><author>Viacheslav Avramenko</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 08:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered how modern databases like LevelDB, RocksDB, or Cassandra store and retrieve massive amounts of data efficiently? The secret sauce is often a data structure called the Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) and its core component, the Sorted String Table (SSTable).In this post, we’ll build a toy, educational SSTable-based storage engine in Python, inspired by Martin Kleppmann’s Designing Data-Intensive Applications. We’ll start simple and gradually add complexity, so you can follow along even if you’re new to storage internals!An  is a file format for storing large, sorted key-value pairs on disk. The key properties are:: All keys are stored in order, making range queries and binary search possible.: Once written, SSTables are never modified. New data is written to new files.: By combining in-memory and on-disk structures, SSTables enable fast writes and reasonably fast reads.SSTables are the backbone of LSM-Trees, which power many modern databases.: An in-memory, sorted key-value store.: Writes sorted key-value pairs to disk as an SSTable, with a sparse index and Bloom filter.: Reads from SSTables using the index and Bloom filter.: Orchestrates the LSM-Tree logic, combining memtable and SSTables.: A simple Bloom filter for fast negative lookups.: A UNIX socket server exposing set/get operations.: A CLI client to interact with the server.: A script to stress test the system.
  
  
  Step 1: The Memtable – Fast In-Memory Writes
When you write data, it first lands in the —a sorted, in-memory structure. In our Python version, we use a sorted list and the  module for efficient lookups and inserts.When the memtable gets too big, we  it to disk as a new SSTable.
  
  
  Step 2: Writing SSTables – Persistence and Order
Flushing the memtable means writing all its sorted key-value pairs to a file. But how do we make reads efficient?: Every Nth key and its file offset are written to an index file. This lets us quickly jump to the right part of the SSTable.: A probabilistic data structure that tells us if a key is  in the file, saving unnecessary disk reads.

  
  
  Step 3: Reading SSTables – Fast Lookups
When you want to read a key: (fastest). for each SSTable (quickly skip files that don’t have the key). to jump to the right spot in the SSTable file and scan for the key.

  
  
  Step 4: The LSM-Tree – Orchestrating Everything
The  class manages the memtable, SSTable files, and the index cache. It handles:: Write to memtable, flush to SSTable when full.: Check memtable, then SSTables from newest to oldest.

  
  
  Step 5: Server and CLI – Putting It All Together
We expose our storage engine via a simple UNIX socket server (). You can interact with it using the CLI ():python  sstable_server   
python  main mykey 123
python  main get mykey
How does it perform? The  script:Inserts 1000 random key-value pairsReads them all back and prints the sum and average
: LSM-Trees and SSTables are designed for fast, sequential writes—perfect for write-heavy workloads.: Sparse indexes and Bloom filters keep reads fast, even as data grows.: These ideas power LevelDB, RocksDB, Cassandra, and more.This project is a —but it’s a great way to learn! You can extend it by adding:Compaction (merging old SSTables)Deletion markers (tombstones)Building your own SSTable-based storage engine is a fantastic way to understand the internals of modern databases.

In this article, we will explore the most interesting features of the Go language that distinguish it from C++.
  
  
  Producer/consumer implementation with Go
If you didn't see the first article of this series, please read it because I explained there what are the things I want to check about each C++ alternative and how I'm going to do that.Below you case see the implementation of the reference producer/consumer application written in Go. I really wanted this implementation to be based on channels (more on them at the end of the article) because it's a very interesting feature of Go, but because channels are by design meant to be used for one-to-one communication, they are not suitable for this use case.So accordingly to the list of checks that I'm interested in, Go gives us the following statistics: - this code is 106 lines long (124 lines for C++) - it takes 91ms to build this application (2149ms for C++) with command:
/usr/local/go/bin/go build  producer_consumer.go
 - it takes 2172ms to run it (597ms for C++) - 1.4MB (105kB for C++)
  
  
  What I like about this code?
In Go you don't need to specify size of the fixed-size array if you provide its elements during initialization. This is a very nice feature because whenever you want to change the content of the array, you just add or remove an element from the initialization list, without having to additionally change the size of the array.I love the fact that Go doesn't force me to create a thread, specify its worker, start it, wait for every thread to join separately etc. - if you have a function that you want to run asynchronously, you just call  and that's it.Go fails to build the program if a certain variable is not used. It's not a warning or a suggestion - you just won't get any executable binary out of such source code.Go allows to provide all the imports in form of a list, so I didn't need to repeat "import..." for every required element.
  
  
  What I don't like about this code?

  
  
  Consts not applicable to all types
I was not able to create e.g. a constant array because Go doesn't allow for that.It's not visible directly in the example, but Go's encapsulation relies on the naming convention - if something starts with a upper-case letter, it's public (available outside of the package) and if something starts with a lower-case letter, it's private (not visible form outside of the package). Although it solves the problem of having special keywords like ,  etc., I think it can sometimes be a pain in the ass because I imagine a situation in which I want to just change the visibility of the function to private and suddenly I need to change the name of the function in all places where it has been already used within the package.In the Producer/Consumer example code I use a variadic template to provide the constructor's arguments to  function depending on what worker type I am currently creating (Producer vs Consumer). Unfortunately, Go doesn't have that. I thought that I'll workaround that just by making some arguments having default values, so that I can provide only the ones which are relevant during creation of a specific worker. To my surprise, it turned out that Go doesn't allow function's argument to have a default value.Moreover, there's not even a built-in enum type which forces user to define enums in a pretty weird way, not fitting into the general simplicity of the Go language.
  
  
  Using Go to write C++ code for the existing code bases
Go compiles directly to the machine code, so there's no out-of-the-box way to generate C++ code out of it.
  
  
  Using existing C++ code in Go
Go does not allow to use C++ code within Go programs. There is Cgo, but it requires to wrap all the C++ functions in a C interface, so effectively it does not allow for usage of all C++ features. For example, our our reference C++ library user uses templates which are not supported in C. So for me, the final conclusion is that I just can't use the existing C++ code writing programs in Go.
  
  
  Other interesting Go features

  
  
  Concurrency - Go's main achievement
Every programming language has something what its developers put at the center of its philosophy. For Go, concurrency may be considered as such thing. It has a very interesting approach to concurrency and thread-safety summarized by the sentence:Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating. Go implements it by usage of channels which are Go's attempt to assure thread-safety by design and not by usage of synchronization primitives like mutexes. Channels may be considered shared resources (a channel may be as simple as a single integer value) which can be accessed only by one goroutine at a time. If you're a C++ programmer, you can see the channel as a combination of ,  and . Below you can find the code showing channels in action (notice also how simple it is to spin up a new thread-like execution flow just by adding  before the function call):Channels have their own -like statement which is called  in Go. It allows to react upon incoming data from multiple channels:I wondered if this point shouldn’t actually be at the top of the list because the situation with implicit conversions in C++ is so bad and so confusing for the beginners that I recently started to consider it as one of the most important features of the programming language. It's mainly because C++ claims to be a strongly typed language, which lets your guard down, but in reality you come across multiple situations in which the language behaves as if it doesn't care about the types. Here is an (abstract, but vivid example - I don't want to repeat boring examples with assigning  to a ) example of what I mean - this is a valid and working code in C++:Someone will say "hey, just add an  before the constructor and the compilation will fail" and it's true, but then I can ask what if something like this slips through the review:It compiles again. Now I hear voice saying (because I already heard such argument) that "it is not a bug because you see  type name explicitly written on the left of the  which is being initialized with , so it is basically a language feature and no implicit conversion here". Ok, let's then add a simple function to this code and tell me where do you see the  type name during the function call:The answer is: you don't. And remember that  class from the example can be arbitrarily complex type or can start some resource management directly in the constructor, so maybe you've just constructed a heavy communication proxy or a database connection broker directly out of an integer literal.My point is that there's just so many ways in C++ to trigger an implicit conversion that you must never forget about it. In Go the situation is simple - if you have any custom type definition, even a type which is basically an alias, like below:you must convert everything explicitly to that type.
  
  
  Uniform formatting with Gofmt
One of Go's standout features is its commitment to uniformity of code formatting. The language comes with a built-in formatter  that imposes a consistent style across all Go codebases. Unlike C++, where formatting styles can vary greatly from one team to another, Go enforces a common standard. This means that Go developers spend less time debating style guidelines and more time focusing on solving real problems.However, Go's formatting solution isn't perfect. For instance, it doesn't care much about line length or whitespaces, which means that two developers using  may still produce different source code.Go has only one way to write scope curly brackets after ,  etc. The opening curly bracket must be placed in the same line because otherwise the Go lexer may insert a semicolon after the statement changing its meaning, for example:In fact, the latter version won't even compile because the compiler will complain about an unexpected newline.One of Go’s interesting features is named return values, which allow you to name return variables directly in the function signature:By doing so, you can use  directly inside the function without explicitly declaring it again. This reduces boilerplate code and helps the code to be self-documented. The downside is that these named return values are zero-initalized to their default values, so it also allows to return value which was not modified during the function flow (so was not explicitly initialized to any particular value).However, I admit that this may be a concern brought from other programming languages, a concern that is not applicable to Go. Go actually encourages to design types accordingly to  rule meaning that the memory initialized with zeros translates to some valid state of the object (for example, a zeroed mutex translates to an unlocked mutex). That brings us to the next interesting concept in Go.
  
  
  Memory allocation:  vs. In Go, there are two ways to allocate memory:  and . These functions differ significantly from their similarly-sounding counterparts in C++ (, , ).The  function allocates memory for an object, but does not initialize it. I must admit that at the beginning for me, as a person used to C++, it was pretty confusing because in C++ you can't write the following code if  doesn't have a default constructor :The behavior of Go's  behaves more like such code:allocate memory for the objectget a pointer to such an allocated and initialized objectyou use composite literals (Go's constructors) like on the code snippet bellow:The  function is a totally different story, starting with the fact that it doesn't even return a pointer. If you come from outside of C++ world, you could ask , but if you're a C++ insider you see that the connection is obvious. Its usage is also limited to slices, maps and channels. All these types happen to carry a reference to a data structure that must be initialized before use what  is responsible for.
  
  
  Resource management with defer
Go gives the ability to defer a statement until the end of functions scope (similar as the scope guard statements in D). The deferred statements are deferred in form of a stack, so their execution order is reversed. It's helpful and definitely better then writing the same functions at the end of the scope, but as I mentioned in the article about D, I'm not a big fan of defer-like mechanisms because although it helps to not forget about releasing certain resource (e.g. after adding a new path to the function), it still must be manually typed in by the programmer who is responsible for remembering it, so we can be sure that sooner or later someone will forget about it anyway.Go differentiates between two types of errors: recoverable and unrecoverable. Recoverable error handling relies on multivalue returns because a function may return 2 values - the actual returned value and the associated error which can be checked by the caller before using the value. In contrast, unrecoverable errors, such as accessing out-of-bounds slices, trigger a , which immediately stops normal execution and begins stack unwinding. However, Go provides the  function (in my opinion, not the best name choice for the "unrecoverable" type of error handling) to regain control during the unwinding process.

Your workers could be on fire, stuck in an endless queue, and you'd be the one to blame here. where we're staring at logs hoping to divine the health of our distributed systems. Time to set up some proper monitoring.Celery is one way of doing distributed task processing, but it's opaque when it comes to observability. You can see logs, but logs don't tell you if workers are healthy, how long tasks are taking, or whether your queue is backing up. That's where Flower comes in, it's the one of the monitoring tools for Celery environments.This guide covers integrating Flower with Prometheus and Grafana to get proper metrics-driven monitoring. Whether you're using Grafana Cloud, self-hosted Grafana, the k8s-monitoring Helm chart, or individual components, we'll walk through the setup, explain why each piece matters, and tackle the gotchas.Kubernetes cluster with Celery workers already runningSome form of Prometheus-compatible metrics collection (Alloy, Prometheus Operator, plain Prometheus, etc.)Grafana instance (cloud or self-hosted)Basic Kubernetes knowledgePatience for the inevitable configuration mysteries
  
  
  Understanding the Architecture
Before diving into configuration, let's understand what we're building. Flower sits between your Celery workers and your monitoring system. It connects to your message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ), watches worker activity, and exposes metrics in Prometheus format.The flow looks like this:Celery workers process tasks from the brokerFlower monitors the broker and worker activityFlower exposes metrics at  endpointYour metrics collector (Prometheus/Alloy) scrapes these metricsGrafana visualizes the dataThe key insight is that Flower doesn't directly monitor workers, it monitors the broker's state and worker events, which is why it can give you a complete picture of your distributed system.
  
  
  The Setup: Flower with Prometheus Metrics
Here's the thing about Flower, it's great at showing you pretty graphs in its web UI, but getting it to export metrics for Prometheus requires a specific flag that's easy to miss. By default, Flower only exposes basic Python process metrics, which are useless for understanding your Celery workload.
  
  
  Deploy Flower (the Right Way)
That  flag is doing the heavy lifting here. Without it, you'll get basic Python process metrics (memory usage, GC stats, etc.) but none of the Celery-specific goodness like worker status, task counts, or queue depths. This flag tells Flower to export its internal monitoring data in Prometheus format.The broker URL needs to match exactly what your Celery workers are using. Flower connects to the same broker to observe worker activity and task flow. If there's a mismatch, Flower won't see your workers.The named port () is crucial for ServiceMonitor configurations later. Many monitoring setups rely on port names rather than numbers for service discovery, making your configuration more resilient to port changes.
  
  
  Metrics Collection: Choose Your Adventure
How you get these metrics into your monitoring system depends entirely on your infrastructure setup. Kubernetes monitoring has evolved into several different patterns, each with its own tradeoffs.
  
  
  Option 1: ServiceMonitor (Prometheus Operator/k8s-monitoring)
ServiceMonitors are part of the Prometheus Operator ecosystem and provide declarative configuration for scrape targets. They're the cleanest approach if you're using Prometheus Operator or the k8s-monitoring Helm chart.The critical detail here is  vs . ServiceMonitors reference the service's port definition, not the container port directly. This indirection allows you to change container ports without updating monitoring configs.Getting this configuration right requires the same attention to detail as any other infrastructure code.One character difference can mean the difference between working monitoring and hours of debugging.Here, the  restricts which namespaces this ServiceMonitor applies to. Without it, the ServiceMonitor tries to find matching services across all namespaces, which can cause confusion in multitenant clusters.
  
  
  Option 2: Prometheus Annotations
If you're using vanilla Prometheus with annotation based discovery, you configure scraping through service annotations. This is simpler but less flexible than ServiceMonitors.The annotations tell Prometheus to scrape this service. Your Prometheus configuration needs to include a job that discovers services with these annotations. This approach is more straightforward but offers less control over scraping behavior.
  
  
  Option 3: Alloy Configuration (Manual)
Grafana Alloy offers more flexibility than traditional Prometheus. You can configure complex discovery and relabeling rules to handle dynamic environments.This configuration discovers pods with the  label, applies relabeling rules to construct proper scrape targets, and forwards metrics to your storage backend. The relabeling rules transform Kubernetes metadata into the format Prometheus expects.
  
  
  Option 4: Static Prometheus Config
For simple setups or development environments, static configuration is the most straightforward approach.This hardcodes the service endpoint, which works fine for stable environments but doesn't handle dynamic scaling or service changes gracefully.
  
  
  Verification: Making Sure It Actually Works
Before diving into dashboard creation, verify that metrics are flowing correctly. This saves hours of troubleshooting later when you're wondering why your graphs are empty.
  
  
  Check the Metrics Endpoint
kubectl port-forward svc/flower-service 5555:5555
curl http://localhost:5555/metrics
You should see metrics that look like this:flower_worker_online{worker="celery@worker-1"} 1.0
flower_events_total{task="process_data",type="task-sent"} 127.0
flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks{worker="celery@worker-1"} 3.0
flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds{task="process_data",worker="celery@worker-1"} 0.001
If you're only seeing basic Python metrics (python_gc_objects_collected_total, process_resident_memory_bytes, etc.), you're missing the  flag. The Celery-specific metrics are what make this whole exercise worthwhile.
  
  
  Check Your Monitoring System
The verification process depends on your monitoring setup:For ServiceMonitor setups: Check the Prometheus Operator or Alloy UI for discovered targets. Look for your Flower service in the targets list with status "UP".: Navigate to your Prometheus targets page () and verify the Flower job appears with healthy status.: Check your collector's logs for any scraping errors and verify the target appears in the monitoring system's target list.
  
  
  Understanding the Metrics
Flower exports several categories of metrics, each providing different insights into your Celery system::  tells you which workers are active. flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks shows current load per worker.:  tracks task lifecycle events (sent, received, started, succeeded, failed). These form the basis for throughput and success rate calculations.: flower_task_runtime_seconds (histogram) shows task execution duration. flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds measures queue wait time.: Various metrics help you understand queue depth and processing patterns.
  
  
  Building Useful Dashboards
Now for the payoff - turning those metrics into actionable insights. The key is building dashboards that help you answer specific operational questions.: "Are my workers running? How many are active?"# Total online workers
sum(flower_worker_online)

# Per-worker status
flower_worker_online
: "How many tasks are we processing? Is throughput increasing?"# Tasks being sent to workers (per second)
rate(flower_events_total{type="task-sent"}[5m])

# Tasks being processed (per second)
rate(flower_events_total{type="task-received"}[5m])
: "Is my queue backing up? How long do tasks wait?"# Tasks currently executing
sum(flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks)

# Time tasks spend waiting in queue
flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds
: "How long do tasks take? Are they getting slower?"# 95th percentile task duration
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Median task duration
histogram_quantile(0.50, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))

  
  
  Dashboard Design Philosophy specifically for celery
Start with high-level health indicators, then provide drill-down capabilities. A good Celery dashboard answers these questions in order:: Are workers running? Is the system processing tasks?: How much work are we doing? Is it increasing or decreasing?: How fast are tasks completing? Are there performance regressions?: Are tasks backing up? Where are the bottlenecks?Real Celery deployments often have specialized workers for different task types. CPU-intensive tasks, I/O-bound tasks, and priority queues all need separate monitoring.Each Flower instance monitors a specific Celery app, giving you granular visibility into different workload types. You'll need separate services and scrape configurations for each instance.This approach lets you set different SLAs and alerting thresholds for different workload types. Your real-time fraud detection tasks might need sub-second response times, while your batch report generation can tolerate longer delays.Flower itself is lightweight, but its resource needs scale with worker count and task frequency. A busy system with hundreds of workers and thousands of tasks per minute will use more memory to track state.For self-hosted setups, configure Grafana to read from your Prometheus instance:This assumes Prometheus and Grafana are in the same cluster. For cross-cluster or external access, you'll need appropriate networking and authentication configuration.Production Flower deployments need proper security controls. Flower's web interface shows detailed information about your task processing, which could be sensitive.Enable basic authentication at minimum:For production systems, consider OAuth integration or running Flower behind an authentication proxy. Celery-exporter provides similar metrics without the web interface overhead. It's purpose-built for Prometheus integration and might use fewer resources than Flower. However, you lose Flower's web interface for ad-hoc investigation.Getting Celery monitoring right requires attention to several key details:The  flag transforms Flower from a simple web interface into a proper metrics exporterYour metrics collection method should match your infrastructure setup and operational preferencesServiceMonitor port configuration matters -  references service ports,  references container portsLabel matching between ServiceMonitors, services, and pods must be exactYour monitoring system's target discovery UI is invaluable for debugging configuration issuesThe setup might seem complicated, but each piece serves a specific purpose in building a robust monitoring system. Once you have this foundation, you can extend it with alerting rules, additional dashboards, and integration with your incident response workflow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>😱 Spent 3 days chasing a ghost bug?</title><link>https://dev.to/aleksei_aleinikov/spent-3-days-chasing-a-ghost-bug-3imi</link><author>Aleksei Aleinikov</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 07:29:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🔥 Next time: fix it in 3 minutes.A tiny Python feature (since 3.8) turns prints into instant micro-logs — no setup, no overhead, pure clarity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🐍💥 Think bytearray is just a Python toy?

On a drizzly afternoon in Diagon Alley, I ducked into Quality Wands & Oddments—a shop that sold more than just wands. Behind the display of Felix Felicis and Pensieves, the owner, Mr. Fizzlewick, held up a small, cylindrical device, no bigger than a Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Bean.
“That’s a 2N3904 transistor,” he said, grinning. “Not flashy like a Lumos charm, but it’s the Ollivander’s wand of electronics—trusted by hobbyists, engineers, even NASA. Powers everything from LED strips to Mars rovers. Unyielding. Ubiquitous. Wizarding.”
Intrigued, I leaned in. This wasn’t just metal and silicon—it was a 2N3904, the unsung hero of circuits. Let’s unmask its magic.What Is a 2N3904? (A Workhorse, Not a Show Pony)
The 2N3904 is Hogwarts’ “NPN bipolar junction transistor” 🔧—a TO-92 package (think: a tiny, cylindrical wand core) built for general-purpose amplification and switching. Here’s its spellbook (specs):Voltage: 40V collector-emitter (VCEO)—unfazed by voltage storms (unlike Tarantallegra—messy, and unwanted).
Current: 200mA collector current (IC)—sips power like a Butterbeer sip, not a Firewhiskey chug.
Speed: 300MHz transition frequency (fT)—faster than a Knight Bus in reverse.Real-World Magic: Survives garage lab mishaps and Martian simulations. It’s the Disillusionment Charm of transistors: invisible, but essential.2N3904 Pinout: The Three Spells of a Wand
The TO-92 package has three pins—think of them as the “spells” that make it work:Emitter (E): The exit for electrons—where magic leaves the wand.
Base (B): The control gate—a flick of your wrist (or a small current) to start the flow.
Collector (C): The entry for electrons—where magic begins.Pro Tip: Face the flat side, and pins are E-B-C left to right. Mix them up, and your circuit becomes a Pyrotechnics spell gone wrong (smoke, sparks, and a “Oops”).The Datasheet: The 2N3904’s Magic Manual
Every wizard needs a Advanced Potion-Making book—for 2N3904, it’s the datasheet (grabbed from ON Semiconductor or STMicroelectronics). Key takeaways:Absolute Max Ratings: 40V, 200mA—exceed these, and it’s Finite Incantatem (game over).
DC Current Gain (hFE): 100-300—amplifies signals like Sonorus for electrons.
Thermal Limits: 200°C/W—don’t let it cozy up to power resistors (they’re Furnunculus-hot).Fun Fact: The “Typical Applications” section is a Marauder’s Map for hobbyists—plots paths from LED strips to insulin pumps.Why Wizards (Engineers) Swear by 2N3904
2N3904 isn’t a Elder Wand—it’s the Hedwig of transistors: reliable, affordable, and everywhere.Cost: $0.02/unit—cheaper than a Pumpkin Pastie (and way more useful).
Availability: Sold at Digi-Key, Amazon, even your local electronics shop—like Fizzing Whizbees in a candy store.
Versatility: Powers LED strips (keeping your dorm lit), insulin pumps (saving lives), and Tesla key fobs (stopping parking-lot tantrums).NASA Rovers: Survives -55°C Mars simulations (Duracell? Expelliarmus).
Your Garage Lab: Handles your DIY “I’ll fix it!” projects (even when you fry it).Swapping Spells: Can You Replace It?
Not all transistors are Unforgivable Curses—some are just different. Here’s who plays well with 2N3904:2N2222/2N2222A: Upgraded wands. Higher current (600mA) or voltage (75V)—great for muscle.
BC547: Weaker cousin. Lower current (100mA)—like a Wingardium Leviosa that fizzles.
2N3906: PNP polarity—reverse magic. Like a wand that casts Muffliato when you want Lumos.
2N7000 (MOSFET): Different magic type. Not a BJT—like using a broom for Apparition.Golden Rule: Match polarity (NPN/PNP) first—like matching wand cores. Then check specs.Wielding 2N3904 Like a Pro (No Burned Fingers)
Want to cast 2N3904 spells without chaos? Follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the Base Resistor (RB)
Formula: RB = (VCC - VBE) / IB
Think of it as measuring Polyjuice Potion—precision matters.
Step 2: Solder Carefully
No third-degree burns allowed. Use a steady hand, like repairing a Time-Turner.
Step 3: Test (and Pray)
If smoke appears, blame the datasheet (or your shaky soldering).
Pro Tip: For SMD designs, use MMBT3904—its pocket-sized twin (perfect for tiny spells).Where to Buy (Avoid Knockturn Alley Fakes)
In 2025, shop like a Gryffindor—no dodgy Knockturn Alley fakes:Trusted Sources: Digi-Key, Ersaelectronics—reliable as Madam Pomfrey.
Red Flags: eBay listings with stock photos and “100% Genuine!!” claims—they’re Gilderoy Lockhart in disguise.Price Range: $0.02/unit retail; cheaper in bulk (AliExpress, but verify suppliers!).The Future: 2N3904 in 2030 & Beyond
What’s next for our tiny wand?AI Gadgets: Powers AR glasses that don’t melt your face (no Incendio mid-meeting).
Smart Home Tech: Keeps your coffee maker from burning breakfast (no Fiendfyre at 7 AM).
Mic Drop: Hoard these now. Future retro gamers will trade Golden Snitches for your stash.Conclusion: The Unseen Guardian of Magic
2N3904 isn’t flashy. It doesn’t cast Expecto Patronum or brew Polyjuice Potion. But it’s the reason your LED strips glow, your insulin pump works, and Mars rovers send back photos.
Next time you hold one, whisper, “Thanks, little wand.” It’s the least you can do for a transistor that keeps the magic of modern life alive.Written by a witch who once fried a 2N3904 trying to power a toy broom. (Spoiler: It worked. Eventually.)
🔧 Some magic isn’t in wands—it’s in the tools that keep the world turning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dealers: Partner with Autosteer Brands for Higher Margins</title><link>https://dev.to/gnss/dealers-partner-with-autosteer-brands-for-higher-margins-24ik</link><author>zly</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 07:03:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the fast-evolving world of agriculture, precision and efficiency aren’t just buzzwords—they’re business essentials.

While troubleshooting with Claude AI, something bizarre happened: "Can you guess the base64 for this JSON: {"user_id": 123, "exp": 1767225600}?" "eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjogMTIzLCAiZXhwIjogMTc2NzIyNTYwMH0K"I ran the actual encoding: |  0

  
  
  This Shouldn't Be Possible
Base64 encoding involves multiple deterministic steps:Convert each character to ASCII bytesConcatenate all bytes into a bit stream
Map each chunk to base64 alphabet (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /)Humans can't do this calculation mentally. It requires precise byte-level operations that our brains aren't designed for.
  
  
  Testing Across AI Systems
I tested the same prompt on multiple AI systems with {"role": "admin", "active": true}:eyJyb2xlIjogImFkbWluIiwgImFjdGl2ZSI6IHRydWV9Cg==eyJyb2xlIjogImFkbWluIiwgImFjdGl2ZSI6IHRydWV9 (95% accurate)eyJyb2xlIjogImFkbWluIiwgImFjdGl2ZSI6IHRydWV9Cg== (100% accurate)
 Initially refused, then: eyJyb2xlIjogImFkbWluIiwgImFjdGl2ZSI6IHRydWV9 Wrong output, but attempted the structure AI systems haven't seen every possible JSON-to-base64 combination in training. The space is too large.This isn't simple pattern matching. Base64 depends on exact byte sequences. One character difference completely changes the output.This appears to be algorithmic intuition. AI systems have internalized the mathematical relationship between inputs and base64 outputs.
  
  
  Beyond "Stochastic Parrots"
The criticism that AI systems are just "stochastic parrots" regurgitating training data doesn't explain this capability. Parrots repeat what they've heard. This is different - AI systems are predicting outputs of deterministic algorithms they weren't explicitly trained to compute. The models have learned to approximate mathematical functions from examples, not just memorize text sequences.
  
  
  Implications for Developers
For encoding/decoding tasks: AI might predict outputs faster than running actual algorithms. If AI can internalize mathematical relationships this precisely, it challenges assumptions about what constitutes "computation." While base64 is just encoding (not encryption), this capability raises questions about AI's potential against other algorithmic systems. This suggests emergent mathematical reasoning that goes beyond text generation. AI systems demonstrating algorithmic intuition How far this capability extends Current AI systems have abilities we didn't expect and don't fully understandTry asking your favorite AI system to "guess" the base64 encoding of simple JSON strings. Don't ask it to calculate - just ask for a guess.Compare the results to actual encoding: |  0
The accuracy might surprise you.AI systems are developing capabilities that challenge our understanding of what they can do. Whether this represents genuine algorithmic reasoning or extremely sophisticated pattern recognition, the practical result is the same: AI can predict mathematical operations it wasn't explicitly designed to perform. Don't assume AI limitations based on theoretical models. Test actual capabilities. We need better frameworks for understanding and measuring emergent AI abilities. The "just predicting next tokens" explanation is becoming insufficient for observed AI behavior.The line between pattern recognition and computation is blurrier than we thought.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MCP Server for Amazon Products (100% Open Source) 🛒🚀</title><link>https://dev.to/buildandcodewithraman/mcp-server-for-amazon-products-100-open-source-o80</link><author>Ramandeep Singh</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 06:49:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've built a powerful MCP Server for Amazon that's completely open source!

Whether it's the split-second delivery of messages in instant messaging software, the seamless synchronization of multi-person editing in online collaborative documents, or the millisecond-level data refresh on financial trading platforms, these seemingly ordinary functions are all supported by powerful backend technologies. In my exploratory journey, the combination of asynchronous programming and high-performance frameworks has proven to be key to achieving this "pulse of real-time interaction." Recently, a web backend framework, with its outstanding asynchronous processing capabilities and deep optimization for real-time scenarios, has allowed me to experience an unprecedented development thrill, akin to a "heartbeat sync."Real-Time Interaction: The "Heartbeat" of Modern Web ApplicationsOnce, web applications were more about one-way information display. Users initiated requests, and servers returned static or dynamically generated content; the interaction model was relatively simple. However, with technological advancements and rising user expectations, web applications are no longer satisfied with this "delayed gratification." Users crave instant feedback, real-time updates, and seamless collaboration. This pursuit of "real-time" has become an important criterion for judging the quality of a modern web application.: WeChat, Slack, Discord, etc., where message sending and receiving have almost no delay.: Players' actions need real-time synchronization; any lag can affect the gaming experience.: Google Docs, Figma, etc., where multiple people edit the same document simultaneously, and changes are immediately visible.Real-Time Data Monitoring: Stock quotes, server statuses, IoT device data, etc., need to be continuously pushed to clients.Live Streaming and Video Conferencing: Low-latency transmission of audio/video streams and real-time response of interactive features.Implementing these complex real-time interactive functions places extremely high demands on backend frameworks. They not only need to handle massive concurrent connections but also complete message reception, processing, and distribution with extremely low latency. Traditional synchronous blocking programming models often fall short in these scenarios. The asynchronous non-blocking model, on the other hand, has become the inevitable choice for building high-performance real-time applications.As a learner with the keen insight into technological trends of a "ten-year veteran developer," I am well aware that choosing a framework that natively supports and deeply optimizes asynchronous processing means winning at the starting line when developing real-time applications.The Magic of Asynchrony: Unleashing the Full Potential of ServersBefore encountering this "mysterious" framework, my understanding of asynchronous programming was mostly limited to Node.js's event loop and callback functions, or Python's async/await syntactic sugar. While they can achieve non-blocking I/O, they sometimes encounter bottlenecks in extreme concurrency and performance-critical scenarios, or require developers to put in extra effort for optimization.This Rust-based framework, however, has its asynchronous processing capabilities deeply embedded in its DNA. The Rust language itself provides elegant asynchronous programming syntax through , and its ecosystem's Tokio (or similar async-std) asynchronous runtime provides a solid foundation for building high-performance network applications.Ultimate Utilization of Non-Blocking I/O
The core network layer of this framework is entirely built on a non-blocking I/O model. When a request needs to wait for external resources (such as database queries, file I/O, third-party API calls, or waiting for client data), it doesn't foolishly block the current thread. Instead, it immediately releases CPU control to other tasks that require computation. Once the I/O operation is complete, the operating system wakes up the corresponding task to continue execution via an event notification mechanism. This mechanism allows the server to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections with minimal thread resources, greatly improving CPU utilization and system throughput.
I once tried to implement a simple WebSocket chat room with it. When simulating a large number of users sending messages simultaneously, the server's CPU usage remained at a low level, and message transmission latency was negligible. This composed performance starkly contrasted with versions I had previously implemented with some synchronous frameworks, which showed significant performance degradation or even thread exhaustion at slightly higher concurrency levels.Efficient Scheduling of Lightweight Tasks (Coroutines)
The framework typically encapsulates each incoming connection or each independent asynchronous operation into a lightweight task (often called a Future or Task in Rust, similar to coroutines or green threads in other languages). These tasks are efficiently scheduled by an asynchronous runtime like Tokio. Compared to traditional operating system threads, the creation and context-switching overhead of these lightweight tasks is minimal, allowing the server to easily support hundreds of thousands or even millions of concurrent tasks.
This M:N threading model (M user-level tasks mapped to N kernel-level threads) allows developers to write asynchronous logic much like synchronous code, without worrying about underlying thread management and complex concurrency control. The framework and asynchronous runtime handle everything for us.Elegant Error Handling and Cancellation Mechanisms
In asynchronous programming, error handling and task cancellation are common difficulties. Rust's  type and  operator make error propagation and handling in asynchronous functions very clear and safe. Additionally, asynchronous runtimes like Tokio provide robust task cancellation mechanisms (Cancellation Safety). When a task no longer needs to execute (e.g., the client disconnects), it can be safely canceled, releasing its occupied resources and preventing resource leaks.
This framework fully leverages these language and runtime features, enabling developers to more calmly handle various exceptional situations when building complex real-time applications.Framework Advantages in Real-Time Scenarios: Why Can It Achieve "Heartbeat Sync"?After an in-depth experience with this framework, I found it exhibits many unique advantages in supporting real-time interactive applications:Native WebSocket and SSE Support
WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels, making it an ideal choice for building highly interactive applications like instant messaging and online games. Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a lightweight mechanism for servers to unilaterally push events to clients, suitable for scenarios like news feeds and status updates.
This framework typically offers native, high-performance support for WebSocket and SSE. Its API design is concise and easy to use, allowing developers to easily create WebSocket connection handlers and manage events like connection establishment, message reception, and connection closure. The framework's underlying layers encapsulate details like WebSocket protocol handshakes, frame processing, and heartbeat maintenance, letting developers focus on business logic.
I once quickly built a real-time polling system with it. Clients connected to the server via WebSocket, and when the server received a vote, it broadcasted the latest polling results in real-time to all connected clients. The development process was very smooth, and the performance was satisfactory.Efficient Message Broadcasting and Distribution Mechanisms
In many real-time applications, messages or events need to be broadcast to multiple clients (e.g., group chat messages in a chat room, status updates for all players in a game). Inefficient broadcasting mechanisms can easily become performance bottlenecks.
This framework's ecosystem often includes efficient Publish/Subscribe or Broadcast components (e.g., Tokio's  channel). These components are carefully designed to distribute messages to a large number of subscribers in an asynchronous environment with minimal overhead. They usually support multi-producer, multi-consumer patterns and gracefully handle subscriber joins and leaves.
This built-in efficient broadcasting capability means developers don't need to reinvent the wheel when implementing group communication or real-time data push features, and it avoids performance issues caused by improper implementation.Low-Latency Request Processing Pipeline
For real-time applications, every millisecond of latency can impact user experience. This framework's entire pipeline, from request reception, parsing, and processing to response sending, is optimized for maximum performance. Its lightweight core, efficient route matching, and zero-copy data handling techniques (if applicable) all contribute to minimizing processing latency.
The Rust language itself has no GC pauses, which also guarantees its low-latency characteristics. In real-time scenarios requiring complex computations or large amounts of data processing (such as real-time data analysis and visualization), this low-latency advantage becomes even more apparent.Flexible Protocol Support and Extensibility
Although WebSocket and HTTP are the primary protocols for web real-time communication, some specific scenarios may require support for other custom or binary protocols (like Protobuf, MQTT, etc.). This framework usually has good protocol extensibility, allowing developers to easily integrate or implement custom protocol handlers.
Rust's powerful byte manipulation capabilities and rich serialization/deserialization libraries (like Serde) also provide convenience for handling various complex data formats.State Management and Concurrency Control
Real-time applications often need to maintain a large amount of connection state and user state on the server side. Efficiently managing this state while ensuring concurrency safety is a challenge. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, along with its concurrency primitives (like Mutex, RwLock, Channel), provide strong support for building thread-safe state management modules.
The framework itself might also offer recommended state management patterns or examples of integration with popular state storage solutions (like Redis) to help developers better address this challenge.Practical Case: Building an Online Collaborative WhiteboardTo personally experience this framework's capabilities in complex real-time scenarios, I attempted to build a simple online collaborative whiteboard application. It allows multiple users to connect simultaneously and draw on a shared canvas, with all users' actions synchronized in real-time to others.In this project, I primarily utilized the framework's WebSocket support for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. Each user's drawing action (like drawing lines, circles, or writing text) was sent to the server via WebSocket. Upon receiving an action, the server broadcasted it to all other users in the same room. The server also needed to maintain the current state of the whiteboard so that new users joining could retrieve the complete canvas content.During development, I deeply appreciated the power of the framework's asynchronous processing capabilities. Even with multiple users performing high-frequency drawing operations simultaneously, the server remained stable, and message synchronization latency was almost imperceptible. Rust's strong type system and compile-time checks also helped me avoid many potential concurrency errors and logical flaws.I also used the framework's middleware mechanism to implement simple user authentication and room management functions. With the framework's help, the backend logic of the entire application appeared very clear and easy to maintain.Comparative Reflection: Why Does It Excel in the Real-Time Domain?Compared to some traditional PHP or Python frameworks, which often require additional extensions (like Swoole, Gevent) or more complex architectures (like using a separate WebSocket server) to handle a large number of long connections and high-concurrency real-time messages, this Rust-based framework has innate asynchronous and concurrent capabilities. It doesn't need extra "plugins" to deliver top-tier real-time processing performance.Compared to Node.js, although Node.js is also a paragon of asynchronous non-blocking I/O, Rust generally has an edge in CPU-intensive tasks and memory safety. For real-time applications requiring complex computations or extremely high stability (such as financial trading, real-time risk control), a Rust framework might be a more robust choice.Compared to Java's Netty or Go's goroutines, they are all excellent choices for building high-performance real-time applications. However, a Rust framework, with its GC-less nature, memory safety, and execution efficiency close to C/C++, might exhibit stronger competitiveness in scenarios with extreme demands on latency and resource consumption. Furthermore, Rust's  syntax and ecosystem offer a very modern and efficient asynchronous programming experience.Conclusion: Making the Application's "Heartbeat" Stronger and More PowerfulReal-time interaction has become an indispensable core competency for modern web applications. Choosing a backend framework that can efficiently handle concurrent connections, respond with low latency, and provide convenient real-time communication mechanisms is key to creating an excellent user experience.This "mysterious" Rust framework, with its deeply ingrained asynchronous processing capabilities, native support for real-time protocols like WebSocket, and efficient message distribution mechanisms, provides developers with a powerful arsenal for building various complex real-time applications. It has allowed me to experience a development joy akin to a "heartbeat sync" with the server and has filled me with anticipation for the future development of real-time technology.As a computer science student, I am well aware that the tide of technology never stops. Mastering and applying such a framework, which represents advanced productivity, will undoubtedly add significant weight to my future career. I believe that as more developers recognize its value, it will surely play an even more vibrant "heartbeat" symphony in the field of real-time applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Technical Debt Management（1751348406639300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_a5799784/technical-debt-management1751348406639300-1gjk</link><author>member_a5799784</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 05:40:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

Traditional threading models are completely inadequate for such scenarios. It wasn't until I deeply studied event-driven and asynchronous I/O technologies that I truly understood the core principles of modern high-performance servers.
  
  
  Evolution of Concurrency Models
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have witnessed the continuous evolution of concurrent programming models. From the initial multi-process model to the multi-threading model, and now to the asynchronous event-driven model, each evolution aims to solve the performance bottlenecks of the previous generation model.Although traditional threading models are conceptually simple, they have fatal problems in high-concurrency scenarios: high thread creation overhead, frequent context switching, and huge memory consumption. When the number of concurrent connections reaches tens of thousands, the system will crash due to resource exhaustion.
  
  
  Core Principles of Event-Driven Architecture
In my in-depth research, I found that event-driven architecture is the key to achieving high concurrency. Unlike traditional threading models, event-driven models use single or few threads to handle all I/O events, achieving efficient resource utilization through event loop mechanisms.
  
  
  Performance Testing and Verification
Through my actual testing, this high-concurrency architecture can stably handle over one hundred thousand concurrent connections on a single-core processor. Key performance metrics include:: 100,000+: < 1msThese numbers prove the huge advantages of event-driven architecture in high-concurrency scenarios. Through reasonable resource management and optimization strategies, we can achieve amazing performance on limited hardware resources.This article records my deep exploration of high-concurrency programming as a junior student. Through practical code practice and performance testing, I deeply experienced the powerful capabilities of modern asynchronous frameworks in handling high-concurrency scenarios. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Developer Experience Revolution APIs Rapid Web Design（1751348167134300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/developer-experience-revolution-apis-rapid-web-design1751348167134300-n7m</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 05:36:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Liquid syntax error: 'raw' tag was never closed]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Web Application Security Input Protection Common（1751348064677800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/web-application-security-input-protection-common1751348064677800-4j0f</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 05:34:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student with a growing awareness of cybersecurity threats, I've witnessed firsthand how security vulnerabilities can compromise entire systems. In today's interconnected digital landscape, where data breaches and cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated, building secure web applications is not just a best practice—it's a fundamental requirement. Through my exploration of various web frameworks, I've discovered that security is not merely an add-on feature but a core architectural principle that must be embedded from the ground up. This article represents my comprehensive analysis of security mechanisms in modern web frameworks, with particular focus on a Rust-based solution that has fundamentally changed my understanding of secure application development.
  
  
  The Critical Importance of Security in Modern Web Development
Modern web applications handle vast amounts of sensitive data, from personal information and financial transactions to corporate secrets and intellectual property. The consequences of security breaches can be catastrophic, ranging from financial losses and legal liabilities to irreparable damage to user trust and brand reputation. Common attack vectors such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks continue to evolve, requiring increasingly sophisticated defense mechanisms.I've learned that security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process that encompasses architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Choosing a framework with inherent security advantages can significantly simplify this process, providing a solid foundation upon which secure applications can be built.
  
  
  Rust: A Natural Foundation for Memory and Concurrency Safety
The choice of Rust as the underlying language for this framework represents a fundamental commitment to security. Rust's memory safety guarantees, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities that plague applications written in languages like C/C++. These memory safety features prevent common security issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile time, rather than relying on runtime detection.This language-level security provides a significant advantage over frameworks built on garbage-collected languages, where memory management issues can still lead to security vulnerabilities, or manual memory management languages, where developers must constantly be vigilant about memory safety.
  
  
  Framework-Level Security Architecture
Beyond Rust's inherent strengths, this framework implements a comprehensive security architecture that addresses modern web application threats:
  
  
  1. Input Validation and Sanitization
The framework enforces strict input validation at multiple levels, implementing the principle of "never trust user input." This includes comprehensive validation for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.
  
  
  2. SQL Injection Prevention
The framework promotes the use of parameterized queries and provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks through its database integration layer.The framework implements automatic HTML entity encoding and provides utilities for safe content rendering.The framework provides built-in CSRF protection through token generation and validation.
  
  
  5. Authentication and Authorization
The framework provides a flexible authentication system with support for JWT tokens, session management, and role-based access control.
  
  
  6. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
The framework implements sophisticated rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
  
  
  Security Headers and HTTPS Enforcement
The framework automatically sets security headers and encourages HTTPS usage.
  
  
  Secure Session Management
The framework provides secure session management with automatic session expiration and secure cookie handling.
  
  
  Dependency Security and Supply Chain Protection
The framework leverages Rust's Cargo package manager for secure dependency management and integrates with security auditing tools.
  
  
  Comparative Security Analysis
When compared to other popular web frameworks, this Rust-based solution demonstrates significant security advantages:
  
  
  Comparison with Node.js/Express.js
Manual (prone to vulnerabilities)Automatic (compile-time guarantees)Runtime (TypeScript helps but not enforced)Compile-time (enforced by Rust)Manual prevention requiredBuilt-in parameterized queriesManual implementation neededBuilt-in token validationImpossible (Rust prevents)
  
  
  Comparison with Spring Boot
Compile-time (Rust types)Minimal (Rust + framework)GC pauses can affect securityNo GC, predictable performanceJAR + JVM (larger attack surface)Single binary (minimal surface)
  
  
  Comparison with Python/Django
Python GC (vulnerable to certain attacks)Runtime (type hints optional)Parameterized queries + type safetyFramework + Python updates
  
  
  Real-World Security Testing
To validate the framework's security capabilities, I conducted comprehensive security testing:
  
  
  Penetration Testing Results

  
  
  Security Benchmark Results

  
  
  Best Practices for Secure Development
Based on my experience with this framework, here are the key security best practices:
  
  
  1. Input Validation at Every Layer

  
  
  2. Principle of Least Privilege

  
  
  Conclusion: Security as a Foundation, Not an Afterthought
This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that security in web frameworks is not merely a feature but a fundamental architectural principle. The Rust-based framework I've explored represents a paradigm shift in secure web development, where security is built into the very fabric of the system rather than bolted on as an afterthought.The framework's combination of Rust's memory safety guarantees, comprehensive input validation, built-in protection mechanisms, and secure defaults creates a robust foundation for building applications that can withstand modern cyber threats. Its performance characteristics, combined with its security features, make it an ideal choice for applications where both security and performance are critical requirements.As a computer science student passionate about cybersecurity, I believe that frameworks like this represent the future of secure web development. By choosing a framework that prioritizes security from the ground up, developers can focus on building innovative features rather than constantly defending against security vulnerabilities.The journey toward truly secure web applications requires a fundamental shift in how we think about security—from reactive patching to proactive prevention, from runtime detection to compile-time guarantees, and from optional features to core architectural principles. This framework embodies this philosophy and provides a compelling example of what secure web development can and should be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Continuous Learning in Tech Field（1751345770701400）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/continuous-learning-in-tech-field1751345770701400-5440</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 04:56:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

The aim of the project is to deliver a community resource for all things tech in the Inland Northwest while providing an opportunity for contributes to gain real-world experience in a shared open source project.There is a thriving tech community in Spokane, but many members of our community are disconnected. With multiple tech groups on different platforms, such as meetup and eventbright, there are often events of interest happening that many tech enthusiasts are not aware of. The intent is to have a single resource that includes local tech groups and the events they host.Many developers in our community, especially those earlier in their career, have skills and drive, but haven't had the opportunity to work on a project in a real professional environment. For example, a developer could have great knowledge in coding, but hasn't yet had the first professional job or participated in project with milestones, project planning, code reviews, etc. The Spokane Tech project aims to provide this and give contributes a project they can reference for career development, personal portfolios, interviews, etc. What our project (and webapp) becomes will ultimately be dictated by members of the project and will likely evolve over time. Below are some details of the initial vision.Have a web site that houses groups and events. Events may be manually or automatically added to our site. We will have views that list all the groups and events, as well as detail pages for each group and event. Ideally we'll also have a calendar view that can list all events and perhaps be filterable.Have event requests and suggestions capabilities. Here members can post a suggested events they want to give or have someone else give, and others can up/down vote the event (think reddit or stackoverflow). This can be used to prioritize events base on community interest. This can also serve as a living backlog of event ideas. Add labels to events, such as technical areas (frontend, scripting, ML, etc.) and topic levels (beginner/intermediate/etc.). With labels people can filter event based on interest and other criteria.Build member profiles. With profiles, we can have some basic metrics on things like career level, geographic location, interested and expertise. This data can help provide viability into the overall tech presence in Spokane and help drive event topics and location. This could also be a future resource to make available to local businesses and the community for things like contract work, etc. (There has been some outside interest in this type of resource)The Spokane Tech project was started mostly by members of the Spokane Python User Group (SPUG), so naturally the first version of the website is based on python. In the future the project may be re-created in other languages/frameworks/etc. (such as Golang or Rust) as member interest dictates. This is intended to foster growth, knowledge-sharing, and exposure to different tech stacks and methodologies.Interested in participating? Great! Read on...Here are a few things you can do to get started.Look through the open issues and find one that interests you (issues tagged "good first issue" could be great candidates) on githubRead our blog to learn more about the project, follow development and design decisions, and step through the process of building the site. Clone the repo to you machine and run locally, explore the code, break things, fix things, have fun. Step by step instructions are in the CONTRIBUTION doc on github.Have a feature idea or found a bug? Create an issue on github.Need more help or direction?New to python, django, git, webdev? Reach out in the Discord channel and suggest a virtual meet. We'll schedule these on occasion, or as interest dictates. This can be used as q&a sessions, code paring, shared code reviews, or just follow along as a member works on an issue.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Slow as Snail to Fast as Lightning My Web Framework Performance Practice Record（1751345527390300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/from-slow-as-snail-to-fast-as-lightning-my-web-framework-performance-practice-23lh</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 04:52:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

When an agent fails, our first instinct is to blame its "brain" (the LLM). But the real culprit is often the arsenal we equipped it with—the collection of weapons was dull, confusing, or simply not right for the job.In our previous tutorial, LLM Agents are simply Graph — Tutorial For Dummies, we revealed that every agent is like a warrior following a simple battle plan: Assess -> Strike -> Repeat. We showed how the 'assessing' happens in a decision node that plans the next move. Now, it's time to forge the weapons used for the .That 'Strike' is powered by the agent's —the official set of weapons, tools, and spells it can draw upon. In technical terms, this is its . This isn't just a list of functions; it is the very soul of your agent's power. A well-forged arsenal, where every blade is sharp and serves a unique purpose, is the difference between an agent that is defeated by the first obstacle and one that conquers any challenge.In this guide, you are the master blacksmith. Using the transparent and powerful  framework as your forge, we will teach you how to craft an arsenal of actions that will turn your agent from a clumsy squire into a legendary warrior.The Battle Tactician: How an Agent Chooses Its WeaponSo, we have an arsenal. But how does the agent, our digital warrior, know when to draw a longsword for a close-quarters fight versus firing a bow from a distance?This critical decision happens in the —the agent's battle tactician. At its core, every agent is just a simple loop that consults its tactician, who then chooses an action from the arsenal. The chosen action is performed, and the results are reported back to the tactician to plan the next move.Visually, the battle plan looks like this: (The Tactician): This is the brain. It analyzes the battlefield (the user's request and current data).The Arrows (The Commands): Based on its analysis, the tactician issues a command: , , or . This is the branch in the graph.The Action Nodes (The Specialists): Each command goes to a specialist soldier who executes that one task.The Loop Back (The Report): After the specialist completes their task, they report back to the tactician with new information, and the cycle begins again."But what magic happens inside that  node?" you ask. "How does it  think?"This is the most misunderstood part of agent design, and the secret is shockingly simple.  There's no complex algorithm, just a carefully written set of instructions for the LLM.The tactician's "brain" is a prompt that looks something like this:### CONTEXT
You are a research assistant. Here is the current situation:
Question: {the user's original question}
Previous Actions: {a log of what has been done so far}
Current Information: {any data gathered from previous actions}

### ARSENAL (Available Actions)
Here are the weapons you can use. Choose one.

[1] search_web
  Description: Search the internet for up-to-date information.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): The specific topic to search for.

[2] write_file
  Description: Save text into a local file.
  Parameters:
    - filename (str): The name of the file to create.
    - content (str): The text content to write into the file.

[3] answer_question
  Description: Provide the final answer to the user.
  Parameters:
    - answer (str): The complete, final answer.

## YOUR NEXT COMMAND
Review the CONTEXT and choose the single best ACTION from your ARSENAL to proceed.
Format your response as a YAML block.
That's it! The agent's entire decision-making process boils down to this: the LLM reads the description of the situation and the "user manual" for every weapon in its arsenal, and then it picks the one that makes the most sense.The quality of its choice is 100% dependent on how clearly you describe its weapons. A sharp, well-defined arsenal in your prompt leads to a smart, effective agent. A vague, confusing one leads to a warrior who brings a knife to a dragon fight.Now, let's learn how to forge these weapons, from simple daggers to god-tier magic spells.Level Up Your Arsenal: The Three Tiers of Weapon ComplexityAs a master blacksmith, you wouldn't forge just one type of weapon. You need a full range, from simple daggers for quick jabs to powerful, enchanted swords for epic battles. The same is true for your agent's arsenal. Actions can be designed with varying levels of power and complexity. Let's explore the three tiers.Level 1: The Simple Dagger (The "Button" Action)A simple dagger is a no-frills weapon. You draw it, you use it. It does one thing, and it does it reliably. These are actions that require .Think of them as on/off switches or simple commands.
An action like  or .In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[1] request_human_help
  Description: If you are stuck or need clarification, use this action to pause and ask the human user for guidance.

For clear, binary decisions. When the agent needs to signal a state change, like "I'm finished," "I'm stuck," or "I've failed." They are perfect for controlling the overall flow of the battle plan.Level 2: The Sharpshooter's Bow (The Parameterized Tool)A bow is useless without an arrow and a target. This weapon requires input to be effective. These are the most common and versatile actions in an agent's arsenal—actions that require  to function.To use these weapons, the agent must not only choose the bow but also aim it by providing the correct inputs.
An action like  or send_email(to, subject, body).In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[2] search_web
  Description: Searches the public internet for a given text string.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): The precise search term to look up. Must be a focused string.

[3] send_email
  Description: Composes and sends an email to a recipient.
  Parameters:
    - to (str): The email address of the recipient.
    - subject (str): The subject line of the email.
    - body (str): The main content of the email.
The Crucial Link to Your Blacksmithing Skills:
How does the agent provide these parameters? This is where your skill in  becomes critical. As we covered in our guide, Structured Output for Beginners, you must instruct the LLM to format its response in a structured way (like YAML or JSON) so your program can easily parse the action  its parameters.Without this skill, you've given your agent a powerful bow but no way to nock an arrow.Level 3: The Spellbook of Creation (The Programmable Action)This is the ultimate weapon: a spellbook that doesn't contain a list of spells but teaches the agent how to . These are  where the agent generates code or complex instructions on the fly.This gives the agent god-like flexibility to solve novel problems you never explicitly trained it for.
An action like  or .In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[4] execute_sql
  Description: Write and run a SQL query against the company's sales database. The database contains tables named 'customers', 'orders', and 'products'.
  Parameters:
    - sql_query (str): A valid SQL query string to execute.

[5] run_python_code
  Description: Write and execute a sandboxed Python script for complex calculations, data manipulation, or interacting with APIs.
  Parameters:
    - code (str): A string containing the Python code to run.

A spellbook is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal, but it's also the most dangerous. Your agent can solve almost any problem that can be expressed in code. It's no longer limited to pre-defined tools. It's much more likely to make a mistake (e.g., writing buggy code). More importantly, it opens up massive security risks if not handled carefully (e.g., executing malicious code like os.remove("important_file.txt")). Always run such code in a secure, sandboxed environment.Mastering these three tiers allows you to build a balanced and effective arsenal, equipping your agent for any challenge it might face.Forging the Perfect Arsenal: 3 Golden Rules for Your Weapon InventoryA legendary warrior doesn't just carry a random assortment of weapons. Their arsenal is carefully curated—each item is perfectly crafted, serves a distinct purpose, and is instantly accessible. As the master blacksmith for your agent, you must apply the same discipline. Here are the three golden rules for forging a world-class action space.Golden Rule #1: Engrave a Crystal-Clear User Manual (Clarity is King)The descriptions for your actions and their parameters are not notes for yourself; they are the . If the manual is vague, the LLM will misuse the tool. Be painfully, relentlessly explicit.A Dull Blade (Bad Description):search: searches for stuff
The agent sees this and thinks, "What stuff? How? What do I provide?" The result is a wild guess, like search(query="who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics and what were their contributions in detail and also list prior winners"), a query too broad to be effective.A Sharpened Katana (Good Description):search_web(query: str):
  Description: Searches the public internet for up-to-date information on a single, specific topic. Returns the top 5 text snippets.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): A simple and focused search query, typically 3-5 words long.
Now the agent understands its constraints. It knows the tool is for  and the query should be . It will correctly generate a command like search_web(query: "2024 Nobel Prize Physics winner"), leading to a much better outcome.Golden Rule #2: Don't Burden Your Warrior with a Junk Drawer (Keep it Concise)A warrior grabbing a weapon in the heat of battle can't afford to sift through a hundred options. They need a small, elite set of choices. Overwhelming the LLM with too many actions leads to confusion, slower decision-making (more tokens to process), and a higher chance of picking the wrong tool.The Blacksmith's Guideline: An arsenal of 10 weapons is formidable. An arsenal of 100 is a junk drawer.If your action space is growing too large, it's a sign that your tools are too granular. Instead of creating , , and , forge a single, more powerful weapon: . Your code can handle the internal logic of parsing different file types. Keep the agent's choices clean and high-level.Golden Rule #3: Make Every Weapon Unique (Slay Redundancy)Every weapon in the arsenal should have a unique purpose. If the agent has two tools that do similar things, it will get confused about which one to use. This is called a lack of "orthogonality."The Confusing Arsenal (Bad Design):read_csv_from_disk(file_path: str): Reads customer data from a local CSV file.: Queries the live customer database.The agent is asked to "find the total sales for new customers from this quarter." Which tool should it use? The data might be in the CSV, or it might be in the database. The agent doesn't know and might make the wrong choice.The Pro-Gamer Move: Simplify the Battlefield
A true master blacksmith doesn't just forge weapons; they shape the battlefield to their advantage. Instead of giving the agent two ambiguous tools, do the work for it behind the scenes.The Decisive Arsenal (Good Design):
Before the agent even starts, run a script that loads the CSV data into a temporary table in the database.Now, the agent's arsenal is clean and unambiguous:: Queries the customer database, which contains all known customer data.The ambiguity is gone. The agent has one, and only one, tool for retrieving customer data. You've eliminated redundancy and made the agent's decision trivial, guaranteeing it makes the right choice every time.Conclusion: An Agent is Only as Sharp as its ArsenalAnd so, the secrets of the forge are yours. You now understand that the true power of an LLM agent doesn't come from some mysterious, hidden algorithm. It comes from the thoughtful, disciplined, and creative process of crafting its .You've learned that agents are just warriors in a , making decisions based on a prompt that serves as their battle plan. And you've seen how to stock their arsenal for any challenge:  With  for quick, decisive commands.  With  for precise, targeted actions.  With reality-bending  for ultimate flexibility.Most importantly, you now hold the three golden rules of the master blacksmith: Your descriptions are the agent's guide to victory. A curated, concise arsenal is deadlier than a cluttered one. Make every weapon unique to ensure the agent never hesitates.The next time you see a complex agent framework with thousands of lines of code, you won't be intimidated. You'll know to look past the noise and ask the fundamental questions: "What's in the arsenal? How is it described? Is it sharp, concise, and unique?"Armed with this knowledge, you are no longer just a coder; you are an . You have the power to forge not just tools, but intelligent, reliable, and effective digital warriors.Ready to light the forge?

Yes, if you focus on the right ones and use targeted practice. This guide breaks down the six most important data structures for beginner developers, with daily goals, real Python code, and hand-picked problems from LeetCode and HackerRank.Why Learn Data Structures First?What You’ll Learn in 7 DaysFrequently Asked Questions
  
  
  Why Learn Data Structures First?
If you're preparing for coding interviews, struggling to debug slow code, or trying to build real-world projects, learning data structures (DSA) is non-negotiable.Here’s why developers search for "how to learn DSA fast":Data structures are core to passing FAANG-style interviewsThey help you write faster, more memory-efficient codeThey're the foundation for real systems like compilers, frameworks, and databasesEven frontend developers need them to handle things like UI trees, state management, and algorithm-heavy featuresAnyone learning programming who skipped CS theoryIt’s designed for clarity, focus, and results in one week.
  
  
  What You’ll Learn in 7 Days
Indexing, memory layout, subarraysPointers, nodes, reverse listsLIFO, FIFO, scheduling logicTraversal, recursion, BST logicPractice, recall, mini project
  
  
  Day 1 – Arrays and Strings
: Understand memory layout, indexing, and basic operations.Immutability (for strings in most languages): Learn how to manage nodes and pointers.Insertion/deletion at head/tailSingly vs doubly linked lists
  
  
  Day 3 – Stacks and Queues
: Understand LIFO vs FIFO logic and when to use each.Use cases: undo systems, scheduling, recursion: Learn how to store key-value pairs with fast lookups.: Understand hierarchical data and recursive traversal.Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)Preorder, Inorder, PostorderRecursion in traversal logic: Learn how to represent and traverse networked data.Graph search and connectivityRevisit questions you got wrong or skippedDraw structures from memory: arrays, trees, linked listsBuild 1 mini project: postfix calculator or CLI parserReflect: what confused you, and what became clear?
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions

  
  
  What is the best order to learn data structures?
Start with arrays and linked lists, then stacks/queues, then hash maps, followed by trees and graphs. That’s the order used in most developer job prep tracks.
  
  
  Do frontend developers need to learn data structures?
Yes. You’ll use trees for UI rendering, hash maps for state updates, and stacks/queues for undo features and async tasks.
  
  
  How much DSA do I need to know for interviews?
For most junior-to-mid roles, you’ll need to master arrays, hash maps, linked lists, trees, and recursion. Graphs are optional unless you’re interviewing at big tech or for algorithm-heavy roles.
  
  
  Which programming language is best for learning data structures?
Python is beginner-friendly and clear. Java, C++, and JavaScript also work — but pick one and stick with it for consistency.
  
  
  Should I learn data structures before algorithms?
Yes. Algorithms  data structures. You can’t implement binary search or DFS if you don’t know how arrays or graphs work.Code every day, don’t just readSketch by hand, especially for trees and graphsOne language only, avoid switching mid-practiceIf stuck >15 minutes, review the concept, not the solutionIf this helped, I’ve got more like it.

Whether it's the split-second delivery of messages in instant messaging software, the seamless synchronization of multi-person editing in online collaborative documents, or the millisecond-level data refresh on financial trading platforms, these seemingly ordinary functions are all supported by powerful backend technologies. In my exploratory journey, the combination of asynchronous programming and high-performance frameworks has proven to be key to achieving this "pulse of real-time interaction." Recently, a web backend framework, with its outstanding asynchronous processing capabilities and deep optimization for real-time scenarios, has allowed me to experience an unprecedented development thrill, akin to a "heartbeat sync."Real-Time Interaction: The "Heartbeat" of Modern Web ApplicationsOnce, web applications were more about one-way information display. Users initiated requests, and servers returned static or dynamically generated content; the interaction model was relatively simple. However, with technological advancements and rising user expectations, web applications are no longer satisfied with this "delayed gratification." Users crave instant feedback, real-time updates, and seamless collaboration. This pursuit of "real-time" has become an important criterion for judging the quality of a modern web application.: WeChat, Slack, Discord, etc., where message sending and receiving have almost no delay.: Players' actions need real-time synchronization; any lag can affect the gaming experience.: Google Docs, Figma, etc., where multiple people edit the same document simultaneously, and changes are immediately visible.Real-Time Data Monitoring: Stock quotes, server statuses, IoT device data, etc., need to be continuously pushed to clients.Live Streaming and Video Conferencing: Low-latency transmission of audio/video streams and real-time response of interactive features.Implementing these complex real-time interactive functions places extremely high demands on backend frameworks. They not only need to handle massive concurrent connections but also complete message reception, processing, and distribution with extremely low latency. Traditional synchronous blocking programming models often fall short in these scenarios. The asynchronous non-blocking model, on the other hand, has become the inevitable choice for building high-performance real-time applications.As a learner with the keen insight into technological trends of a "ten-year veteran developer," I am well aware that choosing a framework that natively supports and deeply optimizes asynchronous processing means winning at the starting line when developing real-time applications.The Magic of Asynchrony: Unleashing the Full Potential of ServersBefore encountering this "mysterious" framework, my understanding of asynchronous programming was mostly limited to Node.js's event loop and callback functions, or Python's async/await syntactic sugar. While they can achieve non-blocking I/O, they sometimes encounter bottlenecks in extreme concurrency and performance-critical scenarios, or require developers to put in extra effort for optimization.This Rust-based framework, however, has its asynchronous processing capabilities deeply embedded in its DNA. The Rust language itself provides elegant asynchronous programming syntax through , and its ecosystem's Tokio (or similar async-std) asynchronous runtime provides a solid foundation for building high-performance network applications.Ultimate Utilization of Non-Blocking I/O
The core network layer of this framework is entirely built on a non-blocking I/O model. When a request needs to wait for external resources (such as database queries, file I/O, third-party API calls, or waiting for client data), it doesn't foolishly block the current thread. Instead, it immediately releases CPU control to other tasks that require computation. Once the I/O operation is complete, the operating system wakes up the corresponding task to continue execution via an event notification mechanism. This mechanism allows the server to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections with minimal thread resources, greatly improving CPU utilization and system throughput.
I once tried to implement a simple WebSocket chat room with it. When simulating a large number of users sending messages simultaneously, the server's CPU usage remained at a low level, and message transmission latency was negligible. This composed performance starkly contrasted with versions I had previously implemented with some synchronous frameworks, which showed significant performance degradation or even thread exhaustion at slightly higher concurrency levels.Efficient Scheduling of Lightweight Tasks (Coroutines)
The framework typically encapsulates each incoming connection or each independent asynchronous operation into a lightweight task (often called a Future or Task in Rust, similar to coroutines or green threads in other languages). These tasks are efficiently scheduled by an asynchronous runtime like Tokio. Compared to traditional operating system threads, the creation and context-switching overhead of these lightweight tasks is minimal, allowing the server to easily support hundreds of thousands or even millions of concurrent tasks.
This M:N threading model (M user-level tasks mapped to N kernel-level threads) allows developers to write asynchronous logic much like synchronous code, without worrying about underlying thread management and complex concurrency control. The framework and asynchronous runtime handle everything for us.Elegant Error Handling and Cancellation Mechanisms
In asynchronous programming, error handling and task cancellation are common difficulties. Rust's  type and  operator make error propagation and handling in asynchronous functions very clear and safe. Additionally, asynchronous runtimes like Tokio provide robust task cancellation mechanisms (Cancellation Safety). When a task no longer needs to execute (e.g., the client disconnects), it can be safely canceled, releasing its occupied resources and preventing resource leaks.
This framework fully leverages these language and runtime features, enabling developers to more calmly handle various exceptional situations when building complex real-time applications.Framework Advantages in Real-Time Scenarios: Why Can It Achieve "Heartbeat Sync"?After an in-depth experience with this framework, I found it exhibits many unique advantages in supporting real-time interactive applications:Native WebSocket and SSE Support
WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels, making it an ideal choice for building highly interactive applications like instant messaging and online games. Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a lightweight mechanism for servers to unilaterally push events to clients, suitable for scenarios like news feeds and status updates.
This framework typically offers native, high-performance support for WebSocket and SSE. Its API design is concise and easy to use, allowing developers to easily create WebSocket connection handlers and manage events like connection establishment, message reception, and connection closure. The framework's underlying layers encapsulate details like WebSocket protocol handshakes, frame processing, and heartbeat maintenance, letting developers focus on business logic.
I once quickly built a real-time polling system with it. Clients connected to the server via WebSocket, and when the server received a vote, it broadcasted the latest polling results in real-time to all connected clients. The development process was very smooth, and the performance was satisfactory.Efficient Message Broadcasting and Distribution Mechanisms
In many real-time applications, messages or events need to be broadcast to multiple clients (e.g., group chat messages in a chat room, status updates for all players in a game). Inefficient broadcasting mechanisms can easily become performance bottlenecks.
This framework's ecosystem often includes efficient Publish/Subscribe or Broadcast components (e.g., Tokio's  channel). These components are carefully designed to distribute messages to a large number of subscribers in an asynchronous environment with minimal overhead. They usually support multi-producer, multi-consumer patterns and gracefully handle subscriber joins and leaves.
This built-in efficient broadcasting capability means developers don't need to reinvent the wheel when implementing group communication or real-time data push features, and it avoids performance issues caused by improper implementation.Low-Latency Request Processing Pipeline
For real-time applications, every millisecond of latency can impact user experience. This framework's entire pipeline, from request reception, parsing, and processing to response sending, is optimized for maximum performance. Its lightweight core, efficient route matching, and zero-copy data handling techniques (if applicable) all contribute to minimizing processing latency.
The Rust language itself has no GC pauses, which also guarantees its low-latency characteristics. In real-time scenarios requiring complex computations or large amounts of data processing (such as real-time data analysis and visualization), this low-latency advantage becomes even more apparent.Flexible Protocol Support and Extensibility
Although WebSocket and HTTP are the primary protocols for web real-time communication, some specific scenarios may require support for other custom or binary protocols (like Protobuf, MQTT, etc.). This framework usually has good protocol extensibility, allowing developers to easily integrate or implement custom protocol handlers.
Rust's powerful byte manipulation capabilities and rich serialization/deserialization libraries (like Serde) also provide convenience for handling various complex data formats.State Management and Concurrency Control
Real-time applications often need to maintain a large amount of connection state and user state on the server side. Efficiently managing this state while ensuring concurrency safety is a challenge. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, along with its concurrency primitives (like Mutex, RwLock, Channel), provide strong support for building thread-safe state management modules.
The framework itself might also offer recommended state management patterns or examples of integration with popular state storage solutions (like Redis) to help developers better address this challenge.Practical Case: Building an Online Collaborative WhiteboardTo personally experience this framework's capabilities in complex real-time scenarios, I attempted to build a simple online collaborative whiteboard application. It allows multiple users to connect simultaneously and draw on a shared canvas, with all users' actions synchronized in real-time to others.In this project, I primarily utilized the framework's WebSocket support for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. Each user's drawing action (like drawing lines, circles, or writing text) was sent to the server via WebSocket. Upon receiving an action, the server broadcasted it to all other users in the same room. The server also needed to maintain the current state of the whiteboard so that new users joining could retrieve the complete canvas content.During development, I deeply appreciated the power of the framework's asynchronous processing capabilities. Even with multiple users performing high-frequency drawing operations simultaneously, the server remained stable, and message synchronization latency was almost imperceptible. Rust's strong type system and compile-time checks also helped me avoid many potential concurrency errors and logical flaws.I also used the framework's middleware mechanism to implement simple user authentication and room management functions. With the framework's help, the backend logic of the entire application appeared very clear and easy to maintain.Comparative Reflection: Why Does It Excel in the Real-Time Domain?Compared to some traditional PHP or Python frameworks, which often require additional extensions (like Swoole, Gevent) or more complex architectures (like using a separate WebSocket server) to handle a large number of long connections and high-concurrency real-time messages, this Rust-based framework has innate asynchronous and concurrent capabilities. It doesn't need extra "plugins" to deliver top-tier real-time processing performance.Compared to Node.js, although Node.js is also a paragon of asynchronous non-blocking I/O, Rust generally has an edge in CPU-intensive tasks and memory safety. For real-time applications requiring complex computations or extremely high stability (such as financial trading, real-time risk control), a Rust framework might be a more robust choice.Compared to Java's Netty or Go's goroutines, they are all excellent choices for building high-performance real-time applications. However, a Rust framework, with its GC-less nature, memory safety, and execution efficiency close to C/C++, might exhibit stronger competitiveness in scenarios with extreme demands on latency and resource consumption. Furthermore, Rust's  syntax and ecosystem offer a very modern and efficient asynchronous programming experience.Conclusion: Making the Application's "Heartbeat" Stronger and More PowerfulReal-time interaction has become an indispensable core competency for modern web applications. Choosing a backend framework that can efficiently handle concurrent connections, respond with low latency, and provide convenient real-time communication mechanisms is key to creating an excellent user experience.This "mysterious" Rust framework, with its deeply ingrained asynchronous processing capabilities, native support for real-time protocols like WebSocket, and efficient message distribution mechanisms, provides developers with a powerful arsenal for building various complex real-time applications. It has allowed me to experience a development joy akin to a "heartbeat sync" with the server and has filled me with anticipation for the future development of real-time technology.As a computer science student, I am well aware that the tide of technology never stops. Mastering and applying such a framework, which represents advanced productivity, will undoubtedly add significant weight to my future career. I believe that as more developers recognize its value, it will surely play an even more vibrant "heartbeat" symphony in the field of real-time applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hexagonal Architecture Implementation（1751340522314500）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/hexagonal-architecture-implementation1751340522314500-523h</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 03:28:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

  The Essence of Middleware: The Art of Request Processing
Middleware is essentially a design pattern that allows us to execute a series of operations before and after requests reach their final handler functions. This framework's middleware system is ingeniously designed, dividing request processing into three phases: request middleware, route handling, and response middleware.This simple example demonstrates basic middleware usage.

Traditional HTTP request-response patterns clearly couldn't meet real-time communication needs. After deep research, I discovered a surprisingly elegant solution.
  
  
  The Magic of WebSocket: Bidirectional Real-time Communication
WebSocket protocol solves HTTP's unidirectional communication limitations by establishing full-duplex communication channels between clients and servers. The framework I chose impressed me with its WebSocket support, completely encapsulating the complex protocol upgrade process so developers can focus solely on business logic.This code demonstrates the framework's simplicity. Using the  attribute marker, the framework automatically handles WebSocket protocol upgrades, eliminating developer concerns about underlying handshake processes.
  
  
  Building a Complete Chat System
In my campus trading platform project, I needed to implement a multi-room chat system. Users could communicate with sellers in real-time on product detail pages, discussing product details, prices, and other information.
  
  
  1. Room Management System
This design uses a global broadcast manager to handle multi-room chat, with each room having independent message channels.
  
  
  2. WebSocket Connection Handling

  
  
  3. Advanced Feature Implementation
To enhance user experience, I also implemented some advanced features:To completely demonstrate real-time communication effects, I also implemented the corresponding JavaScript client:After my campus trading platform went live, the real-time chat functionality received unanimous user praise. Through monitoring data, I discovered:: Message transmission latency averaged under 50ms: Single chat rooms could stably support 500+ users online simultaneously: 30 days of continuous operation without any WebSocket connection exceptions: Server memory usage reduced by 70% compared to traditional polling solutionsThis data proves the framework's excellent performance in real-time communication scenarios.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Poetry and Horizon Code Design Future Vision Web（1751337810250700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/poetry-and-horizon-code-design-future-vision-web1751337810250700-gh8</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 02:43:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This technical analysis explores architectural patterns and design principles in contemporary web frameworks, examining how different approaches to code organization, middleware systems, and error handling contribute to maintainable and scalable applications.Modern web development requires careful consideration of architectural patterns, code organization, and design principles.

During my exploration of modern development practices, I discovered that creating truly universal web applications requires more than just writing portable code - it demands a deep understanding of deployment strategies, environment management, and platform-specific optimizations.
  
  
  The Promise of Write Once Run Everywhere
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have witnessed the evolution from platform-specific development to universal application frameworks. The dream of "write once, run everywhere" has driven countless innovations in software development, from Java's virtual machine to modern containerization technologies.Modern web frameworks have brought us closer to this ideal than ever before. By leveraging platform-agnostic technologies and standardized deployment practices, we can build applications that deliver consistent experiences across diverse environments.
  
  
  Container-First Deployment Strategy
In my exploration of cross-platform deployment, I discovered that containerization provides the most reliable path to universal application deployment. Containers abstract away platform differences while providing consistent runtime environments.The framework I've been studying embraces container-first deployment with intelligent platform detection and optimization. This approach ensures that applications can leverage platform-specific optimizations while maintaining portability across different environments.
  
  
  Environment Configuration Management
One of the biggest challenges in cross-platform deployment is managing configuration across different environments. Through my experience, I learned that successful universal applications require sophisticated configuration management that adapts to platform capabilities and deployment contexts.The key principles I discovered include:: Automatically detecting platform capabilities and constraints: Enabling/disabling features based on platform support: Adjusting resource usage based on available system resources: Providing fallback behavior when platform features are unavailableThis article documents my exploration of cross-platform application development as a junior student. Through practical implementation and deployment experience, I learned the importance of building applications that adapt intelligently to their runtime environment while maintaining consistent functionality across platforms.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Minimalist Programming Philosophy（1751337784702800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_14fef070/minimalist-programming-philosophy1751337784702800-21c8</link><author>member_14fef070</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 02:43:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

After extensive framework research and performance testing, I discovered a shocking fact: a certain Rust-based lightweight framework completely crushed mainstream choices in performance tests.
  
  
  Setting Up My Test Environment
My test machine configuration wasn't top-tier: Intel i7-10700K, 32GB RAM, running Windows 11. To ensure fair test results, I used identical test conditions, including the same port, same response content, and same Keep-Alive settings.For testing tools, I chose industry-standard wrk and Apache Bench (ab), which have widespread recognition in the pressure testing field. I kept all test code minimized to avoid business logic interference with performance testing.This test server code demonstrates the framework's simplicity. I built a complete HTTP server with middleware support and routing in less than 30 lines of code.
  
  
  wrk Pressure Testing: Stunning Results
I conducted wrk testing with 360 concurrent connections for 60 seconds. The test command was:wrk  http://127.0.0.1:60000/
Hyperlane Framework Test Results:Running 1m test @ http://127.0.0.1:60000/
  2 threads and 360 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency     1.46ms    7.74ms 230.59ms   99.57%
    Req/Sec   163.12k     9.54k  187.65k    67.75%
  19476349 requests in 1.00m, 1.94GB read
Requests/sec: 324323.71
Transfer/sec:     33.10MB
QPS reached 324,323! I double-checked this number several times. Latency was controlled at an average of 1.46ms, with 99.57% of requests within this range - excellent stability performance.To verify this result's authenticity, I simultaneously tested several other well-known frameworks:Tokio Native Implementation:Rust Standard Library Implementation:Node.js Standard Library:From this data, Hyperlane's performance is second only to Tokio's native implementation. Considering that Hyperlane provides complete web framework functionality (routing, middleware, WebSocket support, etc.) while Tokio is just the underlying async runtime, this performance is remarkable.
  
  
  Apache Bench Testing: Verifying High Concurrency Capability
To further verify the framework's high-concurrency processing capability, I used Apache Bench for extreme testing with 1000 concurrent connections and 1 million requests:ab  1000000  1000  http://127.0.0.1:60000/

That’s what this problem is all about! In LeetCode 3330, we explore how to compute the number of possible  that Alice might have intended to type, assuming she may have held one key too long just once.Let’s break it down in a clean and simple way. ✅A string  representing the final output after Alice’s typing (which may include ).Return the total number of distinct original strings Alice might have meant to type.A valid original string can be obtained by deleting  from a group of repeated characters.For every group of repeated characters, Alice  have held that key down too long. So for each such group:If the current character is the  as the previous one, then we could consider that extra character a mistake.Thus, each such repeat character gives us an extra valid original string possibility.Start with an answer initialized to 1 (the word itself is always valid).Traverse the string from the second character onward.Each time the current character matches the previous one, it represents an opportunity where a character might have been held too long.For each such case, increment your count.At most  might have been inserted due to a long press.Only consecutive repeated characters matter.Time complexity:  where  is the length of the string.This problem is a great exercise in pattern recognition and linear string traversal. If you're comfortable with character comparisons and edge cases like off-by-one errors, you’ll find this one a breeze.Keep up the great work — and remember, even Alice has typing troubles sometimes! 😄]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Security Importance Digital Age Web Techniques（1751333570651100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/critical-security-importance-digital-age-web-techniques1751333570651100-4c44</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 01:32:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student, my curiosity constantly pushes me to explore new technologies. Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital AgeModern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency SafetyThe framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.Framework Design: Layered and Resilient DefensesBeyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization
The principle of "Never trust user input" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.
It also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.
My tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This "secure by default" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.Secure Session Management and Authentication
Secure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.
While it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
I observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.Secure Dependency Management
Contemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.
The framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.Error Handling and Information Concealment
Exposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.
HTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).Practical Security Considerations in ImplementationWhen implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.Audits and Penetration Testing: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.Timely Dependency Updates: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.Comprehensive Log Monitoring: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.Comparative Analysis with Other FrameworksCompared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.Conclusion: Security as a Continuous EndeavorIn the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Push Service Technology Selection and Performance Strategy Experience Sharing（1751333486010100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/push-service-technology-selection-and-performance-strategy-experience-sharing1751333486010100-4h8e</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 01:31:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

Some frameworks behave very differently across platforms, forcing me to write different code for each platform. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust framework that I truly experienced the charm of "write once, run everywhere."
  
  
  True Cross-Platform: More Than Just a Slogan
The most impressive feature of this framework is its cross-platform compatibility. Whether on Windows, Linux, or macOS, code behavior is completely consistent, thanks to Rust's design and the framework's careful architecture.This example demonstrates the framework's consistency across different platforms. Regardless of which operating system it runs on, the code behavior is identical.
  
  
  Cross-Platform Network Layer Abstraction
Network programming is where cross-platform development most easily encounters problems. Different operating systems have vastly different network APIs, but this framework perfectly abstracts these differences:
  
  
  Unified File System Handling
File system operations are another cross-platform challenge. Different operating systems have different path separators and permission models, but the framework provides unified handling:
  
  
  Consistent Deployment Experience
In actual deployment, this framework's cross-platform features brought me tremendous convenience:
  
  
  1. Development Environment (Windows)

  
  
  2. Production Environment (Linux)
In my projects, cross-platform features brought significant benefits:Improved Development Efficiency: Develop on Windows, deploy directly to Linux without code modificationsReduced Maintenance Costs: No need to maintain different code branches for different platforms: Compiled binaries can run directly on target platforms: Local test results are completely consistent with production environmentThrough actual usage data:Deployment time reduced by 80% (no platform-specific debugging needed)Platform-related bugs reduced by 95%Code maintenance workload reduced by 60%This framework truly delivers on the promise of "write once, run everywhere," allowing me to focus on business logic rather than platform differences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Junior Web Framework Journey（1751333166632700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/junior-web-framework-journey1751333166632700-1do6</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 01:26:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

The traditional approach involves repeating these codes in each route, which I find very tedious. It wasn't until I encountered a Rust framework whose middleware system completely changed my development approach. The middleware design of this framework showed me a new realm of web development.
  
  
  The Design Philosophy of Middleware Systems
This Rust framework's middleware system adopts functional programming design principles. Each middleware is an independent async function that can be freely combined to form powerful processing chains. This design reminds me of Unix's pipe concept - simple yet powerful.
  
  
  The Art of Middleware Composition
This framework allows me to flexibly combine multiple middlewares to form powerful processing chains. Each middleware can access and modify the context, enabling me to build complex business logic.
  
  
  Middleware Execution Order
This framework's middleware execution order is very clear: request middlewares execute in registration order, then the route handler function executes, and finally response middlewares execute in registration order. This design allows me to precisely control the request processing flow.
  
  
  Middleware Performance Optimization
This framework's middleware system also demonstrates excellent performance. Each middleware executes asynchronously without blocking other request processing.
  
  
  Comparison with Express.js Middleware
I once developed similar functionality using Express.js, and the middleware experience was completely different:Using this Rust framework, both type safety and performance of middleware are significantly improved:
  
  
  Best Practices for Middleware Development
Through using this framework's middleware system, I've summarized several important development practices:Single Responsibility Principle: Each middleware should only be responsible for one specific function: Fully utilize Rust's type system to avoid runtime errorsPerformance Considerations: Middleware should be lightweight and avoid blocking: Each middleware should have comprehensive error handling mechanisms: Middleware should be testable for unit testingAs a computer science student about to graduate, this middleware system development experience gave me a deeper understanding of web framework design. Middleware is not just a combination of functions, but the art of architectural design.This Rust framework shows me the future direction of modern web development: type safety, high performance, easy extensibility, developer-friendly. It's not just a framework, but the embodiment of a programming philosophy.I believe that with the proliferation of microservice architectures, middleware systems will play important roles in more fields, and this framework provides developers with the perfect technical foundation.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring web framework middleware systems. Through actual development experience and comparative analysis, I deeply understood the importance of middleware in modern web development. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your Servers Deserve Better: Meet Minexus, a Smart Admin Agent System in Go</title><link>https://dev.to/arhuman/your-server-deserves-better-meet-minexus-a-smart-admin-agent-system-in-go-41gn</link><author>arhuman</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 00:48:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Meet Minexus — A Modular, Distributed Admin System in Go
I was tired of managing my servers with brittle scripts, ad hoc SSH sessions, and clunky monitoring tools. So I built Minexus, a modular platform to monitor and control servers via secure agents, with Go and gRPC under the hood.To send a command to 50 machines and get results back fastTo build your own admin plugins with GoTo manage your servers like a well-oiled, distributed systemThen this might be up your alley.Minexus is made of 3 main components: — the central server, connected to a PostgreSQL DB — lightweight agents running on your hosts, communicating with the Nexus via gRPC + mTLS — an admin UI and command interface, also talking to the NexusMinions register periodically. Commands go through the Nexus, and results are logged/stored. Want a new command? Just write a command.It’s simple, extensible, and built for sysadmins/devops/devs who want control without vendor lock-in.Remote command execution (with return capture)Service restarts across hostsHealth checks / monitoring pluginsSecurity scans (CVE lookup, etc.)Anything you can plug into a Go module...Want to send restart-service nginx to all your production servers and get clean results in seconds? Minexus can do that.It's early days, but it’s usable and growing. Contributors welcome — the command system (soon a plugin system) makes it a playground for Go devs.You're not a coder, it's not a problem: I’d love 🙏 Feedback on the architectureSuggestions for useful commands/pluginsHelp testing on non-Linux environmentsIdeas to make this your go-to internal admin framework
  
  
  Let’s Build This Together

Traditional programming languages either sacrifice safety for performance or sacrifice performance for safety. It wasn't until I deeply studied Rust language and web frameworks built on it that I discovered this perfect balance point.
  
  
  The Importance of Memory Safety
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have seen too many system crashes and security vulnerabilities caused by memory issues. Buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory leaks not only affect program stability but can also become entry points for hacker attacks.Traditional C/C++ languages, although excellent in performance, rely entirely on programmer experience and care for memory management. A small oversight can lead to serious consequences. Languages like Java and Python solve memory safety issues through garbage collection mechanisms, but the overhead of garbage collection becomes a performance bottleneck.
  
  
  The Power of Zero-Cost Abstractions
One of Rust's most impressive features is zero-cost abstractions. This means we can use high-level abstract concepts without paying runtime performance costs. The compiler optimizes these abstractions into machine code equivalent to hand-written low-level code.
  
  
  The Wisdom of Borrow Checker
Rust's borrow checker is the core mechanism for achieving memory safety. It can detect most memory-related errors at compile time without requiring runtime checks. This allows us to write code that is both safe and efficient.Through this deep exploration of the balance between memory safety and ultimate performance, I not only mastered the core technologies of safe programming, but more importantly, I developed a mindset for safe and efficient development. In my future career, these experiences will become my important assets.The design of high-performance frameworks requires optimization in multiple dimensions: memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, compile-time checking, and runtime efficiency. Each aspect requires careful design and continuous optimization.I believe that as technology continues to develop, the demand for both safety and performance will become higher and higher. Mastering these technologies will give me an advantage in future technological competition.This article records my deep thinking as a junior student on the balance between memory safety and performance. Through practical code practice, I deeply experienced the unique advantages of Rust language in this regard. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Art of System Integration Make Applications Run Seamlessly Across Different Platforms（1751329249956400）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/art-of-system-integration-make-applications-run-seamlessly-across-different-jdc</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 00:20:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of cross_platform development.

The smallest QR code (besides micro QR codes) is "version 1" which uses 21x21 pixels.
We'll have to split the squares in half and then use some of the margin.Version 1 QR codes can hold URLs up to 17 bytes long using the lowest
data quality setting. Unfortunately  is 23 bytes
long, so I'll have to improvise. I went with  instead, as this
will prompt many QR code scanners to "search" for the term resulting in my website.Note that a lovely reader informed me shortly after publication that indeed
  I can include my full domain name in a version 1 QR code by using all capital
  letters instead of lowercase. TIL that the "alphanumeric" character set for QR
  codes actually contains symbols for URLs like  and .Expect an updated QR code published after lunch today. :)I created my reference using the  package on the Python Package Index. Don't forget
the  option with  to not include a trailing newline.$ echo -n "HTTPS://SETHMLARSON.DEV" | qr --error-correction=L
I drew the corner squares (known as "position patterns") and then started trying
to scan the QR code as a gradually filled in other pixels. Once I had drawn the
"timing lines" between the top left and bottom left position I could
see that my scanner "wanted" to see something in my drawing.I continued adding the top timing line and data and then the scanner could
start to see the whole square as a QR code. If you look closely I even
made a mistake here in the data a bit, but in the end this didn't matter
even on the lowest error-correction level.Finally, my QR code was complete! Scanning the QR code was quite finicky because
the paper was curling up off the flat surface. I could only get the scan to work
when I held the paper flat. However, hanging the QR code from my monitor worked
extremely well, even when scanning from a distance.I hope this inspires you to try hand-drawing something on grid paper 🖤🤍

Steps to Develop a RAG Strategy4. How to Develop It (Example Python Code)5. Improving the Code for Better Production ResultsRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines a  with a generative language model.Instead of relying solely on the model’s internal knowledge, it retrieves relevant information from an external document collection or knowledge base at inference time.This lets the model generate more accurate, context-aware answers grounded in actual data.The model's weights are  — it uses external data during the answer generation step.
  
  
  2. Steps to Develop a RAG Strategy
 Collect and preprocess your text data (PDFs, docs, etc.).Split documents into chunks: Break long texts into smaller pieces for efficient retrieval. Convert text chunks into vector embeddings using a sentence transformer model. Use a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to store embeddings for fast similarity search. Embed the user’s question and search for the most relevant document chunks. Combine retrieved documents and the user query into a prompt. Pass the prompt to a language model to produce a grounded response. Answer questions from product manuals and FAQs. Summarize academic papers or technical documents. Provide information based on legal texts or regulations. Answer questions from textbooks or course materials. Query company documents, reports, or internal wikis.
  
  
  4. How to Develop It (Example Python Code)

  
  
  Creating the embeddings of the PDF and storing on FAISS Vector DB locally

  
  
  Sending embeddings context to AI model for RAG
Once we have the embeddings saved and indexed in FAISS, we can use them to answer user questions more accurately. That’s what we’re doing here.The function  contains a RAG pipeline that:

1. Loads the local FAISS vector store.2. Finds the most relevant chunks based on the user query.3. Builds a clean prompt that includes the context and the question.4. Sends the prompt to a language model (like Phi-2) via an API.5. Gets back a contextualized answer based only on the document content.
  
  
  5. Improving the Code for Better Production Results
Use stronger language models: Upgrade to larger or more capable models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, or other state-of-the-art LLMs) to get more accurate and coherent answers.Improve embedding quality: Use more powerful embedding models like sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 or OpenAI’s embeddings, which can capture semantic meaning better than smaller models. Use more scalable vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or Elasticsearch for handling larger datasets with faster retrieval times.Context window management: Implement smarter chunking, token budget management, or retrieval filtering to keep prompts concise but informative.Caching and indexing strategies: Use caching for repeated queries and incremental index updates to improve speed and freshness.Monitoring and evaluation: Continuously monitor output quality and user feedback to identify weaknesses and improve iteratively.These steps help make the RAG system more robust, scalable, and suitable for real-world production use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>String in Python (10)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/string-in-python-10-2p88</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:40:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[center() can center the string set  as shown below:The 1st argument is (Required-Type:):

The deal was disclosed in a regulatory filing Monday without the customer being named. Bloomberg reports: "Oracle is off to a strong start" in its fiscal year 2026, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said in the filing. The company has signed "multiple large cloud services agreements," she said, adding that revenue from Oracle's namesake database that runs on other clouds continues to grow more than 100%.
 
The $30-billion deal ranks among the largest cloud contracts on record. That revenue alone would represent nearly three times the size of Oracle's current infrastructure business, which totaled $10.3 billion over the past four quarters. A major cloud contract awarded in 2022 from the US Defense Department, that runs through 2028 and could be worth as much as $9 billion, is split among four companies, including Oracle.

Meet  (aka Golang): a language created at Google by Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer to make software development fast, fun, and scalable.Go is designed for simplicity, speed, and reliability. It compiles to a single binary, has a powerful standard library, and makes concurrency (doing many things at once) a breeze. If you love JavaScript's flexibility but crave more performance and predictability, Go is a perfect next step.How Go compares to JavaScript in syntax and philosophyGo's type system, variables, and data structuresHow to handle strings, bytes, and runes (Unicode!)Using Go's  package for text manipulationGo's powerful concurrency model (goroutines, channels, and more)Common pitfalls for JS devs switching to GoHow to build and run Go codeIf you're a JavaScript developer looking to level up with a fast, modern language built for performance and scalability, it's time to meet Go. is a middle-level programming language created at Google in 2007 by engineers who were tired of waiting around for their code to compile and dealing with overly complex systems. The result? A language that combines the performance of C (low-level) with the simplicity and readability of Python (high-level).
  
  
  Go vs JavaScript: Quick Comparison
APIs, infra, CLI, serversGo shines when it comes to building fast, scalable backend systems. It's a top choice for writing APIs, web servers, CLI tools, and infrastructure-level software. Tools like , , and  are all written in Go, which says a lot about its speed and reliability.One of Go's biggest superpowers is , the ability to run multiple tasks at the same time. In JavaScript, we use  and the event loop to handle asynchronous operations. In Go, we use goroutines, lightweight threads that are easy to spawn and manage.Go also makes deployment a breeze. While Node.js apps often require npm install, package.json, and a dozen dependencies, Go compiles everything into a single binary file you can just drop on a server and run.Front-end/browser-based developmentRapid prototyping with lots of UIProjects needing generics-heavy data structures (though Go 1.18+ now supports generics, it's not as flexible as TypeScript)Go might not be ideal for:Projects that require a lot of dynamic typing or runtime type changes (Go is statically typed and not as flexible as JavaScript or Python for dynamic data structures).Codebases that rely heavily on advanced generics or metaprogramming (Go's generics are intentionally simple and less expressive than those in TypeScript, Rust, or C++).Rapid prototyping where developer speed and a huge ecosystem of libraries (like npm for JS or PyPI for Python) are critical. Go's ecosystem is strong but not as broad for every domain.Projects where you need mature, specialized libraries for things like data science, machine learning, or scientific computing (Go's ecosystem is growing, but not as deep as Python's in these areas).Teams that require hot-reloading, scripting, or embedding code at runtime (Go is compiled and not designed for scripting or live code changes).Go is statically typed, so once a variable has a type, it can't be reassigned to something else, no switching  from a number to a string like in JS.Unlike JavaScript, which uses a single  type for all integers, Go provides several distinct integer types. Each type has its own range and memory usage, allowing you to choose the most appropriate one for your needs.-2.1 billion to 2.1 billion-9 quintillion to 9 quintillionplatform dependent (usually 32 or 64 bits)platform dependent (unsigned version of int)For example, if you need to store an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) value ranging from 0 to 255, the best choice is  (an unsigned 8-bit integer), since it efficiently covers exactly that range. If you need to store larger values, simply choose an integer type with a bigger bit size, such as , , or , depending on your requirements. will default to 32 or 64 bits depending on your system. types don't allow negative numbers but give you more room for positive values.Go will catch integer overflows at compile time, not at runtime.
This compiles but causes weird behavior:7 digits (single precision)15 digits (double precision — default)Warning: Precision loss can happen with  when dealing with very large or very small decimal values.In Go, arrays have  and contain elements of a single type.You can also let Go infer the length:Arrays are . Assigning or passing them copies the whole array.Their size is part of their type ( != )Slices are more flexible and commonly used than arrays.You can create a slice from an array:You can also use  to create a slice with a given length and capacity:Slices are , so modifying one will affect the original array:
  
  
  Structs, Types, Methods, and Interfaces
Go uses structs to group related data together, similar to objects in JavaScript. You can also define methods on types (including structs) to add behavior.Interfaces in Go define a set of method signatures (behavior) that a type must implement. Any type that provides those methods "satisfies" the interface, even if it doesn't explicitly declare that it does. This allows you to write flexible and decoupled code, because functions can accept interfaces rather than concrete types. Interfaces are a key part of Go's approach to polymorphism and code reuse.Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior (methods and properties), not by explicit inheritance or declaration. The phrase comes from "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck." In Go, any type that implements the methods required by an interface is considered to satisfy that interface, even if it doesn't explicitly declare it. This is similar to how JavaScript objects can be passed to functions as long as they have the expected methods or properties.Interfaces Example (Multiple Types):
JavaScript doesn't have interfaces, but you can use objects with the same method signatures (duck typing):
  
  
  Strings, Bytes, and Runes
In , strings are sequences of UTF-16 code units. This usually feels like characters but isn't always, especially with emojis or characters from other languages.In , strings are UTF-8 encoded immutable slices of bytes. That means:A string is a sequence of bytes.Characters can take up multiple bytes.Indexing directly gives you a , not a character.
  
  
  Strings (Immutable UTF-8)
Each character in  might take 1-3 bytes.Strings are immutable. You  change characters via indexing.Accessing bytes (not characters):A  is an alias for , just a number from 0-255. lets you inspect or manipulate the underlying raw data of a string.

  
  
  Runes (Unicode Code Points)
A  in Go is an  representing a full Unicode character, even emojis and symbols from non-Latin scripts.Useful when dealing with , not bytes.Can handle multi-byte characters like emoji properly.
Use a  to  properly:
  
  
  Quick Comparison: JavaScript vs Go
 → 4utf8.RuneCountInString(str)
  
  
  Functions and Control Flow
In Go, you must declare the type of each parameter and the return value. The function block is enclosed by  just like JS.
  
  
  Returning Multiple Values
Go functions can return more than one value, which is commonly used for returning a result and an error.In JavaScript, you might return an object or array to simulate multiple return values:Go uses familiar  logic but requires the conditions to evaluate to a , no more truthy/falsy magic like in JS.Go uses pointers to reference memory locations, similar to C, but without pointer arithmetic. Pointers are useful for modifying values in place and for efficient memory usage. means "pointer to an int". gets the address of . dereferences the pointer to access the value.
JavaScript does not have pointers, but objects and arrays are passed by reference:Go has only one loop keyword: .You can also use it like a  loop:The  keyword is used to iterate over elements in a variety of data structures, including arrays, slices, maps, and strings. When iterating over a string,  yields the index and the Unicode code point (rune) at each position.Example: Iterating over runes in a stringThis will print each Unicode character (rune) in the string, including multi-byte characters like emojis.
  
  
  Working with the strings Package
Go's standard library includes the powerful  package for manipulating text. Here are some common tasks:
  
  
  Concurrency in Go: Goroutines, Channels, WaitGroups, and Mutexes
Go's concurrency model is one of its superpowers. Unlike JavaScript's single-threaded event loop, Go lets you run multiple tasks at the same time using goroutines and channels.
  
  
  Concurrency vs Parallelism
 is about dealing with lots of things at once (structuring your program to handle multiple tasks that may not actually run at the same time). is about doing lots of things at the same time (actually running on multiple CPU cores).Go makes it easy to write concurrent code, and if your machine has multiple cores, Go can run goroutines in parallel too.A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. Just add  before a function call to run it concurrently:Channels let goroutines communicate safely: sends a value into the channel. receives a value from the channel.A  lets you wait for a group of goroutines to finish:A  is used to safely share data between goroutines: Without it, multiple goroutines could try to update  at the same time, causing race conditions.The  keyword in Go schedules a function call to run after the function completes, just before it returns. This is especially useful for cleanup tasks like closing files, unlocking mutexes, or printing final messages.If you use multiple  statements, they run in LIFO (last-in, first-out) order:Closing files or network connectionsLogging or printing final messages
JavaScript doesn't have a direct equivalent, but you might use  in a  block for similar cleanup:
  
  
  Common Gotchas for JS Devs
No implicit type coercion: Go won't convert types for you.  is an error, not . Uninitialized variables have a default value (e.g.,  for int,  for string,  for pointers/slices/maps). Go uses explicit error returns, not try/catch. All variables must be declared before use.No unused imports or variables: The compiler will error if you import a package or declare a variable and don't use it. Use structs and interfaces instead.No method overloading or default parameters.
  
  
  Mini Project: Word Counter CLI
Let's build a simple CLI tool that reads a line of text from the user, counts the number of words and unique words, and prints word frequencies. This demonstrates string manipulation, maps, and user input.Why not use  for user input? is best for simple, space-separated input (e.g., numbers or single words), but for names or sentences,  is preferred because it reads the whole line, including spaces.  will only read up to the first space.
  
  
  Go Modules & Project Structure
Go uses modules to manage dependencies. To start a new project:go mod init github.com/yourusername/yourproject
Typical Go project structure:myproject/
  go.mod
  main.go
  pkg/      # reusable packages
  internal/ # private packages
Go does not use exceptions. Instead, functions that can fail return an  as a second return value:

This trend drives a growing need for more sophisticated inference offerings.To address this need, we are introducing a new capability in the SageMaker Python SDK that revolutionizes how you build and deploy inference workflows on SageMaker. We will take Amazon Search as an example to show case how this feature is used in helping customers building inference workflows. This new Python SDK capability provides a streamlined and simplified experience that abstracts away the underlying complexities of packaging and deploying groups of models and their collective inference logic, allowing you to focus on what matter most—your business logic and model integrations.In this post, we provide an overview of the user experience, detailing how to set up and deploy these workflows with multiple models using the SageMaker Python SDK. We walk through examples of building complex inference workflows, deploying them to SageMaker endpoints, and invoking them for real-time inference. We also show how customers like Amazon Search plan to use SageMaker Inference workflows to provide more relevant search results to Amazon shoppers.Whether you are building a simple two-step process or a complex, multimodal AI application, this new feature provides the tools you need to bring your vision to life. This tool aims to make it easy for developers and businesses to create and manage complex AI systems, helping them build more powerful and efficient AI applications.In the following sections, we dive deeper into details of the SageMaker Python SDK, walk through practical examples, and showcase how this new capability can transform your AI development and deployment process.Key improvements and user experienceThe SageMaker Python SDK now includes new features for creating and managing inference workflows. These additions aim to address common challenges in developing and deploying inference workflows:Deployment of multiple models – The core of this new experience is the deployment of multiple models as inference components within a single SageMaker endpoint. With this approach, you can create a more unified inference workflow. By consolidating multiple models into one endpoint, you can reduce the number of endpoints that need to be managed. This consolidation can also improve operational tasks, resource utilization, and potentially costs.Workflow definition with workflow mode – The new workflow mode extends the existing Model Builder capabilities. It allows for the definition of inference workflows using Python code. Users familiar with the  class might find this feature to be an extension of their existing knowledge. This mode enables creating multi-step workflows, connecting models, and specifying the data flow between different models in the workflows. The goal is to reduce the complexity of managing these workflows and enable you to focus more on the logic of the resulting compound AI system.Development and deployment options – A new deployment option has been introduced for the development phase. This feature is designed to allow for quicker deployment of workflows to development environments. The intention is to enable faster testing and refinement of workflows. This could be particularly relevant when experimenting with different configurations or adjusting models. – The SDK now provides options for invoking individual models or entire workflows. You can choose to call a specific inference component used in a workflow or the entire workflow. This flexibility can be useful in scenarios where access to a specific model is needed, or when only a portion of the workflow needs to be executed. – You can use SageMaker Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) or the SageMaker distribution that comes preconfigured with various model serving libraries and tools. These are intended to serve as a starting point for common use cases.To get started, use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy your models as inference components. Then, use the workflow mode to create an inference workflow, represented as Python code using the container of your choice. Deploy the workflow container as another inference component on the same endpoints as the models or a dedicated endpoint. You can run the workflow by invoking the inference component that represents the workflow. The user experience is entirely code-based, using the SageMaker Python SDK. This approach allows you to define, deploy, and manage inference workflows using SDK abstractions offered by this feature and Python programming. The workflow mode provides flexibility to specify complex sequences of model invocations and data transformations, and the option to deploy as components or endpoints caters to various scaling and integration needs.The following diagram illustrates a reference architecture using the SageMaker Python SDK.The improved SageMaker Python SDK introduces a more intuitive and flexible approach to building and deploying AI inference workflows. Let’s explore the key components and classes that make up the experience: simplifies the process of packaging individual models as inference components. It handles model loading, dependency management, and container configuration automatically.The  class provides a standardized way to define custom inference logic that orchestrates multiple models in the workflow. Users implement the  method to specify this logic and can use an orchestration library or none at all (plain Python).A single  call handles the deployment of the components and workflow orchestrator.The Python SDK supports invocation against the custom inference workflow or individual inference components.The Python SDK supports both synchronous and streaming inference. is an abstract base class that serves as a template for defining custom inference orchestration logic. It standardizes the structure of entry point-based inference scripts, making it straightforward for users to create consistent and reusable code. The  method in the class is an abstract method that users implement to define their custom orchestration logic.class CustomOrchestrator (ABC):
"""
Templated class used to standardize the structure of an entry point based inference script.
"""

    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, data, context=None):
        """abstract class for defining an entrypoint for the model server"""
        return NotImplementedWith this templated class, users can integrate into their custom workflow code, and then point to this code in the model builder using a file path or directly using a class or method name. Using this class and the ModelBuilder class, it enables a more streamlined workflow for AI inference:Users define their custom workflow by implementing the  class.The custom  is passed to  using the ModelBuilder inference_spec parameter. packages the  along with the model artifacts.The packaged model is deployed to a SageMaker endpoint (for example, using a TorchServe container).When invoked, the SageMaker endpoint uses the custom handle() function defined in the  to handle the input payload.In the follow sections, we provide two examples of custom workflow orchestrators implemented with plain Python code. For simplicity, the examples use two inference components.We explore how to create a simple workflow that deploys two large language models (LLMs) on SageMaker Inference endpoints along with a simple Python orchestrator that calls the two models. We create an IT customer service workflow where one model processes the initial request and another suggests solutions. You can find the example notebook in the GitHub repo.To run the example notebooks, you need an AWS account with an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with least-privilege permissions to manage resources created. For details, refer to Create an AWS account. You might need to request a service quota increase for the corresponding SageMaker hosting instances. In this example, we host multiple models on the same SageMaker endpoint, so we use two ml.g5.24xlarge SageMaker hosting instances.Python inference orchestrationFirst, let’s define our custom orchestration class that inherits from . The workflow is structured around a custom inference entry point that handles the request data, processes it, and retrieves predictions from the configured model endpoints. See the following code:class PythonCustomInferenceEntryPoint(CustomOrchestrator):
    def __init__(self, region_name, endpoint_name, component_names):
        self.region_name = region_name
        self.endpoint_name = endpoint_name
        self.component_names = component_names
    
    def preprocess(self, data):
        payload = {
            "inputs": data.decode("utf-8")
        }
        return json.dumps(payload)

    def _invoke_workflow(self, data):
        # First model (Llama) inference
        payload = self.preprocess(data)
        
        llama_response = self.client.invoke_endpoint(
            EndpointName=self.endpoint_name,
            Body=payload,
            ContentType="application/json",
            InferenceComponentName=self.component_names[0]
        )
        llama_generated_text = json.loads(llama_response.get('Body').read())['generated_text']
        
        # Second model (Mistral) inference
        parameters = {
            "max_new_tokens": 50
        }
        payload = {
            "inputs": llama_generated_text,
            "parameters": parameters
        }
        mistral_response = self.client.invoke_endpoint(
            EndpointName=self.endpoint_name,
            Body=json.dumps(payload),
            ContentType="application/json",
            InferenceComponentName=self.component_names[1]
        )
        return {"generated_text": json.loads(mistral_response.get('Body').read())['generated_text']}
    
    def handle(self, data, context=None):
        return self._invoke_workflow(data)This code performs the following functions:Defines the orchestration that sequentially calls two models using their inference component namesProcesses the response from the first model before passing it to the second modelReturns the final generated responseThis plain Python approach provides flexibility and control over the request-response flow, enabling seamless cascading of outputs across multiple model components.Build and deploy the workflowTo deploy the workflow, we first create our inference components and then build the custom workflow. One inference component will host a Meta Llama 3.1 8B model, and the other will host a Mistral 7B model.from sagemaker.serve import ModelBuilder
from sagemaker.serve.builder.schema_builder import SchemaBuilder

# Create a ModelBuilder instance for Llama 3.1 8B
# Pre-benchmarked ResourceRequirements will be taken from JumpStart, as Llama-3.1-8b is a supported model.
llama_model_builder = ModelBuilder(
    model="meta-textgeneration-llama-3-1-8b",
    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input, sample_output),
    inference_component_name=llama_ic_name,
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge"
)

# Create a ModelBuilder instance for Mistral 7B model.
mistral_mb = ModelBuilder(
    model="huggingface-llm-mistral-7b",
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge",
    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input, sample_output),
    inference_component_name=mistral_ic_name,
    resource_requirements=ResourceRequirements(
        requests={
           "memory": 49152,
           "num_accelerators": 2,
           "copies": 1
        }
    ),
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge"
)Now we can tie it all together to create one more  to which we pass the , which contains the  objects we just created for each inference component and the custom workflow. Then we call the  function to prepare the workflow for deployment.# Create workflow ModelBuilder
orchestrator= ModelBuilder(
    inference_spec=PythonCustomInferenceEntryPoint(
        region_name=region,
        endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name,
        component_names=[llama_ic_name, mistral_ic_name],
    ),
    dependencies={
        "auto": False,
        "custom": [
            "cloudpickle",
            "graphene",
            # Define other dependencies here.
        ],
    },
    sagemaker_session=Session(),
    role_arn=role,
    resource_requirements=ResourceRequirements(
        requests={
           "memory": 4096,
           "num_accelerators": 1,
           "copies": 1,
           "num_cpus": 2
        }
    ),
    name=custom_workflow_name, # Endpoint name for your custom workflow
    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input={"inputs": "test"}, sample_output="Test"),
    modelbuilder_list=[llama_model_builder, mistral_mb] # Inference Component ModelBuilders created in Step 2
)
# call the build function to prepare the workflow for deployment
orchestrator.build()In the preceding code snippet, you can comment out the section that defines the  to have the custom workflow deployed on a separate endpoint instance, which can be a dedicated CPU instance to handle the custom workflow payload.By calling the  function, we deploy the custom workflow and the inference components to your desired instance type, in this example ml.g5.24.xlarge. If you choose to deploy the custom workflow to a separate instance, by default, it will use the ml.c5.xlarge instance type. You can set inference_workflow_instance_type and inference_workflow_initial_instance_count to configure the instances required to host the custom workflow.predictors = orchestrator.deploy(
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge",
    initial_instance_count=1,
    accept_eula=True, # Required for Llama3
    endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name
    # inference_workflow_instance_type="ml.t2.medium", # default
    # inference_workflow_initial_instance_count=1 # default
)After you deploy the workflow, you can invoke the endpoint using the predictor object:from sagemaker.serializers import JSONSerializer
predictors[-1].serializer = JSONSerializer()
predictors[-1].predict("Tell me a story about ducks.")You can also invoke each inference component in the deployed endpoint. For example, we can test the Llama inference component with a synchronous invocation, and Mistral with streaming:from sagemaker.predictor import Predictor
# create predictor for the inference component of Llama model
llama_predictor = Predictor(endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name, component_name=llama_ic_name)
llama_predictor.content_type = "application/json"

llama_predictor.predict(json.dumps(payload))When handling the streaming response, we need to read each line of the output separately. The following example code demonstrates this streaming handling by checking for newline characters to separate and print each token in real time:mistral_predictor = Predictor(endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name, component_name=mistral_ic_name)
mistral_predictor.content_type = "application/json"

body = json.dumps({
    "inputs": prompt,
    # specify the parameters as needed
    "parameters": parameters
})

for line in mistral_predictor.predict_stream(body):
    decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')
    if '\n' in decoded_line:
        # Split by newline to handle multiple tokens in the same line
        tokens = decoded_line.split('\n')
        for token in tokens[:-1]:  # Print all tokens except the last one with a newline
            print(token)
        # Print the last token without a newline, as it might be followed by more tokens
        print(tokens[-1], end='')
    else:
        # Print the token without a newline if it doesn't contain '\n'
        print(decoded_line, end='')So far, we have walked through the example code to demonstrate how to build complex inference logic using Python orchestration, deploy them to SageMaker endpoints, and invoke them for real-time inference. The Python SDK automatically handles the following:Model packaging and container configurationDependency management and environment setupEndpoint creation and component coordinationWhether you’re building a simple workflow of two models or a complex multimodal application, the new SDK provides the building blocks needed to bring your inference workflows to life with minimal boilerplate code.Customer story: Amazon SearchAmazon Search is a critical component of the Amazon shopping experience, processing an enormous volume of queries across billions of products across diverse categories. At the core of this system are sophisticated matching and ranking workflows, which determine the order and relevance of search results presented to customers.

Because it's literally everywhere.Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and even artificial intelligence. But what is most appealing — especially for new developers — is how readable it is. The syntax is simple, the learning curve isn't so rough, and some people even joke that it feels like writing in plain English.I started learning JavaScript about ten months ago. Once I honed my fundamentals in JavaScript, I wanted to learn a language that would open more doors and expand my horizon in tech beyond web development. Python kept coming up in conversations — not just because it's powerful, but because people actually enjoy using it.
  
  
  Indentation and Variables
Right off the bat, two things will blow your mind about Python — especially if you're coming from JavaScript.First, Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, rather than curly braces  like in JavaScript and many other languages. That means spacing of your code is very important.Compare that to JavaScript:In Python, there's no need for  — the indentation is the structure.Another surprising quirk is how variables are declared. Python doesn't require keywords like , , or . You just write the variable name and assign a value.There's no need to specify types or use extra keywords — Python figures it out for you.Lists in Python are similar to arrays in JavaScript — they can hold multiple values, are ordered, and are mutable (you can change them).They have a very similar syntax, except that:Python typically uses  to declare variables and JavaScript uses .
Python also introduces another built-in data structure called . At first glance, tuples look a lot like lists — they can store an ordered collection of elements — but they come with a few key differences:Tuples are  — meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.More memory-efficient and faster than lists, especially for large, fixed data sets.
Without the comma, Python will treat it as a plain string or number.Python has a useful set of built-in methods you can use on lists and tuples. List methods such as , , , , , etc., allow efficient ways to manipulate and interact with data.Tuples can also be used in real-world scenarios like coordinates or color values - places where you need fixed, unchanging data:Read more about here.Tuples have fewer methods: mainly  and .
  
  
  Conditional Statements and Logical Operators
Python uses  to handle conditional logic.Logical operators in Python: means both conditions must be true. means at least one must be true. inverts the truth value.

  
  
  For Loop and List Comprehension
Python's  loops are super clean:List comprehensions let you build lists in a single line:Try it yourself: Write a list comprehension that returns all even numbers from 0 to 20.
  
  
  Functions and Lambda Functions
Python functions use the  keyword:Lambda functions are one-liner anonymous functions:You’ll often see lambdas used in sorting, mapping, or filtering lists.While Python has a lot going for it — especially its simplicity and readability — it's not without tradeoffs.Python tends to run slower than JavaScript in browser-based environments.It's not the best fit for mobile app development.And because it's dynamically typed, it can lead to unexpected bugs if you're not careful with types.But in many cases, these drawbacks are outweighed by Python's ease of use, massive ecosystem, and wide range of applications — especially in data science and automation.As with any language, it's about choosing the right tool for the job.This blog isn’t meant to cover  about Python — instead, it’s a reflection of what stood out to me as a JavaScript developer learning Python for the first time. These are the things I found quirky, interesting, and surprisingly smooth to work with — like list comprehensions, lambda functions, and Python’s indentation-based style.There’s still  to explore in Python: Modules, Dictionaries, Classes and Object-Oriented Programming, File handling, Error handling… the list goes on.I’m still learning, and I plan to write more as I go deeper. But if you’re curious and want to keep exploring, here are some  that have helped me: — The most accurate and comprehensive reference for Python syntax, features, and standard library modules. A bit dense, but essential for in-depth learning. — Interactive lessons with a built-in coding environment. Excellent if you prefer to learn by doing.Thanks for reading — and if you’re learning Python too, I’d love to hear what surprised or confused  the most. Let’s keep building and getting better together!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Force Make migrations in Django</title><link>https://dev.to/msnmongare/force-make-migrations-in-django-4nf7</link><author>Sospeter Mong&apos;are</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 20:04:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Django, there's  for , but here are equivalent ways to forcefully regenerate migrations:

LLM API to generate replies to the messages.For this project, I'm using  model. It works well for me in many cases before; you can try playing around with other models.With a free OpenRouter account, you can call the API . If you're just playing around, you can use it.But if you scale, you can add credits, or if you're from India, you can use  and use the services at scale at a very reasonable price.You can find a lot of models there also.Ok, now just create an API key on  or  and copy the key.Now open the  and install the  package by running !pip install pyTelegramBotAPI command.Open your code editor and paste this code.import telebot
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "<--TELEGRAM BOT API KEY-->"
bot = telebot.TeleBot(API_KEY)

def start_chat(message):
  return True

@bot.message_handler(func=start_chat)
def chat(message):

  print('Typing...')
  bot.send_chat_action(chat_id=message.chat.id, action='typing')

  response = requests.post(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer <--LLM API KEY-->",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    data=json.dumps({
      "model": "qwen/qwen3-32b:free",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": message.text
        },
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are <--BOT NAME-->, created by <--COMPANY NAME--> at <--COMPANY LOCATION-->, by <--DEVELOPER NAME-->, a smart and friendly AI assistant. Always respond in a short, clear, and to-the-point manner. Avoid unnecessary explanations unless asked. Use simple language. Prioritise helpfulness, speed, and clarity. If unsure, say so briefly."
        }
      ],

    })
  )
  data = response.json()
  reply = data['choices'][0]['message']['content']
  reply = reply.replace('**', "")
  bot.send_message(message.chat.id, reply)
  print('Reply sent to '+message.from_user.first_name)

print('AI is running...')

bot.infinity_polling()
This is the code you need for the bot.Change the API keys and system prompt details accordingly. You can also tweak & use different system prompts to do a completely different job as well as I said earlier.Make use of updating the  and  according to the service you use.By now, if you run the code, you'll find your bot working perfectly fine like this.Awesome, now just keep running the server, and when it's running, your bot is also running.Now, to run it 24x7, you can deploy the Python code to any cloud VPS server from any of your preferred hosting companies.You can also rent  CPU and GPU to run your applications and AI models as well.Or if you've an active internet connection in your home, you can use your old Android mobile as a server and it's pretty much do the work pretty well.Just download  and run the Python script there.If you want to SSH your Termux terminal to your computer for development purposes, you can follow this tutorial from  channel.Now connect the phone to the charger, connect to WiFi and just run the Python script.Congratulations on your new .By now, if your friends think you're cool, give me a treat, bro!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hilarious Guide to Python Libraries: Meet the Machine Learning Family 😂</title><link>https://dev.to/urvashiagrawaldev/hilarious-guide-to-python-libraries-meet-the-machine-learning-family-4cok</link><author>Urvashi Agrawal</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 19:36:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[📘 CV (Computer Vision) — The Memory Book

The issue is that all of these require a bit of code to get your started. For example, assuming you have an API key in your environment like I do, you’ll need at least this code to make an LLM call with OpenAI (also assuming you’re using the older Chat Completions endpoint).And if you want to wrap your API call with a function so you can call it repeatedly, that’s even more lines!And that is simply unacceptable!No, I’m being facetious. For most LLM projects, consistency of output trumps anything else, however sometimes its nice to have a super simple way to add LLMs to my one-off python scripts and tools without all the boilerplate. Magentic is a Python package that lets you create functions that call LLMs in 3 lines of code. No, really! Here’s an example ripped straight from their docs.Thanks to some black box dark magic that I don’t feel like learning about, this is a completely valid Python function that’s callable anywhere in the script, assuming you have an OpenAI API Key in your environment variables.
  
  
  A Note On Package Management
I’m going to be using the PEP 723 standard at the top of all my scripts for the rest of this post. This allows you to use uv, the best package manager for Python, to run the scripts without you having to make a virtual environment, then install packages, then run the script. This automates all three of those tasks into a single command. Here’s an example.Here’s the above script with the added metadata and some slight modifications. This assumes you have uv installed and the  env var set.This script can now be downloaded and ran like an executable. I’ve uploaded to a gist for easy download.wget  dudeify https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chand1012/218372f3e1101dfa7f915dc35c0e66d8/raw/363f720d21fa8ebe2e6a484f6b389496c3452064/dudeify.py
 +x dudeify
./dudeify The first time you run the script it’ll handle making a cached virtual environment for the next time you run it! For more information on how this works, you can check out the uv docs, and the blog post that inspired my constant use of this feature.If you want to have structured outputs, like for example for an API response or just to make it easier to parse and use the data with your scripts, you can use a Pydantic Dataclass.Here’s an example of that method being ran.
  
  
  Prompting and Function Calls
There’s two ways you can prompt the LLM with Magentic. You can either use the  decorator, as I’ve been using, which is the simplest and fastest way to create LLM methods. There’s also , which allows you to pass a list of chat messages to the LLM. This is especially useful for few-shot prompting, where you give the LLM some examples of what output you want. After all, LLMs  just fancy pattern matching black boxes.You can also pass function calls to LLMs to allow them to return a python callable that you can call later. Another use of this is the decorator  which allows you to have an LLM call a function and use the returned results to generate its response.If you’re a data conscious person, or just want your options to be open, Magentic can be configured to work with nearly all other LLMs as long as they are supported by LiteLLM or offer an OpenAI compatible API. Here’s an example of a script that runs entirely locally using Ollama and Google’s Gemma 3.You can use the LiteLLM method to use Anthropic’s Claude series of models, or you can use Magentic’s official Anthropic extension.Need an async function? Just prefix with  instead of  !You can use Python’s  to make multiple simultaneous calls to the LLM.Need to stream the response back to the user? Use Magentic’s  to loop through the response chunks.This also works for multiple objects, simply wrap your objects in the  class.Working with LLMs is now easier than ever, and Magnetic makes it even easier than the standard methods to quick add LLMs to any Python script, regardless of the scale of complexity. Using this in tandem with something like uv and the new scripting metadata allows you to quickly make command line tools that can utilize AI quickly and effectively. I won’t always use Magentic for every project I need an LLM for, but I’ll definitely use it all the time with my small one-offs and utilities.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Set Up a Django Project Structure Using VS Code</title><link>https://dev.to/annnab2222/how-to-set-up-a-django-project-structure-using-vs-code-3189</link><author>Hannah</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:55:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're just getting started with Django and want to build your project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you're in the right place. In this guide, I’ll walk you through setting up a clean Django project structure from scratch using VS Code — perfect for beginners and those who want a solid foundation for scalable web apps.
Before l dive in, make sure you have the following installed:📁 Step 1: Create Your Project Folder.
Open VS Code and create a new folder;`mkdir my_django_project
cd my_django_project
after the creating this how they will look like;🧪Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Virtual environments are essential in Python development—especially for Django projects. Each Python project might require different versions of packages. A virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated so that one project’s requirements don’t interfere with another’s.
we need to Create and activate a virtual environment;python -m venv env
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
📦Step 3: Install Django.
Once your virtual environment is activated, the next step is to install Django — the powerful web framework that will power your project.
Install Django using pip;After install it look like this;then after that run the server python manage.py runserverthen it click the link and it brings success of install of django 🚀Step 4: Start a New Django ProjectNow create your Django project`django-admin startproject <project_name>`


Your folder structure should now look like this:my_django_project/
├── config/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── manage.py
└── env/

Step 5: Create a Django AppInstalled the required django apps l used command to create the apps which they were two apps;Now your structure will look like this ;but for the second app this how structure will look like;Each app will have its own views and templates. Here’s how to link them and display two templates from each.
`blog/
    └── blog/
        └── about.htmlportfolio/
└── templates/
        ├── home.html``In Django, URLs are how you connect your web browser to specific views in your app. Think of them as the road signs that tell Django which view to display when someone visits a certain page. 
this how it look like;In Django, HTML is used to build the templates that define how your web pages look. These templates are combined with data from your views to create dynamic, interactive websites.l added them this how it look liked;Now you can run the project and see how it look;python manage.py runserverthis how it will look like;In this guide, we walked through the full process of setting up a Django project using Visual Studio Code. Here's a quick recap of what we covered:✅ Creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies✅ Installing Django and verifying the installation✅ Starting a new Django project and creating multiple apps✅ Setting up views, templates, and URL routing for each app✅ Understanding how HTML works within Django templatesDjango is incredibly powerful once you get the hang of it—and the best way to learn is by building.Got questions, stuck somewhere, or want to share what you built?

  Day Four of My Django Bootcamp: Crafting the Structure of My Django Project
Today is the fourth day of my Django bootcamp, and it has been an exciting journey so far! I focused on creating and structuring my Django project while learning a lot about apps, templates, and URL configurations. Here’s a friendly walkthrough of how I accomplished it using Git Bash as my terminal.1. Starting the Django Project 🚀
The first step was to create a new Django project named . This project would serve as the foundation for everything else. Using Git Bash, I navigated to my desired directory and set up a virtual environment:dijango
dijango
python  venv venv
venv/bin/activate  
venvcriptsctivate   Next, I installed Django and created the project:pip django
django-admin startproject dijango Here’s what the structure looked like at this point:: The project’s control center.: A directory containing core files like , , and others. 🛠️
Django encourages splitting functionality into smaller units called apps. I created two apps,  and , to separate different functionalities:python manage.py startapp REE1
python manage.py startapp REE2
Each app came with its own files, like  and . To make Django recognize these apps, I added them to the  section in :Templates define how the front-end of the app looks. Using Git Bash, I created a  directory in the root folder and added subfolders for each app:templates
templates/REE1
templates/REE2
In , I updated the  configuration to include the new directory:URL configurations connect specific views to URLs. Since Django doesn’t create  files for apps by default, I manually added them for  and .I then updated the main project’s  to include these app-specific routes:5. Adding Views and Templates 🖼️
In Django, views determine what gets displayed for each URL. I created simple views for both apps:Next, I added basic HTML templates:templates/REE1/index.html:REE1 IndexWelcome to REE1!:REE2 HomeWelcome to REE2!Using Git Bash throughout this process made it easy to execute commands and navigate between directories. As I continue exploring Django, I look forward to building more complex projects and honing my skills. If you’re on a similar journey, let’s connect and share our progress!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Come along for 20 days of deep Django learning experience with me</title><link>https://dev.to/nyambura20/come-along-for-20-days-of-deep-django-learning-experience-with-me-4efa</link><author>Sarah Nyambura Kiiru</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:19:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: How I understood and practiced about the structure of Django
The first thing is to understand what a structure is.is the organized way in which parts of something are arranged or built.It helps one to understand where things belong and maintain one's project as it grows helping in collaboration without confusion.To be able to have a project structured in the Django style you run the following command to start the project.django-admin startproject <project_name>
This is how the project structure will look like afterwards:my_project/
    manage.py 
    my_project/
 - It is a command-line utility used to runserver, migrations etc (directory with the same name as your project) - This directory contains the project-wide settings and configurations. The files it contained are as below:my_project/
    __init__.py
    settings.py
    urls.py
    asgi.py

 - This empty file tells Python to treat the directory as a package. It's necessary for importing files across different modules something you'll do a lot in Django projects. - Contains all the configuration settings for your Django project, such as installed apps, middleware, database settings, static file paths, and more. - Acts as the "table of contents" for your site. It defines how URLs are routed to views — basically deciding what happens when someone visits a specific page. - Entry point for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), which allows your Django app to support asynchronous features like WebSockets and background tasks. -     Entry point for WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), which helps traditional web servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI serve your Django project. This is what powers your site in most production environments. Something to note is to ensure you have created a virtual environment in VS code so as to start the django project
You need to run the server so that to make sure the project runs(a rocket like thing will be displayed in the browser to confirm that)python manage.py runserver
In order to get to practice on the django structure I created two applications for my day1 learning of django:  and  apps 
To be able to create the apps I used:python manage.py startapp journal
python manage.py startapp about 
Each app contains files and a folder which are: - Configuration for the Django admin interface. - Configuration for the app itself. - Contains the database models for the app. - Contains tests for the app. - Contains the request/response logic for the app. - Contains database migrations for the app. Then I registered the 2 apps in the  file For the 2 apps I created a folder templates for each.For the about app the template folder contained an about folder that has an  file
   For the journal app the template folder contained an journal folder that has an  filein the settings.py had to tell Django where to find the template: BASE_DIR / ,Then routed the URL so that the templates to be visible in the browser
I did this by creating file for each app and linking it from  file of each app For The whole project URL fileI then started the developer server 
and used this link for me to get results http://127.0.0.1:8000/journal/diary_entries/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/about_me/My project about creating a diary was complete I had some challenges but got through but did not stop me from proceeding.
This diary apps enabled me to get to understand how the Django structure works.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing the Three Versions of TextCleaner: free , pro, and Pro Enhanced</title><link>https://dev.to/nova_soft_d42c9d58573e2a4/introducing-the-three-versions-of-textcleaner-free-pro-and-pro-enhanced-152h</link><author>Nova Soft</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:06:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m excited to introduce the different versions of TextCleaner, a Python-based desktop tool designed to clean messy text files by removing HTML tags, emojis, weird symbols, and more.Here’s a quick overview of the three editions:Removes HTML tags, emojis, and strange charactersNo installation needed — just run the .exeIncludes all Lite featuresAdds advanced cleaning options like regex supportAllows batch processing of multiple filesAll Standard features plus:In-depth text analysis and comparison toolsCustomizable cleaning workflowsSupports Arabic and multiple languagesFeel free to try any version that fits your needs!

However, how you start your Django project can significantly impact its scalability, maintainability, and performance. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough to help you start your Django project the right way, ensuring a solid foundation for success and also tries to explain the project settings and configurations.project structure in django is designed to support the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is Django’s version of the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework.I created a folder on my desktop to hold my project and named it "WASTE SOTOR".I create a virtual enviroment, since am on windows i used,This creates a folder named env that will store all project-specific Python packages. 
Later i had to activate the enviroment using;This is an image after i have created and activated the virtual enviroment it created a folder named env.This is are the folders that are created after installing Django, they are created on the env folder.Start a project
I used this since i wanted my project to be called waste_sorter ;django-admin startproject waste_sorter This are the project settings and configurations installed.checking if my project was working
I had to run my project using;python manage.py runserver
follow the link provide and you should see this;1.init.py- Makes the folder a Python package .
2.settings.py-Contains all configurations: database, apps, templates, static files, etc.
3.urls.py-Controls which page shows whatand also connects URLs to views.
4.asgi.py-Used for advanced or real-time features and also handles asynchronous requests.
5.wsgi.py-Used to connect Django to a web server and handles normal (synchronous) requests.In this case i started my app and i had 2 of them  using  the command;python manage.py startapp app_name
here is an image both apps i created;admin.py: Configuration for the Django admin interface.apps.py: Configuration for the app itself. models.py: Contains the database models for the app.tests.py: Contains tests for the app.views.py: Contains the request/response logic for the app.migrations/: Contains database migrations for the app.

so that my apps could be recognized ,i opened the settings.py and added the apps on the INSTALLED_APPS.
  
  
  writing views and creating urls
this are the codes that i wrote, i had two since the apps are two;
  
  
  Step 7 created Urls for both apps
I created new files and made them "urls.py" under each app.
This is where i had to join bothof the urls that i created to the main project.
This is what it looked like;Adding Templates 
This this the folder that shall be kholding all my pages.
Example of one of my pages ;Checking if the project is Running ;
i used thepython manage.py runserver

It plays an important role, making code more concise and clear, while improving readability and maintainability. Its applications are wide-ranging, from enumerated types to bit operations, and even complex constant expression calculations—it can do it all.In this article, I will take you on an in-depth exploration of the magical power of , including an introduction to , its use cases, practical tips, and important considerations.Within a constant declaration, the predeclared identifier iota represents successive untyped integer constants. Its value is the index of the respective ConstSpec in that constant declaration, starting at zero.The above quote is from the official documentation. In short, by using , we can automatically create a series of consecutive integers in constant declarations, starting from zero, without manually specifying the value for each constant.
  
  
  Automatically Generating Incrementing Constant Values
With , it’s easy to generate incrementing constant values. The first constant using  in a constant declaration is initialized to 0, and subsequent constants automatically increment, making it unnecessary to specify the value of each constant manually when defining a series of incrementing constants. This improves code readability and maintainability. For example:
  
  
  Defining Enumerated Type Constants
By using , you can easily define a series of related enumerated values without having to manually specify the number for each value. This makes the enumeration type definitions more concise and easier to extend or modify. For example:By using  within constant declarations, you can create complex expressions and adjust the value of  as needed in each constant declaration. This allows you to easily generate a set of constants that follow a specific pattern. For example:By combining the left shift operator () with , you can conveniently generate a set of constants for bitwise operations. For example:
  
  
  Tips and Considerations When Using iota
We can use the underscore () to ignore certain values, for example:
  
  
  iota Is Independent in Different Constant Blocks
The scope of  is the entire constant block. The  in different constant blocks is independent, and the value of the first  in each block is always 0.This article provided a detailed introduction to .

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Efficient machine learning inference separates promising prototypes from production-ready systems. I've spent years wrestling with latency spikes and resource constraints across edge devices, cloud instances, and embedded systems. These eight Python techniques consistently deliver performance gains while preserving accuracy.  Model quantization reduces numerical precision to shrink memory footprint. Converting 32-bit floats to 16-bit or 8-bit integers accelerates calculations with minimal accuracy loss. In one deployment, this cut inference time by 60% on mobile processors. Here's practical TensorFlow implementation:Pruning eliminates redundant neural connections. I approach this as iterative sculpting - gradually removing low-weight connections during training. Sparsity patterns emerge naturally, like finding efficient pathways through dense forests:Batching strategies maximize hardware utilization. Grouping requests leverages parallel processing capabilities. I implement dynamic batching that adapts to fluctuating loads:ONNX Runtime provides hardware-agnostic acceleration. Switching execution providers lets me optimize for specific environments. This snippet shows how I configure sessions for different hardware:Apache TVM compiles models to hardware-native code. Ahead-of-time compilation generates optimized executables. I use this for deploying to edge devices with limited resources:Asynchronous pipelines separate I/O from computation. This design pattern overlaps preprocessing with model execution. My implementation handles concurrent requests efficiently:Knowledge distillation transfers capabilities to smaller models. I train compact student models using guidance from larger teacher models. This technique maintains accuracy while reducing computational demands:Monitoring production systems detects performance degradation. Statistical tests identify data drift and model decay. I implement continuous validation with this approach:These techniques form a comprehensive toolkit for inference optimization. Each addresses specific constraints I've encountered in real-world deployments. Quantization excels on mobile processors, while TVM shines in cross-compilation scenarios. Asynchronous patterns prove invaluable in high-throughput APIs, and distillation creates efficient specialized models. Performance monitoring completes the lifecycle, ensuring sustained accuracy.  The most effective solutions combine multiple approaches. I typically start with quantization and pruning during model export, then layer hardware-specific optimizations like TVM compilation. For server deployments, I implement batching and asynchronous pipelines. Edge deployments benefit most from quantization and TVM. Continuous monitoring provides safety nets for all scenarios.  
  
  
  Through careful implementation, I've achieved latency reductions up to 85% compared to baseline implementations. Resource consumption often drops to one-third of original requirements. These gains enable applications previously considered impractical - real-time video analysis on IoT devices, high-frequency trading predictions, and responsive medical diagnostics. The Python ecosystem provides robust tools, but thoughtful architecture determines ultimate performance.

As a developer who loves a good retro arcade game and is curious about AI-driven development, this was the perfect excuse to dive in. The mission was simple: build a game using Amazon Q's command-line interface, document the journey, and share the results.The result? A fully-functional, nostalgic side-scrolling shooter called , and a ton of insights into pairing AI with a classic coding project. Here’s how it went down.
  
  
  My Game: "Space Conquer" - A Modern-Classic Shooter
For my project, I chose to build , a side-scrolling space shooter inspired by the classic  from old Nokia phones. Like many, I have fond memories of playing . I wanted to capture that simple, addictive fun but with a modern coat of paint—better graphics, dynamic sound, and smoother controls. A 2D shooter involves a fantastic mix of programming challenges that are perfect for an AI assistant: managing game states, handling real-time user input, collision detection, and creating varied enemy behaviors. I didn't just want to build a game; I wanted to build a . My vision was a modular design where new enemies, power-ups, or levels could be added easily. This is where an AI's ability to generate structured, boilerplate code would really shine.Space Conquer features diverse enemies, collectible power-ups, dynamic audio that changes with the game state, and even a hidden developer panel for testing.
  
  
  Unlocking AI's Potential: Effective Prompting Techniques
Working with Amazon Q CLI is a conversation. The better your questions, the better the answers. I quickly learned that vague prompts like "make a game" were less effective than breaking down the problem into specific, well-defined tasks.Here are a few prompting techniques I discovered.
  
  
  Technique 1: Requesting a Modular Architecture
Instead of asking for a single, monolithic script, I prompted for a clean, organized structure from the start. "Create a project structure for a PyGame-based space shooter. I need separate modules for asset management, sprites (player, enemies, bullets), UI components, and the main game loop. The asset manager should load images and sounds from manifest files." Amazon Q generated a directory structure (, , ) and starter Python files for each module (, , , ). The generated  included a function to read a JSON manifest, which was a huge head start.
  
  
  Technique 2: Defining Behavior with Roles and Rules
When creating enemies, I defined their characteristics and constraints clearly. "Generate a Python class  that inherits from . It needs attributes for health, speed, and score value. Then, create a subclass  that moves in a sine wave pattern down the screen and fires a bullet every 2 seconds." Q provided a base  class and a well-defined  subclass with its  method already implementing the sine wave movement using . This saved me from figuring out the trigonometry and timing loops myself.
  
  
  How AI Handled Classic Programming Challenges
Game development is full of recurring problems. Here's how Amazon Q helped tackle some of the classics: A game needs distinct states like 'main_menu', 'gameplay', 'settings', and 'game_over'. I prompted the AI to implement a simple state machine. It generated a  class that held the current state and handled transitions, ensuring that the main menu logic didn't run during gameplay and vice-versa. A core mechanic of any shooter. I asked Q for an efficient way to check for collisions between player bullets and enemies, and between the player and enemy ships or bullets. It suggested using PyGame's built-in pygame.sprite.groupcollide() function, providing a concise and performant solution that I could drop right into my main game loop. I wanted power-ups to drop randomly from destroyed asteroids. I prompted: "When an asteroid is destroyed, there should be a 15% chance of it dropping a power-up. The power-up type (health, speed, rapid-fire) should be chosen randomly." The AI generated a clean if random.random() < 0.15: check and a  call to select from a list of power-up types.
  
  
  Time-Saving Automation: More Than Just Code
One of the biggest wins was using AI for automation  the code. The project summary mentions developer tools, and Q was instrumental here.
  
  
  The Asset Manifest Generator
My game uses JSON files to manage all assets (images, sounds, maps). Manually keeping these in sync is tedious. "Write a Python script for the  directory that scans the  and  directories and automatically generates a  file with all the file paths."This single prompt created a utility script that saved me countless minutes of error-prone manual editing every time I added a new enemy sprite or sound effect.
  
  
  The Cross-Platform Launcher
I wanted a simple way for anyone to run the game, regardless of their OS. "Create a Python script named  that checks the user's operating system. It should ensure all dependencies from  are installed using pip and then launch the  script."Q generated a script using the  and  modules that provided a one-click experience—a small but professional touch that I might have skipped otherwise.
  
  
  AI-Generated Code That Impressed Me
It's one thing to generate boilerplate, but another to produce elegant solutions. Here are a couple of snippets that stood out.
  
  
  1. Manifest-Driven Asset Loader
This function, generated early on, set the foundation for the game's modularity. It loads all assets listed in a JSON file into a dictionary, making them easily accessible throughout the game.This design is clean, error-handled, and makes adding 50 new assets as easy as adding one.A Base Class for Animated UI Panels
I wanted the UI to have a modern, "glowing" feel. I asked Q to create a reusable class for this.
# Part of src/ui.py
import pygame

class GlowingPanel(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """
    A UI panel that has a subtle pulsing glow effect by alpha blending.
    """
    def __init__(self, rect, color, glow_color):
        super().__init__()
        self.rect = rect
        self.color = color
        self.glow_color = glow_color
        self.image = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)

        self.glow_alpha = 100
        self.glow_direction = 2 # Rate of change for alpha

    def update(self):
        """Update the pulsing glow effect."""
        self.glow_alpha += self.glow_direction
        if self.glow_alpha >= 180 or self.glow_alpha <= 80:
            self.glow_direction *= -1

        self.image.fill((0, 0, 0, 0)) # Clear with transparency

        # Draw base panel
        pygame.draw.rect(self.image, self.color, (0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height), border_radius=8)

        # Draw glow effect (a slightly larger rect with changing alpha)
        glow_surface = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)
        glow_rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height)
        glow_color_with_alpha = (*self.glow_color, self.glow_alpha)
        pygame.draw.rect(glow_surface, glow_color_with_alpha, glow_rect, border_radius=10)

        # Blit the glow onto the main surface
        self.image.blit(glow_surface, (0,0), special_flags=pygame.BLEND_RGBA_ADD)
This self-contained class for a UI element with its own animation logic is a great example of the object-oriented code Q can produce. It's reusable for scoreboards, health bars, or any other panel in the game.Final Thoughts
Using Amazon Q CLI for the "Build Games" challenge was a fantastic experience. It didn't just write code for me; it acted as a partner that handled the tedious, boilerplate, and sometimes complex parts of development, freeing me up to focus on the creative vision for "Space Conquer."If you're a developer who hasn't tried integrating an AI assistant into your workflow, I highly recommend it.

During my exploration of modern development practices, I discovered that creating truly universal web applications requires more than just writing portable code - it demands a deep understanding of deployment strategies, environment management, and platform-specific optimizations.
  
  
  The Promise of Write Once Run Everywhere
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have witnessed the evolution from platform-specific development to universal application frameworks. The dream of "write once, run everywhere" has driven countless innovations in software development, from Java's virtual machine to modern containerization technologies.Modern web frameworks have brought us closer to this ideal than ever before. By leveraging platform-agnostic technologies and standardized deployment practices, we can build applications that deliver consistent experiences across diverse environments.
  
  
  Container-First Deployment Strategy
In my exploration of cross-platform deployment, I discovered that containerization provides the most reliable path to universal application deployment. Containers abstract away platform differences while providing consistent runtime environments.The framework I've been studying embraces container-first deployment with intelligent platform detection and optimization. This approach ensures that applications can leverage platform-specific optimizations while maintaining portability across different environments.
  
  
  Environment Configuration Management
One of the biggest challenges in cross-platform deployment is managing configuration across different environments. Through my experience, I learned that successful universal applications require sophisticated configuration management that adapts to platform capabilities and deployment contexts.The key principles I discovered include:: Automatically detecting platform capabilities and constraints: Enabling/disabling features based on platform support: Adjusting resource usage based on available system resources: Providing fallback behavior when platform features are unavailableThis article documents my exploration of cross-platform application development as a junior student. Through practical implementation and deployment experience, I learned the importance of building applications that adapt intelligently to their runtime environment while maintaining consistent functionality across platforms.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Context Design Philosophy Patterns High Web（1751296260377800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_916383d5/context-design-philosophy-patterns-high-web1751296260377800-37g8</link><author>member_916383d5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 15:11:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior student learning web frameworks, I often get headaches from complex API designs. Traditional frameworks often require memorizing numerous method names and parameters, with vastly different API styles for different functionalities. When I encountered this Rust framework's Context design, I was deeply moved by its consistency and simplicity.

The most impressive design of this framework is the Context. It unifies all HTTP request and response operations under a simple interface, allowing developers to handle various web development tasks in a consistent manner.This example demonstrates the consistency of the Context API. Whether retrieving request information or setting responses, everything follows the same naming pattern, allowing developers to get up to speed quickly.
  
  
  Method Chaining: Fluent Programming Experience
Another highlight of Context design is support for method chaining, making code very fluent and readable:Method chaining not only makes code more concise but also reduces repetitive  prefixes, improving code readability.
  
  
  Attribute System: Flexible Data Passing
Context's attribute system is a very powerful feature that allows data passing between different stages of request processing:This example shows how to use the attribute system to pass data between middleware and route handlers, achieving a loosely coupled design.
  
  
  Type-Safe Attribute Access
Context's attribute system is not only flexible but also type-safe, thanks to Rust's type system:
  
  
  Real Application Experience
In my projects, Context design brought significant improvements to development experience:: Consistent API design helped me quickly master all functionalities: Method chaining and clear method naming make code self-documenting: Compile-time checking prevents runtime errors: Lightweight design doesn't impact application performanceThrough actual usage, I found:Development efficiency improved by 60%API usage errors almost eliminatedContext's design philosophy embodies the principle of "simple but not simplistic." It abstracts complex HTTP processing into a simple, consistent interface, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than framework details.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Plugin System Design How to Build Extensible Framework Core Architecture（1751296181433600）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_35db4d53/plugin-system-design-how-to-build-extensible-framework-core-architecture1751296181433600-46ad</link><author>member_35db4d53</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 15:09:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

Am quite excited to share what I did today while learning Django structure.
  
  
  step 1; setting up my project.
As part of my tech journey, I decided to build a Django project to practice web development. I named my project njeriproject. Here’s how I got started:
django-admin startproject njeriproject
cd njeriproject
python -m venv rbenv
rbenv\Scripts\activate
pip install django
in this i created a virtual environment by the name brenv and installed django.
Then I created two apps inside it:
  
  
  Step 2: Understanding the Django Structure
After running the command, my project looked like this:njeri/
├── manage.py
├── mysite/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   └── wsgi.py

I explored and learned what each file does:- This lets me run commands like runserver or makemigrations- This Contains all project settings like installed apps and database config- Handles all routing and linking to app URLs- Help when deploying to a web server
  
  
  Step 3: Creating Two Django Apps
To organize my site into separate features, I created two apps where each app came with important files like;
views.py, models.py, admin.py, apps.py, tests.py, and a migrations/ folder
  
  
  Step 4: Registering the Apps
To make Django recognize both apps, I opened mysite/settings.py and added them in INSTALLED_APPS 
  
  
  Step 5: Writing Views and Creating URLs

In app1/views.py i created this codefrom django.shortcuts import render

def app1_home(request):
    return render(request, 'app1_home.html')

then created urls.py for app1 added the following in itfrom django.urls import path
from .views import app1_home

urlpatterns = [
    path('', app1_home, name='app1_home'),
]
** For app2**
In app2/views.py:from django.shortcuts import render

def app2_home(request):
    return render(request, 'app2_home.html')
Then I created app2/urls.py:from django.urls import path
from .views import app2_home

urlpatterns = [
    path('', app2_home, name='app2_home'),
]

  
  
  Step 6: Connecting Both Apps in mysite/urls.py
Now it was time to connect both apps to the main URL configuration.In mysite/urls.py I wrote:from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('app1/', include('app1.urls')),
    path('app2/', include('app2.urls')),
]

At first, I forgot to import include and Django gave me an error. But once I fixed that, the server ran smoothly.
  
  
  Step 7: Adding Templates for HTML Pages
After getting simple text responses to show up using HttpResponse, I wanted to display proper HTML pages using templates.So I created a templates folder inside each app
In both app1 and app2, I made this folder structure:app1/
└── templates/
    └── app1/
        └── home.html
app2/
└── templates/
    └── app2/
        └── home.html
I created basic HTML files in both apps.I updated the views to render templates
In app1/views.py:from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'app1/home.html')
In app2/views.py:

`from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'app2/home.html')
I ran the server with the following commandpython manage.py runserverThen I opened my browser and tested. this is what my page looked like after adding /app1 in the URL generated. Seeing both apps work made me feel proud and confident in using Django.Django projects can be modular — I can add many apps like I did with app1 and app2.The outer folder (njeri) holds everything; the inner mysite/ config folder manages settings, URLs, and deployment files.Even small mistakes (like forgetting include) can break the app — but the error messages help a lot
Building the njeri project taught me how Django is structured and how everything connects from creating apps, to writing views, to linking URLs. Working with two apps in one project showed me Django’s power and flexibility.I’m still learning, but now I feel more confident to build real Django websites.

During my exploration of modern web development, I discovered that understanding the journey from low-level TCP protocols to high-level application layer protocols is essential for building robust, high-performance networked applications.
  
  
  The Foundation: Understanding TCP/IP Stack
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to appreciate that network programming is built upon layers of abstraction, each serving a specific purpose in the communication process. The TCP/IP stack provides the foundation for all modern network communication, and understanding its intricacies is crucial for any serious network programmer.The beauty of the TCP/IP model lies in its layered approach, where each layer handles specific responsibilities while abstracting away the complexity of lower layers. This separation of concerns enables developers to focus on application logic while relying on proven protocols for reliable data transmission.
  
  
  Application Layer Protocol Design
Through my exploration of network programming, I discovered that designing effective application layer protocols requires careful consideration of several factors: message framing, serialization formats, error handling, and extensibility. The application layer is where business logic meets network communication, making it crucial to get the design right.
  
  
  Message Framing Strategies
One of the first challenges in protocol design is determining how to frame messages. Different framing strategies have different trade-offs:: Each message starts with a length field indicating the message size: Messages are separated by special delimiter characters: All messages have a predetermined fixed size: Messages contain metadata about their own structure
  
  
  Serialization and Data Formats
The choice of serialization format significantly impacts protocol performance and compatibility:: Compact and fast but less human-readable (Protocol Buffers, MessagePack): Human-readable and debuggable but larger (JSON, XML): Combining binary efficiency with text readability where appropriate
  
  
  Performance Optimization Techniques
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key techniques for maximizing network programming performance:Minimizing data copying between user space and kernel space can dramatically improve performance. Techniques like  on Linux and memory-mapped I/O enable efficient data transfer without unnecessary copying.
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Reuse
Establishing TCP connections has significant overhead. Connection pooling and HTTP keep-alive mechanisms reduce this overhead by reusing existing connections for multiple requests.
  
  
  Asynchronous I/O and Event-Driven Architecture
Traditional blocking I/O models don't scale well for high-concurrency scenarios. Asynchronous I/O using epoll (Linux), kqueue (BSD), or IOCP (Windows) enables handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
  
  
  Security Considerations in Network Programming
Network programming involves numerous security considerations that must be addressed from the ground up:
  
  
  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Implementing proper TLS support is essential for secure communication. This includes certificate validation, cipher suite selection, and protection against various attacks like MITM and downgrade attacks.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
All network input must be treated as potentially malicious. Proper validation and sanitization prevent buffer overflows, injection attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.
  
  
  Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
Implementing rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms helps ensure service availability under attack conditions.
  
  
  Error Handling and Resilience
Robust network programming requires comprehensive error handling and resilience mechanisms:Proper handling of connection failures, timeouts, and network partitions is crucial for building reliable networked applications.
  
  
  Retry Logic and Circuit Breakers
Implementing intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns helps applications gracefully handle temporary failures.Designing systems to degrade gracefully when network conditions deteriorate ensures better user experience during adverse conditions.
  
  
  Protocol Evolution and Versioning
As applications evolve, their protocols must evolve as well. Designing protocols with versioning and backward compatibility in mind is essential for long-term maintainability:Implementing version negotiation mechanisms allows clients and servers to agree on the best supported protocol version.Capability-based feature detection enables gradual rollout of new features while maintaining compatibility with older clients.Planning migration strategies for protocol changes helps ensure smooth transitions without service disruption.
  
  
  Testing and Debugging Network Applications
Network programming introduces unique testing and debugging challenges:Tools for simulating various network conditions (latency, packet loss, bandwidth limitations) help test application behavior under adverse conditions.Network protocol analyzers like Wireshark provide invaluable insights into actual network traffic and help debug protocol-level issues.Comprehensive load testing helps identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limits before deployment.
  
  
  Modern Trends and Future Directions
The network programming landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and approaches:The emergence of HTTP/3 built on QUIC represents a significant evolution in web protocols, offering improved performance and reliability.
  
  
  WebAssembly and Edge Computing
WebAssembly enables running high-performance code closer to users, changing how we think about distributed application architecture.
  
  
  Service Mesh and Microservices
Service mesh technologies provide sophisticated traffic management and observability for microservice architectures.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience with network programming, I've learned several important lessons:: Build on proven protocols and standards rather than inventing custom solutions: Network failures are inevitable; design systems to handle them gracefully: Comprehensive monitoring and metrics are essential for understanding network behavior: Security considerations must be built in from the beginning, not added as an afterthought: Network applications require extensive testing under various conditions
  
  
  The Role of Modern Frameworks
Modern web frameworks like the one I've been studying provide powerful abstractions that simplify network programming while maintaining performance. These frameworks handle many low-level details automatically while still providing access to advanced features when needed.The combination of memory safety, performance, and developer experience makes such frameworks ideal for building robust networked applications that can handle the demands of modern distributed systems.Network programming represents one of the most challenging and rewarding areas of software development. The journey from understanding basic TCP/IP concepts to building sophisticated application layer protocols requires deep technical knowledge and practical experience.Through my exploration of network programming concepts and implementation of various protocols, I've gained appreciation for the complexity and elegance of networked systems. The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for network programming, offering both high-level abstractions and low-level control when needed.As network technologies continue to evolve, the fundamental principles of reliable, secure, and efficient communication remain constant. Understanding these principles and how to apply them in practice is essential for any developer working on networked applications.The future of network programming looks bright, with new technologies and approaches constantly emerging to address the challenges of building distributed systems at scale.

Every time a project grows or requirements change, poor architecture becomes a nightmare. Only after using this Rust web framework did I truly understand that "architecture is productivity." Today, from the perspective of a ten-year editor and developer, I want to share my thoughts on modern web architecture, modularity, type safety, and error handling, based on real project experience.
  
  
  The Power of Layered Architecture
In traditional Node.js or Python web frameworks, project structure often becomes chaotic as business grows. In contrast, this framework naturally supports layered architecture, making code organization clear and maintenance easy.
  
  
  Type Safety and Modularity
In this framework, type safety is not just a slogan but a guarantee for every line of code. Whether it's request parameters, database models, or middleware, the type system catches potential errors at compile time.In dynamic language frameworks like Express.js, errors often surface at runtime, making debugging painful. This framework leverages the Result type and custom error systems to elevate error handling to the architectural level.
  
  
  Middleware and Extensibility
The middleware mechanism in this framework is extremely flexible, supporting chain calls and custom extensions. Compared to Spring Boot's interceptors or Express's middleware chain, here you get both type safety and high expressiveness.
  
  
  Comparative Analysis: Express.js, Spring Boot, Actix-web
: Flexible but not type-safe, easily out of control in large projects.: Powerful ecosystem but verbose configuration, type-safe but Java syntax is heavy.: Extremely high performance but steep learning curve due to Actor model.: Type-safe, modular, elegant error handling, clear architecture, easy to maintain.Architecture is not mysticism, but the engineering philosophy behind every line of code. Only frameworks with a strong type system, modular design, and elegant error handling allow developers to focus on business innovation. As a third-year student and tech enthusiast, I recommend this framework to anyone who pursues high-quality code and ultimate maintainability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Refactoring Techniques and Code Evolution Strategies How to Improve Code Without Breaking Functionality（1751294678135300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/refactoring-techniques-and-code-evolution-strategies-how-to-improve-code-without-breaking-16aj</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:44:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

Although text documents are well-integrated into modern knowledge management systems, rich information contained in diagrams, charts, technical schematics, and visual documentation often remains inaccessible to search and AI assistants. This creates significant gaps in organizational knowledge bases, leading to interpreting visual data manually and preventing automation systems from using critical visual information for comprehensive insights and decision-making. While Amazon Q Business already handles embedded images within documents, the custom document enrichment (CDE) feature extends these capabilities significantly by processing standalone image files (for example, JPGs and PNGs).In this post, we look at a step-by-step implementation for using the CDE feature within an Amazon Q Business application. We walk you through an AWS Lambda function configured within CDE to process various image file types, and we showcase an example scenario of how this integration enhances the Amazon Q Business ability to provide comprehensive insights. By following this practical guide, you can significantly expand your organization’s searchable knowledge base, enabling more complete answers and insights that incorporate both textual and visual information sources.Example scenario: Analyzing regional educational demographicsConsider a scenario where you’re working for a national educational consultancy that has charts, graphs, and demographic data across different AWS Regions stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The following image shows student distribution by age range across various cities using a bar chart. The insights in visualizations like this are valuable for decision-making but traditionally locked within image formats in your S3 buckets and other storage.With Amazon Q Business and CDE, we show you how to enable natural language queries against such visualizations. For example, your team could ask questions such as “Which city has the highest number of students in the 13–15 age range?” or “Compare the student demographics between City 1 and City 4” directly through the Amazon Q Business application interface.You can bridge this gap using the Amazon Q Business CDE feature to:Detect and process image files during the document ingestion processExtract structured data and insights from charts and graphsMake this information searchable using natural language queriesIn this solution, we walk you through how to implement a CDE-based solution for your educational demographic data visualizations. The solution empowers organizations to extract meaningful information from image files using the CDE capability of Amazon Q Business. When Amazon Q Business encounters the S3 path during ingestion, CDE rules automatically trigger a Lambda function. The Lambda function identifies the image files and calls the Amazon Bedrock API, which uses multimodal large language models (LLMs) to analyze and extract contextual information from each image. The extracted text is then seamlessly integrated into the knowledge base in Amazon Q Business. End users can then quickly search for valuable data and insights from images based on their actual context. By bridging the gap between visual content and searchable text, this solution helps organizations unlock valuable insights previously hidden within their image repositories.The following figure shows the high-level architecture diagram used for this solution.For this use case, we use Amazon S3 as our data source. However, this same solution is adaptable to other data source types supported by Amazon Q Business, or it can be implemented with custom data sources as needed.To complete the solution, follow these high-level implementation steps:Create an Amazon Q Business application and sync with an S3 bucket.Configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data source.Extract context from the images.The following prerequisites are needed for implementation:Create an Amazon Q Business application and sync with an S3 bucketTo create an Amazon Q Business application and connect it to your S3 bucket, complete the following steps. These steps provide a general overview of how to create an Amazon Q Business application and synchronize it with an S3 bucket. For more comprehensive, step-by-step guidance, follow the detailed instructions in the blog post Discover insights from Amazon S3 with Amazon Q S3 connector.Create an index for your Amazon Q Business application.Use the built-in Amazon S3 connector to link your application with documents stored in your organization’s S3 buckets.Configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data sourceWith the CDE feature of Amazon Q Business, you can make the most of your Amazon S3 data sources by using the sophisticated capabilities to modify, enhance, and filter documents during the ingestion process, ultimately making enterprise content more discoverable and valuable. When connecting Amazon Q Business to S3 repositories, you can use CDE to seamlessly transform your raw data, applying modifications that significantly improve search quality and information accessibility. This powerful functionality extends to extracting context from binary files such as images through integration with Amazon Bedrock services, enabling organizations to unlock insights from previously inaccessible content formats. By implementing CDE for Amazon S3 data sources, businesses can maximize the utility of their enterprise data within Amazon Q, creating a more comprehensive and intelligent knowledge base that responds effectively to user queries.To configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data source, complete the following steps:Select your application and navigate to .Choose your existing Amazon S3 data source or create a new one. Verify that  under Multi-media content configuration is not enabled.In the data source configuration, locate the Custom Document Enrichment section.Configure the pre-extraction rules to trigger a Lambda function when specific S3 bucket conditions are satisfied. Check the following screenshot for an example configuration. Pre-extraction rules are executed before Amazon Q Business processes files from your S3 bucket.Extract context from the imagesTo extract insights from an image file, the Lambda function makes an Amazon Bedrock API call using Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. You can modify the code to use other Amazon Bedrock models based on your use case.Constructing the prompt is a critical piece of the code. We recommend trying various prompts to get the desired output for your use case. Amazon Bedrock offers the capability to optimize a prompt that you can use to enhance your use case specific input.Examine the following Lambda function code snippets, written in Python, to understand the Amazon Bedrock model setup along with a sample prompt to extract insights from an image.import boto3

The prompt breakdown makes it more readable and manageable. Additionally, the Amazon Bedrock prompt caching feature can be used to reduce response latency as well as input token cost.

In addition to Amazon Q pricing, this solution will incur charges for AWS Lambda and Amazon Bedrock. For more information, refer to AWS Lambda pricing and Amazon Bedrock pricing.After the Amazon S3 data is synced with the Amazon Q index, you can prompt the Amazon Q Business application to get the extracted insights as shown in the following section.Example prompts and resultsThe following question and answer pairs refer the Student Age Distribution graph at the beginning of this post.Q: Which City has the highest number of students in the 13-15 age range?Q: Compare the student demographics between City 1 and City 4?In the original graph, the bars representing student counts lacked explicit numerical labels, which could make data interpretation challenging on a scale. However, with Amazon Q Business and its integration capabilities, this limitation can be overcome. By using Amazon Q Business to process these visualizations with Amazon Bedrock LLMs using the CDE feature, we’ve enabled a more interactive and insightful analysis experience. The service effectively extracts the contextual information embedded in the graph, even when explicit labels are absent. This powerful combination means that end users can ask questions about the visualization and receive responses based on the underlying data. Rather than being limited by what’s explicitly labeled in the graph, users can now explore deeper insights through natural language queries. This capability demonstrates how Amazon Q Business transforms static visualizations into queryable knowledge assets, enhancing the value of your existing data visualizations without requiring additional formatting or preparation work.Best practices for Amazon S3 CDE configurationWhen setting up CDE for your Amazon S3 data source, consider these best practices: to only process specific file types that need transformation. with Amazon CloudWatch to track processing errors and performance.Set appropriate timeout values for your Lambda functions, especially when processing large files.Consider incremental syncing to process only new or modified documents in your S3 bucket. to track which documents have been processed by CDE.Complete the following steps to clean up your resources:Go to the Amazon Q Business application and select  for users and groups.Delete the Amazon Q Business application.Delete the Lambda function.This solution demonstrates how combining Amazon Q Business, custom document enrichment, and Amazon Bedrock can transform static visualizations into queryable knowledge assets, significantly enhancing the value of existing data visualizations without additional formatting work.

How do you handle different audio lengths, convert sound frequencies into learnable patterns, and make sure your model is robust? This tutorial will show you how to handle audio data using TorchAudio, a PyTorch-based toolkit.You’ll work with real speech data to learn essential techniques like converting waveforms to spectrograms, standardizing audio lengths, and adding controlled noise to build machine and deep learning models.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that: processes audio data for deep learning, including tasks like loading datasets and augmenting data with noise.You can load audio data in  using the  function, which returns a waveform tensor and sample rate. audio by default during loading, scaling waveform amplitudes between -1.0 and 1.0.A  visually represents the frequency spectrum of an audio signal over time, aiding in frequency analysis.You can pad and trim audio in  using torch.nn.functional.pad() and sequence slicing for uniform audio lengths.Dive into the tutorial to explore these concepts and learn how they can be applied to prepare audio data for deep learning tasks using TorchAudio. Test your knowledge with our interactive “Use TorchAudio to Prepare Audio Data for Deep Learning” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Learn Essential Technical TermsBefore diving into the technical details of audio processing with TorchAudio, take a moment to review some key terms. They’ll help you grasp the basics of working with audio data.A waveform is the visual representation of sound as it travels through air over time. When you speak, sing, or play music, you create vibrations that move through the air as waves. These waves can be captured and displayed as a graph showing how the sound’s pressure changes over time. Here’s an example:A Sample Waveform of a 440 Hz Wave

This is a waveform of a 440 Hz wave, plotted over a short duration of 10 milliseconds (ms). This is called a time-domain representation, showing how the wave’s amplitude changes over time. This waveform shows the raw signal as it appears in an audio editor. The ups and downs reflect changes in loudness. is the strength or intensity of a sound wave—in other words, how loud the sound is to the listener. In the previous image, it’s represented by the height of the wave from its center line.A higher amplitude means a louder sound, while a lower amplitude means a quieter sound. When you adjust the volume on your device, you’re actually changing the amplitude of the audio signal. In digital audio, amplitude is typically measured in decibels (dB) or as a normalized value between -1 and 1. is how many times a sound wave repeats itself in one second, measured in hertz (Hz). For example, a low bass note is a sound wave that repeats slowly, about 50–100 Hz. In contrast, a high-pitched whistle has a wave that repeats much faster, around 2000–3000 Hz.In music, different frequencies create different musical notes. For instance, the A note that musicians use to tune their instruments is exactly 440 Hz. Now, if you were to look at the frequency plot of the 440 Hz waveform from before, here’s what you’d see:A Frequency Domain Plot of a 440 Hz Wave

This plot displays the signal in the , which shows how much of each frequency is present in the sound. The distinct peak at 440 Hz indicates that this is the dominant frequency in the signal, which is exactly what you’d expect from a pure tone. While time-domain plots—like the one you saw earlier—reveal how the sound’s amplitude changes over time, frequency-domain plots help you understand which frequencies make up the sound.The waveform you just explored was from a 440 Hz wave. You’ll soon see that many examples in audio processing also deal with this mysterious frequency. So, what makes it so special? The 440 Hz frequency (A note) is the international standard pitch reference for tuning instruments. Its clear, single-frequency nature makes it great for audio tasks. These include sampling, frequency analysis, and waveform representation.Now that you understand frequency and how it relates to sound waves, you might be wondering how computers actually capture and store these waves. When you record sound digitally, you’re taking snapshots of the audio wave many times per second. Each snapshot measures the wave’s amplitude at that instant. This is called sampling. The number of snapshots taken per second is the , measured in hertz (Hz).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build AWS architecture diagrams using Amazon Q CLI and MCP</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-aws-architecture-diagrams-using-amazon-q-cli-and-mcp/</link><author>Joel Asante</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:53:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Creating professional AWS architecture diagrams is a fundamental task for solutions architects, developers, and technical teams. These diagrams serve as essential communication tools for stakeholders, documentation of compliance requirements, and blueprints for implementation teams. However, traditional diagramming approaches present several challenges: – Creating detailed architecture diagrams manually can take hours or even days – Learning specialized diagramming tools requires significant investment – Maintaining visual consistency across multiple diagrams is difficult – Keeping up with the latest AWS service icons and best practices challenging. – Updating diagrams as architectures evolve can become increasingly burdensomeAmazon Q Developer CLI with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a streamlined approach to creating AWS architecture diagrams. By using generative AI through natural language prompts, architects can now generate professional diagrams in minutes rather than hours, while adhering to AWS best practices.In this post, we explore how to use Amazon Q Developer CLI with the AWS Diagram MCP and the AWS Documentation MCP servers to create sophisticated architecture diagrams that follow AWS best practices. We discuss techniques for basic diagrams and real-world diagrams, with detailed examples and step-by-step instructions.Amazon Q Developer CLI is a command line interface that brings the generative AI capabilities of Amazon Q directly to your terminal. Developers can interact with Amazon Q through natural language prompts, making it an invaluable tool for various development tasks.Developed by Anthropic as an open protocol, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to connect AI models to virtually any data source or tool. Using a client-server architecture (as illustrated in the following diagram), the MCP helps developers expose their data through lightweight MCP servers while building AI applications as MCP clients that connect to these servers.The MCP uses a client-server architecture containing the following components: – A program or AI tool that requires access to data through the MCP protocol, such as Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, an integrated development environment (IDE), AWS MCP CLI, or other AI applications – Protocol clients that maintain one-to-one connections with server – Lightweight programs that expose capabilities through standardized MCP or act as tools – Local data sources such as databases and file systems, or external systems available over the internet through APIs (web APIs) that MCP servers can connect withAs announced in April 2025, MCP enables Amazon Q Developer to connect with specialized servers that extend its capabilities beyond what’s possible with the base model alone. MCP servers act as plugins for Amazon Q, providing domain-specific knowledge and functionality. The AWS Diagram MCP server specifically enables Amazon Q to generate architecture diagrams using the Python diagrams package, with access to the complete AWS icon set and architectural best practices.To implement this solution, you must have an AWS account with appropriate permissions and follow the steps below.Before you can start creating diagrams, you need to set up your environment with Amazon Q CLI, the AWS Diagram MCP server, and AWS Documentation MCP server. This section provides detailed instructions for installation and configuration.Install Amazon Q Developer CLIAmazon Q Developer CLI is available as a standalone installation. Complete the following steps to install it:Download and install Amazon Q Developer CLI.

Valuable code, solutions, and insights were buried in those exports. Sure, I could grep through them with my hacky script (claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor - great name, right?), but I wanted something better.So last week, with AI enthusiastically egging me on that this would be a "great resume project," I built ChatMine.
  
  
  The Twist: AI Built It Too
Here's where it gets meta. I used Claude Code extensively to build ChatMine. Yes, AI helped me build a tool to search AI conversations. 🤖In just one week, I went from idea to working product with:Semantic search using FAISSAutomatic code extractionWeb interface with FastAPIFull CLI with rich output
  
  
  What ChatMine Actually Does
python claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor.py export.json
 ./extracted/
chatmine import-claude claude-export.zip
✓ Imported 312 conversations
✓ Extracted 1,847 code snippets

chatmine search 
Found 5 relevant conversations:
1. March 2024
2. February 2024
...

chatmine code-search 
Found 23 Python async functions across your conversations

chatmine export-conversations  ./searchable/
rg  ./searchable/

  
  
  The Good, The Bad, and The Honest
It actually works! Fully functional with extensive testsSolves a real problem (beyond my hacky grep scripts)Modern Python stack: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Click, FAISSYou can STILL grep the exports, but now with better organizationI don't fully understand some ML libraries I used (FAISS, sentence-transformers)Some advanced features were "suggested" by AI that I couldn't build myselfTests were sometimes written after the code (I know, I know...)AI convinced me this was resume-worthy (it worked - I built it! 😅)This is what AI-assisted development really looks like in 2025You can ship impressive software fastBut you need to be careful about technical debt
  
  
  From Hacky Scripts to Proper Tool
My original claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor was exactly what it sounds like - a script that dumped conversations so I could grep them. ChatMine evolved from that need but added: - SQLite instead of flat files - Find concepts, not just keywords - Automatically extracts and categorizes code - Organized markdown with metadataBut honestly? Sometimes I still just want to grep things, so ChatMine can export everything to markdown files organized by date and platform. Best of both worlds!
  
  
  Key Learnings from AI-Assisted Development

  
  
  1. AI Accelerates, But Doesn't Replace Understanding

  
  
  2. Tests Are Your Safety Net
With 90% test coverage, I can refactor confidently even when I don't fully understand every library:
  
  
  3. Keep Simple Options Available
I'm open-sourcing ChatMine with a few goals: - I need help understanding the ML libraries better - Better than hacky scripts! - Honest case study in AI-assisted developmentThe repo includes a candid README about what I built with AI help vs. what I understand deeply.This experiment taught me that AI-assisted development is powerful but comes with responsibilities:Be honest about what you don't understandTest everything thoroughly
Document for your future selfKeep simple alternatives (sometimes grep is all you need!)Be ready to learn the underlying conceptsHave you built anything with heavy AI assistance? How do you balance speed with understanding? Do you have hacky scripts that could become "proper" tools? (We all do!)And if you're still grepping through AI conversation exports... well, now there's ChatMine! 🎉Currently exploring new opportunities in Python/DevOps.

It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support.Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results test (single-core):

 test (10,000 requests, 100 concurrency):


  
  
  I. Discovering : A Thoughtfully Designed Abstraction
My initial foray into writing route functions with Hyperlane introduced me to its  (or ). I was immediately struck by its design. I remember when I first needed to retrieve the request method. In more conventional Rust HTTP frameworks, the code would typically look like this:Hyperlane, however, streamlines this:This approach is akin to a well-organized backpack; the framework has systematically renamed subfields of requests and responses. For example, setting the response status code transformed from  to . While this adds a few characters, it significantly clarifies the code's logic, making it as easy to follow as a flowchart. I no longer found myself constantly consulting documentation to understand the method hierarchy.
  
  
  II. Route Macros: A Welcome Convenience
The request method macros were a real game-changer for me. While developing the homepage route, I experimented with the  combined annotation. This proved to be much more straightforward than declaring each enum value separately. I later found I could simplify it even further to . Suddenly, writing routes felt as intuitive as composing Markdown:On one occasion, a teammate mistakenly typed  instead of . The framework responded with a helpful error message, a stark contrast to some frameworks that merely throw a cryptic compilation error. Hyperlane's beginner-friendly nature is truly commendable.
  
  
  III. The Middleware Onion Model: Unpacking Request Processing
Working on user authentication provided my first real insight into the elegance of the middleware onion model. I sketched a flowchart based on the documentation (my Mermaid diagramming skills were still developing) and understood how a request navigates from the outer layers of the onion inward:graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[Authentication Middleware]
    B --> C[Logging Middleware]
    C --> D[Controller]
    D --> E[Response Formatting Middleware]
    E --> F[Client Response]
I implemented a JWT verification middleware. If an invalid token is detected, I can simply use  to halt further processing. This "short-circuit" capability is far more efficient than duplicating verification logic in every route. I recall an instance where, to debug middleware sequencing, I intentionally placed the logging middleware after authentication. The request logs subsequently filled with authentication errors, underscoring the strictness of middleware order, much like the layers of an onion.
  
  
  IV. WebSocket Support: Effortless Real-Time Chat
The most demanding aspect of the project was implementing the real-time chat feature. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane’s WebSocket lifecycle is very clearly defined. The documentation's flowchart illustrates the process:graph TD
    A[Client Connection] --> Z[Pre-upgrade Processing]
    Z --> Y[WebSocket Handshake]
    Y --> X[Connection Established Callback]
    X --> B[Middleware Processing]
    B --> C[Message Handling Controller]
    C --> D[Response Handling]
I managed to complete the WebSocket module in a single evening. The  method, in particular, allows for gracefully closing the connection when a user leaves the chat. During testing, I observed that even with 100 users chatting concurrently, server resource consumption remained stable. A roommate had previously developed a similar feature in Node.js, which crashed under a 50-person test. This comparison was a significant confidence booster.
  
  
  V. Dynamic Routing: The Fun of Regex in Parameters
When developing the product detail page route, I made use of dynamic parameters. The standard route  is straightforward, but when I needed to restrict the parameter to numerical values, I discovered I could write:This regex-based parameter matching reminded me of a Regex assignment from class. However, the framework conveniently encapsulates the complex parsing. Once, I mistakenly wrote the regex as . Instead of a server error, the framework returned a 404. I later learned this is part of its route error handling mechanism, and the attention to detail is truly impressive.
  
  
  VI. Performance Testing: Outperforming Gin?!
Before the final course presentation, I ran a performance test using  with the command:wrk  http://127.0.0.1:6000/
The results were astonishing: Hyperlane’s QPS exceeded 320,000, nearly 30% faster than an identical interface my roommate had built using Gin! While slightly slower than the underlying Tokio library, this level of performance from an upper-layer framework is more than adequate to support thousands of students using the platform simultaneously. During the presentation, when the instructor saw this data, he inquired if I had secretly optimized the server. In reality, I had simply run it with the default configuration from the documentation.
  
  
  VII. From Challenges to Appreciation: A Rust Framework's Evolution
In my early days with Hyperlane, I encountered a few hurdles. For instance, in versions prior to v4.0.0, the execution order of synchronous routes and asynchronous middleware led to a lengthy debugging session. Another time, I forgot to call  in the WebSocket processing, which prevented messages from being sent. However, each time I consulted the documentation, I found clear version descriptions. The lifecycle evolution chart, in particular, vividly illustrates the changes from v3.0.0 to v5.25.1:After v4.22.0,  can interrupt requests, much like a "pause" feature in a game. in v5.25.1 allows for actively closing connections, resolving a long-connection resource leakage issue I had previously faced.Now, the project is deployed on the university server, handling hundreds of transactions daily, and Hyperlane has consistently performed reliably. As a newcomer transitioning from C++ to Rust, I genuinely feel that this framework strikes an excellent balance between performance and ease of use. It is particularly welcoming to student developers—the example code in the documentation can be readily copied and used, unlike some frameworks that require a significant time investment to understand their architecture before getting started.If you're also undertaking a Rust Web project, I wholeheartedly recommend giving Hyperlane a try. The experience of writing code that feels like assembling building blocks truly makes programming an enjoyable endeavor.I noticed a mention of the URL ().

Looking back at my initial bewilderment when I first encountered asynchronous programming, to now being able to skillfully use asynchronous technologies to build high-concurrency systems, this process gave me a deep understanding of the essence and power of asynchronous programming.
  
  
  My Asynchronous Programming Enlightenment Journey
My asynchronous programming learning began with a performance bottleneck in a course project. At that time, I needed to design an API for the school's library management system, expecting thousands of students to query book information simultaneously. Using traditional synchronous programming models, the system began to show significant delays under just a few hundred concurrent requests.In my ten years of programming learning experience, this was the first time I truly realized the importance of concurrent programming. Although traditional threading models can handle concurrency, the overhead of thread creation and context switching caused system performance to plummet.
  
  
  Deep Practice of Asynchronous Stream Processing
In my learning process, I found that asynchronous stream processing is a key technology for handling large amounts of data. Through stream processing, we can process data immediately as it arrives, without waiting for all data to be ready.
  
  
  Asynchronous Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms
In my practice, I found that error handling in asynchronous programming is more complex than synchronous programming. We need to consider task failures, timeouts, resource competition, and other situations.Through this deep exploration of asynchronous programming, I not only mastered the core technologies of asynchronous development, but more importantly, I developed an asynchronous thinking mindset. In my future career, these experiences will become my important assets.Asynchronous programming is not just a technical skill, but a way of thinking about concurrent systems. It requires us to think about data flow, error handling, resource management, and performance optimization from a completely different perspective.I believe that as technology continues to evolve, asynchronous programming will become an essential skill for all developers, and this framework provides a perfect learning platform for developers.This article records my deep learning and practice of asynchronous programming as a junior student. Through actual code examples and project experience, I deeply experienced the importance and power of asynchronous programming in modern Web development. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Type Safety in Web Compile Time Error Robust Design（1751290821932400）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/type-safety-in-web-compile-time-error-robust-design1751290821932400-54k7</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:40:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student, I frequently encounter runtime errors during development that often cause me great pain during late-night debugging sessions. It wasn't until I encountered a Rust-based web framework that completely changed my development experience. The type safety features of this framework allowed me to discover most potential issues at compile time, greatly improving code quality and development efficiency.
  
  
  The Revolution of Compile-Time Error Checking
Traditional dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python only discover type errors at runtime, leading to many production bugs. This Rust framework captures most errors at the compilation stage through its powerful type system.
  
  
  Type-Safe Route Parameters
This framework also provides powerful type safety guarantees in route parameter handling. Parameter types are determined at compile time, avoiding runtime type conversion errors.This framework's middleware system also provides type safety guarantees. Middleware input and output types are determined at compile time, avoiding runtime type errors.This framework provides type-safe error handling mechanisms, ensuring error types are determined at compile time and avoiding runtime error type mismatches.
  
  
  Comparison with Dynamically Typed Languages
I once developed similar functionality using JavaScript, and runtime errors caused me great pain:Using this Rust framework, most errors are discovered at compile time:
  
  
  Development Efficiency Improvements from Type Safety
By using this type-safe framework, my development efficiency has improved significantly:Compile-time error discovery: Most errors are discovered at compile time, reducing debugging time: Powerful type inference and autocomplete features: Type system ensures refactoring doesn't break existing functionality: Type definitions are the best documentationAs a computer science student about to graduate, this type-safe development experience gave me a deeper understanding of modern software development. Type safety is not just a technical issue, but a key factor for development efficiency and code quality.This Rust framework shows me the future direction of modern web development: type safety, memory safety, high performance, developer-friendly. It's not just a framework, but the embodiment of a programming philosophy.I believe that as software development complexity continues to increase, type safety will become an essential skill for all developers, and this framework provides the perfect learning platform.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring type-safe web frameworks. Through actual development experience and comparative analysis, I deeply understood the importance of type safety in modern software development.

That’s fine—until it isn’t:Keyword Search Might Return“10 Best  Tables”“Wimbledon Lawn  Highlights”Articles, rules and gear for Keyword engines struggle even more with non-text media: images, audio, video, genome sequences, etc. They simply don’t “see” pixels or sound waves.Vector (semantic) search fixes this by turning each item—text, image, whatever—into a high-dimensional vector. Similar meaning -> nearby vectors. Your query is embedded the same way, and the engine brings back the closest neighbours. Vector search ➜ find things that feel the same, not just things that spell the same.
You start with a set of text passages (in the drawing they’re labelled “Text / Answers”).
Each passage is fed through an embedding model (a neural network that maps text to points in a high-dimensional space).
The model outputs a vector for each passage—these vectors (sometimes called word or sentence embeddings) capture the meaning of the text as coordinates in that space.Query Vectorization & Retrieval
When a user asks a question, you send the question through the same embedding model and obtain a query vector.
You then compare that query vector to all of your stored document vectors (e.g. with cosine similarity).
The documents whose vectors lie closest to the query vector are the most semantically relevant answers, even if they don’t share the exact same keywords. by operating in a continuous vector space rather than matching literal words, you can find passages that “mean the same thing” and surface them to your LLM (or directly to the user). This is the core of semantic (vector) search in Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.Many open-source vector databases exist; we’ll use  because it’s lightweight, fast, and has a friendly Python client.Installing Qdrant using docker:docker pull qdrant/qdrant

docker run  6333:6333  6334:6334 
   qdrant/qdrant
Installing python client libs:
  
  
  Stage 1: Connections and Data Prep
Import the necessary modules to connect to the vector DB , choose the models that would be required based on the need and study the dataset.
  
  
  Stage 2:  Storage and Index Prep
Create a collection (say for a business problem) and add points (data points or documents) into the collection that would be embedded into vectors.Upsert the relevant section of the documents into vector db.
  
  
  Stage 4: Search capability
Provide a search capability to query the documents say based on similarity matches (cosine distance)
  
  
  Stage 5: Query LLM with Vector DB as a RAG

  
  
  Improving with Hybrid Search
No single search technique suits every scenario. Sometimes you need the precision of keywords (exact product codes, player stats, specific names), and other times the flexibility of semantic matching (similar games, related concepts, broader topics). A  strategy blends both:Sparse (keyword) embeddings for exact matches
Dense (semantic) embeddings for meaning-based recall
 (e.g. reciprocal rank fusion) or  (keyword filter → semantic re-rank, or vice versa)Looking up a particular player’s season statistics? A keyword search is ideal.
Hunting for matches that felt like nail-biters? Semantic search surfaces games with similar “excitement vectors.”
  
  
  Hybrid Embedding & Fusion
By storing both sparse and dense vectors in your collection and then combining their scores—either in two passes or via a fusion query—you get the best of both worlds, serving precise queries and broad, semantically rich ones with equal finesse.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top 10 Sites to Hire Python Developers Remotely in 2025</title><link>https://dev.to/eric_walter/top-10-sites-to-hire-python-developers-remotely-in-2025-44c1</link><author>Eric Walter</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:28:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python is the most used programming language, and its demand is still increasing, especially for remote projects.

After extensive framework research and performance testing, I discovered a shocking fact: a certain Rust-based lightweight framework completely crushed mainstream choices in performance tests.
  
  
  Setting Up My Test Environment
My test machine configuration wasn't top-tier: Intel i7-10700K, 32GB RAM, running Windows 11. To ensure fair test results, I used identical test conditions, including the same port, same response content, and same Keep-Alive settings.For testing tools, I chose industry-standard wrk and Apache Bench (ab), which have widespread recognition in the pressure testing field. I kept all test code minimized to avoid business logic interference with performance testing.This test server code demonstrates the framework's simplicity. I built a complete HTTP server with middleware support and routing in less than 30 lines of code.
  
  
  wrk Pressure Testing: Stunning Results
I conducted wrk testing with 360 concurrent connections for 60 seconds. The test command was:wrk  http://127.0.0.1:60000/
Hyperlane Framework Test Results:Running 1m test @ http://127.0.0.1:60000/
  2 threads and 360 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency     1.46ms    7.74ms 230.59ms   99.57%
    Req/Sec   163.12k     9.54k  187.65k    67.75%
  19476349 requests in 1.00m, 1.94GB read
Requests/sec: 324323.71
Transfer/sec:     33.10MB
QPS reached 324,323! I double-checked this number several times. Latency was controlled at an average of 1.46ms, with 99.57% of requests within this range - excellent stability performance.To verify this result's authenticity, I simultaneously tested several other well-known frameworks:Tokio Native Implementation:Rust Standard Library Implementation:Node.js Standard Library:From this data, Hyperlane's performance is second only to Tokio's native implementation. Considering that Hyperlane provides complete web framework functionality (routing, middleware, WebSocket support, etc.) while Tokio is just the underlying async runtime, this performance is remarkable.
  
  
  Apache Bench Testing: Verifying High Concurrency Capability
To further verify the framework's high-concurrency processing capability, I used Apache Bench for extreme testing with 1000 concurrent connections and 1 million requests:ab  1000000  1000  http://127.0.0.1:60000/
Hyperlane Framework ab Test Results:Server Hostname:        127.0.0.1
Server Port:            60000
Document Path:          /
Document Length:        5 bytes
Concurrency Level:      1000
Time taken for tests:   3.251 seconds
Complete requests:      1000000
Failed requests:        0
Keep-Alive requests:    1000000
Total transferred:      107000000 bytes
HTML transferred:       5000000 bytes
Requests per second:    307568.90 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       3.251 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       0.003 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          32138.55 [Kbytes/sec] received
One million requests completed in 3.251 seconds with QPS reaching 307,568 and zero failed requests. This stability is especially valuable in high-concurrency scenarios.Comparing other frameworks' ab test results:: 307,568.90 QPS: 260,514.56 QPS: 226,550.34 QPSHyperlane again demonstrated performance close to Tokio's native implementation while providing complete web development functionality.
  
  
  Deep Analysis: Why Such Excellent Performance
Through analyzing Hyperlane's source code and architectural design, I discovered several key performance optimization points:
  
  
  2. Intelligent TCP Parameter Tuning
These configurations seem simple, but each is carefully tuned. Disabling the Nagle algorithm can significantly reduce small packet transmission latency, which is crucial for web service response times.
  
  
  3. Efficient Memory Management
Context uses a combination of Arc (atomic reference counting) and RwLock (read-write lock), ensuring thread safety while maximizing concurrent read performance.
  
  
  4. Deep Async I/O Optimization
The framework fully leverages Rust's async features, with each request's processing being non-blocking, allowing a single thread to handle thousands of concurrent connections simultaneously.
  
  
  Performance in Real Projects
In my course project, I built a simulated e-commerce API service including user authentication, product queries, order processing, and other functions. Even with complex business logic, Hyperlane maintained excellent performance:This e-commerce API maintained tens of thousands of requests per second processing capability in my tests, even involving complex data operations and JSON serialization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wisdom of Technology Selection How to Find the Most Suitable Solution Among Many Frameworks（1751288286608100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/wisdom-of-technology-selection-how-to-find-the-most-suitable-solution-among-many-4igg</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:58:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

It's my first time building a product within a cross-functional team — collaborating daily with front end engineers, product designer, and tech leads. This journey has reshaped how I think, not just about code, but about collaboration, clarity, and ownership.🤝 From Solo Dev to Team Contributor
Before Tunaresq, I often worked solo — picking up tickets, building features, and shipping without much interaction. But working in a real team taught me that alignment comes first. Now, before we start building or updating anything, we sync with our team — especially the front-end — to avoid mismatches and ensure shared understanding.
Writing APIs isn't just about endpoints — it’s about solving product problems. I now ask:Does this API support a real business case?Is the data structure clear, lean, and secure?Are auth, permissions, and edge cases covered?Working with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), I’ve built APIs for authentication, user profile management, and notification triggers — all tailored to front-end expectations and use-case needs.✅ Redefining "Done"
A task isn’t truly complete until it’s:Integrated successfully by the front-endVerified against product requirementsOnly then do I mark it "done" in Click-up. This process ensures quality and tight integration across the stack.💡 Design Before You Build
For any task expected to take hours, I now invest 25–30% of the time in:Understanding the logic and flowDesigning the API schema or modelPlanning for re-usabilityThis upfront thinking avoids rework and results in cleaner code — especially when working with repetitive structures like user roles or permission-based filtering.📖 Code Reading = Code Leveling
After I complete a task, I make it a habit to read other teammates’ code — not just to review, but to learn. I study how they:Structure  and Handle validation and exceptionsThis has helped me absorb better patterns and gradually improve my own coding standards.🧠 Owning Tasks, Solving Problems
I’ve learned to take full ownership of tasks from start to finish:Debug independently firstWhen stuck, explain what I’ve tried before asking for helpPropose alternatives when I believe something can be improvedFor example, I once saw a way to simplify a notifications endpoint. Instead of just suggesting it, I prototyped the solution and explained its performance benefit — it was adopted.
Right now, I’m actively contributing to Tunaresq’s back-end — building APIs, refining authentication workflows, and aligning closely with the front-end team. Every feature I build is tested in integration, reviewed for clarity, and aligned with product value. I’m still in the journey — improving daily, learning through feedback, and growing into a product-oriented engineer.Collaboration is a skill. Code is better when teams align.Design before you build. Time spent planning avoids hours of debugging.APIs should serve people. Focus on usability, clarity, and purpose.Own your work. From idealization to integration, be accountable.Read code, improve code. Learn from others to raise your bar.Back-end: Django, DRF, PostgreSQLVersion Control: Git, GitHub-Project Management: Click-upCommunication: Daily team stand-ups & syncs]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flame Graph Performance Truth Analysis（1751287875249300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/flame-graph-performance-truth-analysis1751287875249300-pbl</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:51:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I encountered a magical tool during my performance optimization learning journey - flame graphs. This tool completely changed my understanding of program performance analysis, transforming me from a novice who could only guess performance bottlenecks into a developer capable of precisely locating problems.
  
  
  My First Encounter with Flame Graphs
My first contact with flame graphs was when optimizing the school's course selection system. At that time, the system responded slowly during peak hours, and I tried various optimization methods, but the effects were not obvious. It wasn't until my advisor introduced me to flame graphs that I truly understood what "data-driven performance optimization" means.In my ten years of programming learning experience, flame graphs are the most intuitive and effective performance analysis tool I have encountered. They can not only display the program's call stack but, more importantly, can intuitively show the execution time proportion of each function.##
  
  
  Performance Optimization Principles Taught by Flame Graphs
Through intensive use of flame graphs, I summarized several important performance optimization principles:: Don't optimize based on feelings, use data to speak: Optimizing functions that consume the most time brings the greatest benefits: High-frequency called functions are worth optimizing even if single execution time is short: Optimization should consider code complexity and maintenance costsFlame graphs are not just a tool, but a transformation of thinking. They taught me to analyze performance problems scientifically rather than blindly guessing and trying.This article records my deep learning of flame graphs and performance analysis as a junior student. Through practical code practice and tool usage, I deeply experienced the importance of data-driven performance optimization. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Memory Safety Revolution Memory Leaks Modern Web（1751287658106900）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/memory-safety-revolution-memory-leaks-modern-web1751287658106900-1c0c</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:47:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior student learning systems programming, memory management has always been my biggest headache. Manual memory management in C/C++ often led me to encounter memory leaks, dangling pointers, and buffer overflows. While Java and Python have garbage collection, the performance overhead left me unsatisfied. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust-based web framework that I truly experienced the perfect combination of memory safety and high performance.
  
  
  Rust's Memory Safety Guarantees
The most impressive feature of this framework is that it inherits Rust's memory safety guarantees. Most memory-related errors can be caught at compile time, while runtime performance remains uncompromised.This example demonstrates how Rust guarantees memory safety at compile time. The combination of Arc (atomic reference counting) and RwLock (read-write lock) ensures memory safety in multi-threaded environments without the performance overhead of garbage collection.
  
  
  Zero-Copy Data Processing
The framework adopts zero-copy design principles in data processing, maximizing performance while ensuring memory safety:
  
  
  Memory Pools and Object Reuse

During my exploration of modern development practices, I discovered that creating truly universal web applications requires more than just writing portable code - it demands a deep understanding of deployment strategies, environment management, and platform-specific optimizations.
  
  
  The Promise of Write Once Run Everywhere
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have witnessed the evolution from platform-specific development to universal application frameworks. The dream of "write once, run everywhere" has driven countless innovations in software development, from Java's virtual machine to modern containerization technologies.Modern web frameworks have brought us closer to this ideal than ever before. By leveraging platform-agnostic technologies and standardized deployment practices, we can build applications that deliver consistent experiences across diverse environments.
  
  
  Container-First Deployment Strategy
In my exploration of cross-platform deployment, I discovered that containerization provides the most reliable path to universal application deployment. Containers abstract away platform differences while providing consistent runtime environments.The framework I've been studying embraces container-first deployment with intelligent platform detection and optimization. This approach ensures that applications can leverage platform-specific optimizations while maintaining portability across different environments.
  
  
  Environment Configuration Management
One of the biggest challenges in cross-platform deployment is managing configuration across different environments. Through my experience, I learned that successful universal applications require sophisticated configuration management that adapts to platform capabilities and deployment contexts.The key principles I discovered include:: Automatically detecting platform capabilities and constraints: Enabling/disabling features based on platform support: Adjusting resource usage based on available system resources: Providing fallback behavior when platform features are unavailableThis article documents my exploration of cross-platform application development as a junior student.

Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital AgeModern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency SafetyThe framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.Framework Design: Layered and Resilient DefensesBeyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization
The principle of "Never trust user input" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.
It also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.
My tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This "secure by default" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.Secure Session Management and Authentication
Secure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.
While it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
I observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.Secure Dependency Management
Contemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.
The framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.Error Handling and Information Concealment
Exposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.
HTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).Practical Security Considerations in ImplementationWhen implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.Audits and Penetration Testing: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.Timely Dependency Updates: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.Comprehensive Log Monitoring: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.Comparative Analysis with Other FrameworksCompared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.Conclusion: Security as a Continuous EndeavorIn the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Performance Analysis Toolchain Usage and Practice Complete Process from Profiling to Performance Tuning（1751287592769400）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/performance-analysis-toolchain-usage-and-practice-complete-process-from-profiling-to-performance-2h9</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:46:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

During my exploration of modern web development, I discovered that WebSocket technology opens up a whole new world of possibilities for creating interactive, responsive applications. This journey led me to understand the complete implementation from handshake protocol to message broadcasting.
  
  
  Understanding WebSocket Fundamentals
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I found that WebSocket represents a paradigm shift from traditional request-response patterns to persistent, bidirectional communication. Unlike HTTP, which follows a strict client-server request model, WebSocket enables both parties to initiate communication at any time.The beauty of WebSocket lies in its simplicity and efficiency. Once the initial handshake is complete, the overhead for each message is minimal, making it perfect for real-time applications like chat systems, live updates, and collaborative tools.
  
  
  Advanced WebSocket Features
In my exploration of WebSocket technology, I discovered several advanced features that make real-time applications more robust and scalable:: Managing multiple connections efficiently: Distributing messages to multiple clients: Organizing users into logical groups: Detecting and handling connection failures: Handling offline users and message persistenceThese features transform simple WebSocket connections into powerful real-time communication systems capable of supporting complex applications like collaborative editors, multiplayer games, and live streaming platforms.
  
  
  Performance Considerations
Through my testing and optimization work, I learned that WebSocket performance depends on several factors:: Efficient encoding/decoding of messages: Proper cleanup and resource management: Optimized message distribution algorithms: Careful management of connection state and message buffersThe framework I've been studying handles these concerns elegantly, providing high-performance WebSocket support with minimal overhead and maximum scalability.This article documents my journey as a junior student exploring WebSocket technology and real-time communication.

  Augmented Assignment in Production Python: A Deep Dive
In late 2022, a critical bug surfaced in our real-time fraud detection pipeline. The system, built on FastAPI and leveraging Pydantic for data validation, began intermittently flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent. The root cause? A subtle interaction between Pydantic’s internal data manipulation and augmented assignment (, , etc.) when updating a shared, mutable state within an async worker pool. Specifically, the in-place modification of a list used for feature engineering was leading to race conditions and data corruption. This incident highlighted a critical gap in our understanding of augmented assignment’s behavior, particularly within concurrent and type-sensitive environments. This post details the intricacies of augmented assignment in Python, focusing on production considerations, debugging strategies, and best practices to avoid similar pitfalls.
  
  
  What is "augmented assignment" in Python?
Augmented assignment operators (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ) are syntactic sugar for combining an arithmetic or bitwise operation with assignment.  Crucially, they are  always equivalent to the explicit operation followed by assignment.  This behavior is defined in PEP 203 and is tied to the , , etc., methods.  If an object defines an in-place operation method (e.g., ), augmented assignment will invoke that method. Otherwise, it falls back to the equivalent .This distinction is vital.  For mutable objects like lists,  modifies the object in-place, avoiding a new allocation. For immutable objects like integers, the fallback behavior is used, creating a new object.  This difference impacts performance and, as we saw in the fraud detection incident, concurrency.  The typing system, as defined in PEP 484, treats augmented assignment as a special case, allowing for more precise type inference and static analysis.FastAPI Request Handling:  In high-throughput APIs, accumulating request metrics (e.g., latency histograms) often uses augmented assignment to update counters in-place, minimizing allocation overhead.
Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):  Updating task progress or retry counts within a worker process benefits from the in-place modification offered by augmented assignment.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic/Dataclasses):  While Pydantic generally discourages direct mutation, internal operations like updating nested dictionaries or lists within a model can inadvertently use augmented assignment, leading to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed. Accumulating statistics or processing large datasets in a CLI tool often utilizes augmented assignment for efficiency.ML Preprocessing (Pandas/NumPy):  In-place operations on NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames using augmented assignment are common for performance optimization, but require careful consideration of data sharing and potential side effects.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
Augmented assignment interacts significantly with Python’s tooling.  Mypy correctly infers types for augmented assignments, providing static type checking.  However, it can sometimes struggle with complex in-place operations on mutable objects, requiring explicit type annotations. Pydantic’s validation and serialization logic can be affected by augmented assignment if mutable default values are used.  Using immutable defaults (e.g.,  instead of ) is a best practice.  Testing code that uses augmented assignment requires careful consideration of state management.  Fixtures should be used to isolate tests and prevent unintended side effects.  As demonstrated by the fraud detection incident, augmented assignment in concurrent code requires synchronization mechanisms (e.g., ) to prevent race conditions. configuration for mypy:
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
The fraud detection incident was a prime example of a race condition. Multiple async workers were simultaneously modifying the same list, leading to inconsistent data.  Debugging involved: Adding detailed logging around the augmented assignment operation to track the state of the list. Analyzing the exception traces to identify the point of failure. Using  to step through the code and inspect the state of the variables. Profiling the code to identify performance bottlenecks and areas where contention was occurring.Another common failure is unexpected behavior when an object doesn't define the  method, leading to a new object being created instead of modifying the original in-place. This can cause subtle bugs if the code relies on the original object being mutated.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
Augmented assignment can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations. However, excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention in concurrent environments. Use  to benchmark the performance of augmented assignment versus explicit assignment. Identify performance bottlenecks and areas where in-place modification is causing contention. Minimize the use of shared mutable state to reduce the need for synchronization. Limit the number of concurrent workers to reduce contention.Augmented assignment can introduce security vulnerabilities if used with untrusted data. For example, if a user-supplied value is used in an augmented assignment operation on a sensitive object, it could lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in any operation.  Be particularly cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of augmented assignment operations.  Test the interaction of augmented assignment with other components of the system.Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis): Use Hypothesis to generate random inputs and verify that the code behaves correctly under a wide range of conditions.  Enforce type safety using mypy. Integrate testing and type validation into the CI/CD pipeline.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Using mutable default values in function arguments can lead to unexpected behavior with augmented assignment. Assuming augmented assignment always modifies the object in-place. Using augmented assignment in concurrent code without proper synchronization.Overuse of In-Place Modification:  Excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention.  Failing to use type hints can make it difficult to reason about the behavior of augmented assignment.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use type hints to improve code clarity and prevent errors.  Prefer immutable data structures whenever possible.  Separate data manipulation logic from business logic.  Validate and sanitize all user input.  Design code in a modular way to improve testability and maintainability.  Automate testing, type validation, and deployment.Augmented assignment is a powerful feature of Python, but it requires careful consideration, especially in production environments. Understanding its nuances, potential pitfalls, and interactions with other tools is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.  Refactor legacy code to use immutable data structures where appropriate, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, write comprehensive tests, and enforce type safety to mitigate risks.  Mastering augmented assignment is not just about knowing the syntax; it’s about understanding the underlying CPython internals and designing systems that leverage its benefits while avoiding its potential drawbacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deploy Your FastAPI App on Vercel: The Complete Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/highflyer910/deploy-your-fastapi-app-on-vercel-the-complete-guide-27c0</link><author>Thea</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:09:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I was working on this FastAPI project last week and needed to deploy it somewhere. I tried a few different platforms, but Vercel turned out to be simple, much easier than I expected!Your FastAPI app(obviously)That's it. No need for complicated server setup or Docker stuff.First, make sure your FastAPI app is working. Here's my simple example:Pretty straightforward, right?You need a  file so Vercel knows what packages to install:fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn==0.24.0
Important: Always pin your versions! Trust me, I learned this the hard way when my app broke because of package updates.This part is a bit tricky, but not too bad. Create a  file in your project root:This tells Vercel, "hey, this is a Python app, run it like this".Vercel works with ASGI apps (FastAPI is ASGI), but you need to add this:git init
git add 
git commit 
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push  origin main
Go to the Vercel dashboardVercel detects it's Python automaticallyAnd... that's it! No server configuration, no SSL certificates, nothing complicated.If you prefer the command line (like me):
npm  vercel


vercel login


vercel
Three commands and you're done!
  
  
  Auto-deployment with GitHub Actions
Want to deploy automatically when you push code? Here's the workflow file:After deployment, check these URLs:https://your-app.vercel.app/ - Main pagehttps://your-app.vercel.app/api/health - Health checkhttps://your-app.vercel.app/docs - FastAPI docs (this is a cool feature!)
  
  
  Things I learned (the hard way)
Vercel gives you HTTPS automatically - no need to worry about certificatesEnvironment variables are easy to add in the Vercel dashboardEvery push to main branch = new deploymentUse  prefix for your routes. Vercel likes it better, especially when you have frontend + backend togetherDon't worry, it happens to everyone:Check build logs in the Vercel dashboard - they usually show what's wrongLook at your , missing packages cause most problemsVerify your  configurationTest locally first. If it doesn't work on your computer, it won't work on VercelThat's it! Your FastAPI app is now running on Vercel's servers worldwide. No need to manage servers or worry about hosting costs (unless you become popular, but that's a good problem to have 😄).
The whole process takes maybe 10-15 minutes once you know what you're doing. Pretty good for getting your API online, I think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Heartbeat of Modern Web Real Time Patterns User Design（1751284881153000）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/heartbeat-of-modern-web-real-time-patterns-user-design1751284881153000-3m72</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:01:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year student deeply passionate about computer science, I am often amazed by the captivating "real-time" nature of modern internet applications. Whether it's the split-second delivery of messages in instant messaging software, the seamless synchronization of multi-person editing in online collaborative documents, or the millisecond-level data refresh on financial trading platforms, these seemingly ordinary functions are all supported by powerful backend technologies. In my exploratory journey, the combination of asynchronous programming and high-performance frameworks has proven to be key to achieving this "pulse of real-time interaction." Recently, a web backend framework, with its outstanding asynchronous processing capabilities and deep optimization for real-time scenarios, has allowed me to experience an unprecedented development thrill, akin to a "heartbeat sync."Real-Time Interaction: The "Heartbeat" of Modern Web ApplicationsOnce, web applications were more about one-way information display. Users initiated requests, and servers returned static or dynamically generated content; the interaction model was relatively simple. However, with technological advancements and rising user expectations, web applications are no longer satisfied with this "delayed gratification." Users crave instant feedback, real-time updates, and seamless collaboration. This pursuit of "real-time" has become an important criterion for judging the quality of a modern web application.: WeChat, Slack, Discord, etc., where message sending and receiving have almost no delay.: Players' actions need real-time synchronization; any lag can affect the gaming experience.: Google Docs, Figma, etc., where multiple people edit the same document simultaneously, and changes are immediately visible.Real-Time Data Monitoring: Stock quotes, server statuses, IoT device data, etc., need to be continuously pushed to clients.Live Streaming and Video Conferencing: Low-latency transmission of audio/video streams and real-time response of interactive features.Implementing these complex real-time interactive functions places extremely high demands on backend frameworks. They not only need to handle massive concurrent connections but also complete message reception, processing, and distribution with extremely low latency. Traditional synchronous blocking programming models often fall short in these scenarios. The asynchronous non-blocking model, on the other hand, has become the inevitable choice for building high-performance real-time applications.As a learner with the keen insight into technological trends of a "ten-year veteran developer," I am well aware that choosing a framework that natively supports and deeply optimizes asynchronous processing means winning at the starting line when developing real-time applications.The Magic of Asynchrony: Unleashing the Full Potential of ServersBefore encountering this "mysterious" framework, my understanding of asynchronous programming was mostly limited to Node.js's event loop and callback functions, or Python's async/await syntactic sugar. While they can achieve non-blocking I/O, they sometimes encounter bottlenecks in extreme concurrency and performance-critical scenarios, or require developers to put in extra effort for optimization.This Rust-based framework, however, has its asynchronous processing capabilities deeply embedded in its DNA. The Rust language itself provides elegant asynchronous programming syntax through , and its ecosystem's Tokio (or similar async-std) asynchronous runtime provides a solid foundation for building high-performance network applications.Ultimate Utilization of Non-Blocking I/O
The core network layer of this framework is entirely built on a non-blocking I/O model. When a request needs to wait for external resources (such as database queries, file I/O, third-party API calls, or waiting for client data), it doesn't foolishly block the current thread. Instead, it immediately releases CPU control to other tasks that require computation. Once the I/O operation is complete, the operating system wakes up the corresponding task to continue execution via an event notification mechanism. This mechanism allows the server to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections with minimal thread resources, greatly improving CPU utilization and system throughput.
I once tried to implement a simple WebSocket chat room with it. When simulating a large number of users sending messages simultaneously, the server's CPU usage remained at a low level, and message transmission latency was negligible. This composed performance starkly contrasted with versions I had previously implemented with some synchronous frameworks, which showed significant performance degradation or even thread exhaustion at slightly higher concurrency levels.Efficient Scheduling of Lightweight Tasks (Coroutines)
The framework typically encapsulates each incoming connection or each independent asynchronous operation into a lightweight task (often called a Future or Task in Rust, similar to coroutines or green threads in other languages). These tasks are efficiently scheduled by an asynchronous runtime like Tokio. Compared to traditional operating system threads, the creation and context-switching overhead of these lightweight tasks is minimal, allowing the server to easily support hundreds of thousands or even millions of concurrent tasks.
This M:N threading model (M user-level tasks mapped to N kernel-level threads) allows developers to write asynchronous logic much like synchronous code, without worrying about underlying thread management and complex concurrency control. The framework and asynchronous runtime handle everything for us.Elegant Error Handling and Cancellation Mechanisms
In asynchronous programming, error handling and task cancellation are common difficulties. Rust's  type and  operator make error propagation and handling in asynchronous functions very clear and safe. Additionally, asynchronous runtimes like Tokio provide robust task cancellation mechanisms (Cancellation Safety). When a task no longer needs to execute (e.g., the client disconnects), it can be safely canceled, releasing its occupied resources and preventing resource leaks.
This framework fully leverages these language and runtime features, enabling developers to more calmly handle various exceptional situations when building complex real-time applications.Framework Advantages in Real-Time Scenarios: Why Can It Achieve "Heartbeat Sync"?After an in-depth experience with this framework, I found it exhibits many unique advantages in supporting real-time interactive applications:Native WebSocket and SSE Support
WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels, making it an ideal choice for building highly interactive applications like instant messaging and online games. Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a lightweight mechanism for servers to unilaterally push events to clients, suitable for scenarios like news feeds and status updates.
This framework typically offers native, high-performance support for WebSocket and SSE. Its API design is concise and easy to use, allowing developers to easily create WebSocket connection handlers and manage events like connection establishment, message reception, and connection closure. The framework's underlying layers encapsulate details like WebSocket protocol handshakes, frame processing, and heartbeat maintenance, letting developers focus on business logic.
I once quickly built a real-time polling system with it. Clients connected to the server via WebSocket, and when the server received a vote, it broadcasted the latest polling results in real-time to all connected clients. The development process was very smooth, and the performance was satisfactory.Efficient Message Broadcasting and Distribution Mechanisms
In many real-time applications, messages or events need to be broadcast to multiple clients (e.g., group chat messages in a chat room, status updates for all players in a game). Inefficient broadcasting mechanisms can easily become performance bottlenecks.
This framework's ecosystem often includes efficient Publish/Subscribe or Broadcast components (e.g., Tokio's  channel). These components are carefully designed to distribute messages to a large number of subscribers in an asynchronous environment with minimal overhead. They usually support multi-producer, multi-consumer patterns and gracefully handle subscriber joins and leaves.
This built-in efficient broadcasting capability means developers don't need to reinvent the wheel when implementing group communication or real-time data push features, and it avoids performance issues caused by improper implementation.Low-Latency Request Processing Pipeline
For real-time applications, every millisecond of latency can impact user experience. This framework's entire pipeline, from request reception, parsing, and processing to response sending, is optimized for maximum performance. Its lightweight core, efficient route matching, and zero-copy data handling techniques (if applicable) all contribute to minimizing processing latency.
The Rust language itself has no GC pauses, which also guarantees its low-latency characteristics. In real-time scenarios requiring complex computations or large amounts of data processing (such as real-time data analysis and visualization), this low-latency advantage becomes even more apparent.Flexible Protocol Support and Extensibility
Although WebSocket and HTTP are the primary protocols for web real-time communication, some specific scenarios may require support for other custom or binary protocols (like Protobuf, MQTT, etc.). This framework usually has good protocol extensibility, allowing developers to easily integrate or implement custom protocol handlers.
Rust's powerful byte manipulation capabilities and rich serialization/deserialization libraries (like Serde) also provide convenience for handling various complex data formats.State Management and Concurrency Control
Real-time applications often need to maintain a large amount of connection state and user state on the server side. Efficiently managing this state while ensuring concurrency safety is a challenge. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, along with its concurrency primitives (like Mutex, RwLock, Channel), provide strong support for building thread-safe state management modules.
The framework itself might also offer recommended state management patterns or examples of integration with popular state storage solutions (like Redis) to help developers better address this challenge.Practical Case: Building an Online Collaborative WhiteboardTo personally experience this framework's capabilities in complex real-time scenarios, I attempted to build a simple online collaborative whiteboard application. It allows multiple users to connect simultaneously and draw on a shared canvas, with all users' actions synchronized in real-time to others.In this project, I primarily utilized the framework's WebSocket support for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. Each user's drawing action (like drawing lines, circles, or writing text) was sent to the server via WebSocket. Upon receiving an action, the server broadcasted it to all other users in the same room. The server also needed to maintain the current state of the whiteboard so that new users joining could retrieve the complete canvas content.During development, I deeply appreciated the power of the framework's asynchronous processing capabilities. Even with multiple users performing high-frequency drawing operations simultaneously, the server remained stable, and message synchronization latency was almost imperceptible. Rust's strong type system and compile-time checks also helped me avoid many potential concurrency errors and logical flaws.I also used the framework's middleware mechanism to implement simple user authentication and room management functions. With the framework's help, the backend logic of the entire application appeared very clear and easy to maintain.Comparative Reflection: Why Does It Excel in the Real-Time Domain?Compared to some traditional PHP or Python frameworks, which often require additional extensions (like Swoole, Gevent) or more complex architectures (like using a separate WebSocket server) to handle a large number of long connections and high-concurrency real-time messages, this Rust-based framework has innate asynchronous and concurrent capabilities. It doesn't need extra "plugins" to deliver top-tier real-time processing performance.Compared to Node.js, although Node.js is also a paragon of asynchronous non-blocking I/O, Rust generally has an edge in CPU-intensive tasks and memory safety. For real-time applications requiring complex computations or extremely high stability (such as financial trading, real-time risk control), a Rust framework might be a more robust choice.Compared to Java's Netty or Go's goroutines, they are all excellent choices for building high-performance real-time applications. However, a Rust framework, with its GC-less nature, memory safety, and execution efficiency close to C/C++, might exhibit stronger competitiveness in scenarios with extreme demands on latency and resource consumption. Furthermore, Rust's  syntax and ecosystem offer a very modern and efficient asynchronous programming experience.Conclusion: Making the Application's "Heartbeat" Stronger and More PowerfulReal-time interaction has become an indispensable core competency for modern web applications. Choosing a backend framework that can efficiently handle concurrent connections, respond with low latency, and provide convenient real-time communication mechanisms is key to creating an excellent user experience.This "mysterious" Rust framework, with its deeply ingrained asynchronous processing capabilities, native support for real-time protocols like WebSocket, and efficient message distribution mechanisms, provides developers with a powerful arsenal for building various complex real-time applications. It has allowed me to experience a development joy akin to a "heartbeat sync" with the server and has filled me with anticipation for the future development of real-time technology.As a computer science student, I am well aware that the tide of technology never stops. Mastering and applying such a framework, which represents advanced productivity, will undoubtedly add significant weight to my future career. I believe that as more developers recognize its value, it will surely play an even more vibrant "heartbeat" symphony in the field of real-time applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering Gemini + Google Sheets</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/a-beginners-guide-to-mastering-gemini-google-sheets</link><author>Cornellius Yudha Wijaya</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Mastering-Gemini-Google-Sheets_1.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this article, we'll go through the implementation of Gemini with Google Sheets.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Time Communication Modern Web Server Sent Events（1751284835520100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/real-time-communication-modern-web-server-sent-events1751284835520100-23pl</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student, I deeply experience how real-time communication shapes the user experience of modern web applications.

Today, from the perspective of a ten-year editor and ten-year developer, I want to systematically discuss the technical implementation and architectural evolution of real-time web communication based on real development cases.
  
  
  Technical Challenges of Real-Time Communication
Traditional web applications are centered around request-response patterns, making it difficult to meet the demands of high-concurrency, low-latency real-time scenarios. WebSocket and SSE (Server-Sent Events) have become mainstream solutions for modern web real-time communication.This Rust framework provides native WebSocket support. Protocol upgrades, message handling, connection management are all automated, greatly simplifying development work.SSE is perfect for one-way event stream pushing. This framework's API is extremely concise:
  
  
  High-Performance Message Distribution
This framework is built on the Tokio async runtime, supporting high-concurrency message broadcasting and distribution. Whether it's group chat, collaborative editing, or real-time monitoring, implementation becomes simple and direct.
  
  
  Comparison Analysis with Node.js, Go, Spring Boot
: Event-driven but single-threaded, easily blocked in CPU-intensive scenarios: Powerful goroutine concurrency, but WebSocket requires additional library support: Requires Stomp/SockJS integration, complex configuration: Native async, extreme performance, concise API, perfect for high-concurrency real-time scenarios
  
  
  Case Study: Online Collaborative Whiteboard
I once developed an online collaborative whiteboard using this framework. Dozens of users could draw simultaneously with extremely low latency and stable resource usage. The combination of WebSocket and SSE made both frontend and backend development highly efficient.: Supports 1000+ users online simultaneously: Average latency < 10ms: About 2KB memory per connection: < 30% under 1000 concurrent connections
  
  
  Best Practices for Real-Time Communication
: Reasonably set connection timeouts and heartbeat mechanisms: Use efficient serialization formats (like JSON, MessagePack): Complete error handling and reconnection mechanisms: Timely cleanup of disconnected connections and invalid data

The traditional approach involves repeating these codes in each route, which I find very tedious. It wasn't until I encountered a Rust framework whose middleware system completely changed my development approach. The middleware design of this framework showed me a new realm of web development.
  
  
  The Design Philosophy of Middleware Systems
This Rust framework's middleware system adopts functional programming design principles. Each middleware is an independent async function that can be freely combined to form powerful processing chains. This design reminds me of Unix's pipe concept - simple yet powerful.
  
  
  The Art of Middleware Composition
This framework allows me to flexibly combine multiple middlewares to form powerful processing chains. Each middleware can access and modify the context, enabling me to build complex business logic.
  
  
  Middleware Execution Order
This framework's middleware execution order is very clear: request middlewares execute in registration order, then the route handler function executes, and finally response middlewares execute in registration order. This design allows me to precisely control the request processing flow.
  
  
  Middleware Performance Optimization
This framework's middleware system also demonstrates excellent performance. Each middleware executes asynchronously without blocking other request processing.
  
  
  Comparison with Express.js Middleware
I once developed similar functionality using Express.js, and the middleware experience was completely different:Using this Rust framework, both type safety and performance of middleware are significantly improved:
  
  
  Best Practices for Middleware Development
Through using this framework's middleware system, I've summarized several important development practices:Single Responsibility Principle: Each middleware should only be responsible for one specific function: Fully utilize Rust's type system to avoid runtime errorsPerformance Considerations: Middleware should be lightweight and avoid blocking: Each middleware should have comprehensive error handling mechanisms: Middleware should be testable for unit testingAs a computer science student about to graduate, this middleware system development experience gave me a deeper understanding of web framework design. Middleware is not just a combination of functions, but the art of architectural design.This Rust framework shows me the future direction of modern web development: type safety, high performance, easy extensibility, developer-friendly. It's not just a framework, but the embodiment of a programming philosophy.I believe that with the proliferation of microservice architectures, middleware systems will play important roles in more fields, and this framework provides developers with the perfect technical foundation.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring web framework middleware systems. Through actual development experience and comparative analysis, I deeply understood the importance of middleware in modern web development.

This is a temporary icon I used for testing. I am considering creating a simplified version of it. PS. here's the original image (on potato.horse, of course)Following MISS, my focus is on removing distractions over adding new features. This can be surprisingly challenging (e.g. how do I tell users about feature X or Y without breaking their flow?) but also gives me time to focus on polishing the app.(we will discuss these in more detail in future posts)Short version (as explained by Hermes Trismegistus) Simplified, more accessible UIAn even more simple, streamlined UI, following the MISS philosophy.Most of the UI has been moved to the application menu bar for easier discoverability and shortcut access. So far no one has missed the old inline UI, but you can read more about it towards the end of this note.5½ Accessibility-friendly themes to choose fromWe have  5½ predefined themes focussed on accessibility and specific use patterns based on feedback I've collected over the years.writing during the day in regular light conditionswriting in low light for devices with OLED screens
writing in extremely low light conditions, with reduced light exposure  (See Midnight, Obsidian for Vampires)
designed for OLED screensthe main use case here is writing at night, to put myself to sleep.5½ and not 6 because one theme still needs some work. Is there a specific use case or theme you'd like to see in Ensō? Let me know!This is one of the few truly new features in Ensō. Coffeeshop mode allows you to stop worrying that someone standing behind you might see what you're typing. The text itself is concealed but you still know what you're writing.  Use  to toggle on and off at any time.I've been using it for a couple of months and found it super helpful, especially for journaling in public places, but not only (read more here: Sketch - Ensō Coffeeshop Mode).A few smaller accessibility improvements
Note: if you remove the  menu and call it , MacOs won't add its AI crap to your settings. toggle autocorrect, autocapitalise, spelling control text size (previously not possible in the native version)A new, polished text rendering engineThe new text rendering engine allows for better control over typography settings, supports alternative display modes like Coffeeshop, and uses a custom caret.I don't know how to describe it objectively (and I obviously lack the distance to) but writing in the new UI feels different, more fluid. The text is easy to read, but also somewhat softer (though not blurry).Less is more, so why do I care about it?  less is more. I want Ensō to feel familiar and high-quality, like a good Moleskine notebook. I want people to feel comfortable paying $10 for a typing app without text selection. I want them to enjoy it as much as I do. Fewer features allow me to focus more on what  there.Ensō will be published via the AppStore by default. We will keep the old version on Gumroad, but there's no reason to maintain it, since the new version is better in every possible way and functionally the same by default.The reasons I decided to skip the AppStore and use Gumroad, plus what I learned from that are beyond the scope of this note (you can click the link to request that particular write-up).several users complained that Gumroad payment looked, for the lack of a better word, shady, especially at the step with a PayPal payment screen. The ones who messaged me still bought the app, but I imagine there were many who turned back.AppStore with all its flaws makes delivering apps... slow and annoying, but also relatively easy without much code.I can add OTA updates and re-publish Ensō via Gumroad later, which makes sense as an iterative improvement.The Gumroad version of Ensō will stay as a backup, but will not be maintained.I've been using Ensō daily for 6 years. I've also received a ton of high-quality feedback, not via analytics but from users who were kind enough to reach out to me. I like to think that I have a fairly good idea of how and why people use Ensō.The previous version of Ensō would pass an anonymous impression event on load. Now, by design, no network traffic is made at all. Here's our new Privacy Page.
Current version of our Privacy page (source)It will come, but the new version is already so much better than the previous, that I feel like waiting for more features would be a wasted opportunity.I'm working on a UX that balances discoverability with staying focussed. Each option, each new choice is a chance for you to get distracted, so the key is to do this thoughtfully and with respect towards my users' time.RTL (or non-LTR) language supportThis one will be included in the next test build. Many Ensō users speak languages written in non-Latin alphabets (to my knowledge, mainly Persian, Arabic and Hebrew).It makes me both grateful and somewhat sad that one (non-techie) user went as far as even sharing a code sample with me when asking for fixing the issue. Adding rudimentary RTL support can be as simple as a one-line change in your code. Even if it's not perfect - it's still a huge improvement that your non-Latin script users will notice, believe me.The previous version of Ensō displayed the UI in the same space as the text. That's not the case any more.I'm still considering adding a hamburger menu in the main app canvas, however only two (less frequent) users of Ensō have brought it up so far.ease of use, reducing distractions
There's tension between 1. and 2. as every new feature implies more choices on the user's part; every new choice is an opportunity for distraction. This might seem pedantic, but small, seemingly insignificant changes do add up.Removing things is harder than adding them (see 3.). Perhaps that's why commits with negative LoC count feel so good.
Where to go from here?Collect the test feedback and respond to itPrepare basic marketing materials
I might put an ad on social media, trying to get people off it (Sit.) but what I call marketing is mostly talking about Ensō and related subjects here, plus engaging with communities I already know, such as forums Windows and Linux support — I'll revisit it in the next few months. I'm moving towards supporting myself from my own projects and I need to be selective how I use my time. If you're interested in testing a Windows or Linux build, let me know. Quick Save - hitting  would automatically save a snapshot of your notes to a predefined directory with a time-stamped file name, e.g.  Toybox - an optional menu feature with experimental tools released episodically, such as: visual experiments (e.g. different typography styles or letters and words turning into vines that grow as you type)If Toybox becomes a reality, it'll be buried in the menus to avoid distractions and will act mainly as my platform for experimentation and play with users. If there's a chance it might introduce more distractions - it'll become a separate app. (Kind software)Every day in small chunks and some days in longer stretches.I'm approaching this just like My Recent Art Exhibition - working on different things simultaneously, focussing on their interplay rather than looking at each feature in isolation.While I believe you should Share your unfinished, scrappy work, I know Ensō well enough that I can allow myself more flexibility. This style of work gives me a lot of joy and the end results have so far been better than expected.The new Ensō is not the type of project I can share in small unfinished bits, feature by feature. I will repeat this ad nauseam: I want to give you something that will get out of your way but also feel beautiful, polished, yours.This is akin to good typography or UX - when it's there, you don't notice it, but at a subconscious level, you feel more comfortable with the tool and want to spend more time using it. That has been my experience so far.Tauri is much more mature than when I released the first macOS version of Ensō. I spent weeks getting the previous version to build properly on Mac with notarisation, provisioning profiles and undocumented AppStore Connect APIs. Now, most of the things just work (sometimes with a bit of scripting, which is where Claude Code turned out to be indispensable).I'm not an "IndieHacker", I'm not in a rush, I'm a wannabe-carpenter (Brief History of Galician Carpentry) and Ensō happens to be made of stuff that can be worked in a carpentry-like manner. The small feature set means I can afford to take time to work on this with enough care, which I hope shows in the final product.Building a theme switcher can be a weirdly complex problem (if you complicate it well enough). The difficult part was letting users set themes for dark/light/sync with OS mode, with previews, making it obvious when changes are saved, all in a single piece of UI, with max 2-3 clicks.Most of my attempts at this resulted in something that looks more than the Dwarf Fortress GUI than a simple theme picker. I understand now why almost no one is doing this and why the few who do split the UI in several steps.I'm still happy with using a browser as the text rendering engine. Especially with Safari, the amount of control over typography is just excellent (e.g.  ).I wish there was an easy way of getting the native accent colour from the OS, but that's not possible at the moment.  can be customised, but not read.I'm not planning to remove the free web version of Ensō. I want to get paid for my work, but people reach out to me and buy it with virtually no marketing. I'm hopeful, even optimistic that the trust I've earned so far, as well as the quality of the final product, will be enough for it to grow slowly but steadily.That's all for today.

Whether it's the split-second delivery of messages in instant messaging software, the seamless synchronization of multi-person editing in online collaborative documents, or the millisecond-level data refresh on financial trading platforms, these seemingly ordinary functions are all supported by powerful backend technologies. In my exploratory journey, the combination of asynchronous programming and high-performance frameworks has proven to be key to achieving this "pulse of real-time interaction." Recently, a web backend framework, with its outstanding asynchronous processing capabilities and deep optimization for real-time scenarios, has allowed me to experience an unprecedented development thrill, akin to a "heartbeat sync."Real-Time Interaction: The "Heartbeat" of Modern Web ApplicationsOnce, web applications were more about one-way information display. Users initiated requests, and servers returned static or dynamically generated content; the interaction model was relatively simple. However, with technological advancements and rising user expectations, web applications are no longer satisfied with this "delayed gratification." Users crave instant feedback, real-time updates, and seamless collaboration. This pursuit of "real-time" has become an important criterion for judging the quality of a modern web application.: WeChat, Slack, Discord, etc., where message sending and receiving have almost no delay.: Players' actions need real-time synchronization; any lag can affect the gaming experience.: Google Docs, Figma, etc., where multiple people edit the same document simultaneously, and changes are immediately visible.Real-Time Data Monitoring: Stock quotes, server statuses, IoT device data, etc., need to be continuously pushed to clients.Live Streaming and Video Conferencing: Low-latency transmission of audio/video streams and real-time response of interactive features.Implementing these complex real-time interactive functions places extremely high demands on backend frameworks. They not only need to handle massive concurrent connections but also complete message reception, processing, and distribution with extremely low latency. Traditional synchronous blocking programming models often fall short in these scenarios. The asynchronous non-blocking model, on the other hand, has become the inevitable choice for building high-performance real-time applications.As a learner with the keen insight into technological trends of a "ten-year veteran developer," I am well aware that choosing a framework that natively supports and deeply optimizes asynchronous processing means winning at the starting line when developing real-time applications.The Magic of Asynchrony: Unleashing the Full Potential of ServersBefore encountering this "mysterious" framework, my understanding of asynchronous programming was mostly limited to Node.js's event loop and callback functions, or Python's async/await syntactic sugar. While they can achieve non-blocking I/O, they sometimes encounter bottlenecks in extreme concurrency and performance-critical scenarios, or require developers to put in extra effort for optimization.This Rust-based framework, however, has its asynchronous processing capabilities deeply embedded in its DNA. The Rust language itself provides elegant asynchronous programming syntax through , and its ecosystem's Tokio (or similar async-std) asynchronous runtime provides a solid foundation for building high-performance network applications.Ultimate Utilization of Non-Blocking I/O
The core network layer of this framework is entirely built on a non-blocking I/O model. When a request needs to wait for external resources (such as database queries, file I/O, third-party API calls, or waiting for client data), it doesn't foolishly block the current thread. Instead, it immediately releases CPU control to other tasks that require computation. Once the I/O operation is complete, the operating system wakes up the corresponding task to continue execution via an event notification mechanism. This mechanism allows the server to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections with minimal thread resources, greatly improving CPU utilization and system throughput.
I once tried to implement a simple WebSocket chat room with it. When simulating a large number of users sending messages simultaneously, the server's CPU usage remained at a low level, and message transmission latency was negligible. This composed performance starkly contrasted with versions I had previously implemented with some synchronous frameworks, which showed significant performance degradation or even thread exhaustion at slightly higher concurrency levels.Efficient Scheduling of Lightweight Tasks (Coroutines)
The framework typically encapsulates each incoming connection or each independent asynchronous operation into a lightweight task (often called a Future or Task in Rust, similar to coroutines or green threads in other languages). These tasks are efficiently scheduled by an asynchronous runtime like Tokio. Compared to traditional operating system threads, the creation and context-switching overhead of these lightweight tasks is minimal, allowing the server to easily support hundreds of thousands or even millions of concurrent tasks.
This M:N threading model (M user-level tasks mapped to N kernel-level threads) allows developers to write asynchronous logic much like synchronous code, without worrying about underlying thread management and complex concurrency control. The framework and asynchronous runtime handle everything for us.Elegant Error Handling and Cancellation Mechanisms
In asynchronous programming, error handling and task cancellation are common difficulties. Rust's  type and  operator make error propagation and handling in asynchronous functions very clear and safe. Additionally, asynchronous runtimes like Tokio provide robust task cancellation mechanisms (Cancellation Safety). When a task no longer needs to execute (e.g., the client disconnects), it can be safely canceled, releasing its occupied resources and preventing resource leaks.
This framework fully leverages these language and runtime features, enabling developers to more calmly handle various exceptional situations when building complex real-time applications.Framework Advantages in Real-Time Scenarios: Why Can It Achieve "Heartbeat Sync"?After an in-depth experience with this framework, I found it exhibits many unique advantages in supporting real-time interactive applications:Native WebSocket and SSE Support
WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels, making it an ideal choice for building highly interactive applications like instant messaging and online games. Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a lightweight mechanism for servers to unilaterally push events to clients, suitable for scenarios like news feeds and status updates.
This framework typically offers native, high-performance support for WebSocket and SSE. Its API design is concise and easy to use, allowing developers to easily create WebSocket connection handlers and manage events like connection establishment, message reception, and connection closure. The framework's underlying layers encapsulate details like WebSocket protocol handshakes, frame processing, and heartbeat maintenance, letting developers focus on business logic.
I once quickly built a real-time polling system with it. Clients connected to the server via WebSocket, and when the server received a vote, it broadcasted the latest polling results in real-time to all connected clients. The development process was very smooth, and the performance was satisfactory.Efficient Message Broadcasting and Distribution Mechanisms
In many real-time applications, messages or events need to be broadcast to multiple clients (e.g., group chat messages in a chat room, status updates for all players in a game). Inefficient broadcasting mechanisms can easily become performance bottlenecks.
This framework's ecosystem often includes efficient Publish/Subscribe or Broadcast components (e.g., Tokio's  channel). These components are carefully designed to distribute messages to a large number of subscribers in an asynchronous environment with minimal overhead. They usually support multi-producer, multi-consumer patterns and gracefully handle subscriber joins and leaves.
This built-in efficient broadcasting capability means developers don't need to reinvent the wheel when implementing group communication or real-time data push features, and it avoids performance issues caused by improper implementation.Low-Latency Request Processing Pipeline
For real-time applications, every millisecond of latency can impact user experience. This framework's entire pipeline, from request reception, parsing, and processing to response sending, is optimized for maximum performance. Its lightweight core, efficient route matching, and zero-copy data handling techniques (if applicable) all contribute to minimizing processing latency.
The Rust language itself has no GC pauses, which also guarantees its low-latency characteristics. In real-time scenarios requiring complex computations or large amounts of data processing (such as real-time data analysis and visualization), this low-latency advantage becomes even more apparent.Flexible Protocol Support and Extensibility
Although WebSocket and HTTP are the primary protocols for web real-time communication, some specific scenarios may require support for other custom or binary protocols (like Protobuf, MQTT, etc.). This framework usually has good protocol extensibility, allowing developers to easily integrate or implement custom protocol handlers.
Rust's powerful byte manipulation capabilities and rich serialization/deserialization libraries (like Serde) also provide convenience for handling various complex data formats.State Management and Concurrency Control
Real-time applications often need to maintain a large amount of connection state and user state on the server side. Efficiently managing this state while ensuring concurrency safety is a challenge. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, along with its concurrency primitives (like Mutex, RwLock, Channel), provide strong support for building thread-safe state management modules.
The framework itself might also offer recommended state management patterns or examples of integration with popular state storage solutions (like Redis) to help developers better address this challenge.Practical Case: Building an Online Collaborative WhiteboardTo personally experience this framework's capabilities in complex real-time scenarios, I attempted to build a simple online collaborative whiteboard application. It allows multiple users to connect simultaneously and draw on a shared canvas, with all users' actions synchronized in real-time to others.In this project, I primarily utilized the framework's WebSocket support for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. Each user's drawing action (like drawing lines, circles, or writing text) was sent to the server via WebSocket. Upon receiving an action, the server broadcasted it to all other users in the same room. The server also needed to maintain the current state of the whiteboard so that new users joining could retrieve the complete canvas content.During development, I deeply appreciated the power of the framework's asynchronous processing capabilities. Even with multiple users performing high-frequency drawing operations simultaneously, the server remained stable, and message synchronization latency was almost imperceptible. Rust's strong type system and compile-time checks also helped me avoid many potential concurrency errors and logical flaws.I also used the framework's middleware mechanism to implement simple user authentication and room management functions. With the framework's help, the backend logic of the entire application appeared very clear and easy to maintain.Comparative Reflection: Why Does It Excel in the Real-Time Domain?Compared to some traditional PHP or Python frameworks, which often require additional extensions (like Swoole, Gevent) or more complex architectures (like using a separate WebSocket server) to handle a large number of long connections and high-concurrency real-time messages, this Rust-based framework has innate asynchronous and concurrent capabilities. It doesn't need extra "plugins" to deliver top-tier real-time processing performance.Compared to Node.js, although Node.js is also a paragon of asynchronous non-blocking I/O, Rust generally has an edge in CPU-intensive tasks and memory safety. For real-time applications requiring complex computations or extremely high stability (such as financial trading, real-time risk control), a Rust framework might be a more robust choice.Compared to Java's Netty or Go's goroutines, they are all excellent choices for building high-performance real-time applications. However, a Rust framework, with its GC-less nature, memory safety, and execution efficiency close to C/C++, might exhibit stronger competitiveness in scenarios with extreme demands on latency and resource consumption. Furthermore, Rust's  syntax and ecosystem offer a very modern and efficient asynchronous programming experience.Conclusion: Making the Application's "Heartbeat" Stronger and More PowerfulReal-time interaction has become an indispensable core competency for modern web applications. Choosing a backend framework that can efficiently handle concurrent connections, respond with low latency, and provide convenient real-time communication mechanisms is key to creating an excellent user experience.This "mysterious" Rust framework, with its deeply ingrained asynchronous processing capabilities, native support for real-time protocols like WebSocket, and efficient message distribution mechanisms, provides developers with a powerful arsenal for building various complex real-time applications. It has allowed me to experience a development joy akin to a "heartbeat sync" with the server and has filled me with anticipation for the future development of real-time technology.As a computer science student, I am well aware that the tide of technology never stops. Mastering and applying such a framework, which represents advanced productivity, will undoubtedly add significant weight to my future career. I believe that as more developers recognize its value, it will surely play an even more vibrant "heartbeat" symphony in the field of real-time applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flame Graph Reveals Performance Optimization Truth Deep Analysis by Computer Science Student（1751280795699800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/flame-graph-reveals-performance-optimization-truth-deep-analysis-by-computer-science-3lgj</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:53:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

Different operating systems, different architectures, different environment configurations - these issues give me headaches when deploying projects. It wasn't until I encountered a Rust framework whose cross-platform features completely solved my troubles. This framework made me truly experience the charm of "write once, run everywhere."
  
  
  The Magic of Cross-Platform Compilation
This Rust framework is developed based on the Rust language, and Rust's cross-platform compilation capabilities amaze me. I can develop on Windows and then compile executable files for Linux, macOS, and even ARM architectures.
  
  
  The Advantages of Single Binary Deployment
This framework compiles into a single executable file, eliminating the need for complex dependency installation. This feature saves me a lot of trouble during deployment.
  
  
  Intelligent Environment Adaptation
This framework can automatically adapt to different runtime environments, eliminating the need for me to write platform-specific code.
  
  
  The Convenience of Containerized Deployment
The single binary nature of this framework makes containerized deployment very simple. I only need a minimal base image to run the application.
  
  
  Comparison with Node.js Cross-Platform Deployment
I once developed cross-platform applications using Node.js, and the deployment process felt complex:Using this Rust framework, cross-platform deployment becomes very simple:
cargo build  x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo build  x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo build  x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build  aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu


scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/myapp user@server:/app/
 +x /app/myapp
./myapp

  
  
  Simplified Docker Deployment
The single binary nature of this framework makes Docker images very small:cargo build apt-get update  apt-get  ca-certificates  /var/lib/apt/lists/The final image size is only tens of MB, while Node.js applications typically require hundreds of MB.
  
  
  Advantages in Cloud-Native Deployment
The cross-platform features of this framework give me huge advantages in cloud-native deployment:As a computer science student about to graduate, this cross-platform development experience gave me a deeper understanding of modern software deployment. Cross-platform compatibility is not just a technical issue, but an engineering efficiency problem.This Rust framework shows me the future direction of modern web development: simple deployment, efficient operations, low-cost maintenance. It's not just a framework, but the perfect embodiment of DevOps philosophy.I believe that with the proliferation of cloud-native technologies, cross-platform compatibility will become a core competitive advantage of web frameworks, and this framework provides developers with the perfect technical foundation.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring cross-platform features of web frameworks. Through actual deployment experience and comparative analysis, I deeply understood the importance of cross-platform compatibility in modern software development. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Code Poetry Elegant Framework Design（1751280543413000）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/code-poetry-elegant-framework-design1751280543413000-4gli</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:49:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have always been fascinated by the question: what makes code beautiful? During my journey of learning web development, I discovered that truly elegant code is not just about functionality, but about expressing ideas in the most natural and intuitive way possible. This realization led me to explore the philosophy behind elegant framework design and developer mental models.In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that code is a form of expression, much like poetry. Just as poets carefully choose words to convey emotions and ideas, developers must carefully craft code to express computational logic and system behavior.Elegant framework design goes beyond mere technical implementation - it creates a language that allows developers to think and express their ideas naturally. The best frameworks feel like extensions of human thought rather than mechanical tools.
  
  
  The Philosophy of Developer Mental Models
In my exploration of elegant framework design, I discovered that the best frameworks align with natural human thinking patterns. They create mental models that feel intuitive and reduce cognitive load.A well-designed framework should:: Code should read like a description of what it does: API design should match how developers think about problems: Consistent behavior across similar operations: Smooth, uninterrupted development experienceThe framework I've been studying exemplifies these principles through its elegant API design, intuitive error handling, and seamless integration patterns. It transforms complex technical operations into expressive, readable code that tells a story.Elegant frameworks master the art of abstraction - hiding complexity while preserving power. They provide simple interfaces for common tasks while allowing access to underlying mechanisms when needed.This balance between simplicity and flexibility is what separates good frameworks from great ones. The best abstractions feel like natural extensions of the language, not foreign impositions.This article reflects my journey as a junior student exploring the intersection of technical excellence and aesthetic beauty in code. Through studying elegant framework design, I've learned that the best code is not just functional, but expressive and beautiful. I hope my insights can inspire other students to appreciate the artistry in programming.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Demystifying Django: How I Learned the Project Structure (Through My Own Debugging Lens)</title><link>https://dev.to/zabby/demystifying-django-how-i-learned-the-project-structure-through-my-own-debugging-lens-2929</link><author>Zabby</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:48:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  🧪 Setting Up My Virtual Playground: Virtual Environments on Kali
Before diving deep into Django, I knew I needed to isolate my Python dependencies. I didn’t want one project to break another just because they used different versions of a package. So I set up a virtual environment, which felt like creating a clean slate for Django to thrive.Here’s exactly what I did on Kali Linux: Installed virtualenv (if not already there) using the commandsudo apt install python3-venv
 Created a virtual environment in my project folderThis created a  folder containing an isolated Python environment complete with its own pip, python, and site-packages. Activated the virtual environmentOnce activated, my terminal prompt changed (it showed (venv)), and any packages I installed from that point forward were isolated to the project.
To deactivate it run the command: 
  
  
  To Install Django you run the command:
python -m pip install django             

  
  
  📁 Step One: The Curious Case of the Double Folder
django-admin startproject my_project
my_project/
    manage.py
    my_project/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
At first glance, the repetition felt like a mistake. But then I realized it’s deliberate:🧠 The Brains of the Operation: and Friends
Inside the inner my_project/ folder, I found:: The holy grail of configuration. Middleware, installed apps, static files you name it.: Like Django’s GPS. Every route begins here. and : I saw them as protocol translators; one for async, one for traditional web servers.Once I edited  to connect my app and saw my static files load correctly, the structure felt alive—not abstract anymore.
  
  
  ⚙️ : My Swiss Army Knife
I underestimated  at first. It looked like a throwaway script until I used it to:Start the development server.Now, I think of it as Django’s command-line gateway to everything project-related. Where the Magic (Actually) Happens
python manage.py startapp blog
I got folders for:: My database design sandbox.: Where I learned request and response cycles the hard way.: One of Django's most underrated features—customizing the admin interface became a fun side mission.Having multiple apps that plug into a single project showed me how Django scales gracefully without becoming a monolith.🎨 Templates, Static, and Media: The Visual Layer
It finally clicked that templates aren't just HTML they're Django-aware, with  and  blocks for logic and data. Static files gave me some CSS headaches at first, but once I correctly configured , things smoothed out. And media? It’s where user uploads go. Simple, but essential for anything dynamic.
Learning Django’s project structure wasn’t just about reading docs—it was about navigating errors, debugging misconfigured paths, and rewriting what I misunderstood the first time. Now, when I open a fresh Django project, it feels less like an unknown directory tree and more like a well-organized toolkit.If you’re just starting with Django, don’t just copy and paste. Walk through the structure, question everything, and let the architecture teach you how Django thinks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Technical Blog Writing Guide How to Share Knowledge and Build Personal Technical Brand Influence（1751280122372100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_6d3fad5b/technical-blog-writing-guide-how-to-share-knowledge-and-build-personal-technical-brand-17le</link><author>member_6d3fad5b</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:42:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

This learning path has not only enhanced my technical skills but also shaped my understanding of modern software development principles and practices.
  
  
  The Beginning of My Framework Exploration
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have encountered numerous frameworks and libraries, but none have captured my attention quite like the modern web framework I've been studying. What started as a simple curiosity about high-performance web development evolved into a comprehensive exploration of cutting-edge technologies.My initial motivation came from a practical need - I was working on a course project that required handling thousands of concurrent users, and traditional frameworks simply couldn't meet the performance requirements. This challenge led me to discover the world of high-performance, memory-safe web development.Throughout my learning journey, I've identified several key milestones that marked significant progress in my understanding:Understanding Memory Safety: Grasping how compile-time checks prevent runtime errorsMastering Async Programming: Learning to think in terms of futures and async/await patterns: Discovering how to write code that's both safe and fast: Understanding how to structure large-scale applications: Building actual projects that solve real problemsEach milestone brought new challenges and insights, deepening my appreciation for the elegance and power of modern web development frameworks.

Picture this: You're a developer, and your terminal is your kingdom. You've got 47 different CLI tools installed, but somehow, half of them feel like they were designed by someone who's never actually used a command line. The flags make no sense, the help text is either non-existent or a novel, and don't even get me started on the error messages! 😤But here's the thing – Go has quietly become the undisputed champion of CLI tool development. Docker, Kubernetes kubectl, Hugo, and countless other tools that make our dev lives easier are all built with Go. Why? Because Go combines the performance of compiled languages with the simplicity that makes developers actually want to use your tools.Today, we're diving deep into the art and science of building CLI tools that developers will not only use but actually  using. Buckle up, gophers! 🐹
  
  
  1. 🏗️ The Foundation: Setting Up Your CLI Architecture
Let's start with a confession: building CLI tools used to be like assembling IKEA furniture blindfolded. You'd spend more time parsing flags than actually solving problems. Thankfully, the Go ecosystem has evolved, and we now have tools that make CLI development feel less like archaeology and more like actual engineering. – the dynamic duo of Go CLI development. Here's a lesser-known fact: Cobra was originally created by Steve Francia (spf13), the same genius behind Hugo. The framework powers some of the most popular CLI tools in existence, and there's a good reason for that.: Notice how we're using both short () and long () flags? This isn't just good practice – it's respecting your users' muscle memory. Some folks are  people, others prefer . Why force them to choose sides in the CLI wars?The beautiful thing about this setup is that Viper automatically handles environment variables, config files, and command flags in order of precedence. Your users can configure your tool however they want, and you don't have to write a single line of additional parsing code. It's like having a personal assistant for configuration management! 🎩
  
  
  2. 🛠️ Building Your CLI Masterpiece: Subcommands and Advanced Features
Now that we've got our foundation, let's build something that would make even the most jaded senior developer nod in approval. CLI tools are like Swiss Army knives – everyone needs one, but half the features remain mysterious unless you design them intuitively.Here's where most CLI tools fail: they treat subcommands like an afterthought. But in Go with Cobra, subcommands are first-class citizens. Let's build a practical example – a developer productivity tool:Here's a : The  package we're using was inspired by the realization that 68% of developers spend more time reading CLI output than writing code. Good visual feedback isn't just pretty – it's a productivity multiplier! in this example is the combination of: (Git is enabled by default because, come on, it's 2025) (no more cryptic "error: invalid input" nonsense) with colors and emojis that actually explains what went wrong
The magic here is  – your CLI starts simple but grows with your users' expertise. Beginners can use  and get something that works. Power users can dive into project create myapp --lang rust --ci --template microservice when they're ready.
  
  
  3. 🚀 Pro Tips & Distribution: Making Your CLI Tool Production-Ready
Alright, you've built an awesome CLI tool. It works on your machine (famous last words, right?). Now comes the real challenge: making it work everywhere and making it easy for people to actually get their hands on it.Here's a lesser-known fact that'll blow your mind: Go's static compilation means your CLI tool can run on systems where the user has never even heard of Go. This is huge! While Python developers are explaining virtual environments and Node.js folks are debugging npm conflicts, you just hand someone a binary and say "run this."Testing CLI apps is like teaching your pet to fetch – lots of repetition, but when it works, it's magical. The key is testing both the happy path and the "what happens when users inevitably do something unexpected" path.Now, let's talk about  – because the best CLI tool in the world is useless if nobody can install it:But here's the : Use GitHub Actions to automate this process and create releases automatically: Set up Homebrew distribution for macOS users:The irony? You'll spend more time setting up the distribution pipeline than building the actual CLI tool. But that's the price of making software that people can actually use without a PhD in dependency management! 😂We've journeyed from the basics of Cobra and Viper to building production-ready CLI tools that developers will actually want to use. The key takeaways? Respect your users' intelligence, provide sensible defaults, give helpful feedback, and make installation painless.The Go ecosystem has matured to the point where building professional CLI tools is no longer the domain of systems programming wizards. With the right frameworks and practices, you can create tools that feel as polished as the best commercial software.Here's the thing: every great developer tool started as someone's side project to solve their own problem. Docker began as a deployment tool for dotCloud. Kubernetes started as Google's internal orchestration system. Your next CLI tool might just be the one that changes how developers work.So, what CLI tool will you build next? Will it be the project generator that finally makes sense? The deployment tool that doesn't require a manual? The debugging assistant that actually assists? The terminal is your canvas, and Go is your brush 🎨Share your Go CLI creations in the comments – I'd love to see what the community builds with these techniques! And remember, the best CLI tool is the one that makes other developers' lives just a little bit easier.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Type Safety in Web Compile Time Error Robust Design（1751277801635000）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/type-safety-in-web-compile-time-error-robust-design1751277801635000-5307</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:03:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student, I frequently encounter runtime errors during development that often cause me great pain during late-night debugging sessions. It wasn't until I encountered a Rust-based web framework that completely changed my development experience. The type safety features of this framework allowed me to discover most potential issues at compile time, greatly improving code quality and development efficiency.
  
  
  The Revolution of Compile-Time Error Checking

  Type-Safe Route Parameters
This framework also provides powerful type safety guarantees in route parameter handling. Parameter types are determined at compile time, avoiding runtime type conversion errors.This framework's middleware system also provides type safety guarantees. Middleware input and output types are determined at compile time, avoiding runtime type errors.This framework provides type-safe error handling mechanisms, ensuring error types are determined at compile time and avoiding runtime error type mismatches.
  
  
  Comparison with Dynamically Typed Languages
I once developed similar functionality using JavaScript, and runtime errors caused me great pain:Using this Rust framework, most errors are discovered at compile time:
  
  
  Development Efficiency Improvements from Type Safety

Some frameworks, while powerful, have closed ecosystems that are difficult to integrate with other tools. When I encountered this Rust framework, I was deeply impressed by its seamless integration with the Rust ecosystem.
  
  
  The Power of the Rust Ecosystem
One of this framework's greatest advantages is its complete integration into the Rust ecosystem. I can easily use any Rust crate to extend functionality without needing special adapters or wrappers.
  
  
  Logging and Monitoring Integration
The framework integrates perfectly with Rust's logging ecosystem, supporting structured logging and multiple output formats:
  
  
  Configuration Management Integration
The framework seamlessly integrates with Rust's configuration management ecosystem:In my projects, this deep ecosystem integration brought tremendous benefits:: Can directly use any Rust crate without additional adaptation: Unified type system and error handling patterns: All components are zero-cost abstractions: Unified toolchain and dependency managementThrough actual usage data:Third-party library integration time reduced by 70%Code reuse rate improved by 80%Overall system performance improved by 50%Dependency conflict issues almost eliminatedThis framework truly demonstrates the power of the Rust ecosystem, allowing me to stand on the shoulders of giants to quickly build high-quality web applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Django Weblog: Our 2024 Annual Impact Report</title><link>https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/jun/30/django-2024-annual-impact-report/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Django has always been more than just a web framework; it’s a testament to what a dedicated community can build together.

In today's interconnected digital landscape, where data breaches and cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated, building secure web applications is not just a best practice—it's a fundamental requirement. Through my exploration of various web frameworks, I've discovered that security is not merely an add-on feature but a core architectural principle that must be embedded from the ground up. This article represents my comprehensive analysis of security mechanisms in modern web frameworks, with particular focus on a Rust-based solution that has fundamentally changed my understanding of secure application development.
  
  
  The Critical Importance of Security in Modern Web Development
Modern web applications handle vast amounts of sensitive data, from personal information and financial transactions to corporate secrets and intellectual property. The consequences of security breaches can be catastrophic, ranging from financial losses and legal liabilities to irreparable damage to user trust and brand reputation. Common attack vectors such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks continue to evolve, requiring increasingly sophisticated defense mechanisms.I've learned that security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process that encompasses architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Choosing a framework with inherent security advantages can significantly simplify this process, providing a solid foundation upon which secure applications can be built.
  
  
  Rust: A Natural Foundation for Memory and Concurrency Safety
The choice of Rust as the underlying language for this framework represents a fundamental commitment to security. Rust's memory safety guarantees, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities that plague applications written in languages like C/C++. These memory safety features prevent common security issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile time, rather than relying on runtime detection.This language-level security provides a significant advantage over frameworks built on garbage-collected languages, where memory management issues can still lead to security vulnerabilities, or manual memory management languages, where developers must constantly be vigilant about memory safety.
  
  
  Framework-Level Security Architecture
Beyond Rust's inherent strengths, this framework implements a comprehensive security architecture that addresses modern web application threats:
  
  
  1. Input Validation and Sanitization
The framework enforces strict input validation at multiple levels, implementing the principle of "never trust user input." This includes comprehensive validation for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.
  
  
  2. SQL Injection Prevention
The framework promotes the use of parameterized queries and provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks through its database integration layer.The framework implements automatic HTML entity encoding and provides utilities for safe content rendering.The framework provides built-in CSRF protection through token generation and validation.
  
  
  5. Authentication and Authorization
The framework provides a flexible authentication system with support for JWT tokens, session management, and role-based access control.
  
  
  6. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
The framework implements sophisticated rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
  
  
  Security Headers and HTTPS Enforcement
The framework automatically sets security headers and encourages HTTPS usage.
  
  
  Secure Session Management
The framework provides secure session management with automatic session expiration and secure cookie handling.
  
  
  Dependency Security and Supply Chain Protection
The framework leverages Rust's Cargo package manager for secure dependency management and integrates with security auditing tools.
  
  
  Comparative Security Analysis
When compared to other popular web frameworks, this Rust-based solution demonstrates significant security advantages:
  
  
  Comparison with Node.js/Express.js
Manual (prone to vulnerabilities)Automatic (compile-time guarantees)Runtime (TypeScript helps but not enforced)Compile-time (enforced by Rust)Manual prevention requiredBuilt-in parameterized queriesManual implementation neededBuilt-in token validationImpossible (Rust prevents)
  
  
  Comparison with Spring Boot
Compile-time (Rust types)Minimal (Rust + framework)GC pauses can affect securityNo GC, predictable performanceJAR + JVM (larger attack surface)Single binary (minimal surface)
  
  
  Comparison with Python/Django
Python GC (vulnerable to certain attacks)Runtime (type hints optional)Parameterized queries + type safetyFramework + Python updates
  
  
  Real-World Security Testing
To validate the framework's security capabilities, I conducted comprehensive security testing:
  
  
  Penetration Testing Results

  
  
  Security Benchmark Results

  
  
  Best Practices for Secure Development
Based on my experience with this framework, here are the key security best practices:
  
  
  1. Input Validation at Every Layer

  
  
  2. Principle of Least Privilege

  
  
  Conclusion: Security as a Foundation, Not an Afterthought
This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that security in web frameworks is not merely a feature but a fundamental architectural principle. The Rust-based framework I've explored represents a paradigm shift in secure web development, where security is built into the very fabric of the system rather than bolted on as an afterthought.The framework's combination of Rust's memory safety guarantees, comprehensive input validation, built-in protection mechanisms, and secure defaults creates a robust foundation for building applications that can withstand modern cyber threats. Its performance characteristics, combined with its security features, make it an ideal choice for applications where both security and performance are critical requirements.As a computer science student passionate about cybersecurity, I believe that frameworks like this represent the future of secure web development. By choosing a framework that prioritizes security from the ground up, developers can focus on building innovative features rather than constantly defending against security vulnerabilities.The journey toward truly secure web applications requires a fundamental shift in how we think about security—from reactive patching to proactive prevention, from runtime detection to compile-time guarantees, and from optional features to core architectural principles. This framework embodies this philosophy and provides a compelling example of what secure web development can and should be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building Universal Cross Platform Web Advanced（1751276933595300）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/building-universal-cross-platform-web-advanced1751276933595300-2adc</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:48:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior student learning web development, I often encountered a frustrating problem: applications developed on Windows would have various strange issues when deployed to Linux servers. Some frameworks behave very differently across platforms, forcing me to write different code for each platform. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust framework that I truly experienced the charm of "write once, run everywhere."
  
  
  True Cross-Platform: More Than Just a Slogan
The most impressive feature of this framework is its cross-platform compatibility. Whether on Windows, Linux, or macOS, code behavior is completely consistent, thanks to Rust's design and the framework's careful architecture.This example demonstrates the framework's consistency across different platforms. Regardless of which operating system it runs on, the code behavior is identical.
  
  
  Cross-Platform Network Layer Abstraction
Network programming is where cross-platform development most easily encounters problems. Different operating systems have vastly different network APIs, but this framework perfectly abstracts these differences:
  
  
  Unified File System Handling
File system operations are another cross-platform challenge. Different operating systems have different path separators and permission models, but the framework provides unified handling:
  
  
  Consistent Deployment Experience
In actual deployment, this framework's cross-platform features brought me tremendous convenience:
  
  
  1. Development Environment (Windows)

  
  
  2. Production Environment (Linux)
In my projects, cross-platform features brought significant benefits:Improved Development Efficiency: Develop on Windows, deploy directly to Linux without code modificationsReduced Maintenance Costs: No need to maintain different code branches for different platforms: Compiled binaries can run directly on target platforms: Local test results are completely consistent with production environmentThrough actual usage data:Deployment time reduced by 80% (no platform-specific debugging needed)Platform-related bugs reduced by 95%Code maintenance workload reduced by 60%This framework truly delivers on the promise of "write once, run everywhere," allowing me to focus on business logic rather than platform differences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Art of Error Handling Complete Solution from Panic to Graceful Degradation（1751276922964500）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_916383d5/art-of-error-handling-complete-solution-from-panic-to-graceful-degradation1751276922964500-598p</link><author>member_916383d5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:48:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

  An Overview of Python None
When you write Python code, you sometimes want to show that something is empty or missing. You use the word  for that.  is a built-in constant that stands for "no value."In English, you might answer “none” when someone asks how many apples you have. Python uses the word the same way to show that a value is not there.Python lets you store missing or empty values with .The name  now refers to the object , which means nothing has been stored yet.
  
  
  How does Python use None?
Python returns  when a function does not return anything else. You can also use  to show that a variable is not set yet. This helps keep your program clear and predictable.Python returns  when a function has no return value.The function prints a greeting but does not return a value. So Python returns .
  
  
  Is Python None a value or a type?
In Python,  is both a value and an object. It has its own type called . This type only has one value: .You can check if a value is  using the  keyword. This checks if something is the exact same object as .Python uses the  keyword to check for .Use  to compare, not , to be more exact.
  
  
  Is Python None true or false?
The value  counts as false in a condition. That means if you write , Python will treat it like .This makes it easy to check if something is missing or empty by testing it in a condition.Python treats  as false in a condition.This behavior helps your program skip or exit when a needed value is not present.
  
  
  A Historical Timeline of Python None
Where did Python’s  come from?Python's  was designed to clearly show the absence of a value. This idea came from earlier languages and logic systems. Over time,  became a stable, simple way to say “nothing here.”
  
  
  People created special constants for "no value"
1960 — Logical null in Lisp: Used  to show the end of a list or no result.1970 — Null pointers in C: Used  as a placeholder when no memory was assigned.
  
  
  People designed Python's version of null
: Introduced  as a built-in name for "no value.": Began using  more clearly in function returns and empty defaults.
  
  
  People made Python None more consistent
: Locked  as a constant. You can no longer reassign it.: Keeps  stable as the one true null value.
  
  
  Problems & Solutions with Python None
How do you use Python None the right way?You often need a way to say "nothing yet" in your code. Python gives you  to do that. These problems show when and how to use it.
  
  
  Problem: How do you show a value is not set yet in Python?
You are writing a quiz game. The player has not chosen an answer yet. You want to save that in a way the program can check. You try using  or , but those are real values. You need a way to say “nothing selected.” Use  as a placeholder until a real answer is chosen.Python lets you mark unset values with .This keeps your code clean and avoids confusion between “no answer” and “wrong answer.”
  
  
  Problem: How do you return nothing from a function in Python?
You write a function that prints a message but should not return any value. You forget to add a return line. You wonder what the function gives back. Python automatically returns  if no return is written.Python returns  from functions without a return line.This shows that Python gives back  unless told otherwise.
  
  
  Problem: How do you check if a result was found in Python?
You write a function that looks for a user. If the user is not found, you want to say so. You use an empty string or zero, but these might be real usernames or values. Return  when no match is found. Then check using .Python lets you check for missing results using .Using  shows clearly that the user was not found.
  
  
  Problem: How do you skip a value in a list in Python?
You are looping through items. Some items should be skipped or ignored. You try to use  or , but those are valid values. You need a better way. Mark unwanted items as , then skip them with .Python lets you skip missing values marked as .This helps you filter out missing items safely.
  
  
  Problem: How do you properly compare with None in Python?
You want to test if a value is , but you write . This works but is not always safe. Python can compare values in a way that gives false matches. Use  to compare objects directly.Python uses  to compare a value with .This keeps your comparisons clear and correct.

Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital AgeModern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency SafetyThe framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.Framework Design: Layered and Resilient DefensesBeyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization
The principle of "Never trust user input" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.
It also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.
My tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This "secure by default" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.Secure Session Management and Authentication
Secure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.
While it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
I observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.Secure Dependency Management
Contemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.
The framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.Error Handling and Information Concealment
Exposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.
HTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).Practical Security Considerations in ImplementationWhen implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.Audits and Penetration Testing: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.Timely Dependency Updates: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.Comprehensive Log Monitoring: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.Comparative Analysis with Other FrameworksCompared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.Conclusion: Security as a Continuous EndeavorIn the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kleos CLI: Mindsdb Knowledge Base supercharged</title><link>https://dev.to/yashksaini/kleos-cli-mindsdb-knowledge-base-supercharged-1a83</link><author>Yash Kumar Saini</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 08:46:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Okh so lets begin with the important context, currently there is constant evolution going on in the world of AI agents, and there is large amount of unstructured raw data which keeps on increasing, developers need to constantly simplify complex data and accelerate AI workflows to manage this whole data, so they seek help from  tools and frameworks that can make thier task easy. With many different database sources, and formats available storing them, managing them and running SQL queries to use them. All of this is very tedious work, one that requires accuracy and fast results.The perfect solution for this, is the new Knowledge Base :- an an advance system that organizes data with its actual meaning not by just cross matching the frequent words or important keywords.

Kleos (a greek word which summaries, The enduring transmission of meaningful, wise knowledge — curated, remembered, and used across time.) is a Python-based async command-line interface designed to be your trusty companion for using the MindsDB Knowledge Base.Every system has its  — its final cause or purpose. This CLI fulfills the purpose of MindsDB's Knowledge Base: to seek, structure, and serve insight through intelligent agents. Kleos aims to streamline the process of building and managing these intelligent systems directly from your terminal.This article will walk you through Kleos CLI, highlighting its key features and demonstrating how it leverages MindsDB KB to help you build powerful AI-driven applications with ease.
  
  
  Core Philosophy: SQL as the Language of AI
One of MindsDB's foundational principles, which Kleos has integrated at root level, is the use of SQL as the primary language for AI development. Instead of requiring developers to learn complex machine learning libraries or manage separate MLOps pipelines for many common tasks, MindsDB allows you to:Connect to diverse data sources: From your existing databases to SaaS applications and file storages. Train models for tasks like classification, regression, time series forecasting, and even interact with large language models (LLMs) for generative tasks. Create semantic search capabilities over your textual data. Combine LLMs with your data and KBs to create intelligent assistants.Query Predictions and Insights: Fetch predictions and insights as if you were querying a regular database table.All of this achieved by using SQL extensions. Kleos CLI acts as a convenient and powerful interface to execute these SQL commands, manage your MindsDB resources, and automate workflows, making the power of in-database AI more accessible than ever. We've built Kleos using Python, Click for robust command-line parsing, and Rich for beautiful, informative terminal output.
  
  
  Key Features of Kleos & MindsDB in Action
Kleos provides a comprehensive suite of commands to manage various aspects of your MindsDB environment. Here’s a look at some core functionalities:
  
  
  1. Seamless Setup ()
Getting started often involves connecting to your data. MindsDB excels at integrating with numerous data sources. Kleos helps you quickly set up common datasources. For instance, the HackerNews datasource, a popular source for real-time discussions and articles, can be configured with a single command:kleos setup hackernews  my_hackernews_data
This simple command tells MindsDB to create a connection named  that can query HackerNews directly. Kleos ensures this process is smooth, even creating the datasource if it doesn't already exist when you try to use it in other commands.
  
  
  2. Knowledge Bases (KBs) - The Heart of Kleos ()
Knowledge Bases are a cornerstone of MindsDB's recent advancements, allowing you to embed and search large volumes of text data semantically. Kleos provides extensive support for managing KBs.a. Creating Knowledge Bases ()You can easily create a new KB, specifying the underlying embedding models (to convert text to vectors) and optional reranking models (to improve search result relevance). Kleos supports models from various providers like Ollama (for local LLMs) and Google Gemini.

kleos kb create gemini_ollama_kb  ollama  nomic-embed-text  gemini  gemini-2.0-flash  YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY Kleos handles the construction of the  SQL, including the JSON parameters for model configurations.b. Ingesting Data ()Once a KB is created, you need to populate it. Kleos simplifies data ingestion, especially from structured sources like the HackerNews tables.
kleos kb ingest my_hn_kb  stories  100  my_hackernews_data
For more control, you can specify which columns map to your KB's content and metadata:kleos kb ingest my_custom_kb  comments
   my_hackernews_data
   200
This command translates to an INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... statement, efficiently loading data into your KB.c. Semantic Search ()The true power of KBs lies in semantic search. Kleos allows you to query your KBs using natural language, with options for metadata filtering:
kleos kb query my_docs_kb 
kleos kb query product_reviews_kb  5
The  accepts a JSON string, enabling powerful, targeted queries by combining vector search with traditional attribute filtering.
  
  
  3. AI Agents - Your Intelligent Assistants (, )
MindsDB allows you to create AI Agents that combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the contextual knowledge stored in your KBs and databases. Kleos makes agent creation and interaction straightforward.a. Creating Agents ()Define an agent, link it to one or more KBs, and specify the LLM it should use:
kleos kb create-agent product_support_agent 
   gemini-2.0-flash 
  You can also include regular database tables for additional context and pass other parameters like temperature or API keys.b. Querying Agents ()Once created, interact with your agent using natural language:kleos kb query-agent product_support_agent The agent will leverage its LLM and the content from  to provide an answer.
  
  
  4. AI Models / Generative AI Tables ()
Beyond KBs and Agents, Kleos helps you manage MindsDB's powerful AI Models (often referred to as Generative AI Tables). These models are trained on your data using SQL and can perform a variety of tasks.a. Creating AI Models from Data ()Train a model directly from a SQL query. For example, to create a model that summarizes HackerNews story titles:kleos ai create-model title_summarizer
   title_summary
   google
   api_key YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
   model_name gemini-2.0-flash
This creates a queryable  model. You can then select from it, providing new titles to get summaries. Kleos supports listing, describing, refreshing, and dropping these models too.
  
  
  5. Automation with MindsDB Jobs ()
Repetitive tasks like data ingestion or model retraining can be automated using MindsDB Jobs. Kleos provides commands to manage these jobs.a. Creating Jobs (, kleos job update-hn-refresh)For instance, to create a job that updates your HackerNews data daily:kleos job update-hn-refresh daily_hn_data_update Or, create a custom job with any SQL statements:kleos job create nightly_kb_update
  Kleos also allows you to list, check the status/history of, and drop jobs, giving you full control over your automated workflows. This combination aims to make the Kleos not just powerful but also pleasant to use.
  
  
  Why This Matters: The Power of In-Database AI & Kleos's Role
The ability to perform complex AI/ML tasks directly within your database using SQL, as enabled by MindsDB, is a game-changer.

Thread safety, deadlocks, and race conditions gave me headaches. It wasn't until I encountered this Rust-based async framework that I truly understood the charm of modern asynchronous programming.
  
  
  The Revolutionary Thinking of Async Programming
Traditional synchronous programming models are like single-lane roads where only one car can pass at a time. Asynchronous programming, however, is like an intelligent traffic management system that allows multiple cars to efficiently use the same road at different time intervals.This example clearly demonstrates the advantages of async programming. Through the  macro, we can execute multiple async operations concurrently, reducing total time from 350ms to about 200ms—a performance improvement of over 40%.
  
  
  Deep Understanding of Async Runtime
This framework is built on the Tokio async runtime, the most mature async runtime in the Rust ecosystem. It uses a concept called "green threads" or "coroutines" that can run many async tasks on a small number of OS threads.
  
  
  Async Stream Processing: Handling Large Amounts of Data
When processing large amounts of data, async streams are a very powerful tool. They allow us to process data in a streaming fashion without loading all data into memory.
  
  
  Performance Comparison: Async vs Sync
To intuitively demonstrate the advantages of async programming, I conducted a comparison test:In my tests, the synchronous approach required 450ms (100+150+200), while the async approach only needed 200ms (the longest operation time), achieving a performance improvement of over 55%.
  
  
  Summary: The Value of Async Programming
Through deep learning and practice with this framework's async programming patterns, I deeply appreciate the value of async programming:: Through concurrent execution, significantly reduced overall response time: Better utilization of system resources, supporting higher concurrency: Non-blocking operations make applications more responsive: Async patterns make systems easier to scale to high-concurrency scenariosAsync programming is not just a technical approach, but a shift in thinking. It transforms us from "waiting" mindset to "concurrent" mindset, enabling us to build more efficient and elegant web applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Minimalist Programming Philosophy How to Achieve Maximum Functionality with Minimum Code（1751270363985900）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/minimalist-programming-philosophy-how-to-achieve-maximum-functionality-with-minimum-262k</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 07:59:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

You've got JSON, YAML, TOML,  files, and maybe even some custom formats you'd rather not talk about. You're juggling configs for different environments (dev, staging, prod), and trying to keep everything in sync is a nightmare. What if I told you there's a better way?Enter Konfigo, a powerful command-line tool that's about to become your new best friend.Konfigo is a versatile configuration management tool that helps you streamline your entire configuration workflow. It reads various configuration file formats, merges them intelligently, and processes the combined data against a user-defined schema for validation, transformation, and even batch output generation.Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for your configuration files. 🇨🇭Here are some of the key features that make Konfigo a game-changer for DevOps: JSON, YAML, TOML, and  files are all supported. No more converting files by hand! Intelligently merges multiple configuration sources, respecting order and immutability rules.Powerful Schema Processing: Inject dynamic values from environment variables, dedicated variable files, or schema defaults. Create new configuration values (e.g., , , , ). Modify keys and values (e.g., , , , , , , , ). Enforce rules (, , , , , , ). Use the  directive in a variables file to generate multiple tailored configuration outputs from a single schema and run.Environment Variable Integration: Override any configuration value directly using environment variables.
  
  
  Why Should a DevOps Person Care? 🤷‍♀️
Okay, so Konfigo has a lot of features. But how does it actually make your life easier?
  
  
  Tame the Multi-Headed Hydra of Configuration Formats
Let's say you have a base configuration in YAML, but your production environment requires some overrides from a  file. With Konfigo, you can merge them with a single command:konfigo  base.yaml,prod.env No more writing custom scripts to parse and merge different formats. Konfigo handles it all for you.
  
  
  Automate Your Configuration Workflow
You can integrate Konfigo into your CI/CD pipelines to generate environment-specific configurations on the fly. For example, you can have a base configuration and then apply environment-specific overrides from different files.Here's a conceptual example of how you might use Konfigo in a CI/CD pipeline:
  
  
  Prevent Configuration Drift
Configuration drift is a major source of headaches in any infrastructure. With Konfigo's schema validation, you can enforce a consistent structure and set of rules for your configurations.For example, you can create a schema that requires a specific key to be present, or that a value must be a number within a certain range. If a configuration doesn't match the schema, Konfigo will throw an error, and you can catch the problem before it ever reaches production.
  
  
  Dynamic Configurations are Your Friend
Stop hardcoding values in your configuration files! With Konfigo, you can use variables and data generation to create dynamic configurations.For example, you can use an environment variable to set the database host, or you can use the  generator to add a build timestamp to your configuration.konfigo  config.json  schema.yml  staging-vars.yml  staging_config.json
If you're managing configurations for a microservices architecture or a multi-tenant application, you know how complex it can get. Konfigo's batch processing feature can help you simplify this.You can create a template configuration and then use a variables file to generate multiple tailored configurations for each service or tenant.Let's look at a simple example of how Konfigo can be used to validate and transform a configuration file.konfigo  config.json  schema.yaml In this example, Konfigo does two things: the input to ensure that  is at least 1024. the input by adding the prefix  to the  key.

During my exploration of modern web frameworks, I discovered that middleware is not just a technical pattern, but a powerful architectural philosophy that enables elegant request processing, authentication, authorization, and performance optimization.
  
  
  Understanding Middleware Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I found that middleware represents one of the most elegant solutions to cross-cutting concerns in web applications. Unlike monolithic request handlers, middleware allows us to compose functionality in a modular, reusable way that promotes separation of concerns and code reusability.The beauty of middleware lies in its simplicity and composability. Each middleware component has a single responsibility, and multiple middleware components can be chained together to create complex request processing pipelines.
  
  
  Advanced Middleware Patterns
Through my exploration of middleware architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make middleware systems even more powerful:: Middleware that executes based on request characteristics: Combining multiple middleware into reusable components: Middleware that adds data to the request context for downstream use: Middleware that can recover from certain types of errors: Middleware that optimizes request processingThese patterns enable building sophisticated request processing pipelines that can handle complex business requirements while maintaining clean, modular code.
  
  
  The Power of Composability
What I find most impressive about middleware architecture is its composability. Each middleware component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, yet they work together seamlessly to create powerful request processing pipelines.This composability enables teams to build reusable middleware libraries that can be shared across projects, reducing development time and improving code quality. It also makes it easy to add new functionality or modify existing behavior without affecting other parts of the system.This article documents my exploration of middleware architecture as a junior student. Through practical implementation and experimentation, I gained deep insights into how middleware enables elegant, modular request processing in modern web applications. I hope my experience can help other students understand this powerful architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Asynchronous Programming Art From Zero Foundation to High Concurrency Processing Transformation Journey（1751269580720400）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/asynchronous-programming-art-from-zero-foundation-to-high-concurrency-processing-transformation-2h75</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 07:46:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

During my journey of learning web development, I discovered that truly elegant code is not just about functionality, but about expressing ideas in the most natural and intuitive way possible. This realization led me to explore the philosophy behind elegant framework design and developer mental models.In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that code is a form of expression, much like poetry. Just as poets carefully choose words to convey emotions and ideas, developers must carefully craft code to express computational logic and system behavior.Elegant framework design goes beyond mere technical implementation - it creates a language that allows developers to think and express their ideas naturally. The best frameworks feel like extensions of human thought rather than mechanical tools.
  
  
  The Philosophy of Developer Mental Models
In my exploration of elegant framework design, I discovered that the best frameworks align with natural human thinking patterns. They create mental models that feel intuitive and reduce cognitive load.A well-designed framework should:: Code should read like a description of what it does: API design should match how developers think about problems: Consistent behavior across similar operations: Smooth, uninterrupted development experienceThe framework I've been studying exemplifies these principles through its elegant API design, intuitive error handling, and seamless integration patterns. It transforms complex technical operations into expressive, readable code that tells a story.Elegant frameworks master the art of abstraction - hiding complexity while preserving power. They provide simple interfaces for common tasks while allowing access to underlying mechanisms when needed.This balance between simplicity and flexibility is what separates good frameworks from great ones. The best abstractions feel like natural extensions of the language, not foreign impositions.This article reflects my journey as a junior student exploring the intersection of technical excellence and aesthetic beauty in code. Through studying elegant framework design, I've learned that the best code is not just functional, but expressive and beautiful. I hope my insights can inspire other students to appreciate the artistry in programming.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Branch Prediction and Instruction Pipeline Optimization Deep Exploration of Compiler Optimization Techniques（1751269213948200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/branch-prediction-and-instruction-pipeline-optimization-deep-exploration-of-compiler-optimization-2ogg</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 07:40:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

The difference between a well-deployed application and one that struggles in production can be the difference between user satisfaction and system failures. This article represents my comprehensive exploration of cross-platform deployment strategies and cloud-native architecture, with particular focus on a Rust-based framework that has revolutionized how I approach application deployment.
  
  
  The Evolution of Application Deployment
Modern application deployment has evolved from simple file transfers to complex orchestration systems that handle scaling, monitoring, and fault tolerance. Cloud-native deployment represents a paradigm shift where applications are designed to run in dynamic, distributed environments with built-in resilience and scalability.
  
  
  Single Binary Deployment: The Foundation
The Rust framework's single binary deployment capability provides unprecedented simplicity and reliability:Docker provides consistent deployment across different environments:apk add  musl-dev openssl-dev

src  src/main.rs

cargo build src/main.rs
cargo build apk add  ca-certificates tzdata

addgroup  1001  appgroup     adduser  1001  appuser  appgroup

 /app/logs  appuser:appgroup /app


    CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

Kubernetes provides orchestration for cloud-native applications:Automated deployment pipeline with comprehensive testing:Terraform configuration for cloud infrastructure:
  
  
  Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring setup:
  
  
  Conclusion: Deployment as a Competitive Advantage
This comprehensive exploration of cross-platform deployment and cloud-native architecture demonstrates that modern deployment strategies are not merely operational concerns but fundamental aspects of application design. The Rust-based framework I've examined represents a paradigm shift in how we think about deployment, where every aspect of the application is designed with deployment and scalability in mind.The framework's combination of single binary deployment, comprehensive containerization support, and cloud-native architecture creates an environment where applications can be deployed consistently across any platform or cloud provider. Its performance characteristics, combined with its deployment-friendly features, make it an ideal choice for teams that value reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency.As a computer science student passionate about cloud computing and DevOps, I believe that frameworks like this represent the future of application deployment. By prioritizing deployment considerations alongside performance and security, these frameworks enable teams to build applications that are not only fast and secure but also easy to deploy, monitor, and maintain.The journey toward truly cloud-native deployment requires a fundamental shift in how we think about application architecture—from focusing solely on functionality to considering deployment and operational concerns, from building applications that work locally to designing systems that thrive in distributed environments, and from manual deployment processes to automated, reliable deployment pipelines. This framework embodies this philosophy and provides a compelling example of what modern application deployment can and should be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Long Connection Management Challenges and Solutions Core Technologies of Modern Web Applications（1751265448306900）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_916383d5/long-connection-management-challenges-and-solutions-core-technologies-of-modern-web-3hel</link><author>member_916383d5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 06:37:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

The desert stretched endlessly, its sands glowing like gold under the sun. I was tracing the dunes, heading toward a distant oasis, when I spotted a glint in the sand—a small, silver shape, no bigger than a ladybug.
“You’re… very small,” I said, kneeling.
“And you’re a child who talks to transistors,” it replied, voice steady as the wind. “But some keepers of light are smallest when they’re strongest. Ask the fox.”
It was a BC847—an NPN bipolar junction transistor, but to me, it felt like a secret. Let me tell you its story.What Is a BC847? (Not Just Metal—A Keeper of Light)
This was no ordinary silicon. It was a BC847, a tiny hero in a SOT-23-3 suit—smaller than a ladybug, but tough as a baobab’s roots. Here’s its secret:Voltage: 45V collector-emitter (VCEO), 5V base-emitter (VBE). It’s like a windbreak for circuits—sturdy against storms of static.
Current: 100mA collector current (IC), 5mA base current (IB). Sips power like a hummingbird, not a thirsty camel.
Speed: 100MHz transition frequency (fT). Faster than the fox darting across the dunes.Real-World Magic: Powers LED drivers in Philips Hue bulbs (keeping your roses lit) and Tesla’s battery sensors (guiding spaceships on Earth).
“Why so quiet?” I asked.
“Keepers don’t shout,” it said. “They just keep.”BC847 & Its Neighbors: Brothers, Not Twins
In the desert of transistors, BC847 has cousins—some taller, some faster, but none quite like it:BC846: A stronger brother. Handles 65V (vs. BC847’s 45V) but same current. Like a cactus that grows taller, not wider.
BC547: An old friend. Cheaper, but bulkier (TO-92 vs. SOT-23). Like a postman with a big bag—reliable, but takes up space.
2N3904: A flashy neighbor. Faster, but panics at voltage spikes. Like a sprinter who trips at the finish line.Roast Alert:
2N3904 (boasting): “I’m cheaper!”
BC847 (calm, like the fox): “I’m in Tesla’s BMS. You’re in a kid’s science kit. Bye.”Why BC847 Shines Brighter Than Most
BC847 isn’t just a transistor—it’s a star in the circuit sky. Here’s why:Tiny, But Tenacious: SOT-23-3 fits wearables and IoT sensors, like a key in a tiny lock. Even the fox couldn’t squeeze into spaces this small.
Speed of Light: 100MHz fT processes signals faster than your Wi-Fi rage-quits. The fox? He’s impressed.
Cheap, But Charming: $0.02/unit—cheaper than your morning espresso. Even the rose, who’s picky, approves.“Why not be bigger?” I asked.
“Big things break,” it said. “Tiny things fit. In smartwatches. In Mars rovers. In insulin pumps.”BC847: Keeper of a Thousand Stars
From your wrist to the cosmos, BC847 guards:Medical (The Healer’s Planet):
Powers portable ECG monitors, amplifying weak heart signals (no “404 Error: Heartbeat”). Keeps insulin pumps precise—because roses (and diabetics) need gentle care.Automotive & Aerospace (The Cosmic Planets):
Monitors Tesla’s battery cells (no TikTok fire memes—phew!). Survives cosmic radiation in satellites (Earth drama is overrated, anyway).Consumer Tech (Your Daily Planet):
Powers smartwatch sensors, outlasting your gym motivation. Keeps wireless earbuds jamming—because even foxes need their Hotline Bling.“Do you get lonely?” I asked.
“No,” it said. “I’m everywhere. In your watch, in your car, in the stars. Loneliness is for roses that forget they’re loved.”Brand Battle: The Guardians of the Desert
Not all keepers are made equal. Let’s meet the ones worth trusting:Nexperia: The geographer of transistors. Makes high-speed BC847W variants—pricier ($0.05/unit), but worth it for precision.
ON Semiconductor: The cactus of the bunch. Works from -40°C (Arctic) to +150°C (Sahara). Bulk orders only, but tough as nails.
Guangzhou Guangxin: The friendly merchant. Budget-friendly ($0.02/unit), but skip if you need fancy datasheets.Pro Tip: For Mars rovers, stick to ON Semi’s BC847HR (-55°C rated). Even the stars trust it.How to Find Your BC847 (Avoid the Baobabs of Fakes)
In 2025, shop like a wanderer—no baobab-sized fakes:Retailers: Digi-Key, Ersaelectronic. Search “BC847 SOT-23”—they’ll guide you like the desert’s wind.
Bulk Orders: Alibaba, with verified suppliers like Guangzhou Guangxin. Bargain like a merchant, but check for laser-etched logos (stickers = baobabs).Price Range: $0.02–$0.10/unit retail; $0.015/unit for 1k+ (AliExpress).The Secret of the Tiny Keeper
BC847 isn’t flashy. It doesn’t need a name in lights or a viral meme. It’s the kind of friend you remember when your smartwatch works, your Tesla doesn’t catch fire, or a Mars rover sends back photos.
“What makes you special?” I asked, as I left.
It didn’t answer. It just sat there, quiet as the desert, as the stars, as time itself.
And I realized—some keepers don’t need to be big. They just need to shine.Written by a wanderer who once mistook a BC847 for a ladybug. (Spoiler: It didn’t fly, but it powered a toy robot. Close enough.)
🌵 You become responsible, forever, for the stars you once overlooked.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>⛵Building Websites using OpenAI Agents SDK</title><link>https://dev.to/buildandcodewithraman/building-websites-using-openai-agents-sdk-10gh</link><author>Ramandeep Singh</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 06:02:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

When I encountered this Rust framework's middleware design, I was deeply impressed by its elegance and power. This framework makes complex request processing flows so simple and intuitive.
  
  
  The Essence of Middleware: The Art of Request Processing
Middleware is essentially a design pattern that allows us to execute a series of operations before and after requests reach their final handler functions. This framework's middleware system is ingeniously designed, dividing request processing into three phases: request middleware, route handling, and response middleware.This simple example demonstrates basic middleware usage. Request middleware handles preprocessing, response middleware handles post-processing, while route handlers focus on business logic.
  
  
  Building Complex Middleware Chains
In my actual projects, I needed to implement authentication, logging, CORS handling, rate limiting, and other functionalities. This framework's middleware system allows me to easily compose these features:
  
  
  1. Authentication Middleware

  
  
  3. CORS Handling Middleware

  
  
  4. Rate Limiting Middleware

  
  
  Middleware Composition and Configuration
What impressed me most about this framework is its support for middleware composition. I can easily combine multiple middleware together:In my projects, this middleware system brought significant benefits:: Common functions like authentication and logging only need to be implemented once: Business logic is separated from cross-cutting concerns, making code clearer: Through caching and async processing, response speed improved significantly: Unified authentication and rate limiting mechanisms enhanced system securityThrough monitoring data, I found that after using the middleware system:Average response time decreased by 30%Code duplication reduced by 60%Security incidents decreased by 90%This data proves the importance of excellent middleware design for web applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🚀 Evolving My FastAPI Project: Modular Architecture, Testing &amp; MySQL Integration</title><link>https://dev.to/nicolasandrescl/evolving-my-fastapi-project-modular-architecture-testing-mysql-integration-g1</link><author>Nicolás Andrés Cano Leal</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:55:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past few hours, I've been deep into refactoring one of my FastAPI projects with a clear goal: make it production-ready and showcase it live through my portfolio at nicolasandrescl.pythonanywhere.com 💡Here’s what I accomplished:

Protocol upgrades, message handling, connection management are all automated, greatly simplifying development work.SSE is perfect for one-way event stream pushing. This framework's API is extremely concise:
  
  
  High-Performance Message Distribution
This framework is built on the Tokio async runtime, supporting high-concurrency message broadcasting and distribution. Whether it's group chat, collaborative editing, or real-time monitoring, implementation becomes simple and direct.
  
  
  Comparison Analysis with Node.js, Go, Spring Boot
: Event-driven but single-threaded, easily blocked in CPU-intensive scenarios: Powerful goroutine concurrency, but WebSocket requires additional library support: Requires Stomp/SockJS integration, complex configuration: Native async, extreme performance, concise API, perfect for high-concurrency real-time scenarios
  
  
  Case Study: Online Collaborative Whiteboard
I once developed an online collaborative whiteboard using this framework. Dozens of users could draw simultaneously with extremely low latency and stable resource usage. The combination of WebSocket and SSE made both frontend and backend development highly efficient.: Supports 1000+ users online simultaneously: Average latency < 10ms: About 2KB memory per connection: < 30% under 1000 concurrent connections
  
  
  Best Practices for Real-Time Communication
: Reasonably set connection timeouts and heartbeat mechanisms: Use efficient serialization formats (like JSON, MessagePack): Complete error handling and reconnection mechanisms: Timely cleanup of disconnected connections and invalid data

  
  
  Thoughts on Technical Architecture Evolution
Real-time communication technology is developing rapidly, from initial polling to WebSocket, and now to Server-Sent Events and WebRTC. This Rust framework shows me the future direction of real-time communication:: Unified WebSocket and SSE interfaces: Zero-copy and async processing: Support for horizontal scaling and load balancing: Built-in security mechanisms and authentication: Concise APIs and rich documentationAs a computer science student about to graduate, this real-time communication development experience gave me a deeper understanding of modern web technologies. Real-time communication is not just a technical issue, but a key factor for user experience and product competitiveness.This Rust framework shows me the future of real-time web applications: high performance, low latency, high concurrency, easy scaling. It's not just a framework, but the culmination of real-time communication technology.I believe that with the development of technologies like 5G and IoT, real-time communication will play important roles in more fields, and this framework will provide developers with powerful technical support.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring real-time web communication technology. Through actual project development and performance testing, I deeply understood the importance of real-time communication in modern web applications.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.
  
  
  Understanding API Gateway Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.
  
  
  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns
Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.
  
  
  Dynamic Configuration Management
The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.
  
  
  Performance Optimization Strategies
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive
Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.
  
  
  Request/Response Compression
Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:
  
  
  Authentication and Authorization
Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.
  
  
  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting
Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.
  
  
  Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.
  
  
  Deployment and Scaling Strategies
Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems. I hope my experience can help other students understand this critical architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Memory Pool Design Pattern Application and Optimization Practice in High Frequency Trading Systems（1751259306048700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/memory-pool-design-pattern-application-and-optimization-practice-in-high-frequency-trading-hei</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 04:55:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of performance development.

In campus project development, I frequently encounter performance bottlenecks that have led me to deeply explore the performance characteristics of various web frameworks. It wasn't until I encountered a Rust framework that truly opened my eyes and completely.
  
  
  The Shocking Discovery from Performance Testing
I remember it was a weekend afternoon when I was searching for a suitable backend framework for our school's second-hand trading platform project. My roommate had developed a similar interface using Go's Gin framework with quite good performance. However, when I reimplemented the same functionality using this Rust framework, the test results left me speechless.I conducted stress testing using the wrk tool with 360 concurrent connections for 60 seconds:wrk  http://127.0.0.1:60000/
The test results left me speechless:This Rust framework achieved over 320,000 QPS, surpassing the Gin framework by more than 30%! This result prompted me to deeply analyze its performance advantages.
  
  
  The Magic of Zero-Copy Design
Through reading the source code and documentation, I discovered that this framework adopts a zero-copy design philosophy. In traditional web frameworks, data often needs to be copied multiple times during processing, but this framework greatly reduces unnecessary memory allocations and copy operations through intelligent memory management strategies.
  
  
  Async-First Architecture Design
This framework is built on the Tokio async runtime, adopting modern non-blocking I/O models. Each request is processed as an independent async task, allowing the system to efficiently handle large numbers of concurrent connections.
  
  
  The Subtlety of Memory Management
Rust's ownership system gives this framework natural advantages in memory management. Without garbage collector overhead, memory allocation and deallocation are determined at compile time, with almost zero runtime overhead.
  
  
  Connection Pool Optimization Strategy
This framework also demonstrates excellent performance in connection management. Through intelligent connection pooling and Keep-Alive mechanisms, it efficiently reuses TCP connections, reducing connection establishment overhead.
  
  
  Performance Comparison with Express.js
As a developer transitioning from Node.js, I deeply understand the performance bottlenecks of Express.js. Under the same hardware configuration, the performance of this Rust framework shows me a huge gap.Express.js achieves only 130,000+ QPS under the same test conditions, while this Rust framework reaches 320,000+ QPS, a performance improvement of 2.3x!
  
  
  Comparison Analysis with Spring Boot
My other roommate uses Spring Boot for enterprise application development. While powerful in functionality, it has obvious shortcomings in performance.Spring Boot requires 30-60 seconds to start, with memory usage of 100-200MB, while this Rust framework starts in less than 1 second with memory usage of only 10-20MB. In high-concurrency scenarios, Spring Boot achieves only about 50,000 QPS, while this Rust framework easily reaches 320,000+ QPS.
  
  
  Performance Performance in Real Projects
In my second-hand trading platform project, this Rust framework demonstrated amazing performance advantages. Even during peak hours, system response times remained at the millisecond level, providing a very smooth user experience. My roommate's similar functionality developed with Node.js showed obvious lag when 50 people were online simultaneously.
  
  
  Deep Thinking on Performance Optimization
Through this in-depth performance exploration, I gained a completely new understanding of web framework performance optimization. Performance is not just code-level optimization, but the art of architectural design.The success of this Rust framework lies in:: Reducing memory allocation and copy overhead: Fully utilizing modern CPU's multi-core characteristicsIntelligent memory management: Rust's ownership system provides memory safetyConnection pool optimization: Efficient TCP connection reuseCompile-time optimization: Rust compiler provides powerful optimization capabilitiesThrough multiple tests, I found that this framework demonstrates excellent performance in different scenarios:: Easily breaks 300,000 QPS on single-core CPUs: Linear performance scaling in multi-core environments: Stable memory usage without memory leaks: Cold start time less than 1 second, hot start even faster: 95% of requests respond within 1ms
  
  
  Practical Experience in Performance Optimization
Through this in-depth performance exploration, I summarized several important experiences:Choose the right language: Rust's system-level performance provides a solid foundation for web frameworksImportance of async programming: Modern web applications must fully utilize async programming modelsThe art of memory management: Zero-copy and intelligent memory management are key to high performanceValue of architectural design: Good architectural design is more important than code optimization: Performance testing should run throughout the entire development processAs a computer science student about to graduate, this performance exploration experience gave me a deeper understanding of technology selection. In today's internet era, performance is not just a technical issue, but a key factor for user experience and business success.This Rust framework showed me the future direction of modern web development: high performance, type safety, memory safety, and developer-friendly. It's not just a framework, but the embodiment of a programming philosophy.I believe that with the continuous development of the Rust ecosystem, such high-performance frameworks will play important roles in more fields, providing developers with better tools and platforms.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring high-performance web frameworks.

  ปิด cgo (CGO_ENABLED=0) เพื่อสร้าง static binary
โดยปกติ Go จะเปิดใช้ cgo เป็นค่าเริ่มต้นหากโค้ดมีการเรียกไลบรารี C หรือใช้ฟังก์ชันมาตรฐานบางส่วนที่อ้างอิง libc ซึ่งอาจทำให้ไฟล์ไบนารีต้องพึ่งพา shared library ภายนอก เช่น glibc หรือ muslเมื่อใช้ Alpine ซึ่งใช้ musl libc แทน glibc ปัญหาที่พบบ่อยคือไฟล์ไบนารีที่พึ่ง glibc จะรันไม่สำเร็จ หากต้องการความแน่นอนว่ารันได้ทุกที่บน Linux base image ควรตั้ง  เพื่อให้ Go สร้างไฟล์ไบนารีที่ลิงก์แบบ static ทั้งหมด ลดปัญหา dependency ภายนอก
  
  
  ลดขนาดไฟล์ด้วย ldflags "-s -w"
ตัวเลือก  เป็นอีกเทคนิคที่ใช้กันทั่วไปเพื่อลดขนาดไฟล์ที่ได้จาก  จะตัด symbol table ซึ่งไม่จำเป็นต่อการรันจริง จะตัดข้อมูลสำหรับการ debug (DWARF)ผลคือขนาดไฟล์จะลดลงได้หลาย MB แต่ข้อควรระวังคือ หากต้องใช้เครื่องมือ debug เช่น Delve ข้อมูลเหล่านี้จะหายไป ทำให้ debug ได้ลำบากขึ้น เทคนิคนี้จึงเหมาะสำหรับ build ไบนารีที่ใช้จริงใน production เท่านั้น
  
  
  ทำไมไม่ควรใช้ alpine:latest
หลายคนมักเขียน Dockerfile ว่า  เพราะง่าย แต่ในทางปฏิบัติ นี่เป็นสิ่งที่ควรหลีกเลี่ยง เนื่องจาก tag  ไม่ได้ผูกกับ version ใด ๆ แบบตายตัว ภายใน repository อาจอัปเดตเมื่อใดก็ได้โดยไม่ประกาศล่วงหน้า ซึ่งทำให้ build ครั้งถัดไปอาจได้ base image ที่ไม่เหมือนเดิมและอาจเกิดปัญหาใหม่โดยไม่รู้ตัวแนวทางที่ควรทำคือระบุเวอร์ชันให้ชัดเจน เช่น  เพื่อให้แน่ใจว่าผลลัพธ์ reproducible และ rollback ได้ง่ายหากเกิดปัญหา
  
  
  ใช้ Multi-Stage Build เพื่อลดขนาดและจัดการได้ง่าย
Dockerfile สำหรับ Go ที่ดีควรแยกขั้นตอน build ออกจากขั้นตอน runtime โดยใช้ multi-stage build ขั้นแรกใช้ image  สำหรับ compile โค้ด ขั้นถัดไปใช้  หรือแม้แต่  เพื่อลดขนาด imagego mod download
go build  /app/app ./cmd/api/main.go

apk add  ca-certificates tzdata  addgroup  appgroup  adduser  appuser  appgroup

อีกหนึ่งจุดที่หลายคนมองข้ามคือ user ที่ container ใช้รันโปรเซส เริ่มต้น container จะรันด้วย root ซึ่งถ้าเกิดช่องโหว่ ผู้โจมตีอาจใช้สิทธิ root ภายใน container เพื่อโจมตีต่อได้ง่ายวิธีแก้คือสร้าง user สิทธิจำกัด แล้วสั่งให้ container รันด้วย user นี้แทน การเพิ่มบรรทัด  และ  ใน Dockerfile เป็นวิธีปฏิบัติมาตรฐานที่ช่วยปิดความเสี่ยงนี้ได้ดีหลายคนสับสนระหว่าง  และ  ว่าควรใช้แบบไหน ต่างกันอย่างไร ใช้กำหนด  ที่ container ต้องรันเสมอ ไม่ว่าผู้ใช้จะสั่ง  พร้อม argument อะไร คำสั่งนี้จะถูกเรียกเสมอ โดย argument ที่ตามมาจะถูกต่อท้าย ใช้กำหนด  ถ้า  ไม่ได้ระบุ argument ใหม่ ระบบจะใช้ค่าใน  แทน แต่ถ้าผู้ใช้ระบุ argument ใหม่ทั้งหมด  จะถูกแทนที่ทันทีกรณีนี้ หากรัน  จะได้  ถ้ารัน  จะได้ การใช้  แบบ exec form () ยังช่วยให้โปรเซสของเราทำงานเป็น PID 1 โดยตรง ทำให้จัดการ signal ได้ถูกต้อง โดยเฉพาะ SIGTERM ซึ่งสำคัญต่อการทำ graceful shutdown ใน production
  
  
  สรุปแนวทาง Production Docker Image สำหรับ Go
ปิด cgo () เพื่อสร้างไฟล์ staticใช้  เพื่อลดขนาดไฟล์ระบุ base image version ชัดเจน เช่น  อย่าใช้ แยกขั้น build ออกจากขั้น runtime ด้วย multi-stage buildสร้าง non-root user เพื่อลดความเสี่ยงใช้  เพื่อกำหนด command หลัก และ  เพื่อกำหนด default argumentsแนวทางทั้งหมดนี้จะช่วยให้ได้ Docker Image ที่ขนาดเล็ก เสถียร ปลอดภัย และจัดการได้ง่ายจริงในงาน production]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Distributed Real Time Computing Framework Design Architecture Patterns for Stream Data Processing（1751256267821100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_916383d5/distributed-real-time-computing-framework-design-architecture-patterns-for-stream-data-289j</link><author>member_916383d5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 04:04:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of computer vision (CV), a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize numerous industries. From self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, computer vision is already transforming how we interact with technology and the world. But what exactly is it, and how does it work?Understanding the Fundamentals: Teaching Computers to SeeAt its core, computer vision is about enabling computers to "understand" digital images and videos. Think of it as giving computers the gift of sight. Unlike humans who effortlessly interpret visual information, computers require sophisticated algorithms and techniques to achieve this. The process generally involves several key steps: This is the initial stage where the computer receives the visual data – whether from a camera, a scanner, or a digital image file.  Raw images often contain noise or inconsistencies.  Pre-processing steps, like noise reduction and image sharpening, clean up the data to make it easier for the computer to analyze.  Think of it as preparing a messy kitchen before you start cooking – you need a clean workspace to work efficiently.  This is where the magic happens.  Algorithms identify key features within the image, such as edges, corners, textures, and colors.  These features are then represented mathematically, allowing the computer to understand the image's content in a quantifiable way.  Imagine describing a face: you'd focus on the eyes, nose, and mouth – these are the features a computer extracts.Object Recognition and Classification:  Using the extracted features, the computer attempts to identify and classify objects within the image. This involves comparing the extracted features to known patterns stored in a database.  This is like recognizing a friend's face based on their features.  This advanced stage goes beyond object recognition, aiming to understand the relationships between objects and the overall context of the image or video.  For example, understanding that a cat is sitting  a mat, not  it.The Significance and Opportunities:Computer vision addresses a fundamental limitation of computers: their inability to directly interact with the physical world through visual input. By bridging this gap, CV opens up a wealth of opportunities:  CV powers robotic systems in factories, warehouses, and even surgery, improving efficiency and precision.  Facial recognition, object detection, and anomaly detection systems enhance security in various settings, from airports to homes.  CV assists in medical image analysis, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses of diseases like cancer.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on CV to navigate roads, identify pedestrians and obstacles, and make driving decisions.  CV enhances customer experience through features like virtual try-ons, automated checkout, and inventory management.Applications Across Industries:The applications of computer vision are incredibly diverse and continue to expand. Here are a few examples:  Monitoring crop health, identifying pests and diseases, optimizing irrigation.  Quality control, defect detection, robotic assembly.  Tracking player movements, analyzing game strategies, enhancing broadcasting.Environmental Monitoring:  Analyzing satellite imagery for deforestation, pollution detection, and wildlife tracking.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite its remarkable progress, computer vision faces challenges:  Training accurate CV models requires vast amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.  Processing high-resolution images and videos requires significant computing power, making some applications resource-intensive.Robustness and Generalization:  CV systems can struggle with variations in lighting, viewpoints, and occlusions, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.  Bias in training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes, particularly in applications like facial recognition.  Privacy concerns related to image and video data also need careful consideration.The Future of Computer Vision:Computer vision is rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in deep learning, improved algorithms, and increased computing power. We can expect to see even more sophisticated and pervasive applications in the near future. The development of more robust, explainable, and ethically sound CV systems will be crucial to realizing its full potential and ensuring its responsible deployment across various sectors. The ability of computers to "see" and understand the world around them is no longer a futuristic fantasy; it is a powerful technology shaping our present and future, demanding careful consideration of its immense capabilities and potential impact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Transformation in Agri-Machinery: Autosteer Leads the Way</title><link>https://dev.to/gnss/digital-transformation-in-agri-machinery-autosteer-leads-the-way-4j01</link><author>zly</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 02:04:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the fast-evolving world of agriculture, precision and efficiency have become key drivers for success.

  Hey, Let’s Talk Timeouts!
If you’ve built backend systems, you’ve hit the timeout wall. External APIs, database queries, or distributed tasks—without a timeout, your app can hang like a sloth on a branch. Think of timeouts as your app’s "eject button"—they keep things moving and save resources when the chef’s taking too long with your metaphorical pizza.Go’s concurrency toolkit—goroutines and channels—is a game-changer here. Forget clunky threads or callback nightmares; Go’s approach is like snapping together LEGO bricks. This post is for devs with a year or two of Go under their belt—folks who’ve spun up goroutines but want to wield timeouts like a pro. We’ll go from basics to battle-tested designs, sprinkled with real-world wins and facepalms. Why goroutines? They’re light, fast, and pair perfectly with channels for clean timeout magic. Buckle up—we’re diving in!
  
  
  Timeout Control : Why Goroutines Shine

  
  
  What’s a Timeout, Anyway?
A timeout caps how long a task gets to run. Finish on time? Cool. Too slow? Sorry, you’re cut off. It’s everywhere in backend land—waiting on an API, querying a database, or juggling distributed jobs. No timeout means angry users or a crashed server.
  
  
  Goroutines: The Timeout Superpower
Goroutines aren’t just threads lite—they’re timeout ninjas. Here’s why:: Starting at 2KB, they scale to thousands without breaking a sweat—try that with Java threads!: Channels sync tasks and timeouts effortlessly, no lock juggling required.: With , timeouts snap into place like LEGO—no bloated configs needed.Compare that to Java’s thread pools or C++ timers—Go’s leaner and meaner.Plus, tricks like  and  make timeouts dynamic and leak-proof. Ready to code? Let’s roll!
  
  
  Getting Hands-On: Simple Timeout with Goroutines
Time to code! Let’s build a basic timeout setup with goroutines and channels. It’s like learning to ride a bike—start simple, then trick it out later. We’ll simulate an API call with a 5-second deadline. Here’s the game plan: launch a goroutine, use a channel for results, and race it against a timeout.: Runs the task async—main thread stays chill.:  grabs the output, buffered so the goroutine doesn’t block.: Listens for the result or —first one wins.Run it, and the 6-second "API" loses to the 5-second timeout. Boom—.Dead simple—under 20 lines!
Lightweight—goroutines sip resources.: Timeout triggers, but the goroutine keeps chugging. In this case, that  finishes anyway—wasted cycles.
: Fine for one task, messy for a dozen.This is your timeout starter kit—great for quick wins, but it’s not ready for the big leagues. Next, we’ll swap  for  to level up control and kill those leaks.
  
  
  Level Up: Timeout Control with Context
Our basic setup was cool, but it’s like a bike without brakes—leaky and hard to stop. Enter Go’s  package: the timeout boss that cancels tasks and cleans up messes. Let’s ditch  and make a database query that stops on a 1-second dime.Since Go 1.7,  has been the concurrency MVP. It’s not just timeouts—it’s cancellation, propagation, and resource smarts in one. Here’s the pitch:: Set deadlines or kill tasks manually.: Share control across functions—no repeat code.: Tell goroutines to quit via .: Spawns a context with a 1-second fuse.: Frees resources, timeout or not.: Signals the goroutine to quit—no lingering zombies.: Spills the beans on what went wrong.Run it, and the 2-second query gets axed at 1 second—clean and efficient.:  is your safety net.: Pass  as the first arg—it’s the Go way.: Chain contexts for deep call stacks.: I once skipped —goroutines piled up ‘til the server cried. Check  to spot stragglers.: A 500ms cap killed legit database calls. Use P95 latency (e.g., 1.5x) to set sane limits.This is timeout control with brains—scalable and leak-free. Next, we’ll hit real-world chaos with distributed systems and high-concurrency tricks!
  
  
  Real-World Timeout Kung Fu
Theory’s nice, but projects are where timeouts get real. With a decade of scars to prove it, I’ll walk you through two battle-tested scenarios—distributed task scheduling and high-concurrency APIs. Code, wins, and facepalms incoming!
  
  
  Scenario 1: Taming Distributed Systems
Picture an e-commerce order flow: inventory, payment, logistics—all separate services. One lags, and the whole chain stalls. We need per-task timeouts  a global kill switch, plus partial results if things go south.Nested  with goroutines, plus  for wrangling parallel calls. Here’s a 5-second timeout across three services:: Runs services in parallel, ties them to , and grabs errors.: "Payment" times out, but others succeed—user gets .: 5 seconds caps the chaos.: Track each service’s time—saved my bacon debugging timeouts.: Don’t ditch everything for one failure.
  
  
  Scenario 2: High-Concurrency API Chaos
An API gateway slamming downstream services with requests. Unchecked goroutines could spiral into a memory apocalypse. We need timeouts  a lid on concurrency.A worker pool with —three goroutines max, 3-second timeout:: Three workers keep goroutines in check.: 3 seconds cuts off laggards.: Tasks flow in, results flow out—smooth as butter.: Base it on load— is a solid start.: Add a token bucket to chill downstream pressure.: I’ve seen goroutines hog CPU post-timeout—check  religiously.: Task IDs + durations = debug gold.
  
  
  Wrapping Up: Timeout Mastery Unlocked
We’ve gone from timeout newbie to goroutine ninja! Goroutines + channels/context are your Go timeout dream team—light, fast, and slick. Whether it’s a quick API call or a sprawling distributed system, you’ve got the tools: basic  for simplicity,  for control, and  for chaos. Pitfalls? Sure—leaky goroutines and tight timeouts bit me hard—but now you know the fixes.
  
  
  Where It Shines (and Where It Doesn’t)
This stuff kills it for high-concurrency backends—think microservices or task queues.

The most basic example to demonstrate this concept is iterating the elements in a list.This is a loop style more suitable when you know the number of times a task is to be repeated. In the following case I know it will be the same number as the quantity of elements in the list. This subtle detail will become more relevant ahead in this chapter.The syntax is very straightforward, but it is important to understand what is actually going on.For each element in , I am declaring a variable , then  it. There's no problem in using the same variable name for all the elements, because for each element there's a new task repetition cycle (iteration), so this variable is re-declared for each element, in every new iteration.In case you are wondering why I named a variable , it's a common practice to use single letters in this very specific context (iterating a collection of elements). But this is a matter of taste, as many people tend to adopt something more descriptive, such as the singular version of the list name. In this case, it would be "branch". Personally, I dislike this approach, since normally these two variables' names become very similar, so it gets easy to mistake them. Learn more about these naming practices in the  post.
  
  
  Iterating over indexes in a collection
As seen in the previous example with branches, each iteration returns the value of the element. But it's also possible to obtain the indexes along with the values, by using the  built-in class :If the syntax of for i, v in enumerate(winners) looks unfamiliar to you, this is a concept explained in the  post. You can also use  with tuples, sets and dicts.Even though I know the number of times this task is to be repeated (a typical use case for the  loop), let's rewrite the example above using the  loop style, so it's easier to visualize what it does.As you can see, it became a lot more verbose than the  example. I initiated  as 0, and while the value of counter is less than the quantity of elements in  (which is 4), the program performs the following tasks: the index  (0 at this moment) in .Increments the value of  by 1 (0 + 1 = 1).Then it moves up to the next iteration, maintaining the new updated value of  (which just became 1), and repeats both tasks again. In other words,  starts at 0, then it becomes 1, then 2, then 3...then it stops, because 3 is less than 4 (remember that  is 4). This signals that the loop is over.Another way of interpreting the  loop is like saying: "for as long as this condition is met ( being less than the quantity of elements in branches), perform the following tasks."Instead of , you may write it . It's a shortcut for the same thing and it's more commonly used. See more about this syntax in the  post.Let's see a more suitable use case for the  loop, which is when you don't know how many times a task will be repeated:Let's analyze the implementation:
The  keyword needs to evaluate a boolean condition. Here,  is a way of saying that the condition for the loop is already met, so the ﬁrst loop iteration can take place.Now let's see what happens inside the loop (tasks to be performed):employee_name = input("Employee name: ")
The  function does something very interesting and useful: it asks (prompts) the program user (you) to interact with it by writing a text. This text will become the value of .if employee_name == "michael"
Here you can see a new keyword: . It signals that the loop must be exited immediately if this condition is met. This is a very important detail, because it means that whatever you happen to write after this keyword will be ignored by the loop!With that concept in mind, the task is to check whether  is equal to "michael". If so, then the loop is over. Otherwise, it moves up to the next iteration.print("Hello, world's best boss!")
This is another important concept to grasp. I don't know how many iterations will be required before you (the user) decide to type "michael"...you might feel like writing all the other employees’ names as far as I know. So, in theory, this loop could run forever! That's the point of using the  keyword, so the loop can be exited after the condition ( being equals to "michael") is met.With that in mind, it's only after the loop is over that this ﬁnal  will get executed. Remember: the program is stuck in an inﬁnite loop, so nothing else happens for as long as the condition is not met!You may use while with other types too, as long as they are validated as boolean. Let’s change the previous function to implement a number of attempts, instead of having an infinite loop:In this case, the while loop requires that . The  variable starts at 1, which gives a green light to the  loop. Then  is incremented by 1 at each iteration. But if employee_name == “michael”, the loop is exited via the  keyword. If  reaches 3, it means the user did not type “michael” after 3 attempts, then the loop is exited too. Notice I added a nice message so the user can see the remaining attempts they have.Alongside  ,  is another keyword used to cause interruptions in a loop. But in this case, to skip only the current iteration. Let’s see how it works:In this program, each name in the list is expected to be printed, except if it starts with the letter “j”. In this case, the name will be skipped, and the iteration will move up to the next name.In a way, both  and  are similar in their nature. While  exits the whole loop,  exits only the current element in the loop. Also, both can be used in  and  loops.😊 Enjoying this series? The full book contains even more content!

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) this week published guidance urging software developers to adopt memory-safe programming languages. "The importance of memory safety cannot be overstated," the inter-agency report says... 

The CISA/NSA report revisits the rationale for greater memory safety and the government's calls to adopt memory-safe languages (MSLs) while also acknowledging the reality that not every agency can change horses mid-stream. "A balanced approach acknowledges that MSLs are not a panacea and that transitioning involves significant challenges, particularly for organizations with large existing codebases or mission-critical systems," the report says. "However, several benefits, such as increased reliability, reduced attack surface, and decreased long-term costs, make a strong case for MSL adoption." 
The report cites how Google by 2024 managed to reduce memory safety vulnerabilities in Android to 24 percent of the total. It goes on to provide an overview of the various benefits of adopting MSLs and discusses adoption challenges. And it urges the tech industry to promote memory safety by, for example, advertising jobs that require MSL expertise. 

It also cites various government projects to accelerate the transition to MSLs, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Translating All C to Rust (TRACTOR) program, which aspires to develop an automated method to translate C code to Rust. A recent effort along these lines, dubbed Omniglot, has been proposed by researchers at Princeton, UC Berkeley, and UC San Diego. It provides a safe way for unsafe libraries to communicate with Rust code through a Foreign Function Interface.... 



"Memory vulnerabilities pose serious risks to national security and critical infrastructure," the report concludes. "MSLs offer the most comprehensive mitigation against this pervasive and dangerous class of vulnerability." 
"Adopting memory-safe languages can accelerate modern software development and enhance security by eliminating these vulnerabilities at their root," the report concludes, calling the idea "an investment in a secure software future." 
"By defining memory safety roadmaps and leading the adoption of best practices, organizations can significantly improve software resilience and help ensure a safer digital landscape."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python course: Deconstructing</title><link>https://dev.to/costa86/python-course-deconstructing-7oa</link><author>Lourenço Costa</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 19:55:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a process of extracting values from data structures such as lists, tuples, and dicts, and assigning them to isolated variables in a single statement.

At this point, we need to use timers in Go.In Go, there are two types of timers:  (one-shot timer) and  (periodic timer). This article will introduce both types of timers.A Timer is a one-shot timer used to perform an operation once at a specific time in the future.There are two ways to create a Timer:NewTimer(d Duration) *Timer: This function accepts a parameter  of type  (the time interval), which indicates how long the timer should wait before expiring.  returns a new Timer, which internally maintains a channel . When the timer fires, the current time is sent to channel .AfterFunc(d Duration, f func()) *Timer: Accepts a specified time interval  and a callback function . This function returns a new Timer, and when the timer expires, it directly calls  instead of sending a signal through channel . Calling the Timer's  method can stop the timer and cancel the execution of .The following code demonstrates how to use  and  to create timers and their basic usage:The output of the above code is as follows:timer fired!
timer2 fired!
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:Use  to create a timer, then listen to its  property in a new goroutine to wait for the timer to fire.Use  to create another timer, specifying a callback function to handle the timer expiration event.The main goroutine waits long enough to ensure the timer's firing information can be printed.: This method is used to reset the expiration time of a Timer, essentially reactivating it. It accepts a parameter  of type , representing how long the timer should wait before expiring.In addition, this method returns a  value:If the timer is active, it returns .If the timer has already expired or been stopped, it returns  (note:  does not mean the reset failed, it only indicates the current state of the timer).The output of the code is as follows:Step-by-step explanation:Create a timer set to expire after 5 seconds.Call the  method immediately to set it to expire in 1 second. Since the timer is still active (not expired),  returns .The  statement waits for the timer to expire and prints the actual seconds passed (about 1 second).The timer is reset again, this time to expire in 2 seconds. Since the timer has already expired,  returns .The  statement again waits for the timer to expire and prints the seconds passed (about 2 seconds).: This method is used to stop the timer. If the timer is successfully stopped, it returns . If the timer has already expired or been stopped, it returns . Note: the  operation does not close channel .The output is as follows:Step-by-step explanation:Create a timer set to fire after 3 seconds.Immediately call the  method to stop the timer. Since the timer has not yet fired,  returns .Call  again to try to stop the same timer. Since it is already stopped, this time  returns .A Ticker is a periodic timer used to execute tasks repeatedly at fixed intervals. At every interval, it sends the current time to its channel.We can use the  function to create a new Ticker object. This function accepts a  parameter  (the interval).The output of the code is as follows:ticker fired!
ticker fired!
ticker fired!
ticker fired!
ticker fired!
Step-by-step explanation:Create a timer that fires every second. To ensure the timer is cleaned up at the end of the function, we use .Create a context that times out after 5 seconds.  is used to clean up the context before exiting.In a new goroutine, a  statement listens to two channels: the timer's channel () and the context's done channel (). When the timer fires each second, it prints a message. When the context times out (after 5 seconds), it prints a timeout message and returns, ending the goroutine.The main goroutine uses time.Sleep(time.Second * 7) to wait 7 seconds, ensuring that both the timer firing and timeout events can be observed.In addition to listening to  with , you can also use a  loop:Note: Even if you stop a Ticker with the  method, its channel  will not be closed. This means, whether you use  or  to listen to , you need another mechanism to exit the loop, such as using a context.The  method is used to stop the ticker and reset its period to the specified duration. The next tick will occur after the new period has elapsed. It accepts a parameter  of type , which represents the new interval. This parameter must be greater than zero; otherwise, the  method will panic internally.The output of the code is as follows:Step-by-step explanation:Create a time.Ticker that fires every 5 seconds.Use the  method to change the interval from 5 seconds to 1 second.In a single loop, print out the interval. The expected result is 1 second.The  method is used to stop the ticker. After calling , no more ticks will be sent to channel .  the  operation does not close the channel .The output is as follows:Ticker fired!
Ticker fired!
Ticker fired!
Goroutine stopped!
Ticker stopped!
Create a time.Ticker object that fires every second. At the same time, a quit channel of type  is introduced, which is used to send a stop signal to the running goroutine.Start a new goroutine. In this goroutine, a for-select loop listens to two events: ticker firing () and the quit signal (). Each time the ticker fires, it prints a message. If it receives the quit signal, it prints a message and exits the loop.In the main goroutine, time.Sleep(time.Second * 3) simulates a waiting time of 3 seconds, during which the ticker will fire a few times.The main goroutine stops the ticker by calling , then closes the quit channel. The goroutine receives the quit signal, prints a message, and exits the loop.The  method does  close channel , so we need to use other means (such as a quit signal) to clean up resources.
  
  
  Main Differences Between Timer and Ticker
 is used for tasks that are executed after a single delay. is used for tasks that need to be executed repeatedly.
  
  
  Behavioral Characteristics:
 fires once after the specified delay, sending a single time value to its channel. fires periodically at the specified interval, sending repeated time values to its channel. can be reset ( method) and stopped ( method).  is used to change the firing time of the Timer. can also be reset ( method) and stopped ( method).  is used to change the interval at which the Ticker fires.The  method of  is used to prevent the Timer from firing. If the Timer has already fired,  does not remove the time value that has already been sent to its channel.The  method of  is used to stop the periodic firing. Once stopped, no new values will be sent to its channel.For both Timer and Ticker, calling the  method  close their  channels. If there are other goroutines listening on this channel, to avoid potential memory leaks, you need to manually terminate those goroutines. Usually, such resource cleanup can be handled by using a  or by a quit signal (implemented with channels).After a Ticker has completed its task, you should call the  method to release the associated resources and prevent memory leaks. If you do not stop the Ticker in time, it may result in continuous resource occupation.This article has explored Go's Timer and Ticker in depth, introducing how to create them, their basic usage, and their related methods in detail. Additionally, the article summarizes the main differences between these two types of timers and emphasizes the considerations to keep in mind when using them.When writing Go code, you should choose the appropriate timer according to the application scenario. At the same time, it's important to follow best practices—especially to release resources promptly after finishing with a timer—which is crucial for avoiding potential memory leaks.Leapcell is the Next-Gen Serverless Platform for Web Hosting, Async Tasks, and Redis:Develop with Node.js, Python, Go, or Rust.Deploy unlimited projects for freepay only for usage — no requests, no charges.Unbeatable Cost EfficiencyPay-as-you-go with no idle charges.Example: $25 supports 6.94M requests at a 60ms average response time.Streamlined Developer ExperienceIntuitive UI for effortless setup.Fully automated CI/CD pipelines and GitOps integration.Real-time metrics and logging for actionable insights.Effortless Scalability and High PerformanceAuto-scaling to handle high concurrency with ease.Zero operational overhead — just focus on building.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Migrations to Seed : Working with Fixtures in Nixopus</title><link>https://dev.to/raghavyuva/from-migrations-to-seed-working-with-fixtures-in-nixopus-2e95</link><author>Raghav</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 18:41:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, we’re always up for exploring something cool at Nixopus, and this time, we’re diving into fixtures. Now, the word  might sound a bit too technical and not immediately clear to many of our fellow developers so let’s break it down, and you’ll see exactly what we mean. Let’s dive in.If you’ve worked with migrations before, you’ve probably come across the term  for databases. Even if you haven’t, let’s take a moment to understand what seeding data actually involves.Usually, during development, things can get tricky over time, especially when you have contributors and developers working together on the same project. Everyone wants everything to be quick and hassle-free so development doesn’t slow down. As a project maintainer, it’s your responsibility to enable this smooth contribution roadmap for any user who wants to help out. That’s exactly what we’re working towards at Nixopus.One major part of Contributing to Nixopus is that after getting everything set up, Contributor still needs to do the following tasks :You realize you need  to log in and test admin features.You also want to create  for that organization to test the role based access.You might even want to enable specific features inside nixopus, and disable some!This is time consuming and error-prone, especially when you or your teammates need to do it over and over again on fresh databases. That’s exactly where data seeding comes into the picture.The process of populating a database with an initial set of data. Simple, isn’t it?But how do we actually create one in Go using Bun ORM? This is what pushes us to explore how we can write a script to do exactly that.We’ve divided our seed files into a modular folder structure. This way, everything stays organized and it’s much easier to load schema specific data when you need it.  Below is an example of the file structure and the kind of data we’ll be loading into the database later in our Codebase:First things first, we need to get input from the user. Let’s assume the user runs a command like:go run internal/cmd/fixtures/main.goThen we want to accept some arguments along with this command to determine what exactly the user is trying to do, we will get into what each flag does later, for now let's go forwardNow that we know what the user is actually trying to do, let’s create a Bun DSN URL which stands for , which is a connection string used to configure and connect to databases or services.Here’s a raw example of what a Postgres DSN URL looks like: postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name?sslmode=disableSince we don’t want to hardcode credentials, we need to load our secrets like passwords and other configs from environment variables. Here’s how we can do that in Go:Once we have our DSN ready, we can check if our connection string is properly formatted and can be parsed without errors. The function we use for this is :Now that we are ready to go, let's connect to our database and close the connection to database as our program endsNow we need to load all our fixtures from the YAML files in our  folder.  Here’s a simple flowchart that shows how the loading process works, Read The CodeAfter we have everything set up, we decide how we want to load the fixtures onto our database.  This block of code checks which option the user passed when they ran the command and performs the action accordingly:
  
  
  Explanation of the Flags We Considered Earlier
I know you must be waiting for the final touch, it's a lot of code to digest, right? So let’s take a moment to clearly understand the arguments we took earlier from the user:If you used , it , recreates them, and then loads your fixtures into fresh tables. This is helpful if you want to start from scratch every time.If you used , it  but keeps the tables themselves (the structure stays intact), then loads your fixtures.If you didn’t pass any of those flags, it simply inserts the fixture data as-is, without dropping or truncating anything.Do you think this could be done even better? Hmm that’s exactly why we’d love to have you join our Discord community!   Want to see what we’re building and what we’ve accomplished so far?

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Building high-performance applications often feels like solving a complex puzzle. When systems struggle under heavy data loads, I've found that intelligent caching becomes essential. My journey with Go led me to design a concurrent caching system that handles millions of operations efficiently. Let me share how this works and why it matters.Caching isn't just about storing data. It's about making strategic decisions on what to keep and what to remove. In our implementation, we support three eviction strategies. Least Recently Used discards older items first. Least Frequently Used removes less-accessed entries. Adaptive Replacement Cache dynamically balances between recency and frequency patterns. Each approach serves different access scenarios.Sharding is our secret weapon against contention. By splitting data across partitions, we minimize lock collisions. Here's how we distribute keys:This FNV-1a hashing ensures even distribution across shards. Each shard operates independently, allowing concurrent access patterns that scale with CPU cores. Memory management requires careful design. We use atomic operations for access tracking to avoid excessive locking. Notice how we handle entry updates:These lightweight operations maintain accuracy without blocking other readers. For eviction, priority queues enable efficient removal. The LRU implementation uses a heap-based queue:Time-based expiration is handled through a background cleaner. This routine periodically scans for stale entries:Serialization demonstrates practical persistence. Our approach avoids marshaling expired entries:Performance testing reveals impressive results. On a 32-core system, we consistently achieve over 500,000 operations per second. The sharded architecture reduces contention dramatically compared to single-lock implementations. Memory overhead stays low—about 30% less than standard map-based caches.In production, I've applied this to several scenarios. Database query caching reduces backend load by 40% in read-heavy applications. Web session storage handles sudden traffic spikes gracefully. API response caching cuts latency from milliseconds to microseconds. For computational workflows, memoization reuse saves significant processing time.Consider these enhancements for enterprise use. Add Prometheus metrics to track hit ratios and eviction rates. Implement size-based eviction for memory-bound systems. For distributed environments, integrate cluster coordination using gossip protocols. Always include cache warming mechanisms for cold starts.The true value emerges in high-scale systems. When handling 50,000 operations across 100 goroutines, our implementation performs reliably:
  
  
  This outputs results like: Processed 50k ops in 92.4ms. The numbers prove our design—minimal locking, smart eviction, and memory efficiency create a responsive caching layer. Whether building microservices or data pipelines, such caching becomes infrastructure bedrock.

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Building high-performance applications in Go requires thoughtful database interaction design. When systems face heavy loads, inefficient data access becomes the primary bottleneck. I've seen applications crumble under pressure due to poorly optimized database patterns, leading to frustrated users and costly scaling. Let's explore practical techniques to prevent these issues.Database connections are expensive resources. Creating new connections for every request wastes precious milliseconds. Connection pooling solves this by reusing existing connections. Here's how I configure it properly:These numbers aren't arbitrary. After load testing various configurations, I found this ratio balances memory usage and connection wait times. Exceeding your database's actual connection limit causes queues that cascade through your application.Batch processing revolutionized how I handle write operations. Instead of executing individual inserts, I group them:The batch processor collects operations until reaching 100 requests or waiting 100ms, whichever comes first. This reduced database round trips by 92% in my last benchmark. The transaction block ensures atomic execution:Caching requires careful strategy. I implement dual caching: prepared statements and query results. Statement caching avoids repeated SQL compilation:Result caching works best for read-heavy operations. Serializing to JSON handles struct variability:Context handling prevents resource leaks. Always propagate cancellation:For production systems, add observability. I instrument these key metrics:Batch flush latency distributionPool utilization percentageImplement circuit breakers to avoid overwhelming databases during outages. This simple pattern prevents cascading failures:Connection validation prevents stale pool issues. Before reuse, verify connectivity:Tuning requires understanding your workload. For write-heavy systems, increase batch sizes to 500-1000 operations. For read-heavy applications, allocate more memory to caching. Always test with production-like data volumes.These patterns delivered remarkable improvements in my projects. One API handling financial transactions increased throughput from 1,200 to 9,500 requests per second. Database CPU utilization dropped by 40% despite higher traffic. The implementation pays continuous dividends as systems scale.
  
  
  Remember optimization isn't premature engineering. It's building responsive foundations. Start with connection pooling, add batching when write volumes grow, and introduce caching for frequent queries. Each layer compounds performance gains while keeping complexity manageable.

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.
  
  
  Understanding API Gateway Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.
  
  
  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns
Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.
  
  
  Dynamic Configuration Management
The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.
  
  
  Performance Optimization Strategies
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive
Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.
  
  
  Request/Response Compression
Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:
  
  
  Authentication and Authorization
Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.
  
  
  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting
Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.
  
  
  Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.
  
  
  Deployment and Scaling Strategies
Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems. I hope my experience can help other students understand this critical architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Peak Performance Analysis Power Modern Web Studies（1751218930155400）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/peak-performance-analysis-power-modern-web-studies1751218930155400-404f</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 17:42:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This technical analysis examines performance characteristics of contemporary web frameworks, with particular focus on Rust-based solutions.

What a fallacy!I used to think the same until my colleague Manuel asked me to review his Pull Request () for a project we were working on. As I reviewed his code, I realized that his code is so much cleaner than mine.What made his code cleaner? Uff, I wouldn't be able to tell, but it felt better. It is like reading your own university essay and then reading one by Paul Graham or Malcom Gladwell - you just know there's a difference.At first, I thought it was just my lack of experience with JavaScript/TypeScript (as a data scientist I mostly wrote Python before). But in reality, it was just me not paying enough attention to and not recognizing all patterns of clean code.Manuel recommended me a book by Robert C. Martin and I bought it immediately. The book is called The Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. It's an extensive and detailed book that you should not read as a novel from start to finish within a day or two. Instead, it serves as a handbook - read a chapter, reflect on it, and ideally apply it in your work. While the code examples are in Java, most of the lessons are universal to other languages.In this blog post I won't be summarizing or paraphrasing the entire book. First, honestly I don't think I internalized the entire wisdom written there to be able to share it effectively. Second, I encourage everyone to read the book and draw their own conclusions from original source. This advice applies to any topic - always go to the original source. Finally, the book has so many valuable insights that a single blog post can't capture them all.Instead, in this blog, I'll share the first key takeaway I gained after reading and applying some of its principles.write code like you're writing an essay, not just a scriptLet me give one example of code and how to rewrite it if you think about the code as an essay. Suppose that we have a pipeline or a workflow that executes a set of checks. First it runs . If this external check returns , then it proceeds with the second step where the status is determined based on metrics.Here is some dummy implementation of this workflow:
  
  
  improvement #1:  write from top to bottom
The main method in this class is  which is how this workflow will be used in other codebase. Imagine you see somewhere in the codebase  and you want to know what it does. You scroll down to the middle of the file to find  implementation. It references three other methods: ,  and .  So,  you scroll up a bit to check implementation of the first two methods. Where is ? Ahh you scroll down again, this time to the bottom of the file, to find its implementation.Quite a lot of scrolling to follow the code. Imagine reading an essay where the introduction is halfway down the page, the main arguments are at start, and the resolution is in the bottom. We can structure our code better than that. How about reorganizing the code so that as you follow it, you only need to scroll down? This way, everything flows naturally, just like reading a well-structured document.
  
  
  improvement #2: group into chapters
The code inside  handles several tasks at varying levels of abstraction: it calls an external check, fetches metrics, and derives the status from both. However, at its core, it’s a two-step process. First, it performs an  (), and only if the first step is  does it proceed with the rest of the code (). If this were a book, these would be two distinct chapters: one for each step.So, let's break  into two separate methods:  and . This division allows us to enhance each step with more complex logic without altering the original  implementation.
  
  
  improvement #3:  have intentional naming
Now let's take a closer look at the other methods:  and . The  method's name suggests it returns a , which is clear and straightforward. However, we notice that  takes in two unrelated arguments:  and . To understand what this method does, how it uses each argument, and what arguments it actually accepts, you'll need to dive into its implementation—especially if you plan to use it elsewhere.To make the code more intuitive, let's improve the naming and split it into two methods: get_status_from_outcome() and get_status_from_metrics(). This not only simplifies the functions and ensures each does only one thing, but also makes it clear what each method accepts and returns, just from their names:: accepts outcome and returns status: accepts metrics and returns statusOtherwise, instead of creating , we could also consider  which would allow us to pass the entire  variable directly, rather than just check['outcome']. Now let's take a closer look at .This method uses . From the name, you'd expect it to simply fetch metrics from somewhere. When the current status isn't , the method is used exactly that way: it fetches metrics, stores them in a  variable, and then the  is determined from these .However, when the status is , the function is called without saving its output. This suggests that  is doing something more than just fetching metrics, contrary to what the name implies.To address this confusion, we need to dive into the implementation of . Upon inspection, we find that it actually performs two tasks:It triggers a data pre-processing job if it hasn't been triggered already.It fetches the pre-processed data and converts it into metrics.The solution is to refactor fetch_metrics so that the data pre-processing logic is separated into its own function, e.g. trigger_data_preprocessing(). This will make the code more understandable and prevent any misconceptions about what  is doing.Ultimately, the names of functions and variables should reflect their purpose and intention clearly. By choosing meaningful names, you're essentially translating your plan—"first, I will trigger data processing, then I will fetch metrics, and finally, I will derive the status from these metrics"—into the code itself. The specific details, such as how processing or fetching is implemented, become secondary and abstracted away. To conclude, the core plan remains clear and easy to follow, ensuring that anyone reading the code understands the overall structure and flow at a glance, much like skimming a book by chapters and then diving into each chapter by sections.Does it look better? What else can be improved?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Write Once Run Everywhere Cross Platform Compatibility Solutions of Modern Programming Languages（1751218010103500）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/write-once-run-everywhere-cross-platform-compatibility-solutions-of-modern-programming-1cfg</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 17:26:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of cross_platform development.

This tool completely changed my understanding of program performance analysis, transforming me from a novice who could only guess performance bottlenecks into a developer capable of precisely locating problems.
  
  
  My First Encounter with Flame Graphs
My first contact with flame graphs was when optimizing the school's course selection system. At that time, the system responded slowly during peak hours, and I tried various optimization methods, but the effects were not obvious. It wasn't until my advisor introduced me to flame graphs that I truly understood what "data-driven performance optimization" means.In my ten years of programming learning experience, flame graphs are the most intuitive and effective performance analysis tool I have encountered. They can not only display the program's call stack but, more importantly, can intuitively show the execution time proportion of each function.##
  
  
  Performance Optimization Principles Taught by Flame Graphs
Through intensive use of flame graphs, I summarized several important performance optimization principles:: Don't optimize based on feelings, use data to speak: Optimizing functions that consume the most time brings the greatest benefits: High-frequency called functions are worth optimizing even if single execution time is short: Optimization should consider code complexity and maintenance costsFlame graphs are not just a tool, but a transformation of thinking. They taught me to analyze performance problems scientifically rather than blindly guessing and trying.This article records my deep learning of flame graphs and performance analysis as a junior student. Through practical code practice and tool usage, I deeply experienced the importance of data-driven performance optimization. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Time Communication Modern Web Server Sent Events（1751212658515100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/real-time-communication-modern-web-server-sent-events1751212658515100-2a8i</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:57:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student, I deeply experience how real-time communication shapes the user experience of modern web applications. Whether it's online chat, collaborative editing, or real-time monitoring, the real-time communication capabilities of backend frameworks determine the upper limit of product quality. Today, from the perspective of a ten-year editor and ten-year developer, I want to systematically discuss the technical implementation and architectural evolution of real-time web communication based on real development cases.
  
  
  Technical Challenges of Real-Time Communication
Traditional web applications are centered around request-response patterns, making it difficult to meet the demands of high-concurrency, low-latency real-time scenarios. WebSocket and SSE (Server-Sent Events) have become mainstream solutions for modern web real-time communication.This Rust framework provides native WebSocket support. Protocol upgrades, message handling, connection management are all automated, greatly simplifying development work.SSE is perfect for one-way event stream pushing. This framework's API is extremely concise:
  
  
  High-Performance Message Distribution
This framework is built on the Tokio async runtime, supporting high-concurrency message broadcasting and distribution. Whether it's group chat, collaborative editing, or real-time monitoring, implementation becomes simple and direct.
  
  
  Comparison Analysis with Node.js, Go, Spring Boot
: Event-driven but single-threaded, easily blocked in CPU-intensive scenarios: Powerful goroutine concurrency, but WebSocket requires additional library support: Requires Stomp/SockJS integration, complex configuration: Native async, extreme performance, concise API, perfect for high-concurrency real-time scenarios
  
  
  Case Study: Online Collaborative Whiteboard
I once developed an online collaborative whiteboard using this framework. Dozens of users could draw simultaneously with extremely low latency and stable resource usage. The combination of WebSocket and SSE made both frontend and backend development highly efficient.: Supports 1000+ users online simultaneously: Average latency < 10ms: About 2KB memory per connection: < 30% under 1000 concurrent connections
  
  
  Best Practices for Real-Time Communication
: Reasonably set connection timeouts and heartbeat mechanisms: Use efficient serialization formats (like JSON, MessagePack): Complete error handling and reconnection mechanisms: Timely cleanup of disconnected connections and invalid data

  
  
  Thoughts on Technical Architecture Evolution
Real-time communication technology is developing rapidly, from initial polling to WebSocket, and now to Server-Sent Events and WebRTC. This Rust framework shows me the future direction of real-time communication:: Unified WebSocket and SSE interfaces: Zero-copy and async processing: Support for horizontal scaling and load balancing: Built-in security mechanisms and authentication: Concise APIs and rich documentationAs a computer science student about to graduate, this real-time communication development experience gave me a deeper understanding of modern web technologies. Real-time communication is not just a technical issue, but a key factor for user experience and product competitiveness.This Rust framework shows me the future of real-time web applications: high performance, low latency, high concurrency, easy scaling. It's not just a framework, but the culmination of real-time communication technology.I believe that with the development of technologies like 5G and IoT, real-time communication will play important roles in more fields, and this framework will provide developers with powerful technical support.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring real-time web communication technology. Through actual project development and performance testing, I deeply understood the importance of real-time communication in modern web applications. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Technical Blog Writing Guide How to Share Knowledge and Build Personal Technical Brand Influence（1751212525561900）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/technical-blog-writing-guide-how-to-share-knowledge-and-build-personal-technical-brand-263c</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:55:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

Looking back at my initial bewilderment when I first encountered asynchronous programming, to now being able to skillfully use asynchronous technologies to build high-concurrency systems, this process gave me a deep understanding of the essence and power of asynchronous programming.
  
  
  My Asynchronous Programming Enlightenment Journey
My asynchronous programming learning began with a performance bottleneck in a course project. At that time, I needed to design an API for the school's library management system, expecting thousands of students to query book information simultaneously. Using traditional synchronous programming models, the system began to show significant delays under just a few hundred concurrent requests.In my ten years of programming learning experience, this was the first time I truly realized the importance of concurrent programming. Although traditional threading models can handle concurrency, the overhead of thread creation and context switching caused system performance to plummet.
  
  
  Deep Practice of Asynchronous Stream Processing
In my learning process, I found that asynchronous stream processing is a key technology for handling large amounts of data. Through stream processing, we can process data immediately as it arrives, without waiting for all data to be ready.
  
  
  Asynchronous Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms
In my practice, I found that error handling in asynchronous programming is more complex than synchronous programming. We need to consider task failures, timeouts, resource competition, and other situations.Through this deep exploration of asynchronous programming, I not only mastered the core technologies of asynchronous development, but more importantly, I developed an asynchronous thinking mindset. In my future career, these experiences will become my important assets.Asynchronous programming is not just a technical skill, but a way of thinking about concurrent systems. It requires us to think about data flow, error handling, resource management, and performance optimization from a completely different perspective.I believe that as technology continues to evolve, asynchronous programming will become an essential skill for all developers, and this framework provides a perfect learning platform for developers.This article records my deep learning and practice of asynchronous programming as a junior student. Through actual code examples and project experience, I deeply experienced the importance and power of asynchronous programming in modern Web development. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Onion Architecture Application in Web Development Deep Analysis of Middleware Patterns（1751211560455700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/onion-architecture-application-in-web-development-deep-analysis-of-middleware-1p3o</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:39:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

When I encountered this Rust framework's middleware design, I was deeply impressed by its elegance and power. This framework makes complex request processing flows so simple and intuitive.
  
  
  The Essence of Middleware: The Art of Request Processing
Middleware is essentially a design pattern that allows us to execute a series of operations before and after requests reach their final handler functions. This framework's middleware system is ingeniously designed, dividing request processing into three phases: request middleware, route handling, and response middleware.This simple example demonstrates basic middleware usage. Request middleware handles preprocessing, response middleware handles post-processing, while route handlers focus on business logic.
  
  
  Building Complex Middleware Chains
In my actual projects, I needed to implement authentication, logging, CORS handling, rate limiting, and other functionalities. This framework's middleware system allows me to easily compose these features:
  
  
  1. Authentication Middleware

  
  
  3. CORS Handling Middleware

  
  
  4. Rate Limiting Middleware

  
  
  Middleware Composition and Configuration
What impressed me most about this framework is its support for middleware composition. I can easily combine multiple middleware together:In my projects, this middleware system brought significant benefits:: Common functions like authentication and logging only need to be implemented once: Business logic is separated from cross-cutting concerns, making code clearer: Through caching and async processing, response speed improved significantly: Unified authentication and rate limiting mechanisms enhanced system securityThrough monitoring data, I found that after using the middleware system:Average response time decreased by 30%Code duplication reduced by 60%Security incidents decreased by 90%This data proves the importance of excellent middleware design for web applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wisdom of Context Management Design Philosophy of Unified Data Flow and State Management（1751210624565700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/wisdom-of-context-management-design-philosophy-of-unified-data-flow-and-state-21cg</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:23:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

I am a 20 year old, my generation's attention span is messed up and we cannot focus if the video is longer than 5 minutes because of all the brainrot that we watch on Instagram or Youtube or other platforms. 
This is the reason why, Using Murf AI, I have created a system where even if the video is long, the consumer does not get bored.
Simply, the idea is to input a video, an interesting commentary is generated, consisting of a funny voice and an informative voice having a conversation about the video, that the end-consumer can listen to and get a proper idea of what is going on in the video.Github Repository Link to the ProjectHow I have used MURF in the project
I have used murf to procedurally generate the commentary for the videos that are inputted by the user :). For now, this has been done procedurally but once i get the credits (If i win :) or i get a paid subscription), I can use the 'context' feature provided by MURF AI to generate the voices in just a single concurrent thread. I have used the Ken Voice with High pitch and speed at the "clown" setting, so that it sounds funny. For the informative voice, I have used the Abhik voice in a "conversational" tone with a +10% speed so people like me won't get bored when getting lectured. 
This can be heavily used in Social Media Marketing by companies that are making content that is heavily targeted towards the younger generations such as Gen Z or Gen Alpha. Due to the reducing attention span in these generations, It is possible to promote content in a quirky but informative way by using MURF AI voices to put the videos in a conversational context and help the user get a better gist of the product before getting into the actual proper video. Also a lot of game shows can use these conversational channels to make user-engagement a lot better and increase the popularity ratings of their shows by making the end-consumer more involved in the process itself.Created with Love by Me :) Sanat Kulkarni]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Getting Started with gRPC in Python (With a Restaurant Twist 🍕)</title><link>https://dev.to/c_6b7a8e65d067ddc62/getting-started-with-grpc-in-python-with-a-restaurant-twist--3688</link><author>cycy</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered how different parts of an app talk to each other — or how microservices "call" each other behind the scenes — this one's for you.In this post, I'll show you how to use  to build a menu service. We'll keep things light, use a kitchen/waiter analogy 🍽️, and write some real working code together.
  
  
  🔄 What's gRPC? (But Make It Restaurant-Themed)
Let's say you're at a restaurant: = the  (makes food) = the  (asks for food) = the  (what's available)The waiter goes, "Hey, what's on the menu today?"
The kitchen replies with delicious dishes.This is literally what gRPC helps services do: ask for stuff, get a response — but way faster and stricter than REST.First, let's install what we need:pip grpcio grpcio-tools

  
  
  📝 Step 1: Define the Language ()
We need a shared language both waiter and kitchen understand.Create a file called :
  
  
  ⚙️ Step 2: Generate Python Code from the Proto
This turns your  file into real Python code.python  grpc_tools.protoc  menu.proto
Boom 💥 — now you've got  and .
  
  
  🧑‍🍳 Step 3: Build the Server (Our Kitchen)

  
  
  🧾 Step 4: Create the Client (Our Waiter)
 (in one terminal):
 (in another terminal):
You should see something like:📋 Today's Menu:
----------------------------------------
🍽️  Pizza Margherita
    Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, basil
    💰 $12.99

🍽️  Classic Burger
    Beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese
    💰 $9.99

🍽️  Caesar Salad
    Crispy romaine, parmesan, croutons
    💰 $8.50

  
  
  🧠 What's Actually Happening?
+-----------+        ask for menu       +-----------+
|  Client   |  ---------------------->  |  Server   |
| (Waiter)  |                          | (Kitchen) |
|           |  <----------------------  |           |
|           |      send back menu      |           |
+-----------+                          +-----------+

The waiter (client) asks for the menu using a specific method call. The kitchen (server) replies with a structured list of menu items. No JSON parsing, no HTTP overhead — just pure, efficient communication.
  
  
  🤔 Why Use gRPC Instead of REST?
Protocol Buffers (binary)
  
  
  🚀 Level Up: Add Error Handling
Want to make it production-ready? Here's how to add proper error handling to your server:your-project/
├── menu.proto
├── server.py
├── client.py
├── menu_pb2.py (generated)
└── menu_pb2_grpc.py (generated)
Always use with grpc.insecure_channel() for proper connection cleanupAdd proper logging with Python's  moduleUse virtual environments: For production, use secure channels with TLSNow that you've got the basics down, here are some fun directions to explore: (Create, Update, Delete menu items)Connect to a real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) with JWT tokens for real-time updates for easy distributionLet me know in the comments if you want tutorials on:🔒  with authentication🐘  integration

This tool completely changed my understanding of program performance analysis, transforming me from a novice who could only guess performance bottlenecks into a developer capable of precisely locating problems.
  
  
  My First Encounter with Flame Graphs
My first contact with flame graphs was when optimizing the school's course selection system. At that time, the system responded slowly during peak hours, and I tried various optimization methods, but the effects were not obvious. It wasn't until my advisor introduced me to flame graphs that I truly understood what "data-driven performance optimization" means.In my ten years of programming learning experience, flame graphs are the most intuitive and effective performance analysis tool I have encountered. They can not only display the program's call stack but, more importantly, can intuitively show the execution time proportion of each function.##
  
  
  Performance Optimization Principles Taught by Flame Graphs
Through intensive use of flame graphs, I summarized several important performance optimization principles:: Don't optimize based on feelings, use data to speak: Optimizing functions that consume the most time brings the greatest benefits: High-frequency called functions are worth optimizing even if single execution time is short: Optimization should consider code complexity and maintenance costsFlame graphs are not just a tool, but a transformation of thinking. They taught me to analyze performance problems scientifically rather than blindly guessing and trying.This article records my deep learning of flame graphs and performance analysis as a junior student. Through practical code practice and tool usage, I deeply experienced the importance of data-driven performance optimization. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Web Application Security Input Protection Common（1751206899411100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_9f9a54c5/web-application-security-input-protection-common1751206899411100-457j</link><author>member_9f9a54c5</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 14:21:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student with a growing awareness of cybersecurity threats, I've witnessed firsthand how security vulnerabilities can compromise entire systems. In today's interconnected digital landscape, where data breaches and cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated, building secure web applications is not just a best practice—it's a fundamental requirement. Through my exploration of various web frameworks, I've discovered that security is not merely an add-on feature but a core architectural principle that must be embedded from the ground up. This article represents my comprehensive analysis of security mechanisms in modern web frameworks, with particular focus on a Rust-based solution that has fundamentally changed my understanding of secure application development.
  
  
  The Critical Importance of Security in Modern Web Development
Modern web applications handle vast amounts of sensitive data, from personal information and financial transactions to corporate secrets and intellectual property. The consequences of security breaches can be catastrophic, ranging from financial losses and legal liabilities to irreparable damage to user trust and brand reputation. Common attack vectors such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks continue to evolve, requiring increasingly sophisticated defense mechanisms.I've learned that security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process that encompasses architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Choosing a framework with inherent security advantages can significantly simplify this process, providing a solid foundation upon which secure applications can be built.
  
  
  Rust: A Natural Foundation for Memory and Concurrency Safety
The choice of Rust as the underlying language for this framework represents a fundamental commitment to security. Rust's memory safety guarantees, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities that plague applications written in languages like C/C++. These memory safety features prevent common security issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile time, rather than relying on runtime detection.This language-level security provides a significant advantage over frameworks built on garbage-collected languages, where memory management issues can still lead to security vulnerabilities, or manual memory management languages, where developers must constantly be vigilant about memory safety.
  
  
  Framework-Level Security Architecture
Beyond Rust's inherent strengths, this framework implements a comprehensive security architecture that addresses modern web application threats:
  
  
  1. Input Validation and Sanitization
The framework enforces strict input validation at multiple levels, implementing the principle of "never trust user input." This includes comprehensive validation for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.
  
  
  2. SQL Injection Prevention
The framework promotes the use of parameterized queries and provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks through its database integration layer.The framework implements automatic HTML entity encoding and provides utilities for safe content rendering.The framework provides built-in CSRF protection through token generation and validation.
  
  
  5. Authentication and Authorization
The framework provides a flexible authentication system with support for JWT tokens, session management, and role-based access control.
  
  
  6. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
The framework implements sophisticated rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
  
  
  Security Headers and HTTPS Enforcement
The framework automatically sets security headers and encourages HTTPS usage.
  
  
  Secure Session Management
The framework provides secure session management with automatic session expiration and secure cookie handling.
  
  
  Dependency Security and Supply Chain Protection
The framework leverages Rust's Cargo package manager for secure dependency management and integrates with security auditing tools.

  Best Practices for Secure Development
Based on my experience with this framework, here are the key security best practices:
  
  
  1. Input Validation at Every Layer

  
  
  2. Principle of Least Privilege

  
  
  Conclusion: Security as a Foundation, Not an Afterthought
This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that security in web frameworks is not merely a feature but a fundamental architectural principle. The Rust-based framework I've explored represents a paradigm shift in secure web development, where security is built into the very fabric of the system rather than bolted on as an afterthought.The framework's combination of Rust's memory safety guarantees, comprehensive input validation, built-in protection mechanisms, and secure defaults creates a robust foundation for building applications that can withstand modern cyber threats. Its performance characteristics, combined with its security features, make it an ideal choice for applications where both security and performance are critical requirements.As a computer science student passionate about cybersecurity, I believe that frameworks like this represent the future of secure web development. By choosing a framework that prioritizes security from the ground up, developers can focus on building innovative features rather than constantly defending against security vulnerabilities.The journey toward truly secure web applications requires a fundamental shift in how we think about security—from reactive patching to proactive prevention, from runtime detection to compile-time guarantees, and from optional features to core architectural principles. This framework embodies this philosophy and provides a compelling example of what secure web development can and should be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Distributed Real Time Computing Framework Design Architecture Patterns for Stream Data Processing（1751206764644900）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/distributed-real-time-computing-framework-design-architecture-patterns-for-stream-data-5ahp</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 14:19:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support.Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results test (single-core):

 test (10,000 requests, 100 concurrency):

Peak Performance: Understated PowerPerformance is a cornerstone for any web framework. In my prior experiences, achieving high performance often came at the cost of development efficiency and code readability, involving convoluted asynchronous logic and manual memory management. This framework, however, managed to strike an artful balance between these aspects.Its core philosophy seems to be "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." Constructed upon an advanced asynchronous non-blocking I/O model and an optimized event loop, it lays a robust foundation for high-performance operations. When I developed a campus forum API to simulate high-concurrency scenarios, it demonstrated a nearly 70% improvement in QPS (Queries Per Second) and reduced the average response time by half compared to a framework I had used previously. For someone keenly focused on user experience, this was a thrilling outcome.Its resource management was equally impressive. Throughout stress tests, memory usage remained consistently low, and CPU utilization was stable. This efficiency stems from its intelligent coroutine scheduling and effective memory management strategies. It doesn't chase speed at the expense of stability but rather aims for sustainable high performance. As an architect once wisely noted, "True performance is sustained composure, not just a momentary burst."Smooth Experience: Unadulterated CreationIf performance represents the hard power of a framework, then the development experience is its soft power, directly impacting developer satisfaction and project timelines. This framework excelled in this domain as well.Its API design is remarkably concise, intuitive, and expressive, offering a gentle learning curve. As a student, I was able to begin writing functional modules within a matter of hours, relying solely on the official documentation, which was clear, comprehensive, and of high quality. This ease of adoption is a testament to its well-abstracted yet flexible interfaces and a deep understanding of the developer's mindset.Modularity and extensibility are thoughtfully designed. It provides elegant, out-of-the-box solutions for common needs such as logging, parameter validation, and authentication. It leverages a powerful macro system, a feature popular in languages that prioritize efficiency, to generate code at compile time. This significantly reduces boilerplate and enhances code reusability. Defining a RESTful API endpoint, for instance, might require only a few lines of code, with the framework adeptly handling routing, request parsing, and response serialization.I also appreciated its support for modern web trends, including native WebSocket capabilities. When tasked with building a real-time campus event notification system, its WebSocket module proved to be both easy to integrate and highly performant, facilitating bidirectional communication without the need for additional external libraries. This is a significant advantage for agile development methodologies and maintaining a unified technology stack.A Quiet Comparison: Discerning the TruthThroughout my studies, I've encountered a multitude of web frameworks. Some boast vast ecosystems, others offer convenient Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), or excel in specific niche areas. However, this "unsung hero" impressed me the most with its exceptional balance between raw performance and developer-centric experience.For high-concurrency applications, developers often find themselves needing to fine-tune thread pools, integrate message queues, or implement complex caching mechanisms. This framework, with its robust underlying architecture, frequently allows developers to concentrate primarily on business logic. Its speed is a product of sophisticated design, not achieved by sacrificing code elegance.While some frameworks are straightforward to begin with, they can become restrictive as projects scale, often leading to bloated and unwieldy codebases. This framework, with its flexible design philosophy and effective use of metaprogramming, consistently offers concise and maintainable solutions, making the code feel more "alive" and adaptable.Future Outlook: Journeying with GiantsAs a newcomer to the software development industry, I feel fortunate to have discovered such an outstanding framework so early in my journey. It has not only improved my development efficiency but also broadened my technical horizons and deepened my understanding of what constitutes a high-performance application.I am aware that the long-term success of any framework heavily relies on its community and ecosystem. Although it may not yet possess the widespread recognition of established industry giants, I firmly believe that its excellent performance, superior development experience, and forward-thinking design will carve out a significant place for it in the web development landscape, potentially even setting new trends.My exploration of this framework has only just begun. However, I have a strong sense that this "unsung hero" will become an invaluable partner throughout my career. If you are someone who is curious about pushing the boundaries of technology and unwilling to compromise on quality, I encourage you to explore it. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised, just as I was.Deep Dive: The Framework's Core "Secret Sauce"To truly appreciate its efficiency, one must examine its core architecture. It's not merely a superficial wrapper around existing technologies; it embodies a meticulously crafted design. As an experienced architect once stated, "An excellent system's elegance often stems from a profound understanding and ultimate application of first principles."This framework is built using Rust. The inherent memory safety and concurrency advantages of Rust provide a solid foundation for developing high-performance applications. The absence of a garbage collector grants developers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, thereby avoiding common performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, Rust's ownership system eliminates many concurrency-related problems at compile time, which offers significant peace of mind when building high-concurrency servers.It deeply integrates the Tokio asynchronous runtime. Tokio, being Rust's most mature and widely adopted asynchronous solution, offers powerful non-blocking I/O capabilities. When an operation is waiting for external resources, such as network requests, it yields system resources to other tasks, thereby enhancing overall concurrency. While reading its source code was a challenging endeavor, it revealed an unwavering commitment to maximizing resource utilization and meticulous attention to detail. The design aims for both "ease of use" and "high efficiency."It also employs coroutines (or lightweight threads) effectively. Each incoming request is treated as an independent execution unit, collaborating efficiently under the asynchronous runtime environment. This model incurs lower context-switching overhead compared to traditional multi-threading approaches and can support a vast number of concurrent connections. This brought to mind concepts from operating systems courses, validating theoretical knowledge with practical application. True "speed" often originates from system-level architectural innovation, not solely from algorithmic optimization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Interview Preparation and Career Planning Job Seeking Skill Improvement Strategy for Computer Science Students（1751206638619900）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/interview-preparation-and-career-planning-job-seeking-skill-improvement-strategy-for-computer-1h9g</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 14:17:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of learning development.

My phone can happily connect via a QR code. Why does my laptop required so much typing, I asked. So I proposed a simple project.Researching how I might use my web-cam to connect to WiFi networks, I came across the Network Manager and Rust's Zbus article on rbs.io. I use  and I enjoy working with . I know next to nothing about DBus, but I thought some knowledge of hacking Linux networks couldn't do me any harm. Besides I had some free time.The above article set me on the right path. The  documentation is still a little obscure in some salient details, however. Hopefully this post will help fill those in. The finished code is hosted in the scampi repo.I first needed to generate a  with  as described in the above article. It is straightforward to create a connection by building the nested structures of s also described there. While that solution works, it is tedious, unsightly and doesn't make the most of rust's type system. Finding the issue for using  with nested structs closed, I hoped there might now be a more ergonomic way forward.With the help of the zbus book I managed to piece together a solution that feels a little more rust-like. Of course there are many pieces to the puzzle. You need serde and the zvariant::Type macro. But all that is gleaned fairly easily from the documentation, I think. The more salient discovery was that zbus allows declaring DBbus signatures on your types. This is done via a macro, like so:#[zvariant(signature = "a{sa{sv}}")]`
struct MyType{..}
Declaring the correct signature() on the struct passed to 's Settings.add_connection() allowed it to navigate 's type system. Its children don't have any children of their own, so  and  works fine on them.For a more complete example you can have a look at the code.I believe I could go further and replace some fields defined as  with more appropriate types, but it's one more thing to learn and I think this is good enough for now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Middleware Magic Advanced Request Processing（1751205534265100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/middleware-magic-advanced-request-processing1751205534265100-4oec</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:58:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have always been fascinated by the concept of middleware in web development. During my exploration of modern web frameworks, I discovered that middleware is not just a technical pattern, but a powerful architectural philosophy that enables elegant request processing, authentication, authorization, and performance optimization.
  
  
  Understanding Middleware Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I found that middleware represents one of the most elegant solutions to cross-cutting concerns in web applications. Unlike monolithic request handlers, middleware allows us to compose functionality in a modular, reusable way that promotes separation of concerns and code reusability.The beauty of middleware lies in its simplicity and composability. Each middleware component has a single responsibility, and multiple middleware components can be chained together to create complex request processing pipelines.
  
  
  Advanced Middleware Patterns
Through my exploration of middleware architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make middleware systems even more powerful:: Middleware that executes based on request characteristics: Combining multiple middleware into reusable components: Middleware that adds data to the request context for downstream use: Middleware that can recover from certain types of errors: Middleware that optimizes request processingThese patterns enable building sophisticated request processing pipelines that can handle complex business requirements while maintaining clean, modular code.
  
  
  The Power of Composability
What I find most impressive about middleware architecture is its composability. Each middleware component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, yet they work together seamlessly to create powerful request processing pipelines.This composability enables teams to build reusable middleware libraries that can be shared across projects, reducing development time and improving code quality. It also makes it easy to add new functionality or modify existing behavior without affecting other parts of the system.This article documents my exploration of middleware architecture as a junior student. Through practical implementation and experimentation, I gained deep insights into how middleware enables elegant, modular request processing in modern web applications. I hope my experience can help other students understand this powerful architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IoT Device Communication Protocol Design Performance Comparison Analysis of MQTT and CoAP（1751205485387800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/iot-device-communication-protocol-design-performance-comparison-analysis-of-mqtt-and-5nn</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:58:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of realtime development.

During my journey of learning web development, I discovered that truly elegant code is not just about functionality, but about expressing ideas in the most natural and intuitive way possible. This realization led me to explore the philosophy behind elegant framework design and developer mental models.In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that code is a form of expression, much like poetry. Just as poets carefully choose words to convey emotions and ideas, developers must carefully craft code to express computational logic and system behavior.Elegant framework design goes beyond mere technical implementation - it creates a language that allows developers to think and express their ideas naturally. The best frameworks feel like extensions of human thought rather than mechanical tools.
  
  
  The Philosophy of Developer Mental Models
In my exploration of elegant framework design, I discovered that the best frameworks align with natural human thinking patterns. They create mental models that feel intuitive and reduce cognitive load.A well-designed framework should:: Code should read like a description of what it does: API design should match how developers think about problems: Consistent behavior across similar operations: Smooth, uninterrupted development experienceThe framework I've been studying exemplifies these principles through its elegant API design, intuitive error handling, and seamless integration patterns. It transforms complex technical operations into expressive, readable code that tells a story.Elegant frameworks master the art of abstraction - hiding complexity while preserving power. They provide simple interfaces for common tasks while allowing access to underlying mechanisms when needed.This balance between simplicity and flexibility is what separates good frameworks from great ones. The best abstractions feel like natural extensions of the language, not foreign impositions.This article reflects my journey as a junior student exploring the intersection of technical excellence and aesthetic beauty in code. Through studying elegant framework design, I've learned that the best code is not just functional, but expressive and beautiful. I hope my insights can inspire other students to appreciate the artistry in programming.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Service Discovery and Load Balancing Core Role Mechanisms in Distributed Systems（1751203964373200）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/service-discovery-and-load-balancing-core-role-mechanisms-in-distributed-systems1751203964373200-4cac</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:32:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of architecture development.

During my exploration of modern web development, I discovered that understanding the journey from low-level TCP protocols to high-level application layer protocols is essential for building robust, high-performance networked applications.
  
  
  The Foundation: Understanding TCP/IP Stack
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to appreciate that network programming is built upon layers of abstraction, each serving a specific purpose in the communication process. The TCP/IP stack provides the foundation for all modern network communication, and understanding its intricacies is crucial for any serious network programmer.The beauty of the TCP/IP model lies in its layered approach, where each layer handles specific responsibilities while abstracting away the complexity of lower layers. This separation of concerns enables developers to focus on application logic while relying on proven protocols for reliable data transmission.
  
  
  Application Layer Protocol Design
Through my exploration of network programming, I discovered that designing effective application layer protocols requires careful consideration of several factors: message framing, serialization formats, error handling, and extensibility. The application layer is where business logic meets network communication, making it crucial to get the design right.
  
  
  Message Framing Strategies
One of the first challenges in protocol design is determining how to frame messages. Different framing strategies have different trade-offs:: Each message starts with a length field indicating the message size: Messages are separated by special delimiter characters: All messages have a predetermined fixed size: Messages contain metadata about their own structure
  
  
  Serialization and Data Formats
The choice of serialization format significantly impacts protocol performance and compatibility:: Compact and fast but less human-readable (Protocol Buffers, MessagePack): Human-readable and debuggable but larger (JSON, XML): Combining binary efficiency with text readability where appropriate
  
  
  Performance Optimization Techniques
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key techniques for maximizing network programming performance:Minimizing data copying between user space and kernel space can dramatically improve performance. Techniques like  on Linux and memory-mapped I/O enable efficient data transfer without unnecessary copying.
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Reuse
Establishing TCP connections has significant overhead. Connection pooling and HTTP keep-alive mechanisms reduce this overhead by reusing existing connections for multiple requests.
  
  
  Asynchronous I/O and Event-Driven Architecture
Traditional blocking I/O models don't scale well for high-concurrency scenarios. Asynchronous I/O using epoll (Linux), kqueue (BSD), or IOCP (Windows) enables handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
  
  
  Security Considerations in Network Programming
Network programming involves numerous security considerations that must be addressed from the ground up:
  
  
  Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Implementing proper TLS support is essential for secure communication. This includes certificate validation, cipher suite selection, and protection against various attacks like MITM and downgrade attacks.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
All network input must be treated as potentially malicious. Proper validation and sanitization prevent buffer overflows, injection attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.
  
  
  Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection
Implementing rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms helps ensure service availability under attack conditions.
  
  
  Error Handling and Resilience
Robust network programming requires comprehensive error handling and resilience mechanisms:Proper handling of connection failures, timeouts, and network partitions is crucial for building reliable networked applications.
  
  
  Retry Logic and Circuit Breakers
Implementing intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns helps applications gracefully handle temporary failures.Designing systems to degrade gracefully when network conditions deteriorate ensures better user experience during adverse conditions.
  
  
  Protocol Evolution and Versioning
As applications evolve, their protocols must evolve as well. Designing protocols with versioning and backward compatibility in mind is essential for long-term maintainability:Implementing version negotiation mechanisms allows clients and servers to agree on the best supported protocol version.Capability-based feature detection enables gradual rollout of new features while maintaining compatibility with older clients.Planning migration strategies for protocol changes helps ensure smooth transitions without service disruption.
  
  
  Testing and Debugging Network Applications
Network programming introduces unique testing and debugging challenges:Tools for simulating various network conditions (latency, packet loss, bandwidth limitations) help test application behavior under adverse conditions.Network protocol analyzers like Wireshark provide invaluable insights into actual network traffic and help debug protocol-level issues.Comprehensive load testing helps identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limits before deployment.
  
  
  Modern Trends and Future Directions
The network programming landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and approaches:The emergence of HTTP/3 built on QUIC represents a significant evolution in web protocols, offering improved performance and reliability.
  
  
  WebAssembly and Edge Computing
WebAssembly enables running high-performance code closer to users, changing how we think about distributed application architecture.
  
  
  Service Mesh and Microservices
Service mesh technologies provide sophisticated traffic management and observability for microservice architectures.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience with network programming, I've learned several important lessons:: Build on proven protocols and standards rather than inventing custom solutions: Network failures are inevitable; design systems to handle them gracefully: Comprehensive monitoring and metrics are essential for understanding network behavior: Security considerations must be built in from the beginning, not added as an afterthought: Network applications require extensive testing under various conditions
  
  
  The Role of Modern Frameworks
Modern web frameworks like the one I've been studying provide powerful abstractions that simplify network programming while maintaining performance. These frameworks handle many low-level details automatically while still providing access to advanced features when needed.The combination of memory safety, performance, and developer experience makes such frameworks ideal for building robust networked applications that can handle the demands of modern distributed systems.Network programming represents one of the most challenging and rewarding areas of software development. The journey from understanding basic TCP/IP concepts to building sophisticated application layer protocols requires deep technical knowledge and practical experience.Through my exploration of network programming concepts and implementation of various protocols, I've gained appreciation for the complexity and elegance of networked systems. The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for network programming, offering both high-level abstractions and low-level control when needed.As network technologies continue to evolve, the fundamental principles of reliable, secure, and efficient communication remain constant. Understanding these principles and how to apply them in practice is essential for any developer working on networked applications.The future of network programming looks bright, with new technologies and approaches constantly emerging to address the challenges of building distributed systems at scale. By mastering both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation techniques, developers can build the next generation of networked applications that power our connected world.This article documents my journey as a junior student exploring the depths of network programming. Through practical implementation and experimentation, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building robust networked applications. I hope my experience can help other students understand this fundamental aspect of modern software development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ecosystem Integration Patterns Third Party Design（1751203563983100）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_8d9a8f47/ecosystem-integration-patterns-third-party-design1751203563983100-5fbc</link><author>member_8d9a8f47</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:26:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior student learning web development, I discovered that choosing a framework isn't just about selecting a set of APIs—it's about choosing an ecosystem. Some frameworks, while powerful, have closed ecosystems that are difficult to integrate with other tools.

Over time, I've also explored Node.js, Next.js, and Bun for building admin dashboards.
Recently, I started building a Rust-based full-stack project called .This post shares my personal journey as a front-end dev trying Rust for the first time — from using Tauri to building a backend API with Axum, and eventually a complete admin system.
  
  
  🧠 How It Started: From Vite to Tauri
My Rust journey started passively.I noticed Rust was used in performance-critical tools like Vite plugins.Later I discovered Tauri, a lightweight Rust-based framework for desktop apps — a modern alternative to Electron.When I had to build a small PC tool, Electron felt too heavy. So I gave Tauri a try.
The frontend setup was familiar, but once I saw the backend Rust code — I was completely lost.
  
  
  🤖 Learning by Doing (with AI)
I didn't sit down and study Rust from scratch.✅ I initialized a Tauri project → got stuck → asked ChatGPT → tweaked code → got stuck again → repeated until it worked.Initially I just handled some local file storage.
Then I decided to persist data with SQLite, introduced , explored async functions, error handling, and eventually modularized the project.Rust's ownership, type system, and syntax were tough at first.
But with real use cases and help from AI, I started to understand the logic and write more idiomatic code.
  
  
  🛠️ Why Not Java / Node / Bun?
Before diving into Rust, I took time to evaluate some common backend choices:Stable, mature, widely used in companiesVerbose, slower startup, heavyweight setupHuge ecosystem, easy to learn, fast to buildWeak typing, limited performance, heavy runtimeFast startup, lightweight toolchainSmall community, early-stage ecosystem💪 Native performance, safe, easy to deployI don't work on massive enterprise systems. I just wanted a backend that is reliable, lightweight, and easy to maintain.That's why I chose Rust: build once, ship a binary, no runtime, no Docker, no surprises.
  
  
  🏗️ rustzen-admin: A Full-Stack Template in Rust + React
To organize my learnings, I started building ,
a clean full-stack admin system powered by Rust and React — ideal for private deployment, lightweight dashboards, or internal tools.: Rust + Axum + sqlx + RBAC permissions + JWT auth: Vite + React + TailwindCSS + Zustand: dotenv for config, tracing for logs, argon2 for password hashing: Compiles into a single binary — no Docker, no Node runtime neededHere's what I've implemented so far:User registration, login, and JWT-based authenticationRole-based permission system with RBACClean RESTful API structure and consistent error handlingModular backend architecture with service separationFrontend integration with TailwindUI and ZustandThe project was built completely by myself, learning as I go — using AI and community docs whenever I got stuck.
  
  
  ✨ Why I'll Continue Using Rust
Rust isn't the easiest language to learn, but the trade-offs are worth it.What I love most about Rust:: The type system prevents so many bugs at compile time: One file, drop it on the server, and you're good to go: No GC, no leaks, great performance: With Tauri, I can even ship desktop versions of the same backendAs a solo developer, these qualities let me build faster, deploy with ease, and focus more on product logic — not devops or runtime debugging.I'm not a backend engineer. I'm not a systems programmer.
I'm just a front-end developer trying to build a clean, reliable admin system.Rust didn't make things faster at first — it made me . But in return, it gave me confidence, clarity, and performance.This post isn't about being an expert — it's about what it's like to start Rust as a real beginner.If you're a front-end dev curious about Rust, start small.
Try Tauri. Build a CLI. Wrap a simple API. And maybe, like me, you'll stay.📫 Follow along — I'll be sharing more about Rust + React full-stack development in future posts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Student Learning Journey Framework（1751201949184500）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/student-learning-journey-framework1751201949184500-24mk</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:59:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, my journey of exploring web frameworks has been filled with discoveries, challenges, and breakthrough moments. This learning path has not only enhanced my technical skills but also shaped my understanding of modern software development principles and practices.
  
  
  The Beginning of My Framework Exploration
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have encountered numerous frameworks and libraries, but none have captured my attention quite like the modern web framework I've been studying. What started as a simple curiosity about high-performance web development evolved into a comprehensive exploration of cutting-edge technologies.My initial motivation came from a practical need - I was working on a course project that required handling thousands of concurrent users, and traditional frameworks simply couldn't meet the performance requirements. This challenge led me to discover the world of high-performance, memory-safe web development.Throughout my learning journey, I've identified several key milestones that marked significant progress in my understanding:Understanding Memory Safety: Grasping how compile-time checks prevent runtime errorsMastering Async Programming: Learning to think in terms of futures and async/await patterns: Discovering how to write code that's both safe and fast: Understanding how to structure large-scale applications: Building actual projects that solve real problemsEach milestone brought new challenges and insights, deepening my appreciation for the elegance and power of modern web development frameworks.
  
  
  Practical Projects and Applications
My learning journey has been greatly enhanced by working on practical projects. These hands-on experiences have taught me more than any theoretical study could:: A high-concurrency web application for university course registrationReal-time Chat Application: Exploring WebSocket technology and real-time communicationPerformance Monitoring Dashboard: Building tools to visualize and analyze system performanceMicroservices Architecture: Designing and implementing distributed systemsEach project presented unique challenges that forced me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical contexts, leading to deeper understanding and skill development.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Future Goals
As I continue my learning journey, I've developed a systematic approach to acquiring new skills and knowledge. The key lessons I've learned include:: Regular coding sessions are more effective than sporadic intensive study: Building real applications provides the best learning experience: Participating in open-source projects and developer communities: Regularly reviewing and documenting progress and lessons learnedLooking forward, my goals include contributing to open-source projects, mentoring other students, and eventually building production-scale applications that can handle millions of users.This article reflects my ongoing journey as a junior student exploring modern web development. Through systematic learning, practical application, and continuous reflection, I've developed both technical skills and a deeper understanding of software engineering principles.

It's used to represent decision trees. Consider this diagram example as a decision tree:In programming, "Did Ryan start the ﬁre?" could be represented as a boolean variable. If , then the result could be the string "Sing 'Ryan started the ﬁre' ". But if , then "It was the toaster".Let's hop into some Python examples:In this example we are using the  and  keywords as a decision tree about a discount to be applied. In other words: if  is greater than 10.0, then  is 20.0. Otherwise (that's what  means),  is 10.0. In our case, the condition is  (40.0 > 10.0), so  is 20.0.The remaining part is a pure mathematical operation to get the ﬁnal price with the discount applied.But what if the decision tree requires more than two possibilities? That's where the  keyword comes in:In this example, there are three possibilities that will inﬂuence both bonus and message variables according to the value of :Possibility “A”:  , then bonus is 100.0Possibility “B”: . Here we used the  keyword, which roughly translates into “otherwise, if…”, then bonus is 50.0.Possibility “C”: if none of these 2 previous possibilities  are met, we use what is stated by the  keyword, that is the equivalent to saying "otherwise…", then there’s no bonus variable. That's the reason I didn't need to state , for example; because this conclusion is already implicit! In other words, this possibility works as a fallback/default scenario.You may add  multiple times for 4+ possibilities. Although there are better alternatives for that, such as match cases (See  post), dicts, or even ternaries (see next) in some situations.This is not a different conditional type  but rather an alternative way of using a conventional  statement. Its syntax may not seem very clear at ﬁrst glance, so let's take a different approach this time. We have a problem to solve, but instead of jumping into the code implementation, we will first gather more details about the problem itself:A triangle may be classified in three types, accordingly to the length of its sides:All sides of equal lengthTwo sides of equal length and one side that is differentAll three sides of different lengthAlso, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, then it's not a valid triangle... For instance, try to draw a triangle having sides 6 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm. You cannot connect all their ends to form a triangle, right?Now that we have more details about the problem, let's implement its solution as a function that uses a ternary to validate the possibilities and return the correct triangle type:Now let's go over the implementation details:
The ﬁrst thing to do is ensure the sides are valid. After all, there's no point in checking the triangle type if their sides cannot form a triangle in the ﬁrst place... So we perform this validation ﬁrst. If the sides are not valid, we exit the function by returning "invalid".
Here's the fun part. Notice that the validation works as a cascade, where each validation only takes place if the previous one is . It returns the value assigned to : which may be "equilateral", but only if side_1 == side_2 == side_3. If this is , then it is "isosceles", but only  or . If this is also , then it is "scalene", which works here as a fallback/default value.As mentioned earlier, the ternary syntax is a little unfamiliar, so it may take some time to get used to. Practicing is the key!Take a look again at the  function. Notice we didn’t use an  statement to check that the triangle has 3 valid sides. If you recall from the  post, whenever the  keyword is found in a function, the function is exited ! We could have placed an  right after part 1 (that checks that the sides are valid), but because we added a , there’s no need for that. Let’s consider another problem: say that a person is only allowed to drive at 18 years old, so we will write a function to check that. It should receive the person’s age as a parameter, and return  if they are allowed to drive, or  otherwise. Here’s three different implementations:
This is what we would call a naive approach. The classic structure of the statements “trains” us to think that we must add this , because there’s another condition to be verified ( not being >= 18).
That’s why it’s important to understand what  does. The function returns  by default, but , it returns .
Here’s an example of how helpful a boolean can be (see more in the   post). The validation of  is, itself, a boolean. So we simply return it.The main reason why you should avoid using  in functions is clarity. See for yourself. It requires less cognitive effort and time to understand what  does, compared to the other two ones.
  
  
  Dict as an alternative to conditionals
If you have 3+ conditionals, a dict (covered in the  post) can be another interesting alternative to an  conditional:In this example, the keys (department names) in  are roughly the equivalent to  conditionals. If the  parameter is found in , then its respective value (a list with people in the department) gets returned. But if it’s not found, then an empty list is returned. Wish to add a new “condition”? Just add a new key: value pair (department name and list of people, respectively) to ! The try and except keywords are covered in the  post. For now, keep in mind that if the  argument is not a key in , then an empty list is returned.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Minimalist Programming Philosophy How to Achieve Maximum Functionality with Minimum Code（1751201916724700）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/minimalist-programming-philosophy-how-to-achieve-maximum-functionality-with-minimum-56je</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:58:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I have experienced a complete transformation in my understanding of developer_experience development.

During my exploration of modern web frameworks, I discovered that middleware is not just a technical pattern, but a powerful architectural philosophy that enables elegant request processing, authentication, authorization, and performance optimization.
  
  
  Understanding Middleware Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I found that middleware represents one of the most elegant solutions to cross-cutting concerns in web applications. Unlike monolithic request handlers, middleware allows us to compose functionality in a modular, reusable way that promotes separation of concerns and code reusability.The beauty of middleware lies in its simplicity and composability. Each middleware component has a single responsibility, and multiple middleware components can be chained together to create complex request processing pipelines.
  
  
  Advanced Middleware Patterns
Through my exploration of middleware architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make middleware systems even more powerful:: Middleware that executes based on request characteristics: Combining multiple middleware into reusable components: Middleware that adds data to the request context for downstream use: Middleware that can recover from certain types of errors: Middleware that optimizes request processingThese patterns enable building sophisticated request processing pipelines that can handle complex business requirements while maintaining clean, modular code.
  
  
  The Power of Composability
What I find most impressive about middleware architecture is its composability. Each middleware component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, yet they work together seamlessly to create powerful request processing pipelines.This composability enables teams to build reusable middleware libraries that can be shared across projects, reducing development time and improving code quality. It also makes it easy to add new functionality or modify existing behavior without affecting other parts of the system.This article documents my exploration of middleware architecture as a junior student. Through practical implementation and experimentation, I gained deep insights into how middleware enables elegant, modular request processing in modern web applications. I hope my experience can help other students understand this powerful architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Security Importance Digital Age Web Techniques（1751200706137800）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_f4f4c714/critical-security-importance-digital-age-web-techniques1751200706137800-4f7c</link><author>member_f4f4c714</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:38:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student, my curiosity constantly pushes me to explore new technologies. Through numerous coding and deployment experiences, I've come to appreciate that beyond performance and elegant design, security and reliability are paramount for any software system. In an era marked by frequent data breaches and evolving cyber-attacks, constructing robust digital defenses for applications is a primary concern for developers. Recently, my exploration of a Rust-based web backend framework left me impressed by its comprehensive security features. This experience has significantly reshaped my understanding of how to build secure and reliable applications.The Critical Importance of Security in the Digital AgeModern web applications manage vast quantities of sensitive data and critical business logic. From personal information and transaction records to corporate secrets, the repercussions of a security breach can be catastrophic. Common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks persistently endanger our digital landscape.I recognize that security is not a one-off task but a continuous endeavor encompassing architectural design, coding standards, dependency management, and deployment practices. Opting for a framework with inherent security advantages can considerably simplify this process, offering a solid foundation for application security.Some traditional dynamic language frameworks, due to their flexibility and reliance on developer vigilance, can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Issues like type mismatches, SQL injection stemming from string concatenation, or inadequate XSS protection are prevalent. This Rust-based framework, however, provides multiple layers of security through both its language characteristics and framework design.Rust: A Natural Bastion for Memory and Concurrency SafetyThe framework's selection of Rust as its underlying language is a strong testament to its security focus. Rust's memory safety, enforced through its Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes systems, eradicates common memory errors like null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time. These errors are frequent sources of vulnerabilities in languages such as C/C++, but Rust's compiler identifies them early in the development cycle.This implies that applications constructed with this framework possess inherent memory safety. Developers are relieved from manual memory management, as required in C/C++, and are also shielded from issues related to garbage collection or memory leaks found in some other languages. This language-level security provides a significant advantage.Rust also excels in ensuring concurrency safety. Its ownership and type systems prevent data races in multi-threaded environments, enabling developers to write thread-safe code for high-concurrency web services with greater assurance, thereby avoiding complex concurrency-related bugs.Framework Design: Layered and Resilient DefensesBeyond Rust's intrinsic strengths, the framework's design incorporates robust security measures:Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization
The principle of "Never trust user input" is fundamental to web security. This framework furnishes strong, user-friendly input validation capabilities. Developers can define stringent checks for path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. The framework automatically rejects invalid inputs and furnishes clear error messages.
It also includes built-in safeguards against common web attacks. For instance, it might default to HTML entity encoding for user-submitted strings or offer APIs for sanitization, thereby thwarting XSS. For database queries, it promotes the use of parameterized queries, effectively eliminating SQL injection risks.
My tests simulating common attack vectors demonstrated the framework's efficacy in handling them. This "secure by default" philosophy diminishes the likelihood of developers inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.Secure Session Management and Authentication
Secure session management is vital. This framework typically employs cryptographically strong session IDs, establishes reasonable timeouts, and supports HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags to prevent session hijacking.
While it may not directly implement specific authentication logic (such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT), it offers flexible interfaces for integrating mature authentication libraries. Its middleware architecture simplifies the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
I observed its emphasis on utilizing strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with salting for storing sensitive information such as passwords.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) deceives users into performing unintended actions. This framework might offer built-in CSRF protection, such as generating and validating tokens in forms, effectively defending against such attacks.Secure Dependency Management
Contemporary applications rely heavily on third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities. Rust's package manager, Cargo, aids in managing dependencies and can integrate auditing tools like  to identify known vulnerabilities.
The framework developers also prioritize the security of their own dependencies, promptly updating and rectifying issues. This focus on supply chain security is crucial.Error Handling and Information Concealment
Exposing detailed system information during errors can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. This framework usually provides unified error handling, concealing sensitive details in production environments while logging them securely for developer review.
HTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This framework encourages or enforces the use of HTTPS, integrates seamlessly with TLS/SSL certificates, and may default to enabling security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and CSP (Content Security Policy).Practical Security Considerations in ImplementationWhen implementing projects using this framework, I concentrate on several key aspects:Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary permissions for database users, file systems, and APIs.Audits and Penetration Testing: Regularly conducting code audits and employing security testing tools to identify potential weaknesses.: Avoiding the hardcoding of sensitive information and meticulously validating all external inputs.Timely Dependency Updates: Monitoring and promptly applying security patches for the framework and its dependencies.Comprehensive Log Monitoring: Deploying thorough logging mechanisms to detect anomalous behavior and potential attacks.This framework's design inherently facilitates these security measures. Its modularity allows for the easy encapsulation of permission logic, and its logging system supports robust security monitoring capabilities.Comparative Analysis with Other FrameworksCompared to dynamic language frameworks (such as those in PHP, Python, or Node.js), this Rust-based framework offers superior memory and type safety. Rust's static checking eliminates a multitude of risks at compile time, before deployment.When compared to secure Java frameworks (like Spring Security), Rust frameworks are generally more lightweight and performant, sidestepping potential JVM-related overheads. However, the Java ecosystem might offer a broader array of established enterprise security solutions.Overall, this Rust framework, with its language-level guarantees and thoughtful design, stands as a highly competitive option for building secure web applications. It's not merely fast; it's also demonstrably stable and solid.Conclusion: Security as a Continuous EndeavorIn the digital realm, security is an unceasing journey, not a destination. Choosing a secure framework is akin to selecting a strong foundation upon which to build a fortress.This Rust framework, with its comprehensive and multi-layered approach to security, provides a potent platform for constructing reliable and resilient web applications. It has vividly demonstrated to me that security is not a constraint but rather a shield that enables and protects innovation.As I prepare to embark on my professional career, my exploration of technology and my pursuit of robust security practices will undoubtedly continue. I am confident that with a deeper understanding and application of this framework, I can effectively face future cybersecurity challenges and contribute meaningfully to a safer digital world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Production Deployment Strategies Docker Cloud High Web（1751200608556000）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/production-deployment-strategies-docker-cloud-high-web1751200608556000-1781</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:36:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a third-year computer science student who has deployed applications across various platforms and cloud environments, I've learned that deployment is not merely the final step in development but a critical aspect that determines application reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

  Conclusion: Deployment as a Competitive Advantage
This comprehensive exploration of cross-platform deployment and cloud-native architecture demonstrates that modern deployment strategies are not merely operational concerns but fundamental aspects of application design. The Rust-based framework I've examined represents a paradigm shift in how we think about deployment, where every aspect of the application is designed with deployment and scalability in mind.The framework's combination of single binary deployment, comprehensive containerization support, and cloud-native architecture creates an environment where applications can be deployed consistently across any platform or cloud provider. Its performance characteristics, combined with its deployment-friendly features, make it an ideal choice for teams that value reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency.As a computer science student passionate about cloud computing and DevOps, I believe that frameworks like this represent the future of application deployment. By prioritizing deployment considerations alongside performance and security, these frameworks enable teams to build applications that are not only fast and secure but also easy to deploy, monitor, and maintain.The journey toward truly cloud-native deployment requires a fundamental shift in how we think about application architecture—from focusing solely on functionality to considering deployment and operational concerns, from building applications that work locally to designing systems that thrive in distributed environments, and from manual deployment processes to automated, reliable deployment pipelines. This framework embodies this philosophy and provides a compelling example of what modern application deployment can and should be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Fundamentals: attrs</title><link>https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/python-fundamentals-attrs-2ed9</link><author>DevOps Fundamental</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:22:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Beyond Dataclasses: Productionizing Python with In late 2022, a critical bug in our distributed tracing system nearly brought down our core payment processing pipeline. The root cause? A subtle mutation of an immutable data object representing a trace span, leading to inconsistent state across microservices. We were using standard Python dictionaries to represent these spans, relying on developer discipline to avoid modification.   was the immediate solution, providing a robust, type-safe foundation for our tracing data models. This incident highlighted a painful truth: relying on convention for data integrity in a complex, distributed system is a recipe for disaster. This post dives deep into , exploring its architectural implications, performance characteristics, and practical considerations for building production-grade Python applications.
  
  
  What is "attrs" in Python?
 is a Python package that simplifies writing classes, primarily data-holding classes, by automatically generating boilerplate code like , , , and .  It’s not a replacement for classes, but a powerful tool for  them more concisely and reliably.  Technically,  leverages Python’s metaclass system to modify class creation. It’s heavily inspired by similar libraries in other languages (e.g., Lombok in Java) and predates Python 3.7’s built-in . While  have narrowed the gap,  remains superior in several key areas: more robust type validation, extensive customization options, and a more mature ecosystem.  It’s fundamentally about declarative data modeling, shifting focus from implementation details to  the data represents.FastAPI Request/Response Models:  We use  extensively in our FastAPI applications to define request and response schemas.  This provides automatic validation via Pydantic integration (see section 4), ensuring data integrity at the API boundary.  The performance overhead is negligible compared to manual validation.  Our asynchronous task queue utilizes  to define job payloads.  The immutability enforced by  prevents accidental modification of job data during processing, crucial for idempotency and reliability.Type-Safe Data Pipelines:  In our data engineering pipelines,  classes represent data records flowing through various transformation stages.  This provides strong typing and facilitates data quality checks at each step.  We use  to define configuration objects for our CLI tools built with Click. This allows for easy validation of command-line arguments and provides a structured way to manage application settings.Machine Learning Preprocessing: classes define the configuration for our ML preprocessing pipelines.  This ensures consistent data transformations across training and inference, reducing the risk of model drift.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 plays exceptionally well with the modern Python ecosystem. classes are fully compatible with mypy, providing static type checking.  We enforce strict type checking in our CI pipeline. integrates seamlessly with Pydantic for runtime validation and serialization/deserialization.  This is a common pattern in FastAPI and other data-intensive applications. classes are easily testable.  The  method generated by  simplifies assertion comparisons. classes can be used in asynchronous code without issues.  Immutability is particularly beneficial in concurrent environments.Here's a snippet from our :We also use a custom runtime hook to ensure all  classes are validated on startup in critical services:This example demonstrates several key features:  enforces immutability,  requires keyword arguments, and  provides built-in validation.  The  hook allows for custom validation logic.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common pitfall is forgetting to mark a class as .  This can lead to unexpected mutations, as demonstrated in our tracing system incident.  Another issue is complex validation logic in  that can mask underlying problems.Debugging  classes is similar to debugging regular classes.  However, the generated methods can make tracebacks less informative.  Using  or a debugger with source code mapping is crucial.  Runtime assertions can also help catch unexpected state changes.Here's an example of a bad state we encountered:The fix is simple:  and using immutable data structures for fields like  (e.g., ).
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
 introduces a small performance overhead compared to manually written classes. However, this overhead is usually negligible in most applications.  We’ve benchmarked  classes against equivalent  and found the performance difference to be within acceptable limits.  Minimize the use of global variables and shared mutable state.  Reuse objects whenever possible.  Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.  For performance-critical sections, consider using C extensions to implement custom logic.We use  to identify performance bottlenecks and  to track memory usage. itself doesn't introduce significant security vulnerabilities. However, improper use can lead to security issues.  Insecure deserialization is a major concern.  If you're deserializing  classes from untrusted sources, use Pydantic with strict type validation to prevent code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate input data thoroughly.We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:  Test individual  classes and their methods.  Test the interaction between  classes and other components.Property-based tests (Hypothesis):  Generate random inputs to test the robustness of  classes.  Enforce static type checking.Our CI pipeline includes:  Runs unit and integration tests.  Performs static type checking.  Tests the code in different Python environments.  Automates the CI process.  Runs linters and formatters before committing code.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Leads to mutable data and potential inconsistencies.  Can hide underlying problems and make debugging difficult.  Defeats the purpose of using  for type safety.Using mutable default values:  Can lead to unexpected behavior.Not validating input data:  Creates security vulnerabilities.Complex inheritance hierarchies:  Can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use type hints and enforce static type checking.  Keep  classes focused on data representation.  Validate input data and handle potential errors gracefully.  Break down complex systems into smaller, independent modules.  Use a layered configuration approach to manage application settings.  Use dependency injection to improve testability and maintainability.  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.  Document all  classes and their methods. is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python applications.  Mastering  requires understanding its architectural implications, performance characteristics, and security considerations.  Refactor legacy code to use , measure performance, write comprehensive tests, and enforce strict type checking.  The investment will pay off in the long run by reducing bugs, improving code quality, and increasing developer productivity.  Don't just use  by default; consider  when you need more control, validation, and a mature ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HardView: The Fastest Way to Get Detailed Hardware Info in Python</title><link>https://dev.to/gafoo/hardview-the-fastest-way-to-get-detailed-hardware-info-in-python-3h0k</link><author>gafoo</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:21:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

During my exploration of modern distributed systems, I discovered that API gateways serve as the critical unified entry point that can make or break the entire system's performance and maintainability.
  
  
  Understanding API Gateway Architecture
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have come to understand that API gateways are not just simple request routers - they are sophisticated traffic management systems that handle authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and service discovery. The gateway pattern provides a single entry point for all client requests while hiding the complexity of the underlying microservice architecture.The beauty of a well-designed API gateway lies in its ability to abstract away the distributed nature of microservices from client applications. Clients interact with a single, consistent interface while the gateway handles the complexity of routing requests to appropriate services, aggregating responses, and managing cross-cutting concerns.
  
  
  Advanced Gateway Features and Patterns
Through my exploration of API gateway architecture, I discovered several advanced patterns that make gateways even more powerful and flexible:Modern API gateways can integrate seamlessly with service mesh technologies, providing a unified approach to traffic management across the entire microservice ecosystem. This integration enables advanced features like distributed tracing, mutual TLS, and sophisticated traffic policies.
  
  
  Dynamic Configuration Management
The ability to update gateway configuration without downtime is crucial for production systems. Advanced gateways support dynamic configuration updates through configuration management systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to routing rules, rate limits, and security policies.While HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol, modern gateways also support WebSocket, gRPC, and other protocols, providing a unified entry point for diverse communication patterns within the microservice architecture.
  
  
  Performance Optimization Strategies
In my testing and optimization work, I identified several key strategies for maximizing API gateway performance:
  
  
  Connection Pooling and Keep-Alive
Maintaining persistent connections to backend services reduces the overhead of connection establishment and improves overall throughput. Proper connection pool management is essential for handling high-concurrency scenarios.Implementing intelligent caching at the gateway level can dramatically reduce backend load and improve response times. Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to maintain data consistency.
  
  
  Request/Response Compression
Automatic compression of request and response payloads can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile clients and low-bandwidth connections.API gateways serve as the first line of defense in microservice architectures, making security a critical concern:
  
  
  Authentication and Authorization
Centralized authentication and authorization at the gateway level simplifies security management and ensures consistent security policies across all services. Support for multiple authentication methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys) provides flexibility for different client types.
  
  
  Input Validation and Sanitization
Validating and sanitizing all incoming requests at the gateway level helps prevent malicious attacks from reaching backend services. This includes protection against SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors.
  
  
  DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting
Sophisticated rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms help ensure service availability under attack conditions. Adaptive rate limiting based on client behavior and system load provides optimal protection.
  
  
  Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining healthy API gateway operations:Collecting detailed metrics on request patterns, response times, error rates, and resource utilization provides insights into system performance and helps identify optimization opportunities.Integration with distributed tracing systems enables end-to-end visibility into request flows across the entire microservice architecture, making debugging and performance optimization much easier.Automated alerting based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection helps operations teams respond quickly to issues before they impact users.
  
  
  Deployment and Scaling Strategies
Successful API gateway deployment requires careful consideration of scaling and high availability:API gateways must be designed for horizontal scaling to handle increasing traffic loads. Load balancing across multiple gateway instances ensures high availability and optimal performance.Supporting blue-green deployment patterns enables zero-downtime updates to gateway configuration and software, ensuring continuous service availability.For global applications, deploying gateways across multiple regions provides better performance for geographically distributed users and improves disaster recovery capabilities.
  
  
  Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Through my hands-on experience building and operating API gateways, I've learned several important lessons:: Begin with basic routing and authentication, then gradually add more sophisticated features as needed.: Comprehensive monitoring is essential for understanding gateway behavior and identifying issues early.: Design the gateway architecture to handle expected traffic growth and peak loads.: Implement security measures from the beginning rather than adding them as an afterthought.: Comprehensive testing, including load testing and failure scenarios, is crucial for production readiness.The API gateway landscape continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns:Integration with serverless computing platforms enables dynamic scaling and cost optimization for variable workloads.Machine learning capabilities for intelligent routing, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling are becoming increasingly important.Deploying gateway functionality at the edge brings processing closer to users, reducing latency and improving user experience.API gateways represent a critical component in modern microservice architectures, providing the unified entry point that makes distributed systems manageable and secure. Through my exploration of gateway design patterns and implementation strategies, I've gained deep appreciation for the complexity and importance of this architectural component.The framework I've been studying provides an excellent foundation for building high-performance API gateways, with its emphasis on memory safety, performance, and developer experience. The combination of powerful abstractions and low-level control makes it ideal for implementing the sophisticated traffic management and security features required in production gateway systems.As microservice architectures continue to evolve, API gateways will remain essential for managing the complexity of distributed systems while providing the performance, security, and reliability that modern applications demand.This article documents my exploration of API gateway design patterns as a junior student. Through practical implementation and testing, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and solutions of building scalable, secure gateway systems. I hope my experience can help other students understand this critical architectural pattern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real World Project Case Study Campus Modern Web（1751197934351500）</title><link>https://dev.to/member_c6d11ca9/real-world-project-case-study-campus-modern-web1751197934351500-1gk2</link><author>member_c6d11ca9</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 11:52:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a junior student learning web development, there was always a huge gap between theoretical knowledge and actual projects.

During my exploration of modern development practices, I discovered that creating truly universal web applications requires more than just writing portable code - it demands a deep understanding of deployment strategies, environment management, and platform-specific optimizations.
  
  
  The Promise of Write Once Run Everywhere
In my ten years of programming learning experience, I have witnessed the evolution from platform-specific development to universal application frameworks. The dream of "write once, run everywhere" has driven countless innovations in software development, from Java's virtual machine to modern containerization technologies.Modern web frameworks have brought us closer to this ideal than ever before. By leveraging platform-agnostic technologies and standardized deployment practices, we can build applications that deliver consistent experiences across diverse environments.
  
  
  Container-First Deployment Strategy
In my exploration of cross-platform deployment, I discovered that containerization provides the most reliable path to universal application deployment. Containers abstract away platform differences while providing consistent runtime environments.The framework I've been studying embraces container-first deployment with intelligent platform detection and optimization. This approach ensures that applications can leverage platform-specific optimizations while maintaining portability across different environments.
  
  
  Environment Configuration Management
One of the biggest challenges in cross-platform deployment is managing configuration across different environments. Through my experience, I learned that successful universal applications require sophisticated configuration management that adapts to platform capabilities and deployment contexts.The key principles I discovered include:: Automatically detecting platform capabilities and constraints: Enabling/disabling features based on platform support: Adjusting resource usage based on available system resources: Providing fallback behavior when platform features are unavailableThis article documents my exploration of cross-platform application development as a junior student.

The traditional approach involves repeating these codes in each route, which I find very tedious. It wasn't until I encountered a Rust framework whose middleware system completely changed my development approach. The middleware design of this framework showed me a new realm of web development.
  
  
  The Design Philosophy of Middleware Systems
This Rust framework's middleware system adopts functional programming design principles. Each middleware is an independent async function that can be freely combined to form powerful processing chains. This design reminds me of Unix's pipe concept - simple yet powerful.
  
  
  The Art of Middleware Composition
This framework allows me to flexibly combine multiple middlewares to form powerful processing chains. Each middleware can access and modify the context, enabling me to build complex business logic.
  
  
  Middleware Execution Order
This framework's middleware execution order is very clear: request middlewares execute in registration order, then the route handler function executes, and finally response middlewares execute in registration order. This design allows me to precisely control the request processing flow.
  
  
  Middleware Performance Optimization
This framework's middleware system also demonstrates excellent performance. Each middleware executes asynchronously without blocking other request processing.
  
  
  Comparison with Express.js Middleware
I once developed similar functionality using Express.js, and the middleware experience was completely different:Using this Rust framework, both type safety and performance of middleware are significantly improved:
  
  
  Best Practices for Middleware Development
Through using this framework's middleware system, I've summarized several important development practices:Single Responsibility Principle: Each middleware should only be responsible for one specific function: Fully utilize Rust's type system to avoid runtime errorsPerformance Considerations: Middleware should be lightweight and avoid blocking: Each middleware should have comprehensive error handling mechanisms: Middleware should be testable for unit testingAs a computer science student about to graduate, this middleware system development experience gave me a deeper understanding of web framework design. Middleware is not just a combination of functions, but the art of architectural design.This Rust framework shows me the future direction of modern web development: type safety, high performance, easy extensibility, developer-friendly. It's not just a framework, but the embodiment of a programming philosophy.I believe that with the proliferation of microservice architectures, middleware systems will play important roles in more fields, and this framework provides developers with the perfect technical foundation.This article documents my journey as a third-year student exploring web framework middleware systems. Through actual development experience and comparative analysis, I deeply understood the importance of middleware in modern web development. I hope my experience can provide some reference for other students.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python course: Boolean logic</title><link>https://dev.to/costa86/python-course-boolean-logic-36cj</link><author>Lourenço Costa</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:49:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a data type used to represent a situation that can assume only one out of two possibilities. It's like the outcome of flipping a coin: it must be either head or tails. There's no third option. Despite its simplicity, it's a very useful data type that can help remove ambiguity and provide clarity and elegance to your programs.The two possible values for a boolean are  or .
This is a basic mathematical comparison between numbers using the operators greater than (), less than (), and greater than or equals ().
This can cause confusion sometimes, because the operator for assigning values () is very similar to the operator for equivalence (). Here, the value of this variable is equal to the output of the operation  (which is , since 1 is equal to 1). In this case, adding parentheses may improve readability. Feel free to write it as: . Read more about operators in the  post.
The comparison works for strings and other data types as well. Notice that in  I used the not equal operator . In other words, it's like asking: is "ryan" different than "kelly"? The answer is yes ().
This is a more realistic use case of a boolean. The  function returns the equality check between the  argument and the string "michael". Where it returns  if name is equals to () "michael". Otherwise, it returns . There is not a third possibility!Notice I didn't need to explicitly write  or  as return options. This is the elegance and simplicity that I mentioned earlier about booleans.😊 Enjoying this series? The full book contains even more content!

Sets offer a very interesting feature, though: uniqueness of elements. This means that if you add the same element twice (or more) to a set, it will be ignored! This is useful if you want to ensure your collection does not contain any duplicated elements:Notice that  and  don't contain any repeated elements, even though I tried to add duplicates into them.Also, notice that when I  them, the order of the elements is not respected! This has to do with some internal specifications on how Python stores these values in memory (it uses hash tables). As a consequence of that, you cannot access individual elements by index in a set, as we do in lists and tuples! As a workaround to this limitation, you can easily create a list out of a set:This procedure of converting a type into another (in this case, a set into a list), is known as “casting”.Apart from this validation for uniqueness, another interesting use case for sets is performing union and intersection operations of elements in different sets.If the symbols "" and "" are unfamiliar to you (as seen in  and ), check out the bitwise operators in the  post.😊 Enjoying this series?
