You might think of Haskell, with its pure functions and monads (don't panic, we'll explain that in detail later), or JavaScript, which loves to showcase its features with higher - order functions and callbacks. But in fact, you can also do functional programming in Go, and the process is far from dull.First of all, let's talk about higher - order functions. Higher - order functions can work well with other functions, either taking them as parameters or returning them as values. In the world of Go, implementing higher - order functions is not only possible but also quite ingenious.You see, in this example, the  function takes an integer slice and a judgment function , and returns the elements in the slice that meet the judgment conditions. Doesn't it seem a bit like a faster JavaScript?Next up is currying. It is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying is actually not as complicated as it might seem.In this example, the  function takes an integer  and returns a new function. This new function takes another integer  and returns the result of . Simple, straightforward, and gets the job done without any frills.One of the characteristics of functional programming is immutability. Once something is constructed, it doesn't change. Instead, if you need something different, you build a new one. This might sound wasteful at first, but in fact, it keeps the code clean and reduces side effects.In this example, instead of directly modifying the original , we created a new  and modified it.Pure functions are like tidy friends. They don't touch or modify anything outside their scope. What you pass in is what you use, and what they return is their only effect.In this example, the  function only depends on the passed - in parameter  and doesn't affect any external variables.In the simplest terms, functors are anything that can map a function. Think of the humble array, applying a function to each item and getting a new array. In Go, there is no built - in general  function, but we can build one ourselves.Here, we defined a  function that takes an integer slice and a function and returns a new slice, where each element is the result of processing the original slice element by the function.Now, let's talk about endofunctors. It's just a fancy way of saying a functor that maps a type to the same type. Simply put, starting from a Go slice, you end up with a Go slice of the same type. It's not rocket science, just a matter of type consistency.Taking the previous  as an example, it's a kind of endofunctor in disguise. It takes  and returns  without type conversion.Imagine a party where everyone has to bring a friend. Monoids are like that, but for types. They need two things: an operation that combines two types and a special value, which is like the most likable friend - it gets along with everyone but doesn't change anything about them.In Go, you can see this with slices or numbers. Let's take numbers as an example because they're easier to work with:Here, 0 is our hero, the identity element, which keeps the numbers unchanged."When someone says, 'A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors,' they're basically showing off their computer - science vocabulary." To explain in detail: A monad is a programming construct that deals with types and functions in a super - special way - like some people are picky about how their coffee is brewed.In the simplest terms, a monoid is about combining things together using a special rule, which includes a useless element or identity element. Now, add endofunctors, which are like ordinary old functions but stick to transforming things within their own little universe (category). Put it all together, and you'll see that a monad can be seen as a way to chain functions together in a sequence, but in a super - self - contained way while also respecting the original structure of the data. It's like saying, "We're going on a road trip, but we can only take the scenic backroads, and we'll end up back where we started."Monads are all - rounders. They can not only handle values with context (such as errors or lists) but also chain operations together by passing the context. In Go, it might be a bit difficult to mimic this, but let's take a look at error handling, which is a practical use of monads.This makeshift monad can help us handle computations that might go wrong without causing panics and chaos in the code.Functional programming in Go might not be the poster child of the functional paradigm, but it's entirely feasible and can even be fun. Who would have thought, right? Now, you should understand that Go can achieve functional programming just like other languages. With a little effort, you can write clean, efficient, and robust code. Finally, I'd like to recommend a platform that's perfect for deploying Golang code: 
  
  
  1. Multi - Language Support
Develop with JavaScript, Python, Go, or Rust.

  
  
  2. Deploy unlimited projects for free
pay only for usage — no requests, no charges.
  
  
  3. Unbeatable Cost Efficiency
Pay - as - you - go with no idle charges.
Example: $25 supports 6.94M requests at a 60ms average response time.

  
  
  4. Streamlined Developer Experience
Intuitive UI for effortless setup.
Fully automated CI/CD pipelines and GitOps integration.
Real - time metrics and logging for actionable insights.

  
  
  5. Effortless Scalability and High Performance
Auto - scaling to handle high concurrency with ease.
Zero operational overhead — just focus on building.

AWS isn’t adding those to CDK v1 anymore—so to keep up with the latest and greatest, you’ll need to migrate to CDK v2. It might sound like a hassle, but don’t worry—I’ve got your back. Let’s go through this step-by-step and get you up to speed, Python style.
  
  
  Why Should You Care About CDK v2?
Alright, let’s address the big question: why even bother migrating to CDK v2? Well, here are three solid reasons:Simplified Dependencies: No more pulling in tons of packages for different AWS services. CDK v2 bundles everything into a single package: aws-cdk-lib. How awesome is that?Stay Updated: CDK v1 isn’t getting any love anymore. If you want to keep up with the latest AWS features and updates, v2 is where it’s at.Better Developer Experience: AWS has introduced some stability guarantees and cleaned up APIs, making it easier for us to write and maintain our infrastructure code.1. Consolidated Package Structure
Remember the days of importing a separate package for each AWS service? That’s history now. CDK v2 unifies everything into aws-cdk-lib.from aws_cdk import core
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
from aws_cdk import Stack
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
2. Goodbye to Deprecated APIsSome APIs and constructs from v1 didn’t make the cut in v2. For instance, core.Construct has been replaced by constructs.Construct. A little cleanup never hurts, right?There are some great new features, like improved stability guarantees for low-level (L1) constructs and better testing capabilities with assertions.
  
  
  Let’s Get Migrating: Step-by-Step Guide
Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to upgrade your Python CDK project to v2.1. Update Your DependenciesStart by upgrading your project dependencies to use CDK v2. Open your requirements.txt or Pipfile and update them:aws-cdk-lib>=2.0.0
constructs>=10.0.0
Then, install the new dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
This is where the magic happens. Go through your code and replace aws_cdk.core with aws_cdk.Stack, and adjust other imports to use aws-cdk-lib.from aws_cdk import core
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
from aws_cdk import Stack
from aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket
3. Refactor Deprecated ConstructsSome constructs have been replaced or removed. For example, core.Construct is now constructs.Construct. Update your code accordingly.class MyBucket(core.Construct):
    def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str):
        super().__init__(scope, id)
        Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
from constructs import Construct

class MyBucket(Construct):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str):
        super().__init__(scope, id)
        Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
4. Remove Unnecessary Feature FlagsCDK v2 has removed or integrated several feature flags that were necessary in v1. To clean up your cdk.json file, remove any obsolete flags.{
  "app": "python3 app.py",
  "context": {
    "@aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-ec2:uniqueImds": true,
    "@aws-cdk/core:stackRelativeExports": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-secretsmanager:parseOwnedSecretName": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-kms:defaultKeyPolicies": true,
    "@aws-cdk/core:enableStackNameDuplicates": true,
    "aws-cdk:enableDiffNoFail": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-ecr-assets:dockerIgnoreSupport": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-s3:grantWriteWithoutAcl": true,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-efs:defaultEncryptionAtRest": true
  }
}
{
  "app": "python3 app.py"
}
Removing these flags ensures your project stays aligned with CDK v2 best practices.Finally, make sure everything works as expected. Run these commands:Fix any issues that pop up, and you’re good to go!
  
  
  Migration Verification Checklist
 All imports updated to aws-cdk-lib Construct imports moved to constructs package cdk diff shows expected changesAnd there you have it! Migrating from CDK v1 to v2 isn’t as scary as it might seem. With unified dependencies, better APIs, and future-proofing, this upgrade is worth the effort. Take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you hit a roadblock.Have you already migrated to CDK v2? Or are you planning to?

embedded software for extremely expensive spacecraft, where tolerating
a lot of programming pain is a good tradeoff for not losing a mission.
I do not know why someone in that situation does not use the SPARK
subset of Ada, which subset was explicitly designed for verification,
and is simply a better starting point for embedded programming than C.
I am criticising them from the point of view of people writing
programming language processors (compilers, interpreters, editors)
and application software.
We are supposed to teach critical thinking.  This is an example.
How have Gerard J. Holzmann's and my different contexts affected
our judgement?
Can you blindly follow his advice without considering 
context?
Can you blindly follow  advice without considering
your context?
Would these rules necessarily apply to a different/better
programming language?  What if function pointers
were tamed?  What if the language provided opaque abstract
data types as Ada does?
1. Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs —
do not use  statements,
 or  constructs,
and direct or indirect .Note that  and 
are how C does exception handling, so this rule bans any use
of exception handling.

It is true that banning recursion and jumps and loops without
explicit bounds means that you  your program is
going to terminate.  It is also true that recursive functions
can be proven to terminate about as often as loops can, with
reasonably well-understood methods.  What's more important here is
that “sure to terminate” does not imply
“sure to terminate in my lifetime”:
    int const N = 1000000000;
    for (x0 = 0; x0 != N; x0++)
    for (x1 = 0; x1 != N; x1++)
    for (x2 = 0; x2 != N; x2++)
    for (x3 = 0; x3 != N; x3++)
    for (x4 = 0; x4 != N; x4++)
    for (x5 = 0; x5 != N; x5++)
    for (x6 = 0; x6 != N; x6++)
    for (x7 = 0; x7 != N; x7++)
    for (x8 = 0; x8 != N; x8++)
    for (x9 = 0; x9 != N; x9++)
        -- do something --;
This does a bounded number of iterations.  The bound is N.
In this case, that's 10.  If each iteration of the loop body
takes 1 nsec, that's 10 seconds, or about 7.9×10
years.  What is the  difference between “will stop
in 7,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
years” and “will never stop”?

Worse still, taking a problem that is  expressed
using recursion and contorting it into something that manipulates an
explicit stack, while possible, turns clear maintainable code into
buggy spaghetti.  (I've done it, several times.  There's an example
on this web site.  It is  a good idea.)

2. All loops must have a fixed upper-bound.  It must be trivially
possible for a checking tool to prove statically that a preset
upper-bound on the number of iterations of a loop cannot be exceeded.
If the loop-bound cannot be proven statically, the rule is considered
violated.This is an old idea.  As the example above shows, it is not enough
by itself to be of any practical use.  You have to try to make the
bounds reasonably , and you have to regard hitting an
artificial bound as a run-time error.

By the way, note that putting depth bounds on recursive procedures
makes them every bit as safe as loops with fixed bounds.

3. Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.This is also a very old idea.  Some languages designed for embedded
work don't even  dynamic memory allocation.  The big
thing, of course, is that embedded applications have a fixed amount of
memory to work with, are never going to get any more, and should not
crash because they couldn't handle another record.

Note that the rationale actually supports a much stronger rule:
don't even  dynamic memory allocation.  You can of
course manage your own storage pool:
    typedef struct Foo_Record *foo;
    struct Foo_Record {
	foo next;
	...
    };
    #define MAX_FOOS ...
    static struct Foo_Record foo_zone[MAX_FOOS];
    foo foo_free_list = 0;

    void init_foo_free_list() {
	for (int i = MAX_FOOS - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
	    foo_zone[i].next = foo_free_list;
	    foo_free_list = &foo_zone[i];
	}
    }

    foo malloc_foo() {
	foo r = foo_free_list;
	if (r == 0) report_error();
	foo_free_list = r->next;
	return r;
    }

    void free_foo(foo x) {
	x->next = foo_free_list;
	foo_free_list = x;
    }
This  satisfies the rule, but it
violates the  of the rule.  Simulating malloc()
and free() this way is  than using the real
thing, because the memory in foo_zone is permanently tied up
for Foo_Records, even if we don't need any of those at the
moment but do desperately need the memory for something else.

What you really need to do is to use a memory allocator
with known behaviour, and to prove that the amount of memory
in use at any given time (data bytes + headers) is bounded
by a known value.

Note also that SPlint can verify at compile time that
the errors NASA speak of do not occur.

One of the reasons given for the ban is that the performance
of malloc() and free() is unpredictable.  Are these the only
functions we use with unpredictable performance?  Is there
anything about malloc() and free() which makes them
 unpredictable?  The existence of
hard-real-time garbage collectors suggests not.

The rationale for this rule says that

Note that the only way
to dynamically claim memory in the absence of memory allocation from the
heap is to use stack memory.  In the absence of recursion (Rule 1), an
upper bound on the use of stack memory can derived statically, thus
making it possible to prove that an application will always live within
its pre-allocated memory means.
Unfortunately, the sunny optimism shown here is unjustified.  Given
the ISO C standard (any version, C89, C99, or C11) it is 
to determine an upper bound on the use of stack memory.  There is not even
any standard way to determine how much memory a compiler will use for the
stack frame of a given function.  (There could have been.  There just isn't.)
There isn't even any requirement that two invocations of the same function
with the same arguments will use the same amount of memory.
Such a bound can only be calculated for a  version of a
specific compiler with specific options.  Here's a trivial example:
void f() {
    char a[100000];
}
How much memory will that take on the stack?  Compiled for debugging,
it might take a full stack frame (however big that is) plus traceback
information plus a million bytes for a[].  Compiled with optimisation,
the compiler might notice that a[] isn't used, and might even compile
calls to f() inline so that they generate no code and take no space.
That's an extreme example, but not really unfair.  If you want bounds
you can rely on, you had better  what your compiler does,
and recheck every time anything about the compiler changes.

4.  No function should be longer than what can be printed on
a single sheet of paper in a standard reference format with one line per
statement and one line per declaration.  Typically, this means no more
than about 60 lines of code per function.Since programmers these days typically read their code on-screen,
not on paper, it's not clear why the size of a sheet of paper is
relevant any longer.

The rule is arguably stated about the wrong thing.  The thing that
needs to be bounded is not the size of a function, but the size of a
chunk that a programmer needs to read and comprehend.

There are also question marks about how to interpret this if you
are using a sensible language (like Algol 60, Simula 67, Algol 68,
Pascal, Modula2, Ada, Lisp, functional languages like ML, O'CAML,
F#, Clean, Haskell, or Fortran) that allows nested procedures.
Suppose you have a folding editor that presents a procedure to
you like this:
function Text_To_Floating(S: string, E: integer): Double;
   � variables �
   � procedure Mul(Carry: integer) �
   � function Evaluate: Double �

   Base, Sign, Max, Min, Point, Power := 10, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0;
   for N := 1 to S.length do begin
       C := S[N];
       if C = '.' then begin
          Point := -1
       end else
       if C = '_' then begin
          Base := Round(Evaluate);
          Max, Min, Power := 0, 1, 0
       end else
       if Char ≠ ' ' then begin
          Q := ord(C) - ord('0');
          if Q > 9 then Q := ord(C) - ord('A') + 10
          Power := Point + Point
          Mul(Q)
       end
    end;
    Power := Power + Exp;
    Value := Evaluate;
    if Sign < 0 then Value := -Value;
end;
which would be much bigger if the declarations
were expanded out instead of being hidden behind �folds�.
Which size do we count?  The folded size or the unfolded size?
I was using a folding editor called Apprentice on the Classic Mac
back in the 1980s.  It was written by Peter McInerny and was lightning
fast.

5.  The  of the code should average to a minimum of
two assertions per function.Assertions are wonderful documentation and the very best debugging tool
I know of.  I have never seen any real code that had too many assertions.

The example here is one of the ugliest pieces of code I've seen in a while.
if (!c_assert(p >= 0) == true) {
    return ERROR;
}
It should, of course, just be
if (!c_assert(p >= 0)) {
    return ERROR;
}
Better still, it should be something like
#ifdef NDEBUG
#define check(e, c) (void)0
#else
#define check(e, c) if (!(c)) return bugout(c), (e)
#ifdef NDEBUG_LOG
#define bugout(c) (void)0
#else
#define bugout(c) \
    fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d: assertion '%s' failed.\n", \
    __FILE__, __LINE__, #s)
#endif
#endif
Ahem.  The more interesting part is the required density.
I just checked an open source project from a large telecoms
company, and 23 out of 704 files (not functions) contained
at least one assertion.  I just checked my own Smalltalk
system and one SLOC out of every 43 was an assertion, but
the average Smalltalk “function” is only a few
lines.  If the biggest function allowed is 60 lines, then
let's suppose the average function is about 36 lines, so
this rule requires 1 assertion per 18 lines.
Assertions are good, but what they are especially good
for is expressing the requirements on data that come
from outside the function.  I suggest then that
Every argument whose validity is not guaranteed by
its typed should have an assertion to check it.
Every datum that is obtained from an external
source (file, data base, message) whose validity is
not guaranteed by its type should have an assertion
to check it.
The NASA 10 rules are written for embedded systems, where
reading stuff from sensors is fairly common.

6.  Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of
scope.This is excellent advice, but why limit it to data objects?
Oh yeah, the rules were written for crippled languages where you
 declare functions in the right place.

People using Ada, Pascal (Delphi), JavaScript, or functional
languages should also declare types and functions as locally as
possible.

7.  The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each
calling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside
each function.This again is mainly about C, or any other language that indicates
failure by returning special values.  “Standard libraries
famously violate this rule”?  No, the  library does.

You have to be reasonable about this: it simply isn't practical
to check  aspect of validity for 
argument.  Take the C function
void *bsearch(
    void const *key  /* what we are looking for */,
    void const *base /* points to an array of things like that */,
    size_t      n    /* how many elements base has */,
    size_t      size /* the common size of key and base's elements */
    int (*      cmp)(void const *, void const *)
);
This does a binary search in an array.  We must have key≠0,
base≠0, size≠0, cmp≠0, cmp(key,key)=0, and for all
1<i<n,
cmp((char*)base+size*(i-1), (char*)base+size*i) <= 0
Checking the validity in full would mean checking
that [key..key+size) is a range of readable addresses,
[base..base+size*n) is a range of readable addresses,
and doing n calls to cmp.  But the whole point of binary
search is to do O(log(n)) calls to cmp.

The fundamental rules here are
Don't let run-time errors go un-noticed, and
any check is safer than no check.
8. The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of
header files and simple macro definitions.  Token pasting, variable
argument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not allowed.Recursive macro calls don't really work in C, so no quarrel there.
Variable argument lists were introduced into macros in
C99 so that you could write code like
#define err_printf(level, ...) \
    if (debug_level >= level) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
...
    err_printf(HIGH, "About to frob %d\n", control_index);
This is a  thing; conditional tracing like this is a
powerful debugging aid.  It should be , not banned.

The rule goes on to ban macros that expand into things that are
not complete syntactic units.  This would, for example, prohibit
simulating try-catch blocks with macros.  (Fair enough, an earlier rule
banned exception handling anyway.)  Consider this code fragment, from
an actual program.
    row_flag = border;     
    if (row_flag) printf("\\hline");
    for_each_element_child(e0, i, j, e1)
        printf(row_flag ? "\\\\\n" : "\n");
        row_flag = true;  
        col_flag = false;
        for_each_element_child(e1, k, l, e2)
            if (col_flag) printf(" & ");
            col_flag = true;
            walk_paragraph("", e2, "");
        end_each_element_child
    end_each_element_child
    if (border) printf("\\\\\\hline");
    printf("\n\\end{tabular}\n");
It's part of a program converting slides written in something like HTML
into another notation for formatting.  The 
…  loops walk over a tree.  Using
these macros means that the programmer has no need to know and no reason to
care how the tree is represented and how the loop actually works.
You can easily see that  must have at
least one unmatched { and  must have at least one
unmatched }.  That's the kind of macro that's banned by requiring
complete syntactic units.  Yet the readability and maintainability of
the code is  improved by these macros.

One thing the rule covers, but does not at the beginning stress, is
“no  macro processing”.  That is,
no #if.  The argument against it is, I'm afraid, questionable.  If there
are 10 conditions, there are 2 combinations to test,
whether they are expressed as compile-time conditionals or run-time
conditionals.

In particular, the rule against conditional macro processing
would prevent you defining your own assertion macros.
It is not obvious that that's a good idea.

9.  The use of pointers should be restricted.  Specifically, no more
than one level of dereferencing is allowed.  Pointer dereference
operations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef
declarations.  Function pointers are not permitted.Let's look at the last point first.

double integral(double (*f)(double), double lower, double upper, int n) {
    // Compute the integral of f from lower to upper 
    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.
    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;
    double       s;
    double       t;
    int          i;
    
    s = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) s += f((lower + h/2.0) + h*i);
    t = 0.0;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) t += f(lower + h*i);
    return (f(lower) + f(upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);
}
This kind of code has been important in numerical calculations since
the very earliest days.  Pascal could do it.  Algol 60 could do it.
In the 1950s, Fortran could do it.  And NASA would ban it, because in
C,  is a function pointer.

Now it's important to write functions like this once and only once.
For example, the code has at least one error.  The comment says n+1
points, but the function is actually evaluated at 2n+1 points.  If we
need to bound the number of calls to f in order to meet a deadline,
having that number off by a factor of two will not help.
It's nice to have just one place to fix.
Perhaps I should not have copied that code from a well-known source (:-).
Certainly I should not have more than one copy!

What can we do if we're not allowed to use function pointers?
Suppose there are four functions foo, bar, ugh, and zoo that we need
to integrate.  Now we can write
enum Fun {FOO, BAR, UGH, ZOO};

double call(enum Fun which, double what) {
    switch (which) {
        case FOO: return foo(what);
        case BAR: return bar(what);
        case UGH: return ugh(what);
        case ZOO: return zoo(what);
    }
}

double integral(enum Fun which, double lower, double upper, int n) {
    // Compute the integral of a function from lower to upper 
    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.
    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;
    double       s;
    double       t;
    int          i;
    
    s = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) s += call(which, (lower + h/2.0) + h*i);
    t = 0.0;
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) t += call(which, lower + h*i);
    return (call(which, lower) + call(which, upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);
}
Has obeying NASA's rule made the code more reliable?  No, it has made
the code  to understand,  maintainable, and
 that it wasn't before.  Here's a call
illustrating the mistake:
x = integral(4, 0.0, 1.0, 10);I have checked this with two C compilers and a static checker at their
highest settings, and they are completely silent about this.

So there are legitimate uses for function pointers, and simulating
them makes programs , not better.

Now  in Fortran,
Algol 60, or Pascal.  Those languages had procedure 
but not procedure . You could pass a subprogram name as
a parameter, and such a parameter could be passed on, but you could not
store them in variables.  You could have a  of C which
allowed function pointer parameters, but made all function pointer
variables read-only.  That would give you a statically checkable subset
of C that allowed integral().

The other use of function pointers is simulating object-orientation.
Imagine for example
struct Channel {
    void (*send)(struct Channel *, Message const *);
    bool (*recv)(struct Channel *, Message *);
    ...
};
inline void send(struct Channel *c, Message const *m) {
    c->send(c, m);
}
inline bool recv(struct Channel *c, Message *m) {
    return c->recv(c, m);
}
This lets us use a common interface for sending and receiving
messages on different kinds of channels.  This approach has been
used extensively in operating systems (at least as far back as
the Burroughs MCP in the 1960s) to decouple the code that uses
a device from the actual device driver.     I would expect any
program that controls more than one hardware device to do something
like this.  It's one of our key tools for controlling complexity.
Again, we can simulate this, but it makes adding a new kind of
channel harder than it should be, and the code is 
when we do it, not better.

The rule against more than one level of dereferencing is also
an assault on good programming.  One of the key ideas that was
developed in the 1960s is the idea of ;
the idea that it should be possible for one module to define a
data type and operations on it and another module to use instances
of that data type and its operations without having to know
anything about what the data type is.
One of the things I detest about Java is that it spits in the
face of the people who worked out that idea.  Yes, Java (now) has
generic type parameters, and that's good, but you cannot use a
 type without knowing what that type is.

Suppose I have a module that offers operations
And suppose that I have two interfaces in mind.  One of them
uses integers as tokens.
// stasher.h, version 1.
typedef int token;
extern token stash(item);
extern item  recall(token);
extern void  delete(token);
Another uses pointers as tokens.
// stasher.h, version 2.
typedef struct Hidden *token;
extern  token stash(item);
extern  item  recall(token);
extern  void  delete(token);
void snoo(token *ans, item x, item y) {
    if (better(x, y)) {
	*ans = stash(x);
    } else {
	*ans = stash(y);
    }
}
By the NASA rule, the function snoo() would not be accepted or rejected on
its own merits.  With stasher.h, version 1, it would be accepted.
With stasher.h, version 2, it would be rejected.

One reason to prefer version 2 to version 1 is that version 2 gets
more use out of type checking.  There are ever so many ways to get an
int in C.  Ask yourself if it ever makes sense to do
token t1 = stash(x);
token t2 = stash(y);
delete(t1*t2);
I really do not like the idea of banning abstract data types.

10.  All code must be compiled, from the first day of development,
with all compiler warnings enabled at the compiler’s
most pedantic setting.  All code must compile with these setting without
any warnings.  All code must be checked daily with at least one, but
preferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer
and should pass the analyses with zero warnings.This one is good advice.  Rule 9 is really about making your code
worse in order to get more benefit from limited static checkers.  (Since
C has no standard way to construct new functions at run time, the set of
functions that a particular function pointer  point to can
be determined by a fixed-point data flow analysis, at least for most
programs.)  So is rule 1.

At the time, I worked on software (people call them “jailbreaks” these days) to allow users to run their own unofficial apps on the Nintendo Wii.I was passionate about my work and the team I was part of (Team Twiizers, later fail0verflow). Despite that, I ended up burning out, primarily due to the very large fraction of entitled users. Most people using our software just wanted to play pirated games (something we did not support, condone, or directly enable). We kept playing a cat and mouse game with the manufacturer to keep the platform open, only to see our efforts primarily used by people who just wanted to steal other people’s work, and very loudly felt entitled to it. It got really old after a while. As newer game consoles were released, I ended up focusing on Linux ports purely for fun, and didn’t attempt to build a community nor work on the jailbreaks/exploits that would end up becoming a tool used by pirates.When Apple released the M1, I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project. The technical challenges were the same as my console homebrew projects of the past (in fact, much bigger), but this time, the platform was already open - there was no need for a jailbreak, and no drama and entitled users who want to pirate software to worry about. And running Linux on an M1 was a  bigger deal than running it on a PS4.I launched the Asahi Linux project, and received an immense amount of support and donations. Incredibly, I had the support I needed to make the project happen just a few days after my call to action, so I got to work. The first couple of years were amazing, as we brought the platform from nothing to one of the smoothest Linux experiences you can get on a laptop. Sure, there were/are still some bits and pieces of hardware support missing, but the overall experience rivaled or exceeded what you could get on most x86 laptops. And we built it all from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation. It was an impossible feat, something that had never been done before, and we pulled it off.Unfortunately, things became less fun after a while. First, there were the issues upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, which I’ve already spoken at length about and I won’t repeat here. Suffice it to say, being in a position to have to upstream code across practically every Linux subsystem, touching drivers of all categories as well as some common code, is an  frustrating experience. (Clarification: This has nothing to do with Rust at this point, it’s well before R4L was even merged. Upstreaming to Linux is a terrible experience in C too.)But then also came the entitled users. This time, it wasn’t about stealing games, it was about features. “When is Thunderbolt coming?” “Asahi is useless to me until I can use monitors over USB-C” “The battery life sucks compared to macOS” (nobody ever complained when compared to x86 laptops…) “I can’t even check my CPU temperature” (yes, I seriously got that one). (Edit: This wasn’t just a few instances; I’ve seen variations on the first three posted hundreds of times by now, including takes like “Thunderbolt/DP Alt are never going to happen”. A few times is fine, but the same thing repeated over and over again every day while we’re trying to make these things happen will get to anyone.)And, of course, “When is M3/M4 support coming?”For a long time, well after we had a stable release, people kept claiming Asahi Linux and Fedora Asahi Remix in particular were “alpha” and “unstable” and “not suitable for a daily driver” (despite thousands of users, myself included, daily driving it and even using it for servers).No matter how much we did, how many impossible feats we pulled off, people always wanted more. And more. Meanwhile, donations and pledges kept slowly , and have done so since the project launched. Not enough to spell immediate doom for my dream of working on Asahi full time in the short term, but enough to make me wonder if any of this was really appreciated. The all-time peak monthly donation volume was the very first month or two. It seemed the more things we accomplished, the less support we had.I knew burnout was a very real risk and managed this by limiting my time spent on certain areas, such as kernel upstreaming. This worked reasonably well and was mostly sustainable at the time.Then 2024 happened. Last year was incredibly tumultuous for me due to personal reasons which I won’t go into detail about. Suffice it to say, I ended up traveling for most of the year, all the while having to handle various abusers and stalkers who harassed and attacked me and my family (and continue to do so).I did make some progress in 2024, but this left me in a very vulnerable position. I hadn’t gotten nearly as much Asahi work done as I’d liked, and the users weren’t getting any quieter about demanding more features and machine support.We shipped conformant Vulkan drivers and a whole emulation stack for x86-64 games and apps, but we were still stuck without DP Alt Mode (a feature which required deep reverse engineering, debugging, and kernel surgery to pull off, and which, if it were to be implemented properly and robustly, would require a major refactor of certain kernel subsystems or perhaps even the introduction of an entirely new subsystem).I slowly started to ramp work up again at the beginning of this year, feeling very stressed out and guilty about having gotten very little work done for the previous year. “Full” DP Alt support was still a ways away, but we were hoping to ship a limited version that only worked on a specific Type C port for each machine type in the first month or two of the year. Sven had gotten some progress into the PHY code in December, so I picked it up and ended up beating the code of three drivers into enough shape that it mostly worked reliably. Even though it wasn’t the best approach, it was the most I could manage without having another huge bikeshed discussion with the kernel community (I did try to bring the subject up on the mailing lists, but it didn’t get much response).The issues Rust for Linux has had surviving as an upstream Linux project are well documented, so I won’t repeat them in detail here. Suffice it to say, I consider Linus’ handling of the integration of Rust into Linux a major failure of leadership. Such a large project needs significant support from major stakeholders to survive, while his approach seems to have been to just wait and see. Meanwhile, multiple subsystem maintainers downstream of him have done their best to stonewall or hinder the project, issue unacceptable verbal abuse, and generally hurt morale, with no consequence. One major Rust for Linux maintainer already resigned a few months ago.As you know, this is deeply personal to me, as we’ve made a bet on Rust for Linux for Asahi. Not just for fun (or just for memory safety), either: Rust is the entire reason our GPU driver was able to succeed in the time it did. We have two more Rust drivers in our downstream tree now, and a third one on track to be rewritten from C to Rust, because Rust is simply much better suited to the unique challenges we face, and the C driver is becoming unmaintainable. This is, by the way, the same reason the new Nova driver for Nvidia GPUs is being written in Rust. More modern programming languages are better suited to writing drivers for more modern hardware with more complexity and novel challenges, unsurprisingly.Some might be wondering why we can’t just let the Rust situation play out on its own over a longer period of time, perhaps several more years, and simply maintain things downstream until then. One reason is that, of course, this situation is hurting developer morale in the present. Another is that our Apple GPU driver is itself major evidence that Rust for Linux is fit for purpose (it was the first big driver to be written from scratch in Rust and brought along with it lots of development in Rust kernel abstractions). Simply not aiming for upstream might be seen as lack of interest, and hurt the chances of survival of the Rust for Linux effort. But there’s more.In fact, the Linux kernel development model is (perhaps paradoxically) designed to encourage upstreaming and punish downstream forks. While it is possible to just not care about upstream and maintain an outright hard fork, this is not a viable long-term solution (that’s how you get vendor Android kernel trees that die off in 2 years). The Asahi Linux downstream tree is continuously rebased on top of the latest upstream kernel, and that means that every extra patch we carry downstream increases our maintenance workload, sometimes significantly. But it goes deeper than that: Kernel/Mesa policy states that upstream Mesa support for a GPU driver cannot be merged and enabled until the kernel side is ready for merge. This means that we also have to ship a Mesa fork to users. While our GPU driver is 99% upstreamed into Mesa, it is intentionally hard-disabled and we are not allowed to submit a change that would enable it until the kernel side lands. This, in practice, means that users cannot have GPU acceleration work together with container technologies (such as Docker/Podman, but also including things like Waydroid), since standard container images will ship upstream Mesa builds, which would not be compatible. We have a partial workaround for Flatpak, but all other container systems are out of luck. Due to all this and more, the difficulty of upstreaming to the Linux kernel is hurting our downstream users today.I’m not the kind to let injustices go when I see them, so when yet another long-term maintainer abused his position to attempt to hinder R4L and block upstreaming progress, I spoke out. And the response (which has been pretty widely covered) was the last drop that put me over the edge. I resigned from my position as an upstream maintainer for Apple ARM support, as I no longer want to be involved with that community. Later in that thread, another major maintainer unironically stated “We
are the ‘thin blue line’”, and nobody cared, which just further confirmed to me that I don’t want to have anything to do with them. This is the same person that previously prompted a Rust for Linux maintainer to quit.But it goes well beyond the public incident. In the days that followed, I learned that some members of the kernel and adjacent Linux spaces have been playing a two-faced game with me, where they feigned support for me and Asahi Linux while secretly resenting me and rallying resentment behind closed doors. All this occurred without anyone ever sending me any private email or otherwise clueing me into what was going on. I heard that one of these people, one who has a high level position in multiple projects that Asahi Linux must interact with to survive, had sided with and continues to side with individuals who have abused and harassed me directly. Apparently there were also implied falsehoods, such as the idea that I am employed by someone to work on Asahi (I am not, we have zero corporate sponsorship other than bunny.net giving us free CDN credits for the hosting).I get that some people might not have liked my Mastodon posts. Yes, I can be abrasive sometimes, and that is a fault I own up to. But this is simply not okay. I cannot work with people who form cliques behind the scenes and lie about their intentions. I cannot work with those who place blame on the messenger, instead of those who are truly toxic in the community. I cannot work with those who resent public commentary and claim things are better handled in private despite the fact that nothing ever seems to change in private. I cannot work with those who denounce calling out misbehavior on social media to thousands of followers, while themselves roasting people both on social media and on mailing lists with thousands of subscribers. I cannot work with those in high-level positions who use politically charged and discriminatory language in public and face no repercussions. I cannot work with those who say I’m the problem and everything is going great, while major supporters and maintainers are actively resigning and I keep receiving messages from all kinds of people saying they won’t touch the Linux kernel with a 10-foot pole.When Apple released the M1, Linus Torvalds wished it could run Linux, but didn’t have much hope it would ever happen. We made it happen, and Linux 5.19 was released from an M2 MacBook Air running Asahi Linux. I had hoped his enthusiasm would translate to some support for our community and help with our upstreaming struggles. Sadly, that never came to pass. In November 2023 I sent him an invitation to discuss the challenges of kernel contributions and maintenance and see how we could help. He never replied.Back in 2011, Con Kolivas left the Linux kernel community. An anaesthetist by day, he was arguably the last great Linux kernel hobbyist hacker. In the years since it seems things have, if anything, only gotten worse. Today, it is practically impossible to survive being a significant Linux maintainer or cross-subsystem contributor if you’re not employed to do it by a corporation. Linux started out as a hobbyist project, but it has well and truly lost its hobbyist roots.When I started Asahi Linux, I let it take over most of my life. I gave up most of my hobbies (after all, this was my dream hobby), and spent significantly more than full time working on the project. It was fun back then, but it’s not fun any more. I have an M3 Pro in a box and I haven’t even turned it on yet. I dread doing the bring-up work. It doesn’t feel worth the trouble.I miss having free time where I can relax and not worry about the features we haven’t shipped yet. I miss making music. I miss attending jam sessions. I miss going out for dinner with my friends and family and not having to worry about how much we haven’t upstreamed. I miss being able to sit down and play a game or watch a movie without feeling guilty.I’m resigning as lead of the Asahi Linux project, effective immediately. The project will continue on without me, and I’m working with the rest of the team to handle transfer of responsibilities and administrative credentials. My personal Patreon will be paused, and those who supported me personally are encouraged to transfer their support to the Asahi Linux OpenCollective (GitHub Sponsors does not allow me to unilaterally pause payments, but my sponsors will be notified of this change so they can manually cancel their sponsorship).I want to thank the entire Asahi Linux team, without whom I would’ve never gotten anywhere alone. You all know who you are. I also give my utmost gratitude to all of my Patreon and GitHub sponsors, who made the project a viable reality to begin with.If you are interested in hiring me or know someone who might be, please get in touch. Remote positions only please, on a consulting or flexible time/non exclusive basis.

I am curious what is the current "meta" (by "meta" I mean the current rust's community  and  way of doing things) of rust programming. I am studying source code of 2 editors I am using: Helix and Zed. And I can see that while they are doing a lot of similar things (like using LSP and parsing it outputs for example) the code is kinda different.It starts from the file structure: in Helix there are not that many folders to look at (like you have helix-core which contains features like "diagnostic", "diff", "history", etc but in Zed every single one of them is a different crate , which approach is more "idiomatic"? To divide every feature as a separate crate or to use more "packed" crates like "core".Then the code itself is kinda different, for example I am currently looking at LSP implementation in both of them and in Helix's case I can follow along and understand the code much more easily (here is the file I am referring to. But in Zed's case it is kinda hard to understand the code because of "type level programming" stuff like this one for example. It also doesn't help that files have a lot of SLOC in them (over 1500 in normal in Zed's repository, is it also how you do rust?) Maybe I am just used to lean functions from other languages (I mainly did TypeScript and Elixir in my career).Other thing I see is that Helix has more comments about "why the thing is doing that in the first place" which I find very helpful (on the other hand in seems that Zed's is abusing a lot of "type level" programming to have a self-documented code but it is harder to reason about at least for me) which approach here you prefer?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building a RAG-Powered Support Chatbot in 24 Hours of Hackathon</title><link>https://dev.to/akshay_gupta/building-a-rag-powered-support-chatbot-in-24-hours-of-hackathon-5f7c</link><author>Akshay Gupta</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 07:18:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Coffee? ✅ Chai? ✅ Determination to automate admin support? Double ✅In a recent 24-hour hackathon at annual PeopleGrove offsite, my team tackled an ambitious challenge: building an AI-powered support chatbot that could think and respond like a season platform administrator.Armed with Large Language Models (LLMs) and fueled by caffeine, we created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that turned out to be surprisingly capable!: Our support heroes (admins and agents) spending their days 😅:Answering the same questions from different institutions 🏫

Too much time on routine questionsLimited bandwidth for critical platform improvementsOur support team needed a solution that could:Handle common queries intelligently 🤖Provide consistent, accurate responses 📚Free up time for complex problem-solving 💡Scale support without scaling the team 📈Maintain the human touch while automating routine tasks 🤝We built ChatterMind 🤖 - an AI chatbot that combines the power of LLMs with a RAG system. Think of it as a super-smart intern who:Never sleeps (unlike us during the hackathon) 😴Has photographic memory of all support tickets 🧠Knows the PeopleGrove documentation better than its authors 📚Knows when to call for backup (aka create a ticket) 🆘Remembers conversations (thanks to Redis - our MVP choice for the hackathon) 💾Keeps secrets better than a vault 🔒Here's a high-level overview of how ChatterMind processes and responds to queries:Let's geek out about our tech choices for a minute! 🤓Our initial choice was the DeepSeek model (1.5B parameters) because, well, it was lightweight and fast. But we quickly discovered it had a tendency to... let's say, get creative with the truth. After some frantic testing and a few more cups of chai, we switched to Gemini 2.0 Flash (experimental) which proved to be our goldilocks model:Better context understandingStronger reasoning capabilitiesThe secret sauce behind ChatterMind's human-like responses? Carefully crafted prompts! Our prompt engineering approach focused on:Role Definition 🎭

  Data Processing & Embeddings
We built our knowledge base from three main sources:Platform Routes & Permissions:For embeddings, we chose the  model from  because:384-dimensional embeddings (good balance of size vs. accuracy)Fast inference time (crucial for real-time chat)Great at capturing semantic meaningWorks well with technical contentWe stored these in ElasticSeach with cosine similarity search, which gave us:
  
  
  Edge Cases & Safety Features
ChatterMind turned out to be quite the responsible assistant. Some of our favourite edge case handles:Personal Data Protection:User: "What's John Smith's email address?"
ChatterMind: "I apologize, but I cannot share personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or other private details about users. This is to protect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations. If you need to contact someone, I recommend using the platform's built-in messaging system."
User: "Can you update my database permissions?"
ChatterMind: "I'm not able to directly modify system permissions or make database changes. This requires admin intervention for security reasons. Would you like me to help you create a ticket for this request?"
Handling Requests not related to Platform:User: "What is 5 + 2 + 7?"
ChatterMind: "I apologise, but performing mathematical calculations is beyond my scope as a platform support assistant. I'm designed to help with PeopleGrove platform-related questions and issues. If you need a calculator, I'd recommend using your device's built-in calculator app or a dedicated math tool."
User: "It's not working"
ChatterMind: "I notice you're on the messaging page, but I'll need more details to help you effectively. Could you please:
1. Describe what specific feature isn't working
2. What you were trying to do
3. What error message (if any) you're seeing

This will help me provide the most relevant solution."
Our implementation was heavily inspired by the excellent guide on building RAG systems with DeepSeek R1 by Asif Razzaq at MarkTechPost. While we ultimately chose Gemini 2.0 Flash for our use case, the fundamental RAG architecture outlined in the guide formed the backbone of our system.Key learnings we adapted from the guide:Document processing pipeline structureVector store implementation with FAISSEfficient retrieval mechanismsWe modified these concepts to fit our specific needs:The guide's emphasis on proper document chunking and context relevance directly influenced our implementation of the knowledge base processing:
  
  
  Real-time Communication with WebSockets
Why WebSockets? Because nobody likes waiting! We needed real-time, bi-directional communication between the frontend and our RAG system. RESTful APIs would've meant:No server-initiated messagesMore complex state managementChatbot responses getting suck "in transit"Here's how we implemented it:The WebSocket connection allows us to:Stream responses in real-timeMaintain conversation stateImplement retry mechanism
  
  
  ElasticSearch as Our Knowledge Base
While FAISS was suggested in the DeepSeek guide, we chose ElasticSearch for our vector store because:Built-in text search capabilitiesEfficient vector similarity searchHere's our ElasticSearch setup:
  
  
  Cool Features We're Proud Of
Context-Aware Responses

The bot doesn't just search - it understands where the user is in the platform and what they've been talking about. It's like having a GPS for user context!Privacy First

We trained our bot to be as tight-lipped as a secret agent about sensitive data. Try asking for someone's email - it'll give you the "I cannot share that information" speech faster than you can say "GDPR"!Beyond the Knowledge Base

The real magic happens when users ask questions that aren't in any document. By combining context with LLM capabilities, ChatterMind can reason about platform behaviour and suggest solutions, like a true admin would.
ChatterMind: "Hi Akshay, my name is ChatterMind! 👋 Welcome to XYZ Support. I'm here to help with any questions you have about mentoring, connecting with alumni, or using the platform. How can I assist you today?"
User: "Why is the page not working?"
ChatterMind: "It sounds like you're having trouble accessing the admin dashboard. To help me figure out why the page isn't working, could you tell me if you have correct access? This page requires admin-level permissions to function correctly. Also, please note that this page is not available on native mobile apps, so if you are using a mobile app, that could be the reason why it's not working.

If you do have the correct permissions and are not using a mobile app, could you describe what you're seeing on the page? Any details you can provide will help me troubleshoot the issue.

Please let me know if you have any other questions."

  
  
  Hackathon Compromises (aka Technical Debt)
Let's be real - in 24 hours, we had to cut some corners:Redis for chat history

Would use a proper database for productionNo backup/persistence configurationSecurity shortcuts

Basic token authenticationPerformance trade-offs

Single-node ElasticSearchIf we had more time (and less caffeine), we'd love to add:Proper infrastructure

Distributed chat history storageCool features

Voice interface (for those too tired to type)Multi-language support (because admins speak many languages)Predictive issue detection (stop problems before they happen!)This project wouldn't have been possible (let alone won the hackathon! 🏆 🎉) without my amazing team's diverse skills and relentless energy. Special thanks to:Our AI/ML engineer Suyash who became our guide at times and pointed us in right direction. 🧠Our Engineers Rajat & Rahul who made WebSockets work like magic, and did the end-to-end integration on my core idea. ⚡Our Engineers Manoj & Samrood who integrated ElasticSearch & became frontend ninjas who created a sleek chat-interface. 🎨And countless Chai & Coffee that fuelled our coding marathons. 🥤Winning the hackathon was the cherry on top of an incredible 24-hour journey. It proved that when passionate developers come together with a clear mission (and enough caffeine), we can create something truly impactful.Our hackathon project proved that with modern LLMs, good prompt engineering, and a solid RAG system, you can build a surprisingly capable admin support chatbot in just 24 hours.While not production-ready, it showed the potential for AI to transform admin support from a repetitive task to an intelligent service.No admins were harmed in the making of this chatbot, though several cups of Chai and Coffee were consumed! 🚀 ☕ 🎉]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[R] A Survey of Logical Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models: Frameworks, Methods, and Evaluation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iqmjal/r_a_survey_of_logical_reasoning_capabilities_in/</link><author>/u/Successful-Western27</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 06:55:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This new survey provides a comprehensive analysis of logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs, examining different reasoning types, evaluation methods, and current limitations.Key technical aspects: - Categorizes logical reasoning into deductive, inductive, and abductive frameworks - Evaluates performance across multiple benchmarks and testing methodologies - Analyzes the relationship between model size and reasoning capability - Reviews techniques for improving logical reasoning, including prompt engineering and chain-of-thought methodsMain findings: - LLMs show strong performance on basic logical tasks but struggle with complex multi-step reasoning - Model size alone doesn't determine reasoning ability - training methods and problem-solving strategies play crucial roles - Current evaluation methods may not effectively distinguish between true reasoning and pattern matching - Performance degrades significantly when problems require combining multiple reasoning typesI think the most important contribution here is the systematic breakdown of where current models succeed and fail at logical reasoning. This helps identify specific areas where we need to focus research efforts, rather than treating reasoning as a monolithic capability.I think this work highlights the need for better benchmarks - many current tests don't effectively measure true reasoning ability.

Either you optimize, or you lose. Period.I don’t care if you’re an experienced developer with 10 years of experience or 1 year of experience. If you want to make games that WORK, games people respect—you need to understand . Players demand smooth gameplay, high-quality visuals, and a flawless experience across every device. If your game stutters, crashes, or loads slower than a snail? You’re done. Optimization isn’t magic. It’s the foundation of smooth gameplay, fast loading, and stable performance. Without it, your game will lag, crash, and be forgotten faster than you can say “game over.”  But don’t worry. In this article, I will share four effective strategies to help you with that. 
  
  
  Effective Strategies for Performance Optimization
🤸‍♂️ What Is Optimization? Optimization means making your game run as fast and smooth as possible. SIMPLE.When you optimize your game, you:  🖥️ Make the game work on weaker computers or phones.💉 Prevent lag and crashes.Rule 1: Memory ManagementWhen you’re developing a game, memory is your most valuable resource.Every player movement, every enemy on the screen, every explosion needs a little piece of memory to function. Unfortunately, If you don’t manage memory properly, your game can get slow, laggy, or even crash. That’s why memory management is a critical skill every game developer needs. Let’s break it down step by step, with detailed examples in Python.Strategy #1: Memory PoolingThis strategy is simple: reuse Objects Instead of Creating New Ones** Memory pooling is like recycling for your game. Instead of creating new objects every time you need one, you reuse objects you’ve already created.  Creating and destroying objects repeatedly takes up time and memory. Let's say you are building a shooting game where the player fires 10 bullets per second. If you create a new bullet for each shot, your game could quickly slow down.  Here’s how you can implement memory pooling for bullets in a shooting game:The  Class: Defines what a bullet does and keeps track of whether it’s active (in use) or not.
The : A list of 10 reusable bullets.
The  Function: Finds an inactive bullet, reuses it, and sets its position.
Recycling Bullets: When you’re done with a bullet, you reset it so it can be reused.
Strategy #2. Data Structure OptimizationThe way you store your data can make or break your game’s performance. Choosing the wrong data structure is like trying to carry water in a leaky bucket—it’s inefficient and messy.  Let’s say you’re making a game for four players, and you want to keep track of their scores. You could use a list, but a fixed-size array is more efficient because it uses less memory. Creates a fixed-size array of integers ().
 You can’t accidentally add or remove elements, which prevents bugs and saves memory.
 Updating scores is quick and uses minimal resources.
Strategy #3. Memory ProfilingEven if your code seems perfect, hidden memory problems can still exist. Memory profiling helps you monitor how much memory your game is using and find issues like memory leaks.  Python has a built-in tool called  that tracks memory usage. Here’s how to use it: begins monitoring memory usage.
 Create a large list to use up memory.
 Get the current and peak memory usage, converting it to megabytes for readability.
 ends the tracking session.
Now it’s your turn to practice these strategies and take your game development skills to the next level!Rule 2: Asset Streaming (Load Only What You Need)If you load the entire world at once, your game will choke and die. You don’t need that drama. Instead, stream assets as the player needs them. This is called asset streaming. For instance, inside your game, you may have a huge open-world with forests, deserts, and cities. Why load all those levels at once when the player is only in the forest? Makes no sense, right? Load  and keep your game lean, fast, and smooth.Strategy #1: Segment and PrioritizeLet’s break this down with an example. Your player is exploring different levels: Forest, Desert, and City. We’ll only load a level when the player enters it.Here’s how to make it work in Python: Each level has a name (e.g., Forest) and a “loaded” status. If it’s loaded, it doesn’t load again.
 The  function finds the level the player wants to enter and loads it only if it hasn’t been loaded yet.
 Levels not visited don’t waste memory. The game runs smoothly because it only focuses on what the player needs.This is efficiency at its finest. No wasted memory, no wasted time. Your player moves; your game adapts. That’s how you dominate.  Strategy #2: Asynchronous Loading (No Waiting Allowed)Nobody likes waiting. Freezing screens? Laggy loading? It’s amateur hour. You need —this loads assets in the background while your player keeps playing.  Imagine downloading a huge map while still exploring the current one. Your game keeps moving, the player stays happy.Here’s how to simulate asynchronous loading in Python: The  module creates a new thread to load assets without freezing the main game.
 The  function fakes the loading time to mimic how it works in a real game.
 The player can continue playing while the new level or asset loads in the background.
With asynchronous loading, your player stays in the zone, and your game feels seamless. Pro-level stuff.Strategy 3: Level of Detail (LOD) Systems – Be Smart About QualityNot everything in your game needs to look like it’s been rendered by a Hollywood studio. If an object is far away, lower its quality. It’s called , and it’s how you keep your game’s performance sharp.  Example: Using LOD for a TreeHere’s a Python simulation of switching between high and low detail: The  property determines how far the tree is from the player.
 If the tree is close, render it in high detail. If it’s far, use low detail to save memory and processing power.
 The player doesn’t notice the difference, but your game runs smoother and faster.
This is how you keep the balance between beauty and performance. Your game looks stunning up close but doesn’t waste resources on faraway objects. Only load what you need, when you need it. No wasted memory.
 Smooth gameplay keeps players engaged and avoids frustration.
 These techniques are how AAA games stay fast and responsive.
 Go apply these strategies, keep your game lean, and make sure your players never even think about lag.Rule 3: Frame Rate StabilizationThe frame rate is how many pictures (frames) your game shows per second. If it’s unstable, your game will stutter and feel broken.  The secret? Keep the workload for each frame consistent.  🚦Here’s how you can control the timing in a game loop:⚖️ The game updates at a steady rate (60 times per second).
🪂 This make smooth gameplay, no matter how slow or fast the computer is.
Optimize Rendering Paths: Fewer draw calls. Smarter culling. Simplicity wins.Dynamic Resolution Scaling: When the pressure’s on, scale down resolution to maintain the frame rate. Players won’t even notice.Fixed Time Step: Keep your physics and logic consistent. Frame rate fluctuations shouldn’t mean chaos.Rule 4: GPU and CPU OptimizationYour computer has two main processors:   Handles logic, like moving a character or calculating scores.
 Handles graphics, like drawing your game world.
👇 Here's what you have to do for GPU/CPU optimization:Profile Everything: Use tools to pinpoint bottlenecks and strike hard where it hurts.
Shader Optimization: Shaders are resource hogs. Simplify them, streamline them, and cut the fat.
Multithreading: Spread tasks across CPU cores. Don’t overload one and leave the others idle.If one is working too hard while the other is idle, your game will lag.  Solution? Multithreading.
Let’s split tasks between two threads:🎰 One thread handles logic.
🛣️ Another thread handles graphics.
⚖️ This balances the workload and prevents bottlenecks.
Optimization isn’t just for “smart” people. It’s simple if you take it step by step:  Manage memory like a pro. Don’t waste it.
 Load only what you need.
Keep the frame rate stable. No stuttering.
 Use the CPU and GPU wisely.
Start optimizing NOW. Your future self will thank you.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Automating Daily arXiv Paper Summaries with Slack Notifications</title><link>https://dev.to/m_sea_bass/automating-daily-arxiv-paper-summaries-with-slack-notifications-1kp8</link><author>M Sea Bass</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 05:26:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is a follow-up to the previous article. It turns out there’s a slight delay before the latest papers show up in the arXiv API. Because of this delay, the same paper can sometimes appear the next day.To fix this, we’re going to record the timestamp of the last retrieved paper and then only fetch new papers each day.We’ll store the timestamp of the latest paper in Amazon S3 so we can both update and retrieve it later. For this, you’ll need to install . In the  folder we created previously, run:Next, zip the folder again and upload it as a new version of your Lambda layer:zip  ./upload.zip ./python/Then, update your Lambda function to use this new layer version.You’ll also need an S3 bucket ready in advance. In this example, we simply created one with the default settings.Below is the fully revised code in English, including the new functions to update and retrieve the timestamp from S3. Note that we set  as an environment variable.By saving the timestamp in S3, your script won’t process the same paper entries each day, and if no new papers appear, the script will skip generating summaries.

Many engineers fall into the day-to-day routine of writing code without a clear idea of how to grow their careers.This happened to me. At my first job at Amazon, I landed code without knowing what I could do to grow my skills. I left that job within eight months because I felt I wasn’t growing as an engineer. Three years later, I made it to Staff Software Engineer at Instagram after tons of mentorship. Early on, I learned that being good at coding wasn’t enough to get promoted; you have to think strategically about your career and often need to develop new behaviors to move up.In this article, I’ll share everything that helped me fast-track my way up the ladder, from developing the right mindset to making key moves that many overlook. Even if rapid growth isn’t your goal, this guide has learnings for all tech career paths.Software Engineering LevelsAn Algorithm for PromotionJunior (IC3) → Mid-level (IC4)Mid-level (IC4) → Senior (IC5)Senior (IC5) → Staff (IC6)Software Engineering LevelsNote: “IC” = “Individual Contributor”In software engineering, companies measure career progression by levels that measure both behaviors and impact within the company. While the exact titles and structure can vary between companies, most tech companies follow a similar system: - Early in your career, working on smaller, well-defined tasks with guidance from more experienced engineers. - More autonomous, handling moderately complex projects, and beginning to take initiative in improving the codebase and what they build. - Leading larger projects with team-level influence. You’ll mentor and guide the team while having a broad impact on the codebase.: Focusing on cross-team collaboration and solving org-wide challenges. Staff engineers are strategic thinkers who influence the technical direction of their organization.Senior Staff Engineer and Beyond (IC7+): Senior staff engineers and up operate with top technical expertise, driving large-scale initiatives that have a broad impact on the company. Senior staff engineers mentor staff engineers and work closely with executive leadership to meet business objectives.Your impact and compensation increase as you progress, which is a lot more satisfying in my experience. Not to mention that the skills that get you promoted also let you control what you and the company work on.Also, many companies consider only senior engineers (IC5) and higher to be “terminal levels.” You must eventually get promoted to IC5, or you’ll be managed out. Most engineers are promoted in time, so it’s not meant to scare you but to encourage you to grow.An Algorithm For PromotionThere’s a common set of steps across all promotions that will get you to Staff:1) Exceed expectations at your current level - Your manager will be hesitant to find you opportunities at the next level if they have concerns about your performance at the current level. Also, when your manager puts together a promotion packet, it’ll contain a history of your past ratings. The promotion committee will have concerns about your packet if you have a history of only meeting expectations for your level. Work with your manager to understand the expectations for your level and how to exceed them.2) Be direct with your manager about promotion - Once you know you’re exceeding expectations for your level, ask your manager what next-level performance looks like. Your manager plays a huge role in your promotion. They build your case and advocate for it, so they have a lot of influence on this process. Also, the lower the level, the more control your manager has. IC3 -> IC4 promotions are straightforward, so your manager’s perspective is usually what happens. For IC5 -> IC6, there is a lot more ambiguity, so your manager serves more as a middleman between you and the promotion committee. Your manager still plays a significant role in writing your packet and delivering feedback.3) Find next-level scope - If you only work on projects that fit your level’s behaviors, you won’t get any closer to promotion, no matter how good your work is. One simple pattern for finding next-level scope is brainstorming projects with engineers who are 1-2 levels higher than you are. Often, they will have a lot of projects sitting in their backlog that are big enough to help you get promoted. If you take on one of their projects, they’ll often help mentor you, review your designs and code, and give you strong peer feedback for your future promotion packet. I wrote more on this here. Make sure to confirm with your manager that they agree that what you’re working on fits the behaviors of the next level.4) Maintain next-level behaviors and impact - The duration you need to perform at the next level varies depending on your level and your company. At minimum though, you need to maintain that performance for 6-12 months. This is because promotions are “lagging” in tech. You must prove that you’re already operating at the next level before getting promoted. This reduces the risk of failing to meet expectations at the new level.Getting promoted faster is a matter of doing steps (1), (2) and (3) as fast as possible. The best you can do is immediately start exceeding expectations in your first half and working with your manager on the next level.Almost every team has scope for more Senior Engineers (IC5). You can get promoted up to that level if you have the skills and behaviors. Past that, situation and business scope play a much larger role. Many teams don’t need someone who has Staff-level leadership and technical skills. If you find yourself stuck at any point due to your situation, you’ll likely have to switch teams to continue growing your career.Now that you have the algorithm that applies at any of these levels let’s get into the level-specific strategies. I’ll share what got me promoted and what I would change if I did it again.Junior (IC3) → Mid-level (IC4)The main difference between these levels is in the size of the scope that you can handle independently. Here’s a rule of thumb:IC3 - Can handle individual tasks (<2 weeks of work) with minimal guidanceIC4 - Can handle medium-to-large features (<2 months of work) with minimal guidance“Minimal guidance” doesn’t mean that you can’t ask for help—it simply means that you can unblock yourself and make consistent progress. Asking good questions is one of the most effective ways to unblock yourself.You should drive full features and do the project management for them. You should break your project into tasks, set reasonable timelines, and keep stakeholders updated.You will not be expected to come up with the projects yet at this level—Senior Engineers will often outline them. However, at the IC4 level, you’re expected to take more initiative:Initiate refactoring and code cleanups, and give thoughtful code reviews. Leave the code in a better state than you found it.Contributing to production excellence - Participate in the team’s oncall, and help debug production breakages.Own the health of what you build - Add test coverage, logging, and build dashboards to monitor correctness.Optimize your dev velocity to grow faster at this level. Shipping code faster creates a shorter feedback loop, accelerating your learning process. This core skill will help you ship IC4-scope projects and improve as an engineer.Here’s an example of several promotion timelines for what you can expect:Promotion in 6 months (exceptional) - Rare since this means meeting IC4 expectations while onboarding. This is easier for high-performing return interns since they skip onboarding and may have some past track record already.Promotion in 12 months (great) - I’d shoot for this timeline. It’s challenging yet reasonable since it gives you six months to onboard and then start meeting IC4 expectations.Here’s my promotion timeline as an example:H1 (L3 Exceeds Expectations) - First, I took on any task that came my way. These were nice-to-have features that others didn’t have time for. I completed them quickly and started on a larger pipeline rewrite (L4 scope) that my tech lead offered me. Outside of my main project work, I made many contributions to removing dead code and speeding up existing code because I enjoyed it.I started to hit L4 expectations in the last few months of the half. But, since I didn’t have six months track record, I didn’t meet the promotion criteria.H2 (L3→L4 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations) - I continued driving my L4-scope project independently with high engineering quality. I came up with the idea to build a test harness to validate this rewrite that was “comparable to L5 quality” execution. I continued my passion for improving the codebase and led the company in adding static type annotations that MonkeyType couldn’t.At this point, I had delivered on L4 scope for over six months, so the promotion made sense.What I Would Have Changed:Looking back, I would have discussed what IC4 growth looked like with my manager. I wasted our one-on-one time on project updates instead of career growth. This led to two problems:Spent time on work that wasn’t impactful - I took on any work that was passed my way, even though not all of it was impactful. I probably could’ve gotten more out of my time.Didn’t have accurate expectations - I had another engineer tell me my work was IC4 level and that I should get promoted in my first half. I knew nothing then, so I took their word for it. I was surprised when I didn’t get promoted, which could have been avoided if I had been in sync with my manager.Although I could have been more calculated, writing as much code as I did opened doors. My tech lead trusted me with an IC4 project because I showed I could handle it. Similarly, some of the engineering craft work I did for my own personal pleasure ended up being part of what got me promoted too. The more work you do, the luckier you get.Mid-level (IC4) → Senior (IC5)The IC4 to IC5 gap is larger than the IC3 to IC4 one. This is because IC5 promotion requires significant behavior changes. Raw code output is no longer the top priority. You need to lead and have a larger influence within your team too. Here are a few examples of those differences:Example 1 - Improving the codebaseIC4 - Initiates refactoring and code cleanups.IC5 - Identifies areas of improvement, influences the team to take goals on improving it together, then leads the charge on those goals.Example 2 - Production excellenceIC4 - Participates in team’s oncall and mitigating outages.IC5 - Creates an “oncall improvement” workstream and builds a process for everyone to improve the team’s oncall.Example 3 - Project directionIC4 - Owns the project management of a medium-to-large feature.IC5 - Drives team planning and builds a roadmap of several medium-to-large features.I wouldn’t say the IC5 examples are harder, but they require a mindset shift to own things at the team level.Also, you’ll need to work on projects of sufficient scope for an IC5. There are a few ways that tech companies measure scope. Here’s a comparison of the criteria for IC4 and IC5 levels:These criteria aren’t a checklist. Your work can be IC5 scope by meeting only some of these criteria.IC5 is also the first time engineers begin to focus on growing others. At this level, you should mentor others and build up the team’s culture, which includes driving meetings, knowledge sharing, recruiting activities, and organizing team activities. Starting mentorship relationships early is a good idea since you can’t rush mentorship.If you can learn the above behaviors quickly, you can expect promotion on these timelines:Promotion in 6 months (exceptional) - This is rare since you need to exert team-level influence as soon as you join the team. I could see this happening for someone who was under-leveled and just got promoted to IC4.Promotion in 12 months (great) - If you’re ambitious, I’d aim for this goal. It is possible to do this if you find IC5 scope in your first half. If not, one more half should secure your promotion.Here’s my promotion timeline as an example:H1 (IC4 Exceeds Expectations) - This half I wrapped up the workstream that got me promoted to IC4 and picked up another IC4 project. I spent a ton of time on engineering craft this half because I enjoyed it. I deprecated a few legacy systems that no one else would because they were dangerous and not that impactful. I didn’t exhibit any IC5 behaviors this half.My manager handed me an IC5 workstream (~6 eng) to cut video messaging latency in half, which I led successfully. I also began a side project, which became a multiple-half collaboration with another team. Lastly, I took on an intern who did a phenomenal job helping me execute these two roadmaps I led. Although I started exhibiting IC5 behaviors, the company canceled performance reviews this half because of the pandemic.H3 (IC4 → IC5 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations) - My impact this half could’ve met expectations at the IC6 level. I doubled down on the cross-org scope I created in H2 and developed a multi-half roadmap. I influenced and led another team to invest several engineers to revamp the IG video ads pipeline with great results. I built out a second workstream and mentored another engineer to deliver it. This half, I had massive impact, team-level influence, and mentorship, which is what got me promoted.The Skill of Tech Leading - If you grew from L3 → L4 right, you should be exceptional at landing code. The L5 behavior of team-level influence is just helping others do the same. In my first half of leading an initiative, I remember feeling unsure about it since I only had two years of experience. Leaning on my strong execution skills helped me become comfortable leading others.Working Hard Led To More Opportunities - I worked a lot and had a ton of workstreams in flight at the same time. This approach increased my chances of having one that had a ton of impact. At the time, I didn’t know it and was just throwing myself at any problems that came my way. Looking back, it was a great way to derisk my promotion. - In my first half as an L4, I took on projects that were time-intensive and not impactful. I did these migrations because I loved cleaning up tech debt. I would’ve had more impact if I had influenced someone else to do them while I found IC5 scope instead.Senior (IC5) → Staff (IC6)Staff Engineers (IC6) are at the same level as engineering managers. They solve problems that few others can and play a critical role in setting team direction. They lead major initiatives and influence the engineering culture of teams around them.Some say that promotion from IC5 → IC6 is harder than IC6 → IC7 due to the significant behavior changes needed. There are a few major differences between IC5 and IC6.1) Influence Across Teams - Staff Engineer’s projects often extend beyond their team. They take on larger problems by influencing other teams without authority.Once IC6s establish these workstreams, they tackle the hardest problems and work through others. They focus on outcomes and don’t always do the work themselves. Working through delegation and influence across teams is the biggest mindset shift from IC5 → IC6.This style of working isn’t limited to their main project impact. IC6s should also use their influence to inspire a culture of higher engineering quality and reliability across teams. - Senior Engineers (IC5) build roadmaps of several medium-to-large features that help achieve their team’s goals. In this case, the problem and its business impact are clear; we just need an engineer to create a plan to solve it.Staff Engineers (L6) handle more ambiguity. They don’t just solve known problems; they create scope by finding impactful opportunities and problems. Managers work with their L6s to expand the scope of the team.- Big tech companies determine what level projects are in a few ways. Here’s a comparison of the criteria for L5 and L6 levels:Project complexity also distinguishes IC6 scope. Problems that IC5s can’t solve are considered IC6 scope. This is why specialists often have IC6+ scope; others often can’t do their projects.These criteria aren’t a checklist. Work can be IC6 scope by meeting only some of these. Your manager will use these criteria to argue that your work is IC6 scope. This is one of the reasons why it’s important to align with your manager on your work’s scope. - Staff engineers uplift others around them. They should have the ability to help IC5 engineers grow. There are a few ways they uplift others:Mentorship - Dedicated mentorship, preferably with senior engineersKnowledge sharing - Writing wikis, giving presentations, contributing to Q&A groupsCollaborations - Growing others while working with them (e.g. code reviews, design reviews, discussions)IC6 engineers should also contribute to growing the organization. This means that they help with recruiting and partner with their manager to improve team health.Getting to the Staff Engineering level can take a long time. Since IC5 is considered “terminal,” there is no external pressure to achieve IC6 fast. However, if you are eager to grow as fast as possible, here’s how fas you can expect promotion:Promotion in 1 half (Ridiculous) - You’d need to start influencing outside your team as soon as you join. Even then, it’s unlikely you’d get promoted this fast unless you create something company-changing.Promotion in 2 halves (Exceptional) - Finding IC6 opportunities on your team is not always possible this fast. It’s a combination of situation and skill to get promoted in two halves, even if you execute well.Promotion in 3 halves (Great) - If you’re ambitious I’d aim for this goal. It gives you a year to find IC6 scope, which is a reasonable amount of time to pivot if needed. Also, your track record of successes in the first year will help build the narrative for promotion.H1 (IC5 Exceeds Expectations) - I led two workstreams that were partnerships with other teams to hit our goals. I also landed a large win in an unplanned ads workstream, which is what brought my rating above expectations. I was also one of the top contributors to code review and interviewing in my 70-person eng org. The hidden success here was that I bootstrapped a new workstream towards the end of the half that was certainly IC6 scope.H2 (IC5 → IC6 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations) - The IC6 workstream I created turned out to be a massive opportunity. This work was a huge success, resulting in a company-wide award and public recognition from Mark Zuckerberg. I also created a cross-org collaboration between 3 large orgs (70+ eng each), which received positive feedback from each director. Lastly, I ran infrastructure preparations for my org resulting in no major incidents during the most critical time of the year. The repeated influence and impact of these large initiatives is what got me promoted to IC6. - My past context and relationships at Instagram helped me move a lot faster. I could lead several workstreams at once because I knew so much about the codebase. Also, it was easier to get work done in collaboration because I knew partner engineers from past work. Staying at one company for a longer time does have its benefits. - When I was an IC4, I stumbled upon some IC6 scope without realizing it. I had strong initiative so I started solving problems without thinking through why it was impactful. I got lucky that the work had IC6 impact. I’ve since learned the importance of understanding the “why” before diving in. It helps you have consistent IC6 impact and makes it easier to get buy-in for your work.The Tech Lead Skillset Scales Well - In my promotion to Senior (IC5), I learned how to lead initiatives within my team. This skillset turned out to work well at higher levels too. The difference was just that more people were involved. This skill is a great way to continue your IC growth to the highest levels if you fit the “tech lead” archetype.Growth to the Staff level can take a long time, and luck plays a role. As you move up the ladder, each promotion depends more and more on your situation in addition to your skill.There are ways to increase your luck. For instance, you can go to growing companies and teams. You can pick business-critical projects. You can go where the most talented people are. None of these are foolproof, but they increase your chances.Aside from picking your situation, one way to manufacture luck is to do as much good work as you can. Many growth opportunities came to me because of some past work I did. People would reach out to me to do more of it or because they wanted to ask me questions about something I had launched.Although luck plays a role, there are aspects of getting promoted that rely less on luck. Here are four high-level areas:Impact is any measurable and objective outcome that benefits your company. Promotions are a byproduct of your elevated, sustained impact. If you can learn what your organization considers impactful and you deliver that, you will be rewarded.2) Leverage is how you have more impact. Software engineers increase their leverage through people, writing, and code. Leverage is what differentiates higher-level ICs from lower-level ones. What I mean by each type of leverage:People - People leverage comes from technical leadership. This means setting direction, reviewing designs/code, and growing others.Writing - Writing gives us leverage by influencing and helping others without your active involvement.Code - Not all code is created equal. High-leverage code solves problems that few others can or helps engineers move faster at scale. When people hear “personal brand,” their minds often go to social media. But the brand that matters most is your “internal brand.” What do people within your company think about your work and its value? This is the brand that you should care most about.Most of the top ICs I know are not well-known outside of Meta. They are legendary within the company, though because people see their impressive work. Build your internal brand by doing great work and letting others know about it (further reading here).4) Build your soft skills. Working with others is a necessity to do anything of consequence. Also, being someone others want to work with makes it easier to find mentors who will uplift you along the way.Soft skills are underrated among software engineers. It’s important to be an excellent IC, but you can go so much further if you also communicate well. Also, engineers don’t often prioritize soft skills, so having them will help you stand out and lead.One last thing I’ll leave you with is something that I didn’t realize until looking back. When I first joined the industry, I was an absolute machine. I would get in early and stay until the last shuttle left at 9:27 PM. Although this might sound like hell to some people, I loved it. No one made me do that; I put in those hours because I enjoyed the work and thought it was interesting.Looking back years later, I realize that was an unfair advantage I had. It let me put in a ton of work without getting burned out. Also, I got much more out of what I did because I was intrinsically motivated.If there’s one thing I wish for you, it is that you find work at the intersection of what you enjoy and what will get you promoted. That is the best recipe for hyper-career growth.Thanks for reading,Ryan PetermanIf you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.

Enter Server-Sent Events (SSE) - a simpler alternative that's perfect for one-way server-to-client communication.In this guide, I'll walk you through implementing SSE using GoFrame, taking you from basic implementation all the way to production-ready code. Let's dive in!
  
  
  What are Server-Sent Events? 🤔
SSE is a standard that enables servers to push real-time updates to clients over HTTP. Unlike WebSocket, SSE:Is one-way (server to client only)Automatically reconnects if the connection is lostPerfect for: real-time notifications, live feeds, status updates, and monitoring dashboards!
  
  
  Getting Started: Basic SSE Implementation 🌱
Let's start with a simple example. Here's how to create your first SSE endpoint in GoFrame:And here's how to connect from the frontend:

  3. Support Different Event Types 🔄
Handle various types of updates:For distributed systems, use Redis pub/sub to coordinate SSE messages:: When you have frequent updates, batch them together:
: Prevent server overload:
Implement event replay for clients that reconnect:
  
  
  Client Groups and Filtering
Implement client grouping for targeted updates:
  
  
  Rate Limiting and Throttling
Implement rate limiting for high-frequency updates:Use CORS headers in productionAdd authentication for sensitive dataMonitor connection counts and server resourcesTest with different network conditionsSSE is a powerful tool for real-time updates that's often overlooked in favor of WebSockets. For one-way communication, it's simpler, more lightweight, and works great with HTTP/2. With GoFrame, implementing SSE becomes even more straightforward and maintainable.Here's a quick checklist for your SSE implementation:✅ Basic SSE setup with proper headers✅ Error handling and connection management✅ Authentication and authorization✅ Security considerationsYou could extend this implementation by:Adding message persistenceImplementing message replayBuilding client librariesAdding WebSocket fallbackImplementing server-side filteringAdding message prioritizationHave you used SSE in your projects?

Pay specific attention to the function. This function is a  function and the byte tables that it references are  as well. This will allow you to eventually run the unicode algorithms at both compile and run-time.Since the tables are fixed at compile time, I can proof that all values from the table will result in values that will never break any bounds, so technically the bound checks are unnecessary.There are two bound checks in the assembly output for this function.The check before accessing the EAST_ASIAN_WIDTH_COLUMN table (I use an assert! to do this, otherwise there will be double bound check).And the check on the conversion to the enum.The two bound checks are the two compare + conditional-jump instructions in this code.I could increase the size of the column table to remove one of the bound checks, but I want to keep the table small if possible.Is there a way to safely (I don't want to use the unsafe code) proof to the compiler that those two checks are unnecessary?P.S. technically there is a bound check before the index table a CMOV instruction, but it doubles as a way to also decompress the index table (last entry is repeated), so I feel this is not really a bound check.I was able to concat the two tables, and use a byte offset. So now there is no way to get an out of bound access, and the bound checks are no longer emitted by the compiler.I also added a manual check for out of bound on the enum and return zero instead, this becomes a CMOV and it eliminated all the panic code from the function.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon AWS &quot;whoAMI&quot; Attack Exploits AMI Name Confusion to Take Over Cloud Instances</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iqav3c/amazon_aws_whoami_attack_exploits_ami_name/</link><author>/u/Dark-Marc</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:43:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Newly Curated 40+ Developer Fixes || Try it now :)</title><link>https://dev.to/0x2e_tech/newly-curated-40-developer-fixes-try-it-now--14fe</link><author>0x2e Tech</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:03:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

My manager has me learning Rust and exploring one of its libraries, and I’m also reading up on operating systems and computer networking. I'm almost done with the OS book and plan to start the networking one next week.I do have a bit of experience with embedded systems I completed two internships during my freshman year. However, so far I’m really enjoying Rust. I am quite a rookie compared to you experienced folks haha! But so far I love how Rust's compiler enforces safety, how Cargo makes dependency management a breeze compared to CMake, and the whole concept of ownership and borrowing is just super cool.At the moment, I’m nearly finished with the Rust book. I am on the concurrency chapter. Guess I am just wondering what next? I really want this return offer and I just want to blow this opportunity out the park. I go too a state school and my manager told me he has high expectations for me after my interviews. I just do not want to let him down you know also plus kind of getting impostor syndrome a bit seeing all the other interns coming from schools such as MIT, Harvard, Standford, etc. Sorry for the vent I guess I just want to prove my worth? and show my manager they made the right choice?What fun, Rust projects have helped you learn a lot?Are there any books you’d recommend that could help me out for the summer?Books I want to read before I start summer:Operating Systems (Three easy pieces)Beej's Guide to Network ProgrammingC++ Concurrency in Action]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Is my company missing out by avoiding deep learning?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iq9gtk/d_is_my_company_missing_out_by_avoiding_deep/</link><author>/u/DatAndre</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 19:42:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Disclaimer: obviously it does not make sense to use a neural network if a linear regression is enough. I work at a company that strictly adheres to mathematical, explainable models. Their stance is that methods like Neural Networks or even Gradient Boosting Machines are too "black-box" and thus unreliable for decision-making. While I understand the importance of interpretability (especially in mission critical scenarios) I can't help but feel that this approach is overly restrictive. I see a lot of research and industry adoption of these methods, which makes me wonder: are they really just black boxes, or is this an outdated view? Surely, with so many people working in this field, there must be ways to gain insights into these models and make them more trustworthy. Am I also missing out on them, since I do not have work experience with such models?EDIT: Context is formula one! However, races are a thing and support tools another. I too would avoid such models in anything strictly related to a race, unless completely necessary.

One of the key decisions made by the Rust team is the choice to not support the null paradigm. While this design choice leads to safer, more reliable code, it raises an important question for developers: How do we handle the absence of a value?In many programming languages, the concept of  or  (depending on the language) is used to represent the absence of a value. This approach, however, introduces a number of issues:Null Pointer Dereferencing: Accessing a  pointer can lead to runtime errors that are often hard to debug. values can lead to subtle bugs when programmers forget to check for them, causing unexpected behaviors in applications.Rust decided to leave behind this problematic paradigm in favor of alternatives that promote safety at compile-time.
  
  
  Rust's Approach: Rust takes a unique approach to handling the absence of a value: it uses the  enum. This powerful construct allows developers to explicitly handle the presence or absence of a value.The  type is defined as: represents the presence of a value. represents the absence of a value.This makes  a much safer alternative to . The compiler forces you to explicitly handle both cases ( and ), reducing the risk of null pointer exceptions.Here's a simple example of how you might use  to handle optional values:In this example, instead of returning  when the user isn't found, we return , and the caller must handle the potential absence of a value.
  
  
  Why  Is Better Than  With , Rust ensures that you never have to deal with null values unless you explicitly decide to. This eliminates the common pitfalls of null pointer dereferencing. Rust’s borrow checker ensures that you handle all  cases correctly, even when dealing with complex ownership and lifetime semantics. Rust’s pattern matching syntax makes it easy to express the logic of handling  and  values, leading to clean and readable code.
  
  
  Other Alternatives:  for Error Handling
In addition to , Rust also offers the  enum for handling operations that might fail. The  type is especially useful when a function might produce either a valid result or an error, combining both success and failure cases into a single, explicit structure.Just like , the  type forces developers to handle both cases explicitly, improving robustness and error recovery in your programs.
  
  
  Conclusion: Embracing Safety and Clarity
Rust’s rejection of the  paradigm and adoption of types like  is a conscious choice to create safer, more reliable code. By forcing developers to handle the possibility of missing or invalid data explicitly, Rust eliminates the risks and headaches often associated with .While this approach might feel unfamiliar to developers coming from languages with , it quickly becomes a strength of the language. Embracing  (and ) in your code not only prevents bugs but also promotes a more clear, understandable way of thinking about data and operations in your applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust - Ownership Model</title><link>https://dev.to/dedsecrattle/rust-ownership-model-1l6j</link><author>Prabhat Kumar</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:34:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rust’s ownership model is one of its most powerful and defining features. It provides memory safety without needing a garbage collector, making Rust highly efficient and reliable. If you're coming from languages like C++, Java, or Python, understanding Rust’s ownership system might feel daunting at first. In this post, we'll break it down step by step.What is Ownership in Rust?Ownership is Rust’s unique way of managing memory. Instead of using garbage collection or manual memory management, Rust enforces strict ownership rules at compile time. These rules ensure memory safety and prevent data races in concurrent programs.The three key ownership rules are:Each value in Rust has a single owner.When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the value.Ownership can be transferred (moved) or borrowed (immutably or mutably).
  
  
  Moving, Copying, and Cloning
When assigning a value from one variable to another, ownership is transferred. Consider this example:Since  is allocated on the heap, Rust prevents double-free errors by invalidating  when ownership moves to .Certain types implement the  trait, meaning they are duplicated instead of moved. Examples include:Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, etc.) implement , so they don’t follow move semantics.If you need to duplicate heap-allocated data, use :Cloning explicitly creates a separate copy in memory, avoiding move-related issues.Rust allows borrowing instead of transferring ownership. Borrowing enables passing data without giving up ownership.A reference () allows read-only access to data without taking ownership:You can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time, but not if there’s a mutable borrow.A mutable reference () allows modification but enforces exclusivity:Rust ensures at compile time that you cannot have multiple mutable references or a mix of mutable and immutable references at the same time.
  
  
  Lifetimes: Ensuring Valid References
Rust’s  prevent dangling references. Consider this example:The  lifetime annotation ensures that the returned reference is valid as long as both input references are valid.
  
  
  Why Rust’s Ownership Model Matters
: No need for garbage collection, yet Rust prevents use-after-free and memory leaks.: Enforces thread safety at compile time.: Eliminates runtime overhead associated with memory management.: Code is predictable and free from subtle memory bugs.Rust’s ownership model might take some getting used to, but once you grasp it, you gain the power to write efficient and safe code without worrying about memory leaks. By understanding moves, copies, borrowing, and lifetimes, you can write highly performant Rust applications while maintaining safety guarantees.Are you currently learning Rust?

Even tho compared to C++ syntax is a bit messy for me]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No, your GenAI model isn&apos;t going to replace me</title><link>https://marioarias.hashnode.dev/no-your-genai-model-isnt-going-to-replace-me</link><author>/u/dh44t</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:06:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Type safe Go money library beta2!</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iq5stk/type_safe_go_money_library_beta2/</link><author>/u/HawkSecure4957</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:02:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, after I released beta1, I received many constructive feedback! mainly lacking of locale support.This update brings locale formatting support and an improved interface for better usability.

It provides memory safety without needing a garbage collector, making Rust highly efficient and reliable. If you're coming from languages like C++, Java, or Python, understanding Rust’s ownership system might feel daunting at first. In this post, we'll break it down step by step.What is Ownership in Rust?Ownership is Rust’s unique way of managing memory. Instead of using garbage collection or manual memory management, Rust enforces strict ownership rules at compile time. These rules ensure memory safety and prevent data races in concurrent programs.The three key ownership rules are:Each value in Rust has a single owner.When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the value.Ownership can be transferred (moved) or borrowed (immutably or mutably).
  
  
  Moving, Copying, and Cloning
When assigning a value from one variable to another, ownership is transferred. Consider this example:Since  is allocated on the heap, Rust prevents double-free errors by invalidating  when ownership moves to .Certain types implement the  trait, meaning they are duplicated instead of moved. Examples include:Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, etc.) implement , so they don’t follow move semantics.If you need to duplicate heap-allocated data, use :Cloning explicitly creates a separate copy in memory, avoiding move-related issues.Rust allows borrowing instead of transferring ownership. Borrowing enables passing data without giving up ownership.A reference () allows read-only access to data without taking ownership:You can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time, but not if there’s a mutable borrow.A mutable reference () allows modification but enforces exclusivity:Rust ensures at compile time that you cannot have multiple mutable references or a mix of mutable and immutable references at the same time.
  
  
  Lifetimes: Ensuring Valid References
Rust’s  prevent dangling references. Consider this example:The  lifetime annotation ensures that the returned reference is valid as long as both input references are valid.
  
  
  Why Rust’s Ownership Model Matters
: No need for garbage collection, yet Rust prevents use-after-free and memory leaks.: Enforces thread safety at compile time.: Eliminates runtime overhead associated with memory management.: Code is predictable and free from subtle memory bugs.Rust’s ownership model might take some getting used to, but once you grasp it, you gain the power to write efficient and safe code without worrying about memory leaks. By understanding moves, copies, borrowing, and lifetimes, you can write highly performant Rust applications while maintaining safety guarantees.Are you currently learning Rust? Let me know what aspects of ownership you find the most challenging in the comments below!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Larry Ellison wants to put all US data in one big AI system</title><link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/12/larry_ellison_wants_all_data/</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:59:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If governments want AI to improve services and security for their citizens, then they need to put all their information in one place – even citizens’ genomic data – according to Larry Ellison, the Oracle database tycoon.Ellison shared his take on what governments need to do to succeed with AI during a discussion with his buddy former UK prime minister Tony Blair at the World Governments Summit in Dubai today.The world's fourth-most-richest man – a good friend also of the world's richest man Elon Musk – insisted artificial intelligence is soon going to change everyone's lives "across the board."I have to tell the AI model as much about my country as I can. We need to unify all the national dataIf governments want in, they’ll need to gather all their data – spatial information, economic data, electronic healthcare records including genomic data, and info about infrastructure. Whatever they’ve got, basically. And put it all in one place to be analyzed by algorithms. The American multi-billionaire used the United States as an example, if not a goal."I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can," Ellison said. "We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it's easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like," he said. "That's the missing link."He believes the payoff will include better healthcare, thanks to treatments tailored to individuals, and the ability for governments to lift food production by better predicting crop yields. Analyzing land so that farmers can be advised where to apply fertilizers or increase irrigation was another scenario Ellison floated."As long as countries will put their data - all of it - in a single place we can use AI to help manage the care of all of the patients and the population at large," Ellison said, adding his belief that AI can handle other social services and eliminate fraud.Of course, such a vast database system could also be the precursor to pervasive surveillance – an idea Ellison last year said he feels is desirable and would like Oracle to help facilitate.Constant real-time surveillance of populations, analyzed by Oracle-powered machine-learning products, would keep everyone "on their best behavior," Ellison said at an Oracle financial analyst conference in September 2024. We're reminded of the NSA, PRISM, Snowden.Ellison is not just a techno-optimist. He’s also a top executive and shareholder who has made big AI investments as well as a database company to feed.He therefore told the Dubai audience that Oracle, already a big-time government and military contractor, is ready to help nations realize his above-mentioned AI visions. Ie: Put all this data into one big expensive Oracle system to learn from and process."Oracle is building a 2.2GW datacenter that costs between $50 and $100 billion dollars to build," Ellison said, noting it's sites like that where super-powered AI models will be trained. "Because these models are so expensive, you won't build your own as a rule. There'll be a handful of these models."And a handful of players that can train them. Oracle’s own facilities will likely be one. The super-corp has also joined another, the Stargate project, that plans to blow $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US in the next four years. ®]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alexandre Mutel a.k.a. xoofx is leaving Unity</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@xoofx/113997304444307991</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:53:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Don&apos;t &quot;optimize&quot; conditional moves in shaders with mix()+step()</title><link>https://iquilezles.org/articles/gpuconditionals/</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:52:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this article I want to correct a popular misconception that's been making the rounds in computer graphics aficionado circles for a long time now. It has to do with conditionals when selecting between two results in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation, and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up a little:
So, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);
     x>?(s.x,):
           x>?s*():
                      (,s.y);
}
The exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations deciding what's the final value this function should return. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return one of three results, which are simple to compute. I could also have implemented this function with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say in this article stays true.
Now, here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will step up and invariably propose the following "optimization", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are "conditional branches" in the code, by arithmetic operations. They will suggest something like this: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);

     w0 = (,x);
     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);
     w2 = -w0-w1;

     res0 = (s.x,);
     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();
     res2 = (,s.y);

     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;
}
There are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. "select"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. I'll repeat it again - there is no branching, the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no prediction involved, no pipe to flush, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.
For the record, of course GPUs can do real branching, and those are fine and fast and totally worth it when big chunks of code and computation are to be skipped given a condition. As with all things computing, always check the generated machine code to know what is happening exactly and when. But one thing you can safely assume without having to check any generated code - when moving simple values or computations like in my original example, you are guaranteed to not branch. This has been true for decades at this point, with GPUs. And while I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.
The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimized version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. You can measure it in a variety of hardware. I can only assume that's because the  function is probably implemented with some sort of conditional move or subtract + bit propagation + AND. step(  x,  y )
{
     x < y ?  : ;
}
Either way, using the step() "optimization" are either using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to mask in and out the different potential outputs with a series of arithmetic multiplications and additions. Which is wasteful, the values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.
But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the original code I published:
GLSL x>?(s.x,):
       x>?s*():
                  (,s.y);
AMD Compiler     s0,      v3, , v1
     v4, , v0
     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0
 v3, 0, v3, vcc
 v0, v0, v4, vcc
 vcc, (v2), s1
 v1, v1, v3, vcc
 v0, 0, v0, vcc
Microsoft Compiler   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy
   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )
 r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz
 r0.xy, r0.xyxx
  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()
   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()
 r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy
 o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw
Here we can confirm that the GPU is not branching, as I explained. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).
The Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison ( - "lt"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).
There are no jump/branch instructions in these listings.
Something not related to the discussion but interesting, is that some of the  GLSL calls I had in my shader before the ternary operator we are discussing, didn't become GPU instructions but rather instruction modifiers, which is the reason you see them in the listing. This means you can think of abs() calls as being free.
So, if you ever see somebody proposing this a = ( b, c, ( y, x ) );
as an optimization to
then please correct them for me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Altman: OpenAI not for sale, especially to competitor who is not able to beat us</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/openai-altman-musk-offer</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:17:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GitHub - yaitoo/xun: Xun is an HTTP web framework built on Go&apos;s built-in html/template and net/http package’s router (1.22).</title><link>https://github.com/yaitoo/xun</link><author>/u/imlangzi</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:15:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Event Sourcing?</title><link>https://newsletter.scalablethread.com/p/what-is-event-sourcing</link><author>/u/scalablethread</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:05:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Traditional data storage typically focuses on the current state of an entity. For example, in an e-commerce system, you might store the current state of a customer's order: items, quantities, shipping address, etc. Event sourcing takes a different approach. Instead of storing the current state directly, it stores the events that led to that state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the past. Think of it as a detailed log of transactions on your bank statement. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store. The core idea is that an application's state can be derived by replaying events in the order they occurred, just like you can get your current bank balance by replaying all the transactions from the beginning. This makes Event Sourcing particularly useful for applications that require a high degree of audibility and traceability.Every change to the application state is captured as an event object in an Event Sourcing system. These events are then stored in an event store, a database optimized for handling event data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how Event Sourcing works:Reconstructing the state from events involves reading all the events related to an entity from the event store and applying them in sequence to reconstruct the current state. It's like simulating all the changes that have occurred to construct the current state. For example, consider an e-commerce application where an order goes through various states like "Created," "Paid," and "Shipped." To determine the current state of an order, you would:Retrieve all events related to the order from the event store.Initialize an empty order object.Apply each event to the order object in the order in which they were stored.By the end of this process, the order object will reflect the current state of the order.As the number of events grows, replaying the entire event stream to reconstruct the state can become slow and inefficient. This is where snapshots come in. A snapshot is a saved state of an entity at a specific point in time. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, the application can load the latest snapshot and then replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken.

The ordered map contains the golang map, list and mutex to execute Ordered Map functions.The Ordered Map is a map that remembers the order of items. The map can be iterated over to retrieve the items in the order they were added.
  
  
  Introduction to the omap Go Package
The omap Go package is a lightweight and efficient library for working with ordered maps in Go. An ordered map is a data structure that combines the benefits of a map and a list, allowing you to store key-value pairs in a specific order.Omap is a Go package that provides an implementation of an ordered map. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. Omap is particularly useful when you need to store data in a specific order, such as when working with configuration files, caching, or data processing pipelines.Ordered: omap preserves the order in which key-value pairs are inserted, allowing you to iterate over the map in a specific order.Fast lookups: omap uses a hash table to store key-value pairs, making lookups fast and efficient.Efficient insertion and deletion: omap uses a linked list to store the order of key-value pairs, making insertion and deletion operations efficient.To use omap, you can install it using the following command:go get github.com/kirill-scherba/omap
Here is an example of how to use omap:This code creates a new omap, inserts some key-value pairs, and then iterates over the omap in order, printing out each key-value pair.The omap Go package is a useful library for working with ordered maps in Go. Its fast lookups, efficient insertion and deletion, and ordered iteration make it a great choice for a variety of use cases. Whether you're working with configuration files, caching, or data processing pipelines, omap is definitely worth considering.Configuration files: Use omap to store configuration data in a specific order, making it easy to iterate over the configuration and apply settings in the correct order.Caching: Use omap to store cached data in a specific order, making it easy to iterate over the cache and evict items in the correct order.Data processing pipelines: Use omap to store data in a specific order, making it easy to iterate over the data and process it in the correct order.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[P] Daily ArXiv filtering powered by LLM judge</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ipz934/p_daily_arxiv_filtering_powered_by_llm_judge/</link><author>/u/MadEyeXZ</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 11:14:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🌍 UTF-8</title><link>https://dev.to/wycliffealphus/utf-8-3edn</link><author>Wycliffe A.

Why do some characters get replaced with weird symbols? And most importantly—how do we fix it?The answer is UTF-8, the encoding that powers almost everything today. Let's talk about what it is, why it matters, and how to use it properly in Go (Golang).
  
  
  🔥 The Problem UTF-8 Solves
Back in the early days of computing, ASCII was the standard way to represent text. It used 7 bits per character, meaning it could only represent 128 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and some symbols).That was fine—until computers went global.Suddenly, people needed to store and display languages like Chinese (汉字), Arabic (العربية), Hindi (हिन्दी), and more. ASCII just couldn’t handle it.So different countries created their own encodings:ISO-8859-1 for Western EuropeWindows-1252 for Microsoft systems💀 The result? Encoding chaos. A file written in one system might be unreadable in another.Enter , the hero of our story.
  
  
  🏆 What Makes UTF-8 Special?
UTF-8 was designed in 1992 by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike (yes, the same Rob Pike who helped create Go!). It solved the encoding mess by being:✅ Backwards-compatible with ASCII
✅ Compact for common characters (English stays at 1 byte per character)
✅ Capable of encoding every language and symbol
✅ Error-resistant (invalid bytes won’t accidentally form valid characters)This is why UTF-8 is now used by 97% of websites and is the default encoding for most programming languages, including Go.
  
  
  💻 UTF-8 in Action (With Go Examples)
Since Go natively supports UTF-8, you don’t need to do anything special—it just works. But let’s dig into some examples to see it in action.1️⃣ Encoding a String as UTF-8 BytesEnglish characters (, ) are 1 byte each.Chinese characters () are 3 bytes each.This variable-length encoding is why UTF-8 is so efficient!2️⃣ Decoding UTF-8 Bytes Back to a String💡 No extra libraries—Go just handles it. That’s one of the nice things about UTF-8 in Go.3️⃣ Handling UTF-8 in Web ApplicationsIf you're building a web app, always specify UTF-8 in your response headers:💡 Without , some browsers might misinterpret the text and display garbage characters.4️⃣ Validating UTF-8 DataNot every byte sequence is valid UTF-8. You can check with :✅ Great for validating user input before processing it!5️⃣ Counting Unicode Characters (Runes) in a StringGo strings are byte sequences, not necessarily character sequences.❗ Why the difference? Because 世界 takes 3 bytes each, so len(text) == 13, but there are only 9 characters.6️⃣ Iterating Over Unicode CharactersSince some characters take more than 1 byte, normal indexing won’t work. Use :❗ Notice how 世界 starts at index 7, not 5, because it uses 3 bytes each.
  
  
  🚀 Why UTF-8 is the Default Encoding
Before UTF-8:
❌ Confusing mess of different encodings
❌ Text corruption between systems
❌ Websites needed to support multiple charsetsAfter UTF-8:
✅ One encoding for everything
✅ No more garbled text (mojibake)
✅ Supported everywhere—from databases to web APIsIf you’re dealing with text in Go (or any language), understanding UTF-8 is essential. It ensures your applications work worldwide without encoding issues.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go Nullable with Generics v2.0.0 - now supports omitzero</title><link>https://github.com/LukaGiorgadze/gonull</link><author>/u/Money-Relative-1184</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 11:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>async-arp: library for probing hosts and sending advanced ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ipywbp/asyncarp_library_for_probing_hosts_and_sending/</link><author>/u/arcycar</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:48:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After a few months of exploring and working with Rust, I am happy to share my first small Rust crate,  and I’d love to hear your thoughts! 🚀This library provides an  way to send and receive , making it useful for network discovery, debugging, and custom networking applications.🏎  Built on Tokio for non-blocking network operations🔍  Easily detect active devices in a subnet⚙️  Craft and send ARP packets dynamicallyYou can find usage examples and API documentation here: 📖 Since this is my first crate, I’d really appreciate any feedback on:📌  – Is the interface intuitive and ergonomic?🚀  – Does it fit well into async Rust workflows?🔍  – Any improvements or best practices I may have missed?🦀  – Suggestions to make it more "Rustacean"?If you have further ideas, issues, or want to contribute, check it out on GitHub:Thanks for checking it out—let me know what you think! 🦀]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>what do you use golang for?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ipykyd/what_do_you_use_golang_for/</link><author>/u/Notalabel_4566</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:24:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is there any other major use than web development?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lessons from David Lynch: A Software Developer&apos;s Perspective</title><link>https://lackofimagination.org/2025/02/lessons-from-david-lynch-a-software-developers-perspective/</link><author>/u/aijan1</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 09:40:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[David Lynch passed away in January 2025, shortly after being evacuated from his Los Angeles home due to the Southern California wildfires. He’s perhaps best known for the groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks, which inspired countless shows, including The X-Files, The Sopranos, and Lost.Lynch was genuinely a good human being who cared deeply for his actors and crew. He discovered extraordinary talent like Naomi Watts, who had struggled to land a major role in a Hollywood movie after 10 years of auditioning. From the interviews he gave, it quickly becomes apparent that he respected people of all kinds and never put anyone down – even those who truly deserved it.Lynch is famous for refusing to explain his movies. Although not a fan of his previous work, the great film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that Mulholland Drive remained compulsively watchable while refusing to yield to interpretation.While Lynch offered very little in terms of what his movies meant, he was generous in sharing his views on creativity, work, and life in general. As a tribute to Lynch, I’d like to share my perspective on his life lessons from a software developer’s viewpoint.Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.We’ve all got hundreds or even thousands of ideas floating around in our brains. But the really big ones are few and far between. Once you catch a good one –because they’re so rare– write it down immediately, says Lynch. From there, ideas attract other ideas and start to grow from their initial seed state. The final job is to translate those ideas into a medium, whether it’s a film, a painting, or software.The idea is the whole thing. If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really. You just keep working to make it look like that idea looked, feel like it felt, sound like it sounded, and be the way it was.Software development is part art, part engineering. We don’t build the same software over and over again – virtually all software is crafted by hand, sometimes with help from AI. If you ask two developers to create a non-trivial program, it’s very likely that the programs they produce will be different, even if the functionality is the same. Under the hood, the programming language, data structures, and overall architecture may be completely different. And on the surface, the user interfaces may look nothing alike.It’s a good habit to listen to what users have to say, but they often can only describe their problems – they rarely come up with good ideas to solve them. And that’s OK. It’s our job to find the right ideas, implement them well, and solve tricky problems in a way we, and hopefully the users, will love.My friend Bushnell Keeler, who was really responsible for me wanting to be a painter, said you need four hours of uninterrupted time to get one hour of good painting in, and that is really true.Like other creative fields, writing code requires deep concentration. We need to hold complex structures in our minds while working through problems. Switching between coding and other tasks disrupts  – that magical state of mind where we lose track of time and produce code effortlessly. That’s why many developers hate meetings – they are toxic to our productivity.I believe you need technical knowledge. And also, it’s really, really great to learn by doing. So, you should make a film.Software development is one of those rare fields where a college degree isn’t required to succeed. Yes, we should all know the basics, but in my experience, new college graduates often lack the practical knowledge to be effective developers.The real learning happens through hands-on experience: building real projects, debugging tricky problems, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code over time. It’s crucial to never stop learning, experimenting, and iterating on our craft.Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn’t even exist.Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Originally conceived to meet the demand for information sharing between scientists around the world, the web went mainstream within just a few years.Linus Torvalds created Git due to a licensing dispute over BitKeeper, the original version control system used for Linux development. The need for a new tool led to Git becoming the most widely used version control system today.I feel that a set should be like a happy family. Almost like Thanksgiving every day, happily going down the road together.Be kind to your teammates, don’t embarrass them. They may not be perfect, but accept them for who they are. The most important trait of an effective software development team is psychological safety –that is, team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other, as corroborated by Google’s research on the subject.It’s OK to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them. Knowing that your team has your back when things go south is a wonderful feeling.Most of Hollywood is about making money - and I love money, but I don’t make the films thinking about money.Just like Lynch prioritizes creativity over financial gain, some of the most impactful software projects started with an open source model, and they literally changed the world, such as Linux, PostgreSQL, and Node.js, just to name a few.What makes these projects remarkable is that they didn’t emerge from corporate boardrooms – they were built by communities of passionate developers, collaborating across the world.Money is just a means to an end. Unfortunately, many get this confused.David, thank you for making the world a better place!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Macro-Less, Highly Integrated OpenAPI Document Generation in Rust with Ohkami</title><link>https://dev.to/kanarus/macro-less-highly-integrated-openapi-document-generation-in-rust-with-ohkami-9b2</link><author>kanarus</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:49:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a cross post from Medium.In Rust web dev, utoipa is the most popular crate for generating OpenAPI document from server code.

I am fortunate enough to work and develop with these technologies every day as a machine learning engineer!In this article, I will walk you through my journey to becoming a machine learning engineer, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!In one of my previous articles, I extensively wrote about my journey from school to securing my first Data Science job. I recommend you check out that article, but I will summarise the key timeline here.Pretty much everyone in my family studied some sort of STEM subject. My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.So, my path was always paved for me.I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it’s fair to say everyone was very proud!At school, I wasn’t dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn’t fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It’s mainly for students who don’t have a university offer.I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master’s degree in physics!There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn’t seem there was much opportunity in the space.During this time, DeepMind released theirdocumentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.You can hear more about my journey from a podcast.I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and generalised linear models (GLMs).I built models to predict: — Did someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.— What’s the premium we should give someone.— How many claims will someone have. — What’s the average claim value someone will have.I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.However, due to the company’s structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the “tech” side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in time series forecasting and optimisation problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.Fair to say I learned a lot. I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by Pau Labarta BajoML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues: -> You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance. -> You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don’t provide tangible value to a business.That’s not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.You want to say that you did “X that produced Y”, which the above two avenues allow you to do.The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that’s where I gravitated towards.To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.And that’s exactly what I did.Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!Fortunately, a role kind of “fell to me,” but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work — you don’t know what may come from it.I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist. — A machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That’s why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas. — If you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It’s not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me! — Most companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it’s best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take. — I am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout here.Data Structures & Algorithms — Understanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It’s not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick. — Again, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts. — Many MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse. This is why securing a machine learning engineer role can be quite challenging, as it requires proficiency across a wide range of skills.Summary & Further ThoughtsI have a free newsletter, , where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist.

Its Go adaptation, , inherits these issues despite the modern language.While exploring compilers, I found  to be a gold mine of insights, though buried under outdated practices. Following Allan Holub’s , I dissected its code—clarifying, simplifying, and refactoring convoluted sections. I then tested the revised version in a real-world scenario to ensure it retained its original functionality. The full code is published on github.I aimed to explore real-world open-source code, bridge ideals with reality, and stay sane as a reader. By refining and clarifying it, I made learning smoother and reuse easier.The first issue is poor naming—cryptic, vague, or misleading names. Here’s how naming was improved.original | cleanup          | intent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cpfir    | computeFirstsets | compute the first sets for non-terminal symbols
cpemp    | computeEmpty     | compute compute table to check if a non-terminal symbol is nullable

setbit   | lkset.set        | set a bit ON
bitset   | lkset.check      | check if a bit is ON (mix up with setbit easily)

The second issue is cramming everything into one place, burying core logic (closure and state generation) under the bulky input parsing.  Refactoring separates it to files by functionality, improving clarity and focus.The third issue is poor organization. A key component, the lookahead set, should have its own type with all related methods grouped together, not lying elsewhere. This improves maintainability and makes adding methods easier. Similarly, the kernel item should define its own string representation method. These structs also include a Clone method for copying instances.The fourth issue is convolution. The  variable determines whether closure is  or  for state generation and  for processing closed states. However, it pops up in unexpected places like kernel item addition, state generation, and packing gotos. Furthermore, it creates twists and turns in the  logic, making it harder to follow.To resolve this, I split  into  for  and closure0 for . While slightly redundant, this separation prevents their logic from getting entangled, making the flow easier to follow. With this change, the confusing  is completely eliminated.Similarly,  determines whether we're handling an  but is tangled with  in closed state processing. By explicitly storing and processing , the confusion caused by  is eliminated.The fifth issue is redundant complications. An example is  -production rules with the same . The code extracts only  to construct the  while calling it  in kernel item. By consistently using full production rules, we remove this friction. It helps to eliminate further redundancies like keeping production number in kernel item for comparison and tricky code to print the dot for a kernel item. Here is the code with comments highlighting the problems.Another example is the redundant outer loop of .Another redundant outer loop is in closure's work item processing.The sixth issue is that several lines can be made more readable by adopting a clearer style.

Every image you hover over isn’t just a visual placeholder; it’s a critical data point that fuels our sophisticated personalization engine. At Netflix, we call these images ‘impressions,’ and they play a pivotal role in transforming your interaction from simple browsing into an immersive binge-watching experience, all tailored to your unique tastes.Capturing these moments and turning them into a personalized journey is no simple feat. It requires a state-of-the-art system that can track and process these impressions while maintaining a detailed history of each profile’s exposure. This nuanced integration of data and technology empowers us to offer bespoke content recommendations.In this multi-part blog series, we take you behind the scenes of our system that processes billions of impressions daily. We will explore the challenges we encounter and unveil how we are building a resilient solution that transforms these client-side impressions into a personalized content discovery experience for every Netflix viewer.Why do we need impression history?To tailor recommendations more effectively, it’s crucial to track what content a user has already encountered. Having impression history helps us achieve this by allowing us to identify content that has been displayed on the homepage but not engaged with, helping us deliver fresh, engaging recommendations.By maintaining a history of impressions, we can implement frequency capping to prevent over-exposure to the same content. This ensures users aren’t repeatedly shown identical options, keeping the viewing experience vibrant and reducing the risk of frustration or disengagement.Highlighting New ReleasesFor new content, impression history helps us monitor initial user interactions and adjust our merchandising efforts accordingly. We can experiment with different content placements or promotional strategies to boost visibility and engagement.Additionally, impression history offers insightful information for addressing a number of platform-related analytics queries. Analyzing impression history, for example, might help determine how well a specific row on the home page is functioning or assess the effectiveness of a merchandising strategy.The first pivotal step in managing impressions begins with the creation of a Source-of-Truth (SOT) dataset. This foundational dataset is essential, as it supports various downstream workflows and enables a multitude of use cases.Collecting Raw Impression EventsAs Netflix members explore our platform, their interactions with the user interface spark a vast array of raw events. These events are promptly relayed from the client side to our servers, entering a centralized event processing queue. This queue ensures we are consistently capturing raw events from our global user base.After raw events are collected into a centralized queue, a custom event extractor processes this data to identify and extract all impression events. These extracted events are then routed to an Apache Kafka topic for immediate processing needs and simultaneously stored in an Apache Iceberg table for long-term retention and historical analysis. This dual-path approach leverages Kafka’s capability for low-latency streaming and Iceberg’s efficient management of large-scale, immutable datasets, ensuring both real-time responsiveness and comprehensive historical data availability.Filtering & Enriching Raw ImpressionsOnce the raw impression events are queued, a stateless Apache Flink job takes charge, meticulously processing this data. It filters out any invalid entries and enriches the valid ones with additional metadata, such as show or movie title details, and the specific page and row location where each impression was presented to users. This refined output is then structured using an Avro schema, establishing a definitive source of truth for Netflix’s impression data. The enriched data is seamlessly accessible for both real-time applications via Kafka and historical analysis through storage in an Apache Iceberg table. This dual availability ensures immediate processing capabilities alongside comprehensive long-term data retention.Ensuring High Quality ImpressionsMaintaining the highest quality of impressions is a top priority. We accomplish this by gathering detailed column-level metrics that offer insights into the state and quality of each impression. These metrics include everything from validating identifiers to checking that essential columns are properly filled. The data collected feeds into a comprehensive quality dashboard and supports a tiered threshold-based alerting system. These alerts promptly notify us of any potential issues, enabling us to swiftly address regressions. Additionally, while enriching the data, we ensure that all columns are in agreement with each other, offering in-place corrections wherever possible to deliver accurate data.We handle a staggering volume of 1 to 1.5 million impression events globally every second, with each event approximately 1.2KB in size. To efficiently process this massive influx in real-time, we employ Apache Flink for its low-latency stream processing capabilities, which seamlessly integrates both batch and stream processing to facilitate efficient backfilling of historical data and ensure consistency across real-time and historical analyses. Our Flink configuration includes 8 task managers per region, each equipped with 8 CPU cores and 32GB of memory, operating at a parallelism of 48, allowing us to handle the necessary scale and speed for seamless performance delivery. The Flink job’s sink is equipped with a data mesh connector, as detailed in our Data Mesh platform which has two outputs: Kafka and Iceberg. This setup allows for efficient streaming of real-time data through Kafka and the preservation of historical data in Iceberg, providing a comprehensive and flexible data processing and storage solution.We utilize the ‘island model’ for deploying our Flink jobs, where all dependencies for a given application reside within a single region. This approach ensures high availability by isolating regions, so if one becomes degraded, others remain unaffected, allowing traffic to be shifted between regions to maintain service continuity. Thus, all data in one region is processed by the Flink job deployed within that region.Addressing the Challenge of Unschematized EventsAllowing raw events to land on our centralized processing queue unschematized offers significant flexibility, but it also introduces challenges. Without a defined schema, it can be difficult to determine whether missing data was intentional or due to a logging error. We are investigating solutions to introduce schema management that maintains flexibility while providing clarity.Automating Performance Tuning with AutoscalersTuning the performance of our Apache Flink jobs is currently a manual process. The next step is to integrate with autoscalers, which can dynamically adjust resources based on workload demands. This integration will not only optimize performance but also ensure more efficient resource utilization.Improving Data Quality AlertsRight now, there’s a lot of business rules dictating when a data quality alert needs to be fired. This leads to a lot of false positives that require manual judgement. A lot of times it is difficult to track changes leading to regression due to inadequate data lineage information. We are investing in building a comprehensive data quality platform that more intelligently identifies anomalies in our impression stream, keeps track of data lineage and data governance, and also, generates alerts notifying producers of any regressions. This approach will enhance efficiency, reduce manual oversight, and ensure a higher standard of data integrity.Creating a reliable source of truth for impressions is a complex but essential task that enhances personalization and discovery experience. Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where we’ll delve into how we use this SOT dataset to create a microservice that provides impression histories. We invite you to share your thoughts in the comments and continue with us on this journey of discovering impressions.We are genuinely grateful to our amazing colleagues whose contributions were essential to the success of Impressions: Julian Jaffe, Bryan Keller, Yun Wang, Brandon Bremen, Kyle Alford, Ron Brown and Shriya Arora.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tabiew 0.8.4 Released</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ipp72r/tabiew_084_released/</link><author>/u/shshemi</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:21:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tabiew is a lightweight TUI application that allows users to view and query tabular data files, such as CSV, Parquet, Arrow, Sqlite, and ...📊 Support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, JSONL, Arrow, FWF, and Sqlite🗂️ Multi-table functionalityUI is updated to be more modern and responsiveHorizontally scrollable tablesVisible data frame can be referenced with name "_"Compatibility with older versions of glibcTwo new themes (Tokyo Night and Catppuccin)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Conditional types in TypeScript</title><link>https://2ality.com/2025/02/conditional-types-typescript.html</link><author>Dr. Axel Rauschmayer</author><category>dev</category><category>frontend</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://feeds.feedburner.com/2ality">Axel Raushmayer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In TypeScript, conditional types let us make decisions (think if-then-else expressions) – which is especially useful in generic types.

This started out as an idea of a weekly update, but
that hasn’t happened, and so we will switch it over to just writing up
when something interesting happens and then push it out relatively
immediately when it happens.Nuitka Onefile Gets More Flexible:  and We’ve got a couple of exciting updates to Nuitka’s onefile mode that
give you more control and flexibility in how you deploy your
applications. These enhancements stem from real-world needs and
demonstrate Nuitka’s commitment to providing powerful and adaptable
solutions.Taking Control of Onefile Unpacking: Onefile mode is fantastic for creating single-file executables, but the
management of the unpacking directory where the application expands has
sometimes been a bit… opaque. Previously, Nuitka would decide whether
to clean up this directory based on whether the path used
runtime-dependent variables. This made sense in theory, but in practice,
it could lead to unexpected behavior and made debugging onefile issues
harder.Now, you have complete control! The new  option
lets you explicitly specify what happens to the unpacking directory:: This is the default behavior. Nuitka
will remove the unpacking directory unless runtime-dependent values
were used in the path specification. This is the same behavior as
previous versions.: The unpacking directory is 
removed and becomes a persistent, cached directory. This is useful
for debugging, inspecting the unpacked files, or if you have a use
case that benefits from persistent caching of the unpacked data. The
files will remain available for subsequent runs.: The unpacking directory 
removed after the program exits.This gives you the power to choose the behavior that best suits your
needs. No more guessing!Relative Paths with Another common request, particularly from users deploying applications
in more restricted environments, was the ability to specify the onefile
unpacking directory  to the executable itself. Previously, you
were limited to absolute paths or paths relative to the user’s temporary
directory space.We’ve introduced a new variable, , that you can use in
the  option. This variable is dynamically
replaced at runtime with the full path to the directory containing the
onefile executable.This would create a directory named  the same
directory as the  (or  on Linux/macOS)
and unpack the application there. This is perfect for creating truly
self-contained applications where all data and temporary files reside
alongside the executable.Nuitka Commercial and Open SourceThese features, like many enhancements to Nuitka, originated from a
request by a Nuitka commercial customer. This highlights the close
relationship between the commercial offerings and the open-source core.
While commercial support helps drive development and ensures the
long-term sustainability of Nuitka, the vast majority of features are
made freely available to all users.This change will be in 2.7 and is currentlyWe encourage you to try out these new features and let us know what you
think! As always, bug reports, feature requests, and contributions are
welcome on GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Django Weblog: DjangoCongress JP 2025 Announcement and Live Streaming!</title><link>https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/feb/14/djangocongress-jp-2025-announcement-and-livestream/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:12:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It will be streamed on the following YouTube Live channels:This year there will be talks not only about Django, but also about FastAPI and other asynchronous web topics.

and you'll notice that the "JIT decorator" pattern is pretty popular. For
example, this JAX snippet:In both cases, the function decorated with  doesn't get executed by the
Python interpreter in the normal sense. Instead, the code inside is more like
a DSL (Domain Specific Language) processed by a special purpose compiler built
into the library (JAX or Triton). Another way to think about it is that Python
is used as a  to describe computations.In this post I will describe some implementation strategies used by libraries to
make this possible.Preface - where we're goingThe goal is to explain how different kinds of  decorators work by using
a simplified, educational example that implements several approaches from
scratch. All the approaches featured in this post will be using this flow: Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" /> Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" class="align-center" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/decjit-python.png" />
These are the steps that happen when a Python function wrapped with
our educational  decorator is called:The function is translated to an "expression IR" - .This expression IR is converted to LLVM IR.Finally, the LLVM IR is JIT-executed.First, let's look at the  IR. Here we'll make a big simplification -
only supporting functions that define a single expression, e.g.:Naturally, this can be easily generalized - after all, LLVM IR can be used to
express fully general computations.Here are the  data structures:To convert an  into LLVM IR and JIT-execute it, we'll use this function:It uses the  class to actually generate LLVM IR from .
This process is straightforward and covered extensively in the resources I
linked to earlier; take a look at the full code here.My goal with this architecture is to make things simple, but .
On one hand - there are several simplifications: only single expressions are
supported, very limited set of operators, etc. It's very easy to extend this!
On the other hand, we could have just trivially evaluated the 
without resorting to LLVM IR; I do want to show a more complete compilation
pipeline, though, to demonstrate that an arbitrary amount of complexity can
be hidden behind these simple interfaces.With these building blocks in hand, we can review the strategies used by
 decorators to convert Python functions into s.Python comes with powerful code reflection and introspection capabilities out
of the box. Here's the  decorator:This is a standard Python decorator. It takes a function and returns another
function that will be used in its place ( ensures that
function attributes like the name and docstring of the wrapper match the
wrapped function).After  is applied to , what  holds is the
wrapper. When  is called, the wrapper is invoked with
.The wrapper obtains the AST of the wrapped function, and then uses
 to convert this AST into an :When  finishes visiting the AST it's given, its
 field will contain the  representing the function's
return value. The wrapper then invokes  with this .Note how our decorator interjects into the regular Python execution process.
When  is called, instead of the standard Python compilation and
execution process (code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed
by the VM), we translate its code to our own representation and emit LLVM from
it, and then JIT execute the LLVM IR. While it seems kinda pointless in this
artificial example, in reality this means we can execute the function's code
in any way we like.AST JIT case study: TritonThis approach is almost exactly how the Triton language works. The body of a
function decorated with  gets parsed to a Python AST, which then
- through a series of internal IRs - ends up in LLVM IR; this in turn is lowered
to PTX by the
NVPTX LLVM backend.
Then, the code runs on a GPU using a standard CUDA pipeline.Naturally, the subset of Python that can be compiled down to a GPU is limited;
but it's sufficient to run performant kernels, in a language that's much
friendlier than CUDA and - more importantly - lives in the same file with the
"host" part written in regular Python. For example, if you want testing and
debugging, you can run Triton in "interpreter mode" which will just run the
same kernels locally on a CPU.Note that Triton lets us import names from the  package
and use them inside kernels; these serve as the  for the language
- special calls the compiler handles directly.Python is a fairly complicated language with  of features. Therefore,
if our JIT has to support some large portion of Python semantics, it may make
sense to leverage more of Python's own compiler. Concretely, we can have it
compile the wrapped function all the way to bytecode,
and start our translation from there.Here's the  decorator that does just this :The Python VM is a stack machine; so we emulate a stack to convert the
function's bytecode to  IR (a bit like an RPN evaluator).
As before, we then use our  utility function to lower
 to LLVM IR and JIT execute it.Using this JIT is as simple as the previous one - just swap 
for :Bytecode JIT case study: NumbaNumba is a compiler for Python itself. The idea
is that you can speed up specific functions in your code by slapping a
 decorator on them. What happens next is similar in spirit to
our simple , but of course much more complicated because it
supports a very large portion of Python semantics.Numba uses the Python compiler to emit bytecode, just as we did; it then
converts it into its own IR, and then to LLVM using .By starting with the bytecode, Numba makes its life easier (no need to rewrite
the entire Python compiler). On the other hand, it also makes some analyses
, because by the time we're in bytecode, a lot of semantic information
existing in higher-level representations is lost. For example, Numba has to
sweat a bit to recover control flow information from the bytecode (by
running it through a special interpreter first).The two approaches we've seen so far are similar in many ways - both rely on
Python's introspection capabilities to compile the source code of the JIT-ed
function to some extent (one to AST, the other all the way to bytecode), and
then work on this lowered representation.The tracing strategy is very different. It doesn't analyze the source code of
the wrapped function at all - instead, it  its execution by means of
specially-boxed arguments, leveraging overloaded operators and functions, and
then works on the generated trace.The code implementing this for our smile demo is surprisingly compact:Each runtime argument of the wrapped function is assigned a , and
that is placed in a , a placeholder class which lets us
do operator overloading:The remaining key function is :To understand how this works, consider this trivial example:After the decorated function is defined,  holds the wrapper function
defined inside . When  is called, the wrapper runs:For each argument of  itself (that is  and ), it creates
a new  holding a . This denotes a named variable in
the  IR.It then calls the wrapped function, passing it the boxes as runtime
parameters.When (the wrapped)  runs, it invokes . This is caught by the overloaded
 operator of , and it creates a new  with
the s representing  and  as children. This
 is then returned .The wrapper unboxes the returned  and passes it to
 to emit LLVM IR from it and JIT execute it with the
actual runtime arguments of the call: .This might be a little mind-bending at first, because there are two different
executions that happen:The first is calling the wrapped  function itself, letting the Python
interpreter run it as usual, but with special arguments that build up the IR
instead of doing any computations. This is the .The second is lowering this IR our tracing step built into LLVM IR and then
JIT executing it with the actual runtime argument values ; this is
the .This tracing approach has some interesting characteristics. Since we don't
have to analyze the source of the wrapped functions but only trace through
the execution, we can "magically" support a much richer set of programs, e.g.:This  with our basic . Since Python variables are
placeholders (references) for values, our tracing step is oblivious to them - it
follows the flow of values. Another example:This also just works! The created  will be a long chain of 
additions of 's runtime values through the loop, added to the 
for .This last example also leads us to a limitation of the tracing approach; the
loop cannot be  - it cannot depend on the function's arguments,
because the tracing step has no concept of runtime values and wouldn't know
how many iterations to run through; or at least, it doesn't know this unless
we want to perform the tracing run for every runtime execution .Tracing JIT case study: JAXThe JAX ML framework uses a tracing
approach very similar to the one described here. The first code sample in this
post shows the JAX notation. JAX cleverly wraps Numpy with its own version which
is traced (similar to our , but JAX calls these boxes "tracers"),
letting you write regular-feeling Numpy code that can be JIT optimized and
executed on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs via XLA. JAX's tracer builds up an underlying IR (called
jaxpr) which can then be
emitted to XLA ops and passed to XLA for further lowering and execution.For a fairly deep overview of how JAX works, I recommend reading the
autodidax doc.As mentioned earlier, JAX has some limitations
with things like data-dependent control flow in native Python. This won't work,
because there's control flow
that depends on a runtime value ():When  is executed, JAX will throw an exception, saying something
like:
This concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the
value of the argument count.As a remedy, JAX has its
own built-in intrinsics from the jax.lax package.
Here's the example rewritten in a way that actually works: (and many other built-ins in the  package) is something JAX
can trace through, generating a corresponding XLA operation (XLA has support for
While loops, to which this
 can be lowered).The tracing approach has clear benefits for JAX as well; because it only cares
about the flow of values, it can handle arbitrarily complicated Python code,

Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for NLP and computer vision.For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern large language models (LLMs) without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in  the key concepts that should be studied.Natural language processing (NLP) is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.Before being converted into vectors, words undergo , which includes simple techniques such as , stemming, lemmatization, normalization, or removing . After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into . Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.The  method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance — a concept introduced in the  and  methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings. are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10–20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:  and . Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other large language models (LLMs).When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of  and , introduced in GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.Another important technique developed in recent years is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training. As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model’s weights.This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include ,, and .Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of  is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT’s rich knowledge to a specific domain.Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.As the name suggests,  involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called .In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet, and .Speaking of the object detection task, the  algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about , which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how generative adversial networks (GAN) function to generate images is a good way to broaden one’s horizons.In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.It would be very hard to present in detail the Roadmaps for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.First of all, recommender systems (RecSys) have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions. often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.Closely related to ranking, there is also a  problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair is mapped “well” according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited. is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity. is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier. is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to  find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.The word “approximately” means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms — sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression. involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:the target variable can have an overall , where in the long term its values increase or decrease (e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming).the target variable can have a  which makes its values change based on the currently given period (e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer).Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is , which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning. In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the “trial and error approach”). By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect. After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem. Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.Currently the most popular applications are:. Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans. The most well-known examples are chess and Go.. Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.. Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist. While most of the mentioned topics require time to master, they can add significant value to your portfolio. This is especially true for the NLP and CV domains, which are in high demand today.After reaching a high level of expertise in data science, it is still crucial to stay motivated and consistently push yourself to learn new topics and explore emerging algorithms.Data science is a constantly evolving field, and in the coming years, we might witness the development of new state-of-the-art approaches that we could not have imagined in the past.All images are by the author unless noted otherwise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Generate a Momento Disposable Token with Rust and Lambda</title><link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/generate-a-momento-disposable-token-with-rust-and-lambda-1a58</link><author>Benjamen Pyle</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:57:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Working with browser hosted code (UI) requires a developer to be cautious about exposing secrets and tokens.  A less than trustworthy person could take these secrets and do things that the user doesn't intend.  And while we are all responsible for our internet usage, token and secrets security from an application standpoint falls squarely on a developer's shoulders.  This is why when using Momento, I like to take advantage of the Authorization API.  What the Authorization API allows me to do is create a disposable token from a secure location, so that my UI clients can just refresh them as needed to work with Topics or Caches.  Thus, not having the credential leak up into the "easy to see" JavaScript code.  Let's dive into a Lambda Function coded in Rust that implements this Token Vending Machine concept with Momento.I usually like to work backwards to forwards, meaning I establish what I want in the end and then build from there.  When looking at a sample implementation, that means starting from the diagram and walking through what I'm building.A user's session will need to establish an authenticated and authorized connection to Momento by way of the JavaScript client SDK.  Every call to Momento is over an HTTP API request so it's going to get authenticated and authorized.  Which is a good thing!  However, doing this, requires a token which is what I'll be fetching from the Rust Lambda Function that will be demonstrated throughout the article.  The flow goes like this:1) User requires a token to connect to Momento
2) Browser makes a request to an endpoint backed by a Lambda Function
3) Rust Lambda Function uses a long-lived and secure API Token that has permissions to create short-lived disposable tokens
4) Rust Function uses the Momento SDK to request a token with the supplied Topic and Cache names with scopes to publish and subscribe
5) A token is returned from the Lambda Function where the client code can use to subscribe to a Momento topic.
6) The token has an expiration timestamp represented as a Unix Epoch so that the client can refresh before the token has a chance to expireSo let's walk through those steps above and explore the implementation.
  
  
  Implementing a Momento Token Vending Machine with Rust
I know I'm focusing on Lambda, Momento, and Rust, but there are many other components that go into what I'd consider a quality Lambda Function build.  To address those, let's have a look at the CDK code and what all gets shipped to AWS.TypeScript has become my goto when it comes to creating AWS infrastructure.  I like the CDK, and I especially like having the ability to use the Cargo Lambda CDK Construct.  If you haven't used it before, check out the repository and jump into the documentation.  It's straightforward and the classes inherit from AWS bases.  In addition to Cargo Lambda, I like to include the Datadog Lambda Extension.  This piece of goodness allows me to collect my OpenTelemetry traces into the Datadog UI for easy assessment of performance and any latency or error issues.  I'll highlight further as the article evolves.Here we go! The below is the CDK code that brings the above together.
  
  
  Adding the Datadog Extension
Pay special attention to the following when adding the Datadog extension.Region: I'm using the region my Lambda function is hosted inARM/x64: I'm picking the chip architecture that my Lambda Function is compiled for.
Version: 68 in this case, but  can also be used.
I'm going to use a long-lived API key with Momento so that this Lambda Function can make requests without worrying about expiration.  This is completely acceptable solution.  Think of it like a scoped API key essentially.  To set that up, I'm using AWS SecretsManager.
  
  
  Cargo Lambda Rust Function
Wrapping up the infrastructure components is the definition of the Rust Lambda Function and granting its ability to read from the secret defined above in SecretsManager.  Additionally, I'm exposing the function over a FunctionURL.  This of course could be internal behind an Application Load Balancer or exposed behind a variety of API Gateway setups.  The FunctionURL just makes this example simple to pull together.Key things to point out in the  are:Architecture: set to ARM because I prefer to run on the AWS Graviton chipsEnvironment: 

Setting RUST_LOG allows me to control crate log levels (this is a convention)
At this point, using CDK, I can easily run a  and my code will be live in AWS in just a couple of minutes.  However, I'd like to dive in further on the Rust and Lambda code, specifically addressing the Momento Auth piecesAll Rust code (unless it's a lib) starts out with a  function.  Even Lambda Functions must have a .  In my  below, I'm setting up Momento, Datadog, OpenTelemetry, and other reusable components.  Since my handler is what is called over and over, I want to have things warm and in memory, ready to use as events come in.To initialize the OpenTelemetry, I'm establishing a telemetry layer which I'm registering.The next pieces of  are about fetching the Momento API key from the AWS secret I defined in the infrastructure.  And with that secret, I'll construct an instance of the Momento Auth client so that I can communicate with the Auth API and create the disposable tokens.With all Lambda Functions, I need to define a function that will be called when the Lambda Function is supplied events.  For web APIs, that event is a request from an external client.   My  establishes this connection by the following code.As exposed, I need to send a Momento client, the expiration in minutes I want to let the token be valid for, and the event which is the web request.The Lambda Function handler does the following.Parse the body of the request 

Body in the correct format then generate the tokenIf not, return a 400 BAD REQUESTFor the request body, I'm expecting it to look like this.The Rust structure that this serializes into has the following definition.Now with a struct populated with my request data, I can look at how to generate the disposable token.  It's much easier than I thought it might be.
  
  
  Generating the Disposable Token
This disposable token logic is the heart of this Lambda Function's existence.  Remember, Client code or the UI is going to request a token that I want to scope down to the cache and topic supplied in the payload.  This will guarantee that the client has access to what's needed for the duration defined the environment variable discussed above.Let's break the above down just a little.  First up is the  and .The  plugs into OpenTelemetry that allows me to time the Momento operations by way of the Rust Instrument trait.  I highly recommend any Rust code you write take advantage of these opportunities.  Tracing in the spirit of observability will make finding errors and poor user experiences so much easier when you start to get some volume.The next piece of this function is to create the Disposable token.   are a required parameter to the generate_disposable_token function.  For my example, I'm giving the token access to Publish and Subscribe to the Cache/Topic combination.  And notice that the  parameter is finally being used to round out the function call.The last piece of the function is to create the .  The values returned from the Momento function call are used to populate the struct.
  
  
  Measuring Performance with Datadog and OpenTelemetry
So I can't end an article just demonstrating how to fetch disposable tokens written in Rust and deployed in a Lambda Function without talking about performance.  I am always blown away at the speed of Momento's services.  I hadn't done much work with the Auth API so I wanted to see if the timings that I've been accustomed to with Cache and Topics also held true with Auth.  With the observability code using OpenTelemetry that I've shown above, I'm able to not only track the Lambda Function's execution timings, but also the Momento specific API calls via the  trait that I showed above.  I bring this metrics and traces together via Datadog because there isn't a better tool on the market to help me observe my Lambda Functions as well as other cloud resources.
  
  
  High Level Function Latency
First up is looking at the high level Lambda Function latency. I'm graphing the 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles with this Datadog line graph.I've written about Rust and Lambda performance quite a bit over the past 18 months, but I'm always amazed at how quickly and consistently my function code performs with Rust. I can also make the same statements when it comes to pairing Rust with Momento.  Time and time again, their platform performs consistently, regardless of the load and requests I throw at it.  The same can be said about the Auth API that I'm exercising here.  Consistent p95 latency at the 3ms is just fantastic and not going to be noticeable by an end user.High level tracing is great and something that I love about using Datadog, but since I took advantage of the  trait further up, let's have a look at exactly how the Momento Auth operations play into the overall function latency.This table shows the two spans that are included in the overall latency of the Lambda Functions execution.  If you remember from the code well above, I called the Momento Auth span .  I'm happy all day long with an average latency of 1.25ms and a tail p99 latency of 2.19ms.  I can't recommend their Rust SDK enough.  It is my first and preferred way to work with Momento.Working with client code that is insecure by nature that also needs to authenticate with the Momento API for things like Topic subscriptions can be a challenge.  However, by implementing a token vending machine with Rust, deployed with Lambda, and monitored with Datadog produces a solution that is fast, reliable, and observable.  I've been saying this for a while, but I truly believe that building Lambda Functions with Rust is the way to go.  And I love seeing companies like Momento invest in Rust specific SDKs.  This feature to build disposable tokens was just added in 2025 and will unlock developers to implement this vending machine pattern in Rust like I've shown the article.  Thanks for reading and happy building!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Upskilling to Rust from Python</title><link>https://dev.to/rustds/upskilling-to-rust-from-python-mok</link><author>Michael Gonzalez</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:29:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m a long-time data analyst with some data engineering experience. My overall stack time is about:Tableau Desktop – 10 yearsA few years ago, I embarked on a mission to be full stack. I picked up Python and learned how to do ETL operations on my own. I’ve heard great things about the speed and efficiency benefits of Rust over Python, so I wanted to put it to the test.The basic question I have is: what is the absolute furthest that I can take Rust in the direction of data science (to include AI applications) and data engineering? The library environment for data science is extremely robust for Python and I know it’s substantially smaller for Rust, but I’m still interested in taking it as far as I can. Over the next few months, I’m going to be upskilling in Rust and seeing where Rust for DS goes.I’m very aware of structural differences of Rust compared to Python. Memory management and static typing are elements that I’ve never had to care about, but it’s going to need to be a consideration moving forward. Ultimately, I think giving Rust a try will make me a more consciencious developer in that there are a lot of things I just took for granted with Python and SQL.I know absolutely no Rust right now, so I’m leaning on Duke University’s Rust Fundamentals course through Coursera to get me up to speed on the basics.The first week of the course revolved around setting up the VS Code environment for Rust, deploying GitHub Copilot, setting up the dev container, and dockerizing it.I’m very familiar with VS Code for local development, but actually using Docker and working in a containerized environment is new. I’ve been wanting to containerize my org’s Python development environment for at least a year (it’s further down the to-do list), so spending some time on this is gonna pay off later on.No actual Rust development work yet. Looking ahead, it appears that week 2 of the course jumps right into for and while loops. Ech, not a favorite topic of mine, but essential nonetheless.Anyone else using Rust for data operations?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unlocking global AI potential with next-generation subsea infrastructure</title><link>https://engineering.fb.com/2025/02/14/connectivity/project-waterworth-ai-subsea-infrastructure/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:28:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://engineering.fb.com/">Facebook engineering</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LangCompiler: A Cloud-Native, High-Performance Code Execution Service</title><link>https://dev.to/bladearya/langcompiler-a-cloud-native-high-performance-code-execution-service-5a2i</link><author>Amit Kumar Rout</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:07:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Smooth, secure, and scalable execution of code is of paramount concern in modern software development for a variety of applications, from education systems to enterprise applications.

All the facets that describe the shape and meaning of interesting data are not always captured in a handful of pre-generated figures. While we have powerful technologies available for presenting interactive figures — where a viewer can rotate, filter, zoom, and generally explore complex data  —  they always come with tradeoffs.Here I present my experience using a recently released Python library — marimo — which opens up exciting new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations across the entire field of data science.Interactive Data VisualizationThe tradeoffs to consider when selecting an approach for presenting data visualizations can be broken into three categories: — what visualizations and interactivity am I able to present to the user? — what are the resources needed for displaying this visualization to users (e.g. running servers, hosting websites)? – how much of a new skillset / codebase do I need to learn upfront? is the foundation of portable interactivity. Every user has a web browser installed on their computer and there are many different frameworks available for displaying any degree of interactivity or visualization you might imagine (for example, this gallery of amazing things people have made with three.js). Since the application is running on the user’s computer, no costly servers are needed. However, a significant drawback for the data science community is ease of use, as JS does not have many of the high-level (i.e. easy-to-use) libraries that data scientists use for data manipulation, plotting, and interactivity. provides a useful point of comparison. Because of its continually growing popularity, some have called this the “Era of Python”. For data scientists in particular, Python stands alongside R as one of the foundational languages for quickly and effectively wielding complex data. While Python may be easier to use than Javascript, there are fewer options for presenting interactive visualizations. Some popular projects providing interactivity and visualization have been Flask, Dash, and Streamlit (also worth mentioning — bokeh, HoloViews, altair, and plotly). The biggest tradeoff for using Python has been the cost for publishing – delivering the tool to users. In the same way that shinyapps require a running computer to serve up the visualization, these Python-based frameworks have exclusively been server-based. This is by no means prohibitive for authors with a budget to spend, but it does limit the number of users who can take advantage of a particular project. is an intriguing middle ground — Python code running directly in the web browser using WebAssembly (WASM). There are resource limitations (only 1 thread and 2GB memory) that make this impractical for doing the heavy lifting of data science. , this can be more than sufficient for building visualizations and updating based on user input. Because it runs in the browser, no servers are required for hosting. Tools that use Pyodide as a foundation are interesting to explore because they give data scientists an opportunity to write Python code which runs directly on users’ computers without their having to install or run anything outside of the web browser.As an aside, I’ve been interested previously in one project that has tried this approach: stlite, an in-browser implementation of Streamlit that lets you deploy these flexible and powerful apps to a broad range of users. However, a core limitation is that Streamlit itself is distinct from stlite (the port of Streamlit to WASM), which means that not all features are supported and that advancement of the project is dependent on two separate groups working along compatible lines.The interface resembles a Jupyter , which will be familiar to users.Execution of cells is , so that updating one cell will rerun all cells which depend on its output. can be captured with a flexible set of UI components.Notebooks can be quickly converted into , hiding the code and showing only the input/output elements.Apps can be run locally or converted into using WASM/Pyodide.marimo balances the tradeoffs of technology in a way that is well suited to the skill set of the typical data scientists: — user input and visual display features are rather extensive, supporting user input via Altair and Plotly plots. — deploying as static webpages is basically free — no servers required — for users familiar with Python notebooks, marimo will feel very familiar and be easy to pick up.Publishing Marimo Apps on the WebAs a simple example of the type of display that can be useful in data science, consisting of explanatory text interspersed with interactive displays, I have created a barebones GitHub repository. Try it out yourself here.Using just a little bit of code, users can:Generate visualizations with flexible interactivityWrite narrative text describing their findingsPublish to the web for free (i.e. using GitHub Pages)Public App / Private DataThis new technology offers an exciting new opportunity for collaboration — publish the app publicly to the world, but users can only see specific datasets that they have permission to access.Rather than building a dedicated data backend for every app, user data can be stored in a generic backend which can be securely authenticated and accessed using a Python client library — all contained within the user’s web browser. For example, the user is given an OAuth login link that will authenticate them with the backend and allow the app to temporarily access input data.As a proof of concept, I built a simple visualization app which connects to the Cirro data platform, which is used at my institution to manage scientific data. Full disclosure: I was part of the team that built this platform before it spun out as an independent company. In this manner users can:Load the public visualization app — hosted on GitHub PagesConnect securely to their private data storeLoad the appropriate dataset for displayShare a link which will direct authorized collaborators to the same dataAs a data scientist, this approach of publishing free and open-source visualization apps which can be used to interact with private datasets is extremely exciting. Building and publishing a new app can take hours and days instead of weeks and years, letting researchers quickly share their insights with collaborators and then publish them to the wider world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top 22 Sites To Buy Verified Binance Accounts personal</title><link>https://dev.to/hiya_tili_6b6c8383c5ae8c4/top-22-sites-to-buy-verified-binance-accounts-personal-41fk</link><author>Hiya Tili</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:21:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/go">Dev.to Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to more information just contact now.

Is there another way we can improve PHP's performance?In the previous post, we gave an overview of 1BRC, tried to push the limits of PHP when discussing performance optimization, and ran our best PHP script on an EC2 instance.The results were not bad, but not noteworthy either: 17.0636 seconds (the fastest Java code took 1.535 seconds).So what are we supposed to do? Call it a day and get on with our lives? No, obviously not!
We could "cheat" our way to a better score, by abusing one of Python's winning strategies: letting external libraries do the heavy lifting job!
  
  
  Foreign Function Interface
One of the ways to optimize an interpreted language is by moving the slow operations in an external module, usually written in a low-level language.
In PHP you can write system-wide modules and enable them in ; this is useful for generic functions or for code that is not specific to one application.
Since version 7.4 PHP introduced a new feature: Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
FFI is a method for calling external libraries in your PHP coding, without changing global PHP configuration.
This method is more flexible than dealing with modules, but configuring it could be a bit daunting at first.Let's try to wrap a Rust solution of 1BRC in a PHP script (yes, ok, we are definitely cheating).To keep things simple we need a Rust solution that:it's written in a clear wayit's composed of a few filesThere's no need to explain point ; points  and  are needed because we are going to modify the code to make it work as a module.
I love Rust, but I'm not a Rust programmer, so the simpler the code the better.  First of all, we clone the repository, then we edit the  file to add some options:In the  section, we enabled additional performance optimizations (, , ); we added the  section, where we specify that we want to compile the source as a  library (shared libraries that can be linked into external programs).   file is used just to call ; we remove this file and add a  method in : disables the mangle (in short: it keeps the function's name in the exported library) and marks this function as "to export".  We are cheating, but in a responsible way 😅: from PHP code, we pass the weather data filename to the Rust module. Then the Rust module returns the station's aggregated data to be displayed.
PHP is a loosely-typed language, while Rust is a strongly-typed language, so moving data between the two can be a bit of a challenge-in-the-challenge. We need  crate and  from .  The code needed to convert from PHP String to Rust string slice has been taken from ; using it's words:Getting a Rust string slice (&str) requires a few steps:We need to make sure that the C pointer is not  as Rust references are not allowed to be .Use  to wrap the pointer.  will compute the string's length based on the terminating . This requires an  block as we will be dereferencing a raw pointer, which the Rust compiler cannot verify meets all the safety guarantees so the programmer must do it instead.Ensure the C string is valid UTF-8 and convert it to a Rust string slice.In  we use this code:to return a JSON string to the PHP script.  That's it for Rust; we can compile the library with:On the PHP side first of all we need a class to manage the input and output of th Rust module. Let's create a file called :The constructor's code uses  to import the Rust function from the  file.
Here we have to declare the extern function's signature using C code, so the Rust  parameters, become .: it's also possible to use a  header file to specify the function(s) that PHP needs to know about; since we only need one simple function, it is easier to declare it inline in PHP code.The  method invokes the  method of the Rust module (self::$ffi->run($filename)). We called both this wrapper method and the Rust function with the same name (); this is only a coincidence (...or lack of fantasy); it's not mandatory. converts the pointer to a String usable in PHP.We also need an  file to instantiate this  class and to print the results:Nothing interesting here: we call our  method, passing it the measurements filename.
The JSON string from Rust contains temperatures as integers, so we need to divide them by 10 and calculate the average temperature for each station.Let's run this code on the EC2 instance. The configuration is the same as last time: an  with 32 vCPUs and 128GB of memory. For the hard disk, I opted for a 200GB io1 volume (to reach 10,000 IOPS).perf  1B-ffi.log  10  php app/index.php

This is a surprising result, considering the overhead of calling an external module and the fact that we are still making some calculations on the PHP side of the app.After this 2-parts-journey we can affirm that:PHP is slow, but the performance improves significantly when using threadsPerformance tuning is a game of trade-offs: you can improve the speed of a task by saturating all the CPU cores, but your system will become unresponsive. In PHP this is a problem if your application needs to accept more than one connection at a timeFor heavy tasks, you can delegate to optimized external librariesI hope you enjoyed the post!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I Built Open Source Fastest URL Shortener Ever With Rust</title><link>https://dev.to/abdibrokhim/how-i-built-open-source-fastest-url-shortener-ever-with-rust-4ggm</link><author>Ibrohim Abdivokhidov</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:53:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, I’ll be walking you thro building notlink - an open source, blazingly fast URL shortener ever.

But what is data engineering, and why is it so important? In this blog post, we will discuss the essential components of a functioning data engineering practice and why data engineering is becoming increasingly critical for businesses today, and how you can build your very own Data Engineering Center of Excellence!I’ve had the privilege to build, manage, lead, and foster a sizeable high-performing team of data warehouse & ELT engineers for many years. With the help of my team, I have spent a considerable amount of time every year consciously planning and preparing to manage the growth of our data month-over-month and address the changing reporting and analytics needs for our 20000+ global data consumers. We built many data warehouses to store and centralize massive amounts of data generated from many OLTP sources. We’ve implemented Kimball methodology by creating star schemas both within our on-premise data warehouses and in the ones in the cloud.The objective is to enable our user-base to perform fast analytics and reporting on the data; so our analysts’ community and business users can make accurate data-driven decisions.It took me about three years to transform  () of data warehouse and ETL programmers into one cohesive Data Engineering team.I have compiled some of my learnings building a global data engineering team in this post in hopes that Data professionals and leaders of all levels of technical proficiency can benefit.Evolution of the Data EngineerIt has never been a better time to be a data engineer. Over the last decade, we have seen a massive awakening of enterprises now recognizing their data as the company’s heartbeat, making data engineering the job function that ensures accurate, current, and quality data flow to the solutions that depend on it.Historically, the role of Data Engineers has evolved from that of data warehouse developers and the  (extract, transform and load).The data warehouse developers are responsible for designing, building, developing, administering, and maintaining data warehouses to meet an enterprise’s reporting needs. This is done primarily via extracting data from operational and transactional systems and piping it using extract transform load methodology (ETL/ ELT) to a storage layer like a data warehouse or a data lake. The data warehouse or the data lake is where data analysts, data scientists, and business users consume data. The developers also perform transformations to conform the ingested data to a data model with aggregated data for easy analysis.A data engineer’s prime responsibility is to produce and make data securely available for multiple consumers.Data engineers oversee the ingestion, transformation, modeling, delivery, and movement of data through every part of an organization. Data extraction happens from many different data sources & applications. Data Engineers load the data into data warehouses and data lakes, which are transformed not just for the Data Science & predictive analytics initiatives (as everyone likes to talk about) but primarily for data analysts. Data analysts & data scientists perform operational reporting, exploratory analytics, service-level agreement (SLA) based business intelligence reports and dashboards on the catered data. In this book, we will address all of these job functions.The role of a data engineer is to acquire, store, and aggregate data from both cloud and on-premise, new, and existing systems, with data modeling and feasible data architecture. Without the data engineers, analysts and data scientists won’t have valuable data to work with, and hence, data engineers are the first to be hired at the inception of every new data team. Based on the data and analytics tools available within an enterprise, data engineering teams’ role profiles, constructs, and approaches have several options for what should be included in their responsibilities which we will discuss in this chapter.Software is increasingly automating the historically manual and tedious tasks of data engineers. Data processing tools and technologies have evolved massively over several years and will continue to grow. For example, cloud-based data warehouses (Snowflake, for instance) have made data storage and processing affordable and fast. Data pipeline services (like Informatica IICS, Apache Airflow, Matillion, Fivetran) have turned data extraction into work that can be completed quickly and efficiently. The data engineering team should be leveraging such technologies as force multipliers, taking a consistent and cohesive approach to integration and management of enterprise data, not just relying on legacy siloed approaches to building custom data pipelines with fragile, non-performant, hard to maintain code. Continuing with the latter approach will stifle the pace of innovation within the said enterprise and force the future focus to be around managing data infrastructure issues rather than how to help generate value for your business.The primary role of an enterprise Data Engineering team should be to  into a shape that’s ready for analysis — laying the foundation for real-world analytics and data science application.The Data Engineering team should serve as the  for enterprise-level data with the responsibility to curate the organization’s data and act as a resource for those who want to make use of it, such as Reporting & Analytics teams, Data Science teams, and other groups that are doing more self-service or business group driven analytics leveraging the enterprise data platform. This team should serve as the  of organizational knowledge, managing and refining the catalog so that analysis can be done more effectively. Let’s look at the essential responsibilities of a well-functioning Data Engineering team.Responsibilities of a Data Engineering TeamThe Data Engineering team should provide a  within the enterprise that cuts across to support both the Reporting/Analytics and Data Science capabilities to provide access to clean, transformed, formatted, scalable, and secure data ready for analysis. The Data Engineering teams’ core responsibilities should include:· Build, manage, and optimize the core data platform infrastructure· Build and maintain custom and off-the-shelf data integrations and ingestion pipelines from a variety of structured and unstructured sources· Manage overall data pipeline orchestration· Manage transformation of data either before or after load of raw data through both technical processes and business logic· Support analytics teams with design and performance optimizations of data warehousesData is an Enterprise Asset.Data as an Asset should be shared and protected.Data should be valued as an Enterprise asset, leveraged across all Business Units to enhance the company’s value to its respective customer base by accelerating decision making, and improving competitive advantage with the help of data. Good data stewardship, legal and regulatory requirements dictate that we protect the data owned from unauthorized access and disclosure.In other words, managing Security is a crucial responsibility.Why Create a Centralized Data Engineering Team?Treating Data Engineering as a standard and core capability that underpins both the Analytics and Data Science capabilities will help an enterprise evolve how to approach Data and Analytics. The enterprise needs to stop vertically treating data based on the technology stack involved as we tend to see often and move to more of a horizontal approach of managing a  or  that cuts across the organization and can connect to various technologies as needed drive analytic initiatives. This is a new way of thinking and working, but it can drive efficiency as the various data organizations look to scale. Additionally — there is value in creating a dedicated structure and career path for Data Engineering resources. Data engineering skill sets are in high demand in the market; therefore, hiring outside the company can be costly. Companies must enable programmers, database administrators, and software developers with a career path to gain the needed experience with the above-defined skillsets by working across technologies. Usually, forming a data engineering center of excellence or a capability center would be the first step for making such progression possible.Challenges for creating a centralized Data Engineering TeamThe centralization of the Data Engineering team as a service approach is different from how Reporting & Analytics and Data Science teams operate. It does, in principle, mean giving up some level of control of resources and establishing new processes for how these teams will collaborate and work together to deliver initiatives.The Data Engineering team will need to demonstrate that it can effectively support the needs of both Reporting & Analytics and Data Science teams, no matter how large these teams are. Data Engineering teams must effectively prioritize workloads while ensuring they can bring the right skillsets and experience to assigned projects.Data engineering is essential because it serves as the backbone of data-driven companies. It enables analysts to work with clean and well-organized data, necessary for deriving insights and making sound decisions. To build a functioning data engineering practice, you need the following critical components:The Data Engineering team should be a core capability within the enterprise, but it should effectively serve as a support function involved in almost everything data-related. It should interact with the Reporting and Analytics and Data Science teams in a collaborative support role to make the entire team successful.The Data Engineering team doesn’t create direct business value — but the value should come in making the Reporting and Analytics, and Data Science teams more productive and efficient to ensure delivery of maximum value to business stakeholders through Data & Analytics initiatives. To make that possible, the six key responsibilities within the data engineering capability center would be as follow –Let’s review the 6 pillars of responsibilities:1. Determine Central Data Location for Collation and WranglingUnderstanding and having a strategy for a (a centralized data repository or data warehouse for the mass consumption of data for analysis). Defining requisite data tables and where they will be joined in the context of data engineering and subsequently converting raw data into digestible and valuable formats.2. Data Ingestion and TransformationMoving data from one or more sources to a new destination (your data lake or cloud data warehouse) where it can be stored and further analyzed and then converting data from the format of the source system to that of the destinationExtracting, transforming, and loading data from one or more sources into a destination system to represent the data in a new context or style.Data modeling is an essential function of a data engineering team, granted not all data engineers excel with this capability. Formalizing relationships between data objects and business rules into a conceptual representation through understanding information system workflows, modeling required queries, designing tables, determining primary keys, and effectively utilizing data to create informed output.I’ve seen engineers in interviews mess up more with this than coding in technical discussions. It’s essential to understand the differences between Dimensions, Facts, Aggregate tables.Ensuring that sensitive data is protected and implementing proper authentication and authorization to reduce the risk of a data breach6. Architecture and AdministrationDefining the models, policies, and standards that administer what data is collected, where and how it is stored, and how it such data is integrated into various analytical systems.The six pillars of responsibilities for data engineering capabilities center on the ability to determine a central data location for collation and wrangling, ingest and transform data, execute ETL/ELT operations, model data, secure access and administer an architecture. While all companies have their own specific needs with regards to these functions, it is important to ensure that your team has the necessary skillset in order to build a foundation for big data success.Besides the Data Engineering following are the other capability centers that need to be considered within an enterprise:Analytics Capability CenterThe analytics capability center enables consistent, effective, and efficient BI, analytics, and advanced analytics capabilities across the company. Assist business functions in triaging, prioritizing, and achieving their objectives and goals through reporting, analytics, and dashboard solutions, while providing operational reports and visualizations, self-service analytics, and required tools to automate the generation of such insights.Data Science Capability CenterThe data science capability center is for exploring cutting-edge technologies and concepts to unlock new insights and opportunities, better inform employees and create a culture of prescriptive information usage using Automated AI and Automated ML solutions such as H2O.ai, Dataiku, Aible, DataRobot, C3.aiThe data governance office empowers users with trusted, understood, and timely data to drive effectiveness while keeping the integrity and sanctity of data in the right hands for mass consumption.As your company grows, you will want to make sure that the data engineering capabilities are in place to support the six pillars of responsibilities. By doing this, you will be able to ensure that all aspects of data management and analysis are covered and that your data is safe and accessible by those who need it. Have you started thinking about how your company will grow? What steps have you taken to put a centralized data engineering team in place?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Learnings from sharing Kafka vs Fluvio Benchmarks on Reddit</title><link>https://dev.to/debadyuti/5-learnings-from-sharing-kafka-vs-fluvio-benchmarks-on-reddit-34</link><author>Deb</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:22:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To have a readable blog, all the links are at the bottom except the link to the Fluvio project.Yesterday, I shared a blog on benchmarking results comparing Fluvio, our next-generation streaming engine, with Apache Kafka. The response from the Rust community was encouraging, with over 30,000 impressions, 80+ upvotes, and 40+ comments in just 24 hours. The feedback was invaluable, and I want to share the 5 things I learned from all the developer feedback.Fluvio is a distributed streaming engine built in Rust over the past six years. While it follows Apache Kafka's conceptual patterns, it introduces programmable design patterns through Rust and WebAssembly-based stream processing called Stateful DataFlow (SDF). This makes Fluvio a complete platform for event streaming.
  
  
  1. Developers care a lot about the benchmark environment.
The community emphasized the importance of comprehensive testing environments:Need for bare metal servers to eliminate virtualization artifactsProduction-grade setups with proper replication (factor of 3)Large-scale validation with terabyte-scale live dataThe ideal benchmarks will be using real-world data from Blockchain, High-Frequency Trading, or Ad-Tech on bare metal servers and compare multiple systems like Kafka, RedPanda, Pulsar.
  
  
  2. Intelligent developers know about the trade-offs of using different hardware.
Developers highlighted several hardware-specific considerations:ARM Graviton chips' latency variations in virtualized environmentsImportance of testing across different CPU architectures including x86Thermal throttling differences between consumer laptops and server-grade hardware
  
  
  3. Seasoned developers want production-ready configuration for each solution being configured
Runtime mechanics need to reflect real-world scenarios:Specific JVM and Garbage Collector configurations for Kafka benchmarkingResource utilization patterns under various loadsMulti-node deployment testing at scale
  
  
  4. While benchmarks are great benchmarking in mature categories require mention of table-stakes features
Key functionality developers look for:Consumer groups for ordered delivery per partitionStream and batch processing capabilitiesRobust delivery guarantees
  
  
  5. Benchmarks also immediately makes developers think of reliability and debugging experience
Critical operational features:Dead letter queue implementationsRetry strategies for network issuesDelivery proof mechanisms beyond best-effort
  
  
  The New Streaming Paradigm
Event streaming is a basic pattern in a world filled with agents.Wise developers focus on:Practical performance over theoretical maximaTransparent benchmarking methodologyIntuitive deployment and management
  
  
  Our Vision for Next Generation Data Intensive Applications
We believe the next wave of intelligent applications will come from builders who:Challenge traditional infrastructure assumptionsRequire millisecond latencies at scalePrioritize resource efficiencyWe don't just need faster systems - we need smarter ones that don't drain budgets or sanity.The future belongs to systems that balance raw performance with operational wisdom. The question isn't just about speed—it's about enabling rapid innovation delivering an intuitive developer ergonomics while maintaining efficiency and reliability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It&apos;s time to go ESM-only</title><link>https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/723</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>frontend</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://javascriptweekly.com/">Javascript Weekly</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🤯 Pfft, vehicle data is a joke without CarsXE.

We raised money to do that, and to place some bets; one of them: GPU-enabling our customers. A progress report: GPUs aren’t going anywhere, but: GPUs aren’t going anywhere.A Fly Machine is a Docker/OCI container running inside a hardware-virtualized virtual machine somewhere on our global fleet of bare-metal worker servers. A GPU Machine is a Fly Machine with a hardware-mapped Nvidia GPU. It’s a Fly Machine that can do fast CUDA.Like everybody else in our industry, we were right about the importance of AI/ML. If anything, we underestimated its importance. But the product we came up with probably doesn’t fit the moment. It’s a bet that doesn’t feel like it’s paying off.If you’re using Fly GPU Machines, don’t freak out; we’re not getting rid of them. But if you’re waiting for us to do something bigger with them, a v2 of the product, you’ll probably be waiting awhile.GPU Machines were not a small project for us. Fly Machines run on an idiosyncratically small hypervisor (normally Firecracker, but for GPU Machines Intel’s Cloud Hypervisor, a very similar Rust codebase that supports PCI passthrough). The Nvidia ecosystem is not geared to supporting micro-VM hypervisors.GPUs terrified our security team. A GPU is just about the worst case hardware peripheral: intense multi-directional direct memory transfers(not even bidirectional: in common configurations, GPUs talk to each other)with arbitrary, end-user controlled computation, all operating outside our normal security boundary.We did a couple expensive things to mitigate the risk. We shipped GPUs on dedicated server hardware, so that GPU- and non-GPU workloads weren’t mixed. Because of that, the only reason for a Fly Machine to be scheduled on a GPU machine was that it needed a PCI BDF for an Nvidia GPU, and there’s a limited number of those available on any box. Those GPU servers were drastically less utilized and thus less cost-effective than our ordinary servers.We funded two very large security assessments, from Atredis and Tetrel, to evaluate our GPU deployment. Matt Braun is writing up those assessments now. They were not cheap, and they took time.Security wasn’t directly the biggest cost we had to deal with, but it was an indirect cause for a subtle reason.We could have shipped GPUs very quickly by doing what Nvidia recommended: standing up a standard K8s cluster to schedule GPU jobs on. Had we taken that path, and let our GPU users share a single Linux kernel, we’d have been on Nvidia’s driver happy-path.Alternatively, we could have used a conventional hypervisor. Nvidia suggested VMware (heh). But they could have gotten things working had we used QEMU. We like QEMU fine, and could have talked ourselves into a security story for it, but the whole point of Fly Machines is that they take milliseconds to start. We could not have offered our desired Developer Experience on the Nvidia happy-path.Instead, we burned months trying (and ultimately failing) to get Nvidia’s host drivers working to map virtualized GPUs into Intel Cloud Hypervisor. At one point, we hex-edited the closed-source drivers to trick them into thinking our hypervisor was QEMU.I’m not sure any of this really mattered in the end. There’s a segment of the market we weren’t ever really able to explore because Nvidia’s driver support kept us from thin-slicing GPUs. We’d have been able to put together a really cheap offering for developers if we hadn’t run up against that, and developers love “cheap”, but I can’t prove that those customers are real.On the other hand, we’re committed to delivering the Fly Machine DX for GPU workloads. Beyond the PCI/IOMMU drama, just getting an entire hardware GPU working in a Fly Machine was a lift. We needed Fly Machines that would come up with the right Nvidia drivers; our stack was built assuming that the customer’s OCI container almost entirely defined the root filesystem for a Machine. We had to engineer around that in our  orchestrator. And almost everything people want to do with GPUs involves efficiently grabbing huge files full of model weights. Also annoying!And, of course, we bought GPUs. A lot of GPUs. Expensive GPUs.The biggest problem: developers don’t want GPUs. They don’t even want AI/ML models. They want LLMs.  may have smart, fussy opinions on how to get their models loaded with CUDA, and what the best GPU is. But  don’t care about any of that. When a software developer shipping an app comes looking for a way for their app to deliver prompts to an LLM, you can’t just give them a GPU.For those developers, who probably make up most of the market, it doesn’t seem plausible for an insurgent public cloud to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. Their APIs are fast enough, and developers thinking about performance in terms of “tokens per second” aren’t counting milliseconds.(you should all feel sympathy for us)This makes us sad because we really like the point in the solution space we found. Developers shipping apps on Amazon will outsource to other public clouds to get cost-effective access to GPUs. But then they’ll faceplant trying to handle data and model weights, backhauling gigabytes (at significant expense) from S3. We have app servers, GPUs, and object storage all under the same top-of-rack switch. But inference latency just doesn’t seem to matter yet, so the market doesn’t care.Past that, and just considering the system engineers who do care about GPUs rather than LLMs: the hardware product/market fit here is really rough.People doing serious AI work want galactically huge amounts of GPU compute. A whole enterprise A100 is a compromise position for them; they want an SXM cluster of H100s.Near as we can tell, MIG gives you a UUID to talk to the host driver, not a PCI device.We think there’s probably a market for users doing lightweight ML work getting tiny GPUs. This is what Nvidia MIG does, slicing a big GPU into arbitrarily small virtual GPUs. But for fully-virtualized workloads, it’s not baked; we can’t use it. And I’m not sure how many of those customers there are, or whether we’d get the density of customers per server that we need.That leaves the L40S customers. There are a bunch of these! We dropped L40S prices last year, not because we were sour on GPUs but because they’re the one part we have in our inventory people seem to get a lot of use out of. We’re happy with them. But they’re just another kind of compute that some apps need; they’re not a driver of our core business. They’re not the GPU bet paying off.Really, all of this is just a long way of saying that for most software developers, “AI-enabling” their app is best done with API calls to things like Claude and GPT, Replicate and RunPod.A very useful way to look at a startup is that it’s a race to learn stuff. So, what’s our report card?First off, when we embarked down this path in 2022, we were (like many other companies) operating in a sort of phlogiston era of AI/ML. The industry attention to AI had not yet collapsed around a small number of foundational LLM models. We expected there to be a diversity of  models, the world Elixir Bumblebee looks forward to, where people pull different AI workloads off the shelf the same way they do Ruby gems.But Cursor happened, and, as they say, how are you going to keep ‘em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus? It seems much clearer where things are heading.GPUs were a test of a Fly.io company credo: as we think about core features, we design for 10,000 developers, not for 5-6. It took a minute, but the credo wins here: GPU workloads for the 10,001st developer are a niche thing.Another way to look at a startup is as a series of bets. We put a lot of chips down here. But the buy-in for this tournament gave us a lot of chips to play with. Never making a big bet of any sort isn’t a winning strategy. I’d rather we’d flopped the nut straight, but I think going in on this hand was the right call.A really important thing to keep in mind here, and something I think a lot of startup thinkers sleep on, is the extent to which this bet involved acquiring assets. Obviously, some of our costs here aren’t recoverable. But the hardware parts that aren’t generating revenue will ultimately get liquidated; like with our portfolio of IPv4 addresses, I’m even more comfortable making bets backed by tradable assets with durable value.In the end, I don’t think GPU Fly Machines were going to be a hit for us no matter what we did. Because of that, one thing I’m very happy about is that we didn’t compromise the rest of the product for them. Security concerns slowed us down to where we probably learned what we needed to learn a couple months later than we could have otherwise, but we’re scaling back our GPU ambitions without having sacrificed any of our isolation story, and, ironically, GPUs  are making that story a lot more important. The same thing goes for our Fly Machine developer experience.We started this company building a Javascript runtime for edge computing. We learned that our customers didn’t want a new Javascript runtime; they just wanted their native code to work. We shipped containers, and no convincing was needed. We were wrong about Javascript edge functions, and I think we were wrong about GPUs. That’s usually how we figure out the right answers:  by being wrong about a lot of stuff.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: SQL Noir – Learn SQL by solving crimes</title><link>https://www.sqlnoir.com/</link><author>chrisBHappy</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 21:49:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">Show HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bojan Mihelac: Prefixed Parameters for Django querystring tag</title><link>http://code.informatikamihelac.com/en/query-string-with-prefixed-parameters/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 21:37:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An overview of Django 5.1's new querystring tag and how to add support for prefixed parameters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer — Part 5: The Training</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-5-the-training/</link><author>David Martin</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 21:04:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this fifth part of my series, I will outline the steps for creating a Docker container for training your image classification model, evaluating performance, and preparing for deployment.AI/ML engineers would prefer to focus on model training and data engineering, but the reality is that we also need to understand the infrastructure and mechanics behind the scenes.I hope to share some tips, not only to get your training run running, but how to streamline the process in a cost efficient manner on cloud resources such as Kubernetes.I will reference elements from my previous articles for getting the best model performance, so be sure to check out Part 1 and Part 2 on the data sets, as well as Part 3 and Part 4 on model evaluation.Here are the learnings that I will share with you, once we lay the groundwork on the infrastructure:Building your Docker containerExecuting your training runFirst, let me provide a brief description of the setup that I created, specifically around Kubernetes. Your setup may be entirely different, and that is just fine. I simply want to set the stage on the infrastructure so that the rest of the discussion makes sense.This is a server you deploy that provides a user interface to for your subject matter experts to label and evaluate images for the image classification application. The server can run as a pod on your Kubernetes cluster, but you may find that running a dedicated server with faster disk may be better.Image files are stored in a directory structure like the following, which is self-documenting and easily modified.Image_Library/
  - cats/
    - image1001.png
  - dogs/
    - image2001.pngIdeally, these files would reside on local server storage (instead of cloud or cluster storage) for better performance. The reason for this will become clear as we see what happens as the image library grows.Cloud Storage allows for a virtually limitless and convenient way to share files between systems. In this case, the image library on your management system could access the same files as your Kubernetes cluster or Docker engine.However, the downside of cloud storage is the latency to open a file. Your image library will have  of images, and the latency to read each file will have a significant impact on your training run time. Longer training runs means more cost for using the expensive GPU processors!The way that I found to speed things up is to create a  file of your image library on your management system and copy them to cloud storage. Even better would be to create multiple tar files , each containing 10,000 to 20,000 images.This way you only have network latency on a handful of files (which contain thousands, once extracted) and you start your training run much sooner.Kubernetes or Docker engineA Kubernetes cluster, with proper configuration, will allow you to dynamically scale up/down nodes, so you can perform your model training on GPU hardware as needed. Kubernetes is a rather heavy setup, and there are other container engines that will work.The technology options change constantly!The main idea is that you want to spin up the resources you need — for only as long as you need them — then scale down to reduce your time (and therefore cost) of running expensive GPU resources.Once your GPU node is started and your Docker container is running, you can extract the  files above to  storage, such as an , on your node. The node typically has high-speed SSD disk, ideal for this type of workload. There is one caveat — the storage capacity on your node must be able to handle your image library.Assuming we are good, let’s talk about building your Docker container so that you can train your model on your image library.Building your Docker containerBeing able to execute a training run in a consistent manner lends itself perfectly to building a Docker container. You can “pin” the version of libraries so you know exactly how your scripts will run every time. You can version control your containers as well, and revert to a known good image in a pinch. What is really nice about Docker is you can run the container pretty much anywhere.The tradeoff when running in a container, especially with an Image Classification model, is the speed of file storage. You can attach any number of volumes to your container, but they are usually  attached, so there is latency on each file read. This may not be a problem if you have a small number of files. But when dealing with hundreds of thousands of files like image data, that latency adds up!This is why using the  file method outlined above can be beneficial.Also, keep in mind that Docker containers could be terminated unexpectedly, so you should make sure to store important information outside the container, on cloud storage or a database. I’ll show you how below.Knowing that you will need to run on GPU hardware (here I will assume Nvidia), be sure to select the right base image for your Dockerfile, such as  with the “devel flavor that will contain the right drivers.Next, you will add the script files to your container, along with a “batch” script to coordinate the execution. Here is an example Dockerfile, and then I’ll describe what each of the scripts will be doing.#####   Dockerfile   #####

CMD tail -f /dev/nullDockerfiles are declarative, almost like a cookbook for building a small server — you know what you’ll get every time. Python libraries benefit, too, from this declarative approach. Here is a sample  file that loads the TensorFlow libraries with CUDA support for GPU acceleration.#####   requirements.txt   #####

pandas==2.1.4
scipy==1.11.4
keras==2.15.0
tensorflow[and-cuda]Extract Image Library scriptIn Kubernetes, the Docker container can access local, high speed storage on the physical node. This can be achieved via the  volume type. As mentioned before, this will only work if the local storage on your node can handle the size of your library.#####   sample 25GB emptyDir volume in Kubernetes   #####
containers:
  - name: training-container
    volumeMounts:
      - name: image-library
        mountPath: /mnt/image-library
volumes:
  - name: image-library
    emptyDir:
      sizeLimit: 25GiYou would want to have another  to your cloud storage where you have the  files. What this looks like will depend on your provider, or if you are using a persistent volume claim, so I won’t go into detail here.Now you can extract the  files — ideally in parallel for an added performance boost — to the local mount point.As AI/ML engineers, the model training is where we want to spend most of our time.This is where the magic happens!With your image library now extracted, we can create our train-validation-test sets, load a pre-trained model or build a new one, fit the model, and save the results.One key technique that has served me well is to load the most recently trained model as my base. I discuss this in more detail in Part 4 under “Fine tuning”, this results in faster training time and significantly improved model performance.Be sure to take advantage of the local storage to checkpoint your model during training since the models are quite large and you are paying for the GPU even while it sits idle writing to disk.This of course raises a concern about what happens if the Docker container dies part-way though the training. The risk is (hopefully) low from a cloud provider, and you may not want an incomplete training anyway. But if that does happen, you will at least want to understand , and this is where saving the main log file to cloud storage (described below) or to a package like MLflow comes in handy.After your training run has completed and you have taken proper precaution on saving your work, it is time to see how well it performed.Normally this evaluation script will pick up on the model that just finished. But you may decide to point it at a previous model version through an interactive session. This is why have the script as stand-alone.With it being a separate script, that means it will need to read the completed model from disk — ideally local disk for speed. I like having two separate scripts (training and evaluation), but you might find it better to combine these to avoid reloading the model.Now that the model is loaded, the evaluation script should generate predictions on  image in the training, validation, test, and benchmark sets. I save the results as a  matrix with the softmax confidence score for each class label. So, if there are 1,000 classes and 100,000 images, that’s a table with 100 million scores!I save these results in  files that are then used in the score generation next.Taking the matrix of scores produced by the evaluation script above, we can now create various metrics of model performance. Again, this process could be combined with the evaluation script above, but my preference is for independent scripts. For example, I might want to regenerate scores on previous training runs. See what works for you.Here are some of the  functions that produce useful insights like F1, log loss, AUC-ROC, Matthews correlation coefficient.from sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss, matthews_corrcoef, roc_auc_scoreAside from these basic statistical analyses for each dataset (train, validation, test, and benchmark), it is also useful to identify:Which  labels get the most number of errors?Which  labels get the most number of incorrect guesses?How many ground-truth-to-predicted label pairs are there? In other words, which classes are easily confused?What is the  when applying a minimum softmax confidence score threshold?What is the  above that softmax threshold?For the “difficult” benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently  score?For the “out-of-scope” benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently  score?As you can see, there are multiple calculations and it’s not easy to come up with a single evaluation to decide if the trained model is good enough to be moved to production.In fact, for an image classification model, it is helpful to manually review the images that the model got wrong, as well as the ones that got a low softmax confidence score. Use the scores from this script to create a list of images to manually review, and then get a  for how well the model performs.Check out Part 3 for more in-depth discussion on evaluation and scoring.All of the heavy lifting is done by this point. Since your Docker container will be shutdown soon, now is the time to copy the model artifacts to cloud storage and prepare them for being put to use.The example Python code snippet below is more geared to Keras and TensorFlow. This will take the trained model and export it as a . Later, I will show how this is used by TensorFlow Serving in the  section below.# Increment current version of model and create new directory
next_version_dir, version_number = create_new_version_folder()

# Copy model artifacts to the new directory
copy_model_artifacts(next_version_dir)

# Create the directory to save the model export
saved_model_dir = os.path.join(next_version_dir, str(version_number))

# Save the model export for use with TensorFlow Serving
tf.keras.backend.set_learning_phase(0)
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(keras_model_file)
tf.saved_model.save(model, export_dir=saved_model_dir)This script also copies the other training run artifacts such as the model evaluation results, score summaries, and log files generated from model training. Don’t forget about your label map so you can give human readable names to your classes!Bulk identification scriptYour training run is complete, your model has been scored, and a new version is exported and ready to be served. Now is the time to use this latest model to assist you on trying to identify unlabeled images.As I described in Part 4, you may have a collection of “unknowns” — really good pictures, but no idea what they are. Let your new model provide a best guess on these and record the results to a file or a database. Now you can create filters based on closest match and by high/low scores. This allows your subject matter experts to leverage these filters to find new image classes, add to existing classes, or to remove images that have very low scores and are no good.By the way, I put this step inside the GPU container since you may have thousands of “unknown” images to process and the accelerated hardware will make light work of it. However, if you are not in a hurry, you could perform this step on a separate CPU node, and shutdown your GPU node sooner to save cost. This would especially make sense if your “unknowns” folder is on slower cloud storage.All of the scripts described above perform a specific task — from extracting your image library, executing model training, performing evaluation and scoring, exporting the model artifacts for deployment, and perhaps even bulk identification.One script to rule them allTo coordinate the entire show, this batch script gives you the entry point for your container and an easy way to trigger everything. Be sure to produce a log file in case you need to analyze any failures along the way. Also, be sure to write the log to your cloud storage in case the container dies unexpectedly.#!/bin/bash
# Main batch control script

# Redirect standard output and standard error to a log file
exec > /cloud_storage/batch-logfile.txt 2>&1

/app/ExtractImageLibrary.py
/app/Training.py
/app/Evaluation.py
/app/ScorePerformance.py
/app/ExportModel.py
/app/BulkIdentification.pyExecuting your training runSo, now it’s time to put everything in motion…Let’s go through the steps to prepare your image library, fire up your Docker container to train your model, and then examine the results.Image library ‘tar’ filesYour image management system should now create a  file backup of your data. Since  is a single-threaded function, you will get significant speed improvement by creating multiple tar files in parallel, each with a portion of you data.Now these files can be copied to your shared cloud storage for the next step.All the hard work you put into creating your container (described above) will be put to the test. If you are running Kubernetes, you can create a Job that will execute the  script.Inside the Kubernetes Job definition, you can pass environment variables to adjust the execution of your script. For example, the batch size and number of epochs are set here and then pulled into your Python scripts, so you can alter the behavior without changing your code.#####   sample Job in Kubernetes   #####
containers:
  - name: training-job
    env:
      - name: BATCH_SIZE
        value: 50
      - name: NUM_EPOCHS
        value: 30
    command: ["/app/BatchControl.sh"]Once the Job is completed, be sure to verify that the GPU node properly scales back down to zero according to your scaling configuration in Kubernetes — you don’t want to be saddled with a huge bill over a simple configuration error.With the training run complete, you should now have model artifacts saved and can examine the performance. Look through the metrics, such as F1 and log loss, and benchmark accuracy for high softmax confidence scores.As mentioned earlier, the reports only tell part of the story. It is worth the time and effort to manually review the images that the model got wrong or where it produced a low confidence score.Don’t forget about the bulk identification. Be sure to leverage these to locate new images to fill out your data set, or to find new classes.Once you have reviewed your model performance and are satisfied with the results, it is time to modify your TensorFlow Serving container to put the new model into production.TensorFlow Serving is available as a Docker container and provides a very quick and convenient way to serve your model. This container can listen and respond to API calls for your model.Let’s say your new model is version 7, and your  script (see above) has saved the model in your cloud share as /image_application/models/007. You can start the TensorFlow Serving container with that volume mount. In this example, the  points to folder for version 007.#####   sample TensorFlow pod in Kubernetes   #####
containers:
  - name: tensorflow-serving
    image: bitnami/tensorflow-serving:2.18.0
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8501
    env:
      - name: TENSORFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_NAME
        value: "image_application"
    volumeMounts:
      - name: models-subfolder
        mountPath: "/bitnami/model-data"

volumes:
  - name: models-subfolder
    azureFile:
      shareName: "image_application/models/007"A subtle note here — the export script should create a sub-folder, named 007 (same as the base folder), with the saved model export. This may seem a little confusing, but TensorFlow Serving will mount this share folder as  and detect the numbered sub-folder inside it for the version to serve. This will allow you to query the API for the model version as well as the identification.As I mentioned at the start of this article, this setup has worked for my situation. This is certainly not the only way to approach this challenge, and I invite you to customize your own solution.I wanted to share my hard-fought learnings as I embraced cloud services in Kubernetes, with the desire to keep costs under control. Of course, doing all this while maintaining a high level of model performance is an added challenge, but one that you can achieve.I hope I have provided enough information here to help you with your own endeavors. Happy learnings!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer — Part 3: The Evaluation</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/</link><author>David Martin</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 21:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this third part of my series, I will explore the evaluation process which is a critical piece that will lead to a cleaner data set and elevate your model performance. We will see the difference between evaluation of a  model (one not yet in production), and evaluation of a  model (one making real-world predictions).In Part 1, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your Image Classification project. I showed how to define “good” images and create sub-classes. In Part 2, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, such as benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images.Evaluation of the trained modelAs machine learning engineers we look at accuracy, F1, log loss, and other metrics to decide if a model is ready to move to production. These are all important measures, but from my experience, these scores can be deceiving especially as the number of classes grows.Although it can be time consuming, I find it very important to manually review the images that the model gets , as well as the images that the model gives a  softmax “confidence” score to. This means adding a step immediately after your training run completes to calculate scores for  images — training, validation, test, and the benchmark sets. You only need to bring up for manual review the ones that the model had problems with. This should only be a small percentage of the total number of images. See the Double-check process belowWhat you do during the manual evaluation is to put yourself in a “” to ensure that the labelling standards are being followed that you setup in Part 1. Ask yourself:“Is this a good image?” Is the subject front and center, and can you clearly see all the features?“Is this the correct label?” Don’t be surprised if you find wrong labels.You can either remove the bad images or fix the labels if they are wrong. Otherwise you can keep them in the data set and force the model to do better next time. Other questions I ask are:“Why did the model get this wrong?”“Why did this image get a low score?”“What is it about the image that caused confusion?”Sometimes the answer has nothing to do with  specific image. Frequently, it has to do with the  images, either in the ground truth class or in the predicted class. It is worth the effort to Double-check all images in both sets if you see a consistently bad guess. Again, don’t be surprised if you find poor images or wrong labels.When doing the evaluation of the trained model (above), we apply a lot of subjective analysis — “Why did the model get this wrong?” and “Is this a good image?” From these, you may only get a .Frequently, I will decide to hold off moving a model forward to production based on that gut feel. But how can you justify to your manager that you want to hit the brakes? This is where putting a more  analysis comes in by creating a weighted average of the softmax “confidence” scores.In order to apply a weighted evaluation, we need to identify sets of classes that deserve adjustments to the score. Here is where I create a list of “commonly confused” classes.Commonly confused classesCertain animals at our zoo can easily be mistaken. For example, African elephants and Asian elephants have different ear shapes. If your model gets these two mixed up, that is not as bad as guessing a giraffe! So perhaps you give partial credit here. You and your subject matter experts (SMEs) can come up with a list of these pairs and a weighted adjustment for each.This weight can be factored into a modified cross-entropy loss function in the equation below. The back half of this equation will reduce the impact of being wrong for specific pairs of ground truth and prediction by using the “weight” function as a lookup. By default, the weighted adjustment would be 1 for all pairings, and the commonly confused classes would get something like 0.5.In other words, it’s better to be unsure (have a  confidence score) when you are wrong, compared to being super confident and wrong.Once this weighted log loss is calculated, I can compare to previous training runs to see if the new model is ready for production.Confidence threshold reportAnother valuable measure that incorporates the confidence threshold (in my example, 95) is to report on accuracy and false positive rates. Recall that when we apply the confidence threshold before presenting results, we help reduce false positives from being shown to the end user.In this table, we look at the breakdown of “true positive above 95” for each data set. We get a sense that when a “good” picture comes through (like the ones from our train-validation-test set) it is very likely to surpass the threshold, thus the user is “happy” with the outcome. Conversely, the “false positive above 95” is extremely low for good pictures, thus only a small number of our users will be “sad” about the results.We expect the train-validation-test set results to be exceptional since our data is curated. So, as long as people take “good” pictures, the model should do very well. But to get a sense of how it does on extreme situations, let’s take a look at our benchmarks.The “difficult” benchmark has more modest true positive and false positive rates, which reflects the fact that the images are more challenging. These values are much easier to compare across training runs, so that lets me set a min/max target. So for example, if I target a minimum of 80% for true positive, and maximum of 5% for false positive on this benchmark, then I can feel confident moving this to production.The “out-of-scope” benchmark has no true positive rate because  of the images belong to any class the model can identify. Remember, we picked things like a bag of popcorn, etc., that are not zoo animals, so there cannot be any true positives. But we do get a false positive rate, which means the model gave a confident score to that bag of popcorn as some animal. And if we set a target maximum of 10% for this benchmark, then we may not want to move it to production.Right now, you may be thinking, “Well, what animal did it pick for the bag of popcorn?” Excellent question! Now you understand the importance of doing a manual review of the images that get bad results.Evaluation of the deployed modelThe evaluation that I described above applies to a model immediately after . Now, you want to evaluate how your model is doing in the . The process is similar, but requires you to shift to a “” and asking yourself, “Did the model get this correct?” and “Should it have gotten this correct?” and “Did we tell the user the right thing?”So, imagine that you are logging in for the morning — after sipping on your cold brew coffee, of course — and are presented with 500 images that your zoo guests took yesterday of different animals. Your job is to determine how satisfied the guests were using your model to identify the zoo animals.Using the softmax “confidence” score for each image, we have a threshold before presenting results. Above the threshold, we tell the guest what the model predicted. I’ll call this the “happy path”. And below the threshold is the “sad path” where we ask them to try again.Your review interface will first show you all the “happy path” images one at a time. This is where you ask yourself, “Did we get this right?” Hopefully, yes!But if not, this is where things get tricky. So now you have to ask, “Why not?” Here are some things that it could be:“Bad” picture — Poor lighting, bad angle, zoomed out, etc — refer to your labelling standards.Out-of-scope — It’s a zoo animal, but unfortunately one that isn’t found in  zoo. Maybe it belongs to another zoo (your guest likes to travel and try out your app). Consider adding these to your data set.Out-of-scope — It’s not a zoo animal. It could be an animal in your zoo, but not one typically  there, like a neighborhood sparrow or mallard duck. This might be a candidate to add.Out-of-scope — It’s something found in the zoo. A zoo usually has interesting trees and shrubs, so people might try to identify those. Another candidate to add.Prankster — Completely out-of-scope. Because people like to play with technology, there’s the possibility you have a prankster that took a picture of a bag of popcorn, or a soft drink cup, or even a selfie. These are hard to prevent, but hopefully get a low enough score (below the threshold) so the model did not identify it as a zoo animal. If you see enough pattern in these, consider creating a class with special handling on the front-end.After reviewing the “happy path” images, you move on to the “sad path” images — the ones that got a low confidence score and the app gave a “sorry, try again” message. This time you ask yourself, “ the model have given this image a higher score?” which would have put it in the “happy path”. If so, then you want to ensure these images are added to the training set so next time it will do better. But most of time, the low score reflects many of the “bad” or out-of-scope situations mentioned above.Perhaps your model performance is suffering and it has nothing to do with your model. Maybe it is the ways you users interacting with the app. Keep an eye out of non-technical problems and share your observations with the rest of your team. For example:Are your users using the application in the ways you expected?Are they not following the instructions?Do the instructions need to be stated more clearly?Is there anything you can do to improve the experience?Collect statistics and new imagesBoth of the manual evaluations above open a gold mine of data. So, be sure to collect these statistics and feed them into a dashboard — your manager and your future self will thank you!Keep track of these stats and generate reports that you and your can reference:How often the model is being called?What times of the day, what days of the week is it used?Are your system resources able to handle the peak load?What classes are the most common?After evaluation, what is the accuracy for each class?What is the breakdown for confidence scores?How many scores are above and below the confidence threshold?The single best thing you get from a deployed model is the additional real-world images! You can add these now images to improve coverage of your existing zoo animals. But more importantly, they provide you insight on  classes to add. For example, let’s say people enjoy taking a picture of the large walrus statue at the gate. Some of these may make sense to incorporate into your data set to provide a better user experience.Creating a new class, like the walrus statue, is not a huge effort, and it avoids the false positive responses. It would be more embarrassing to identify a walrus statue as an elephant! As for the prankster and the bag of popcorn, you can configure your front-end to quietly handle these. You might even get creative and have fun with it like, “Thank you for visiting the food court.”It is a good idea to double-check your image set when you suspect there may be problems with your data. I’m not suggesting a top-to-bottom check, because that would a monumental effort! Rather specific classes that you suspect could contain bad data that is degrading your model performance.Immediately after my training run completes, I have a script that will use this new model to generate predictions for my  data set. When this is complete, it will take the list of incorrect identifications, as well as the low scoring predictions, and automatically feed that list into the Double-check interface.This interface will show, one at a time, the image in question, alongside an example image of the ground truth and an example image of what the model predicted. I can visually compare the three, side-by-side. The first thing I do is ensure the original image is a “good” picture, following my labelling standards. Then I check if the ground-truth label is indeed correct, or if there is something that made the model think it was the predicted label.Remove the original image if the image quality is poor.Relabel the image if it belongs in a different class.During this manual evaluation, you might notice dozens of the same wrong prediction. Ask yourself why the model made this mistake when the images seem perfectly fine. The answer may be some incorrect labels on images in the ground truth, or even in the predicted class!Don’t hesitate to add those classes and sub-classes back into the Double-check interface and step through them all. You may have 100–200 pictures to review, but there is a good chance that one or two of the images will stand out as being the culprit.With a different mindset for a trained model versus a deployed model, we can now evaluate performances to decide which models are ready for production, and how well a production model is going to serve the public. This relies on a solid Double-check process and a critical eye on your data. And beyond the “gut feel” of your model, we can rely on the benchmark scores to support us.In Part 4, we kick off the training run, but there are some subtle techniques to get the most out of the process and even ways to leverage throw-away models to expand your library image data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build a dynamic, role-based AI agent using Amazon Bedrock inline agents</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-dynamic-role-based-ai-agent-using-amazon-bedrock-inline-agents/</link><author>Ishan Singh</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:56:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI agents continue to gain momentum, as businesses use the power of generative AI to reinvent customer experiences and automate complex workflows. We are seeing Amazon Bedrock Agents applied in investment research, insurance claims processing, root cause analysis, advertising campaigns, and much more. Agents use the reasoning capability of foundation models (FMs) to break down user-requested tasks into multiple steps. They use developer-provided instructions to create an orchestration plan and carry out that plan by securely invoking company APIs and accessing knowledge bases using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to accurately handle the user’s request.Although organizations see the benefit of agents that are defined, configured, and tested as managed resources, we have increasingly seen the need for an additional, more dynamic way to invoke agents. Organizations need solutions that adjust on the fly—whether to test new approaches, respond to changing business rules, or customize solutions for different clients. This is where the new inline agents capability in Amazon Bedrock Agents becomes transformative. It allows you to dynamically adjust your agent’s behavior at runtime by changing its instructions, tools, guardrails, knowledge bases, prompts, and even the FMs it uses—all without redeploying your application.In this post, we explore how to build an application using Amazon Bedrock inline agents, demonstrating how a single AI assistant can adapt its capabilities dynamically based on user roles.Inline agents in Amazon Bedrock AgentsThis runtime flexibility enabled by inline agents opens powerful new possibilities, such as: – Inline agents minimize the time-consuming create/update/prepare cycles traditionally required for agent configuration changes. Developers can instantly test different combinations of models, tools, and knowledge bases, dramatically accelerating the development process.A/B testing and experimentation – Data science teams can systematically evaluate different model-tool combinations, measure performance metrics, and analyze response patterns in controlled environments. This empirical approach enables quantitative comparison of configurations before production deployment.Subscription-based personalization – Software companies can adapt features based on each customer’s subscription level, providing more advanced tools for premium users.Persona-based data source integration – Institutions can adjust content complexity and tone based on the user’s profile, providing persona-appropriate explanations and resources by changing the knowledge bases associated to the agent on the fly. – Developers can create applications with hundreds of APIs, and quickly and accurately carry out tasks by dynamically choosing a small subset of APIs for the agent to consider for a given request. This is particularly helpful for large software as a service (SaaS) platforms needing multi-tenant scaling.Inline agents expand your options for building and deploying agentic solutions with Amazon Bedrock Agents. For workloads needing managed and versioned agent resources with a pre-determined and tested configuration (specific model, instructions, tools, and so on), developers can continue to use InvokeAgent on resources created with CreateAgent. For workloads that need dynamic runtime behavior changes for each agent invocation, you can use the new InvokeInlineAgent API. With either approach, your agents will be secure and scalable, with configurable guardrails, a flexible set of model inference options, native access to knowledge bases, code interpretation, session memory, and more.Our HR assistant example shows how to build a single AI assistant that adapts to different user roles using the new inline agent capabilities in Amazon Bedrock Agents. When users interact with the assistant, the assistant dynamically configures agent capabilities (such as model, instructions, knowledge bases, action groups, and guardrails) based on the user’s role and their specific selections. This approach creates a flexible system that adjusts its functionality in real time, making it more efficient than creating separate agents for each user role or tool combination. The complete code for this HR assistant example is available on our GitHub repo.This dynamic tool selection enables a personalized experience. When an employee logs in without direct reports, they see a set of tools that they have access to based on their role. They can select from options like requesting vacation time, checking company policies using the knowledge base, using a code interpreter for data analysis, or submitting expense reports. The inline agent assistant is then configured with only these selected tools, allowing it to assist the employee with their chosen tasks. In a real-world example, the user would not need to make the selection, because the application would make that decision and automatically configure the agent invocation at runtime. We make it explicit in this application so that you can demonstrate the impact.Similarly, when a manager logs in to the same system, they see an extended set of tools reflecting their additional permissions. In addition to the employee-level tools, managers have access to capabilities like running performance reviews. They can select which tools they want to use for their current session, instantly configuring the inline agent with their choices.The inclusion of knowledge bases is also adjusted based on the user’s role. Employees and managers see different levels of company policy information, with managers getting additional access to confidential data like performance review and compensation details. For this demo, we’ve implemented metadata filtering to retrieve only the appropriate level of documents based on the user’s access level, further enhancing efficiency and security.Let’s look at how the interface adapts to different user roles.The employee view provides access to essential HR functions like vacation requests, expense submissions, and company policy lookups. Users can select which of these tools they want to use for their current session.The manager view extends these options to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent can be configured with a broader set of tools based on user permissions.The manager view extends these capabilities to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent dynamically adjusts its available tools based on user permissions. Without inline agents, we would need to build and maintain two separate agents.As shown in the preceding screenshots, the same HR assistant offers different tool selections based on the user’s role. An employee sees options like Knowledge Base, Apply Vacation Tool, and Submit Expense, whereas a manager has additional options like Performance Evaluation. Users can select which tools they want to add to the agent for their current interaction.This flexibility allows for quick adaptation to user needs and preferences. For instance, if the company introduces a new policy for creating business travel requests, the tool catalog can be quickly updated to include a Create Business Travel Reservation tool. Employees can then choose to add this new tool to their agent configuration when they need to plan a business trip, or the application could automatically do so based on their role.With Amazon Bedrock inline agents, you can create a catalog of actions that is dynamically selected by the application or by users of the application. This increases the level of flexibility and adaptability of your solutions, making them a perfect fit for navigating the complex, ever-changing landscape of modern business operations. Users have more control over their AI assistant’s capabilities, and the system remains efficient by only loading the necessary tools for each interaction.Technical foundation: Dynamic configuration and action selectionInline agents allow dynamic configuration at runtime, enabling a single agent to effectively perform the work of many. By specifying action groups and modifying instructions on the fly, even within the same session, you can create versatile AI applications that adapt to various scenarios without multiple agent deployments.The following are key points about inline agents: – Change the agent’s configuration, including its FM, at runtime. This enables rapid experimentation and adaptation without redeploying the application, reducing development cycles. – Apply governance and access control at the tool level. With agents changing dynamically at runtime, tool-level governance helps maintain security and compliance regardless of the agent’s configuration. – Provide only necessary tools and instructions at runtime to reduce token usage and improve the agent accuracy. With fewer tools to choose from, it’s less complicated for the agent to select the right one, reducing hallucinations in the tool selection process. This approach can also lead to lower costs and improved latency compared to static agents because removing unnecessary tools, knowledge bases, and instructions reduces the number of input and output tokens being processed by the agent’s large language model (LLM). – Create reusable actions for dynamic selection based on specific needs. This modular approach simplifies maintenance, updates, and scalability of your AI applications.The following are examples of reusable actions:Enterprise system integration – Connect with systems like Salesforce, GitHub, or databases – Perform common tasks such as sending emails or managing calendars – Interact with specialized internal tools and services – Analyze text, structured data, or other information – Fetch weather updates, stock prices, or perform web searches – Use specific machine learning (ML) models for targeted tasksWhen using inline agents, you configure parameters for the following:Contextual tool selection based on user intent or conversation flowAdaptation to different user roles and permissionsSwitching between communication styles or personasModel selection based on task complexityThe inline agent uses the configuration you provide at runtime, allowing for highly flexible AI assistants that efficiently handle various tasks across different business contexts.Building an HR assistant using inline agentsLet’s look at how we built our HR Assistant using Amazon Bedrock inline agents: – We developed a demo catalog of HR-related tools, including: 
   – Using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for accessing company policies and guidelines based on the role of the application user. In order to filter the knowledge base content based on the user’s role, you also need to provide a metadata file specifying the type of employee’s roles that can access each file– For requesting and tracking time off.– For submitting and managing expense reports. – For performing calculations and data analysis.– for conducting and reviewing employee compensation assessments (manager only access). – We defined multiple conversation tones to suit different interaction styles: 
   – For formal, business-like interactions. – For friendly, everyday support. – For upbeat, encouraging assistance. – We implemented role-based access control. The application backend checks the user’s role (employee or manager) and provides access to appropriate tools and information and passes this information to the inline agent. The role information is also used to configure metadata filtering in the knowledge bases to generate relevant responses. The system allows for dynamic tool use at runtime. Users can switch personas or add and remove tools during their session, allowing the agent to adapt to different conversation needs in real time.Integrate the agent with other services and tools – We connected the inline agent to: 
  Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for company policies, with metadata filtering for role-based access.AWS Lambda functions for executing specific actions (such as submitting vacation requests or expense reports).A code interpreter tool for performing calculations and data analysis. – We created a Flask-based UI that performs the following actions: 
  Displays available tools based on the user’s role.Allows users to select different personas.Provides a chat window for interacting with the HR assistant.To understand how this dynamic role-based functionality works under the hood, let’s examine the following system architecture diagram.As shown in preceding architecture diagram, the system works as follows:The end-user logs in and is identified as either a manager or an employee.The user selects the tools that they have access to and makes a request to the HR assistant.The agent breaks down the problems and uses the available tools to solve for the query in steps, which may include: 
  Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases (with metadata filtering for role-based access).Lambda functions for specific actions.Code interpreter tool for calculations.Compensation tool (accessible only to managers to submit base pay raise requests).The application uses the Amazon Bedrock inline agent to dynamically pass in the appropriate tools based on the user’s role and request.The agent uses the selected tools to process the request and provide a response to the user.This approach provides a flexible, scalable solution that can quickly adapt to different user roles and changing business needs.In this post, we introduced the Amazon Bedrock inline agent functionality and highlighted its application to an HR use case. We dynamically selected tools based on the user’s roles and permissions, adapted instructions to set a conversation tone, and selected different models at runtime. With inline agents, you can transform how you build and deploy AI assistants. By dynamically adapting tools, instructions, and models at runtime, you can:Create personalized experiences for different user rolesOptimize costs by matching model capabilities to task complexityStreamline development and maintenanceScale efficiently without managing multiple agent configurationsFor organizations demanding highly dynamic behavior—whether you’re an AI startup, SaaS provider, or enterprise solution team—inline agents offer a scalable approach to building intelligent assistants that grow with your needs.

While this is true (and pretty much obvious), it is extremely difficult to define, build, and sustain good data. Let me share with you the unique processes that I have learned over several years building an ever-growing image classification system and how you can apply these techniques to your own application.With persistence and diligence, you can avoid the classic “garbage in, garbage out”, maximize your model accuracy, and demonstrate real business value.In this series of articles, I will dive into the care and feeding of a multi-class, single-label image classification app and what it takes to reach the highest level of performance. I won’t get into any coding or specific user interfaces, just the main concepts that you can incorporate to suit your needs with the tools at your disposal.Here is a brief description of the articles. You will notice that the model is last on the list since we need to focus on curating the data first and foremost:Over the past six years, I have been primarily focused on building and maintaining an image classification application for a manufacturing company. Back when I started, most of the software did not exist or was too expensive, so I created these from scratch. In this time, I have deployed two identifier applications, the largest handles 1,500 classes and achieves 97–98% accuracy.It was about eight years ago that I started online studies for Data Science and machine learning. So, when the exciting opportunity to create an AI application presented itself, I was prepared to build the tools I needed to leverage the latest advancements. I jumped in with both feet!I quickly found that building and deploying a model is probably the easiest part of the job. Feeding high quality data into the model is the best way to improve performance, and that requires focus and patience. Attention to detail is what I do best, so this was a perfect fit.It all starts with the dataI feel that so much attention is given to the model selection (deciding which neural network is best) and that the data is just an afterthought. I have found the hard way that even one or two pieces of bad data can significantly impact model performance, so that is where we need to focus.For example, let’s say you train the classic cat versus dog image classifier. You have 50 pictures of cats and 50 pictures of dogs, however one of the “cats” is clearly (objectively) a picture of a dog. The computer doesn’t have the luxury of ignoring the mislabelled image, and instead adjusts the model weights to make it fit. Square peg meets round hole.Another example would be a picture of a cat that climbed up into a tree. But when you take a wholistic view of it, you would describe it as a picture of a tree (first) with a cat (second). Again, the computer doesn’t know to ignore the big tree and focus on the cat — it will start to identify trees as cats, even if there is a dog. You can think of these pictures as outliers and should be removed.It doesn’t matter if you have the best neural network in the world, you can count on the model making poor predictions when it is trained on “bad” data. I’ve learned that any time I see the model make mistakes, it’s time to review the data.Example Application — Zoo animalsFor the rest of this write-up, I will use an example of identifying zoo animals. Let’s assume your goal is to create a mobile app where guests at the zoo can take pictures of the animals they see and have the app identify them. Specifically, this is a multi-class, single-label application. — There are a lot of different animals at the zoo and many of them look very similar. — Guests using the app don’t always take good pictures (zoomed out, blurry, too dark), so we don’t want to provide an answer if the image is poor. — The zoo keeps expanding and adding new species all the time. — Occasionally you might find that people take pictures of the sparrows near the food court grabbing some dropped popcorn. — Just for fun, guests may take a picture of the bag of popcorn just to see what it comes back with.These are all real challenges — being able to tell the subtle differences between animals, handling out-of-scope cases, and just plain poor images.Before we get there, let’s start from the beginning.There are a lot of tools these days to help you with this part of the process, but the challenge remains the same — collecting, labelling, and curating the data.Having data to collect is challenge #1. Without images, you have nothing to train. You may need to get creative on sourcing the data, or even creating synthetic data. More on that later.A quick note about image pre-processing. I convert all my images to the input size of my neural network and save them as PNG. Inside this square PNG, I preserve the aspect ratio of the original picture and fill the background black. I don’t stretch the image nor crop any features out. This also helps center the subject.Challenge #2 is to establish standards for data quality…and ensure that these standards are followed! These standards will guide you toward that “good” data. And this assumes, of course, correct labels. Having both is much easier said than done!I hope to show how “good” and “correct” actually go hand-in-hand, and how important it is to apply these standards to every image.First, I want to point out that the image data discussed here is for the training set. What qualifies as a good image for  is a bit different than what qualifies as a good image for . More on that in Part 3.So, what is “good” data when talking about images? “A picture is worth a thousand words”, and if the  you use to describe the picture do not include the subject you are trying to label, then it is not good and you need remove it from your training set.For example, let’s say you are shown a picture of a zebra and (removing bias toward your application) you describe it as an “open field with a zebra in the distance”. In other words, if “open field” is the first thing you notice, then you likely do  want to use that image. The opposite is also true — if the picture is way too close, you would described it as “zebra pattern”.What you want is a description like, “a zebra, front and center”. This would have your subject taking up about 80–90% of the total frame. Sometimes I will take the time to crop the original image so the subject is framed properly.Keep in mind the use of image augmentation at the time of training. Having that buffer around the edges will allow “zoom in” augmentation. And “zoom out” augmentation will simulate smaller subjects, so don’t start out less than 50% of the total frame for your subject since you lose detail.Another aspect of a “good” image relates to the label. If you can only see the back side of your zoo animal, can you really tell, for example, that it is a cheetah versus a leopard? The key identifying features need to be visible. If a human struggles to identify it, you can’t expect the computer to learn anything.What does a “bad” image look like? Here is what I frequently watch out for:Wide angle lens stretchingHigh contrast or dark shadows“Doctored” images, drawn lines and arrows“Unusual” angles or situationsPicture of a mobile device that has a picture of your subjectIf you have a team of subject matter experts (SMEs) on hand to label the images, you are in a good starting position. Animal trainers at the zoo know the various species, and can spot the differences between, for example, a chimpanzee and a bonobo.To a Machine Learning Engineer, it is easy for you to assume all labels from your SMEs are correct and move right on to training the model. However, even experts make mistakes, so if you can get a second opinion on the labels, your error rate should go down.In reality, it can be prohibitively expensive to get one, let alone two, subject matter experts to review image labels. The SME usually has years of experience that make them more valuable to the business in other areas of work. My experience is that the machine learning engineer (that’s you and me) becomes the second opinion, and often the first opinion as well.Over time, you can become pretty adept at labelling, but certainly not an SME. If you do have the luxury of access to an expert, explain to them the labelling standards and how these are required for the application to be successful. Emphasize “quality over quantity”.It goes without saying that having a  label is so important. However, all it takes is one or two mislabelled images to degrade performance. These can easily slip into your data set with careless or hasty labelling. So, take the time to get it right.Ultimately, we as the ML engineer are responsible for model performance. So, if we take the approach of only working on model training and deployment, we will find ourselves wondering why performance is falling short.A lot of times, you will come across a really good picture of a very interesting subject, but have no idea what it is! It would be a shame to simply dispose of it. What you can do is assign it a generic label, like “Unknown Bird” or “Random Plant” that are  included in your training set. Later in Part 4, you’ll see how to come back to these images at a later date when you have a better idea what they are, and you’ll be glad you saved them.If you have done any image labelling, then you know how time consuming and difficult it can be. But this is where having a model, even a less-than-perfect model, can help you.Typically, you have a large collection of unlabelled image and you need to go through them one at a time to assign labels. Simply having the model offer a best guess and display the top 3 results lets you step through each image in a matter of seconds!Even if the top 3 results are wrong, this can help you narrow down your search. Over time, newer models will get better, and the labelling process can even be somewhat fun!In Part 4, I will show how you can bulk identify images and take this to the next level for faster labelling.I mentioned the example above of two species that look very similar, the chimpanzee and the bonobo. When you start out building your data set, you may have very sparse coverage of one or both of these species. In machine learning terms, we these “classes”. One option is to roll with what you have and hope that the model picks up on the differences with only a handful of example images.The option that I have used is to merge two or more classes into one, at least temporarily. So, in this case I would create a class called “chimp-bonobo”, which is composed of the limited example pictures of chimpanzee and bonobo species classes. Combined, these may give me enough to train the model on “chimp-bonobo”, with the trade-off that it’s a more generic identification.Sub-classes can even be normal variations. For example,  pink flamingos are grey instead of pink. Or, male and female orangutans have distinct facial features. You wan to have a fairly balanced number of images for these normal variations, and keeping sub-classes will allow you to accomplish this.Don’t be concerned that you are merging completely different looking classes — the neural network does a nice job of applying the “OR” operator. This works both ways — it can help you identify male or female variations as one species, but it can hurt you when “bad” outlier images sneak in like the example “open field with a zebra in the distance.”Over time, you will (hopefully) be able to collect more images of the sub-classes and then be able to successfully split them apart (if necessary) and train the model to identify them separately. This process has worked very well for me. Just be sure to double-check all the images when you split them to ensure the labels didn’t get accidentally mixed up — it will be time well spent.All of this certainly depends on your user requirements, and you can handle this in different ways either by creating a unique class label like “chimp-bonobo”, or at the front-end presentation layer where you notify the user that you have intentionally merged these classes and provide guidance on further refining the results. Even after you decide to split the two classes, you may want to caution the user that the model could be wrong since the two classes are so similar.I realize this was a long write-up for something that on the surface seems intuitive, but these are all areas that I have tripped me up in the past because I didn’t give them enough attention. Once you have a solid understanding of these principles, you can go on to build a successful application.In Part 2, we will take the curated data we collected here to create the classic data sets, with a custom benchmark set that will further enhance your data. Then we will see how best to evaluate our trained model using a specific “training mindset”, and switch to a “production mindset” when evaluating a deployed model.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer — Part 4: The Model</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/</link><author>David Martin</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:53:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this latest part of my series, I will share what I have learned on selecting a model for Image Classification and how to fine tune that model. I will also show how you can leverage the model to accelerate your labelling process, and finally how to justify your efforts by generating usage and performance statistics.In Part 1, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your image classification project. I showed how define “good” images and create sub-classes. In Part 2, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, with benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images. In Part 3, I explained how to apply different evaluation criteria to a trained model versus a deployed model, and using benchmarks to determine when to deploy a model.So far I have focused a lot of time on labelling and curating the set of images, and also evaluating model performance, which is like putting the cart before the horse. I’m not trying to minimize what it takes to design a massive neural network — this is a very important part of the application you are building. In my case, I spent a few weeks experimenting with different available models before settling on one that fit the bill.Once you pick a model structure, you usually don’t make any major changes to it. For me, six years into deployment, I’m still using the same one. Specifically, I chose Inception V4 because it has a large input image size and an adequate number of layers to pick up on subtle image features. It also performs inference fast enough on CPU, so I don’t need to run expensive hardware to serve the model.Your mileage may vary. But again, the main takeaway is that focusing on your data will pay dividends versus searching for the best model.I will share a process that I found to work extremely well. Once I decided on the model to use, I randomly initialized the weights and let the model train for about 120 epoch before improvements plateau at a fairly modest accuracy, like 93%. At this point, I performed the evaluation of the trained model (see Part 3) to clean up the data set. I also incorporated new images as part of the data pipeline (see Part 1) and prepared the data sets for the next training run.Before starting the next training run, I simply take the last trained model, pop the output layer, and add it back in with random weights. Since the number of output classes are constantly increasing in my case, I have to pop that layer anyway to account for the new number of classes. Importantly, I leave the rest of the trained weights as they were and allow them to continue updating for the new classes.This allows the model to train much faster before improvements stall. After repeating this process dozens of times, the training reaches plateau after about 20 epochs, and the test accuracy can reach 99%! The model is building upon the low-level features that it established from the previous runs while re-learning the output weights to prevent overfitting.It took me a while to trust this process, and for a few years I would train from scratch every time. But after I attempted this and saw the training time (not to mention the cost of cloud GPU) go down while the accuracy continued to go up, I started to embrace the process. More importantly, I continue to see the evaluation metrics of the deployed model return solid performances.During training, you can apply transformations on your images (called “augmentation”) to give you more diversity from you data set. With our zoo animals, it is fairly safe to apply left-right flop, slight rotations clockwise and counterclockwise, and slight resize that will zoom in and out.With these transformations in mind, make sure your images are still able to act as good training images. In other words, an image where the subject is already small will be even smaller with a zoom out, so you probably want to discard the original. Also, some of your original pictures may need to be re-oriented by 90 degrees to be upright since a further rotation would make them look unusual.As I mentioned in Part 1, you can use the trained model to assist you in labelling images one at a time. But the way to take this even further is to have your newly trained model identify hundreds at a time while building a list of the results that you can then filter.Typically, we have large collections of  images that have come in either through regular usage of the application or some other means. Recall from Part 1 assigning “unknown” labels to interesting pictures but you have no clue what it is. By using the bulk identification method, we can sift through the collections quickly to target the labelling once we know what they are.By combining your current image counts with the bulk identification results, you can target classes that need expanded coverage. Here are a few ways you can leverage bulk identification:Increase low image counts — Some of your classes may have just barely made the cutoff to be included in the training set, which means you need more examples to improve coverage. Filter for images that have low counts.Replace staged or synthetic images — Some classes may be built entirely using non-real-world images. These pictures may be good enough to get started with, but may cause performance issues down the road because they look different than what typically comes through. Filter for classes that depend on staged images. — A class in your data set may look like another one. For example, let’s say your model can identify an antelope, and that looks like a gazelle which your model cannot identify yet. Setting a filter for antelope and a lower confidence score may reveal gazelle images that you can label. — You may not have known how to identify the dozens of cute wallaby pictures, so you saved them under “Unknown” because it was a good image. Now that you know what it is, you can filter for its look-alike kangaroo and quickly add a new class.Mass removal of low scores — As a way to clean out your large collection of unlabelled images that have nothing worth labelling, set a filter for lowest scores.Recall the decision I made to have image cutoffs from Part 2, which allows us to ensure an adequate number of example images of a class before we train and server a model to the public. The problem is that you may have a number of classes that are  below your cutoff (in my case, 40) and don’t make it into the model.The way I approach this is with a “throw-away” training run that I do not intend to move to production. I will decrease the lower cutoff from 40 to perhaps 35, build my train-validation-test sets, then train and evaluate like I normally do. The most important part of this is the bulk identification at the end!There is a chance that somewhere in the large collection of unlabelled images I will find the few that I need. Doing the bulk identification with this throw-away model helps find them.One very important aspect of any machine learning application is being able to show usage and performance reports. Your manager will likely want to see how many times the application is being used to justify the expense, and you as the ML engineer will want to see how the latest model is performing compared to the previous one.You should build logging into your model serving to record every transaction going through the system. Also, the manual evaluations from Part 3 should be recorded so you can report on performance for such things as accuracy over time, by model version, by confidence scores, by class, etc. You will be able to detect trends and make adjustments to improve the overall solution.There are a lot of reporting tools, so I won’t recommend one over the other. Just make sure you are collecting as much information as you can to build these dashboards. This will justify the time, effort, and cost associated with maintaining the application.We covered a lot of ground across this four-part series on building an image classification project and deploying it in the real world. It all starts with the data, and by investing the time and effort into maintaining the highest quality image library, you can reach impressive levels of model performance that will gain the trust and confidence of your business partners.As a Machine Learning Engineer, you are primarily responsible for building and deploying your model. But it doesn’t stop there — dive into the data. The more familiar you are with the data, the better you will understand the strengths and weaknesses of your model. Take a close look at the evaluations and use them as an opportunity to adjust the data set.I hope these articles have helped you find new ways to improve your own machine learning project. And by the way, don’t let the machine do all the learning — as humans, our job is to continue our own learning, so don’t ever stop!Thank you for taking this deep dive with me into a data-driven approach to model optimization. I look forward to your feedback and how you can apply this to your own application.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Use language embeddings for zero-shot classification and semantic search with Amazon Bedrock</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-language-embeddings-for-zero-shot-classification-and-semantic-search-with-amazon-bedrock/</link><author>Tom Rogers</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:53:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this post, we discuss what embeddings are, show how to practically use language embeddings, and explore how to use them to add functionality such as zero-shot classification and semantic search. We then use Amazon Bedrock and language embeddings to add these features to a really simple syndication (RSS) aggregator application.Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon available through an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock offers a serverless experience, so you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and integrate and deploy them into your applications using Amazon Web Services (AWS) services without having to manage infrastructure. For this post, we use the Cohere v3 Embed model on Amazon Bedrock to create our language embeddings.To demonstrate some of the possible uses of these language embeddings, we developed an RSS aggregator website. RSS is a web feed that allows publications to publish updates in a standardized, computer-readable way. On our website, users can subscribe to an RSS feed and have an aggregated, categorized list of the new articles. We use embeddings to add the following functionalities:This post uses this application as a reference point to discuss the technical implementation of the semantic search and zero-shot classification features.This solution uses the following services:The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.This section offers a quick primer on what embeddings are and how they can be used.Embeddings are numerical representations of concepts or objects, such as language or images. In this post, we discuss language embeddings. By reducing these concepts to numerical representations, we can then use them in a way that a computer can understand and operate on.Let’s take Berlin and Paris as an example. As humans, we understand the conceptual links between these two words. Berlin and Paris are both cities, they’re capitals of their respective countries, and they’re both in Europe. We understand their conceptual similarities almost instinctively, because we can create a model of the world in our head. However, computers have no built-in way of representing these concepts.To represent these concepts in a way a computer can understand, we convert them into language embeddings. Language embeddings are high dimensional vectors that learn their relationships with each other through the training of a neural network. During training, the neural network is exposed to enormous amounts of text and learns patterns based on how words are colocated and relate to each other in different contexts.Embedding vectors allow computers to model the world from language. For instance, if we embed “Berlin” and “Paris,” we can now perform mathematical operations on these embeddings. We can then observe some fairly interesting relationships. For instance, we could do the following: Paris – France + Germany ~= Berlin. This is because the embeddings capture the relationships between the words “Paris” and “France” and between “Germany” and “Berlin”—specifically, that Paris and Berlin are both capital cities of their respective countries.The following graph shows the word vector distance between countries and their respective capitals.Subtracting “France” from “Paris” removes the country semantics, leaving a vector representing the concept of a capital city. Adding “Germany” to this vector, we are left with something closely resembling “Berlin,” the capital of Germany. The vectors for this relationship are shown in the following graph.For our use case, we use the pre-trained Cohere Embeddings model in Amazon Bedrock, which embeds entire texts rather than a single word. The embeddings represent the meaning of the text and can be operated on using mathematical operations. This property can be useful to map relationships such as similarity between texts.One way in which we use language embeddings is by using their properties to calculate how similar an article is to one of the topics.To do this, we break down a topic into a series of different and related embeddings. For instance, for culture, we have a set of embeddings for sports, TV programs, music, books, and so on. We then embed the incoming title and description of the RSS articles, and calculate the similarity against the topic embeddings. From this, we can assign topic labels to an article.The following figure illustrates how this works. The embeddings that Cohere generates are highly dimensional, containing 1,024 values (or dimensions). However, to demonstrate how this system works, we use an algorithm designed to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), so that we can view them in two dimensions. The following image uses these embeddings to visualize how topics are clustered based on similarity and meaning.You can use the embedding of an article and check the similarity of the article against the preceding embeddings. You can then say that if an article is clustered closely to one of these embeddings, it can be classified with the associated topic.This is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. This algorithm is used to perform classification and regression tasks. In k-NN, you can make assumptions around a data point based on its proximity to other data points. For instance, you can say that an article that has proximity to the music topic shown in the preceding diagram can be tagged with the culture topic.The following figure demonstrates this with an ArsTechnica article. We plot against the embedding of an article’s title and description: (The climate is changing so fast that we haven’t seen how bad extreme weather could get: Decades-old statistics no longer represent what is possible in the present day).The advantage of this approach is that you can add custom, user-generated topics. You can create a topic by first creating a series of embeddings of conceptually related items. For instance, an AI topic would be similar to the embeddings for AI, Generative AI, LLM, and Anthropic, as shown in the following screenshot.In a traditional classification system, we’d be required to train a classifier—a supervised learning task where we’d need to provide a series of examples to establish whether an article belongs to its respective topic. Doing so can be quite an intensive task, requiring labeled data and training the model. For our use case, we can provide examples, create a cluster, and tag articles without having to provide labeled examples or train additional models. This is shown in the following screenshot of results page of our website.In our application, we ingest new articles on a schedule. We use EventBridge schedules to periodically call a Lambda function, which checks if there are new articles. If there are, it creates an embedding from them using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere.We calculate the article’s distance to the different topic embeddings, and can then determine whether the article belongs to that category. This is done with Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector. We store the embeddings of the topics and then calculate their distance using the following SQL query:const topics = await sqlClient.then(it=> it.query(
    `SELECT name, embedding_description, similarity
     FROM (SELECT topic_id as name, embedding_description, (1- ABS( 1 –(embed.embedding <-> $1))) AS "similarity" FROM topic_embedding_link embed)  topics
     ORDER BY similarity desc`,
    [toSql(articleEmbedding)]
  ))
The <-> operator in the preceding code calculates the Euclidean distance between the article and the topic embedding. This number allows us to understand how close an article is to one of the topics. We can then determine the appropriateness of a topic based on this ranking.We then tag the article with the topic. We do this so that the subsequent request for a topic is as computationally as light as possible; we do a simple join rather than calculating the Euclidean distance.const formattedTopicInsert = pgformat(
    `INSERT INTO feed_article_topic_link(topic_id, feed_article_id) VALUES %L ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`,
    topicLinks
  )We also cache a specific topic/feed combination because these are calculated hourly and aren’t expected to change in the interim.As previously discussed, the embeddings produced by Cohere contain a multitude of features; they embed the meanings and semantics of a word of phrase. We’ve also found that we can perform mathematical operations on these embeddings to do things such as calculate the similarity between two phrases or words.We can use these embeddings and calculate the similarity between a search term and an embedding of an article with the k-NN algorithm to find articles that have similar semantics and meanings to the search term we’ve provided.For example, in one of our RSS feeds, we have a lot of different articles that rate products. In a traditional search system, we’d rely on keyword matches to provide relevant results. Although it might be simple to find a specific article (for example, by searching “best digital notebooks”), we would need a different method to capture multiple product list articles.In a semantic search system, we first transform the term “Product list” in an embedding. We can then use the properties of this embedding to perform a search within our embedding space. Using the k-NN algorithm, we can find articles that are semantically similar. As shown in the following screenshot, despite not containing the text “Product list” in either the title or description, we’ve been able to find articles that contain a product list. This is because we were able to capture the semantics of the query and match it to the existing embeddings we have for each article.In our application, we store these embeddings using pgvector on Aurora PostgreSQL. pgvector is an open source extension that enables vector similarity search in PostgreSQL. We transform our search term into an embedding using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere v3 Embed.After we’ve converted the search term to an embedding, we can compare it with the embeddings on the article that have been saved during the ingestion process. We can then use pgvector to find articles that are clustered together. The SQL code for that is as follows:SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT feed_articles.id as id, title, feed_articles.feed_id as feed, feedName, slug, description, url, author, image, published_at as published, 1 - ABS(1 - (embedding <-> $2)) AS "similarity"
    FROM feed_articles
    INNER JOIN (select feed_id, name as feedName from feed_user_subscription fus where fus.user_id=$1) sub on feed_articles.feed_id=sub.feed_id
    ${feedId != undefined ? `WHERE feed_articles.feed_id = $4` : ""}
)
WHERE similarity > 0.95
ORDER BY similarity desc
LIMIT $3;
This code calculates the distance between the topics, and the embedding of this article as “similarity.” If this distance is close, then we can assume that the topic of the article is related, and we therefore attach the topic to the article.To deploy this application in your own account, you need the following prerequisites:Model access for Cohere Embed English.

Also, we talked about classes and sub-classes of your data. These may seem pretty straight forward concepts, but it’s important to have a solid understanding going forward. So, if you haven’t, please check it out.Now we will discuss how to build the various data sets and the techniques that have worked well for my application. Then in the next part, we will dive into the evaluation of your models, beyond simple accuracy.I will again use the example zoo animals image classification app.As machine learning engineers, we are all familiar with the train-validation-test sets, but when we include the concept of sub-classes discussed in Part 1, and incorporate to concepts discussed below to set a minimum and maximum image count per class, as well as staged and synthetic data to the mix, the process gets a bit more complicated. I had to create a custom script to handle these options.I will walk you through these concepts before we split the data for training: — Too few images and your model performance will suffer. Too many and you spend more time training than it’s worth. — Your model indicates how confident it is in the predictions. Let’s use that to decide when to present results to the user. — Real-world data is messy and the benchmark sets should reflect that. These need to stretch the model to the limit and help us decide when it is ready for production.Staged and synthetic data — Real-world data is king, but sometimes you need to produce the your own or even generate data to get off the ground. Be careful it doesn’t hurt performance. — Repeat data can skew your results and give you a false sense of performance. Make sure your data is diverse. — Combine sub-classes, apply cutoffs, and create your train-validation-test sets. Now we are ready to get the show started.In my experience, using a minimum of 40 images per class provides descent performance. Since I like to use 10% each for the test set and validation set, that means at least 4 images will be used to check the training set, which feels just barely adequate. Using fewer than 40 images per class, I notice my model evaluation tends to suffer.On the other end, I set a maximum of about 125 images per class. I have found that the performance gains tend to plateau beyond this, so having more data will slow down the training run with little to show for it. Having more than the maximum is fine, and these “overflow” can be added to the test set, so they don’t go to waste.There are times when I will drop the minimum cutoff to, say 35, with no intention of moving the trained model to production. Instead, the purpose is to leverage this throw-away model to find more images from my unlabelled set. This is a technique that I will go into more detail in Part 3.You are likely familiar with the softmax score. As a reminder, softmax is the probability assigned to each label. I like to think of it as a confidence score, and we are interested in the class that receives the highest confidence. Softmax is a value between zero and one, but I find it easier to interpret confidence scores between zero and 100, like a percentage.In order to decide if the model is confident enough with its prediction, I have chosen a threshold of 95. I use this threshold when determining if I want to present results to the user.Scores above the threshold have a better changes of being right, so I can confidently provide the results. Scores below the threshold may not be right — in fact it could be “out-of-scope”, meaning it’s something the model doesn’t know how to identify. So, instead of taking the risk of presenting incorrect results, I instead prompt the user to try again and offer suggestions on how to take a “good” picture.Admittedly this is somewhat arbitrary cutoff, and you should decide for your use-case what is appropriate. In fact, this score could probably be adjusted for each trained model, but this would make it harder to compare performance across models.I will refer to this confidence score frequently in the evaluations section in Part 3.Let me introduce what I call the benchmark sets, which you can think of as extended test sets. These are hand-picked images designed to stretch the limits of your model, and provide a measure for specific classes of your data. Use these benchmarks to justify moving your model to production, and for an objective measure to show to your manager. — These are the “extra credit” images, like the bonus questions a professor would add to the quiz to see which students are paying attention. You need a keen eye to spot the difference between the ground truth and a similar looking class. For example, a cheetah sleeping in the shade that could pass as a leopard if you don’t look closely. — These are the “trick question” images. Our model is trained on zoo animals, but people are known for not following the rules. For example, a zoo guest takes a picture of their child wearing cheetah face paint. — These are your “bread and butter” classes that need to get near perfect scores and zero errors. This would be a make-or-break benchmark for moving to production. — These are your “rare but exceptional” classes that again need to be correct, but reach a minimum score like the confidence threshold.When looking for images to add to the benchmarks, you can likely find them in real-world images from your deployed model. See the evaluation in Part 3.For each benchmark, calculate the min, max, median, and mean scores, and also how many images get scores above and below the confidence threshold. Now you can compare these measures against what is currently in production, and against your minimum requirements, to help decide if the new model is production worthy.Perhaps the biggest hurdle to any supervised machine learning application is having data to train the model. Clearly, “real-world” data that comes from actual users of the application is ideal. However you can’t really collect these until the model is deployed. Chicken and egg problem.One way to get started to is to have volunteers collect “staged” images for you, trying to act like real users. So, let’s have our zoo staff go around taking pictures of the animals. This is a good start, but there will be a certain level of bias introduced in these images. For example, the staff may take the photos over a few days, so you may not get the year-round weather conditions.Another way to get pictures is use computer-generated “synthetic” images. I would avoid these at all costs, to be honest. Based on my experience, the model struggles with these because they look…different. The lighting is not natural, the subject may superimposed on a background and so the edges look too sharp, etc. Granted, some of the AI generated images look very realistic, but if you look closely you may spot something unusual. The neural network in your model will notice these, so be careful.The way that I handle these staged or synthetic images is as a sub-class that gets merged into the training set, but only  giving preference to the real-world images. I cap the number of staged images to 60, so if I have 10 real-world, I now only need 50 staged. Eventually, these staged and synthetic images are phased out completely, and I rely entirely on real-world.One problem that can creep into your image set are duplicate images. These can be exact copies of pictures, or they can be extremely similar. You may think that this is harmless, but imagine having 100 pictures of an elephant that are exactly the same — your model will not know what to do with a different angle of the elephant.Now, let’s say you have only  pictures that are nearly the same. Not so bad, right? Well, here is what can happen to them:Both pictures go in the training set — The model doesn’t learn anything from the repeated image and it wastes time processing them.One goes into the training set, the other goes into the test set — Your test score will be higher, but it is not an accurate evaluation.Both are in the test set — Your test score will be compounded either higher or lower than it should be.None of these will help your model.There are a few ways to find duplicates. The approach I have taken is to calculate a hamming distance on all the pictures and identify the ones that are very close. I have an interface that displays the duplicates and I decide which one I like best, and remove the other.Another way (I haven’t tried this yet) is to create a vector representation of your images. Store these a vector database, and you can do a similarity search to find nearly identical images.Whatever method you use, it is important to clean up the duplicates.Now we are ready to build the traditional training, validation, and test sets. This is no longer a straight forward task since I want to:Merge sub-classes into a main class.Prioritize real-world images over staged or synthetic images.Apply a minimum number of images per class.Apply a maximum number of images per class, sending the “overflow” to the test set.This process is somewhat complicated and depends on how you manage your image library. First, I would recommend keeping your images in a folder structure that has sub-class folders. You can get image counts by using a script to simply read the folders. Second is to keep a configuration of how the sub-classes are merged. To really set yourself up for success, put these image counts and merge rules in a database for faster lookups.My train-validation-test set splits are usually 90–10–0. I originally started out using 80–10–10, but with diligence on keeping the entire data set clean, I noticed validation and test scores became pretty even. This allowed me to increase the training set size, and use “overflow” to become the test set, as well as using the benchmark sets.In this part, we’ve built our data sets by merging sub-classes and using the image count cutoffs. Plus we handle staged and synthetic data as well as cleaning up duplicate images. We also created benchmark sets and defined confidence thresholds, which help us decide when to move a model to production.In Part 3, we will discuss how we are going to evaluate the different model performances. And then finally we will get to the actual model training and the techniques to enhance accuracy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why We Built an AI Gateway in Rust: A Performance-Centric Decision</title><link>https://dev.to/langdb/why-we-built-an-ai-gateway-in-rust-a-performance-centric-decision-2nb8</link><author>Mrunmay Shelar</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:44:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/rust">Dev.to Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When building our AI gateway, we knew performance would be a critical factor. Unlike most AI software written in Python, an AI gateway acts as the  between users and inference engines. This gateway must handle , , and  efficiently. Python, while dominant in the AI ecosystem, struggles under these demands due to its  and limitations with concurrency.To demonstrate why we chose , we benchmarked three popular programming environments—, , and —to evaluate their performance under high-load conditions. Rust emerged as the clear winner, offering predictable and stable performance even at scale.
  
  
  Benchmark Setup: Simulating Real-World AI Traffic
We built an  and a corresponding client to mimic real-world AI workloads. Here’s how the setup worked:Streams tokens at a fixed inter-token latency of 25ms, similar to the tokenized output of an AI inference engine.Uses HTTP/2 to deliver tokenized data efficiently to multiple clients.Implements asynchronous programming to support thousands of connections concurrently.Gradually establishes up to 15,000 simultaneous connections to the server.Measures the —the time between consecutive tokens received from the server. This metric reflects the server’s ability to scale under increasing load.Ensures that connections remain stable and records latency for each connection.The server was implemented in , , and  to ensure a fair comparison.The client progressively increased the number of active connections, starting with a small number and scaling up to 15,000.Intra-token latency measurements were collected for each implementation to evaluate performance under load.
  
  
  Results: Rust vs. Python vs. JavaScript (Node.js)
The chart below illustrates the  (in milliseconds) as the number of concurrent connections increases:Rust exhibited the most stable performance, maintaining a near-linear increase in latency as connections scaled.At , Rust's intra-token latency reached approximately , only 3x the baseline inter-token latency of 25ms.Rust’s efficiency highlights its ability to handle high concurrency without significant degradation.Python's intra-token latency grew exponentially, exceeding 200ms at 15,000 connections.This exponential growth demonstrates Python's inherent limitations in managing large-scale concurrency and resource contention.Node.js initially performed better than Python, maintaining lower latency up to .However, its performance began to degrade significantly beyond this point, reaching over 150ms at 15,000 connections.This result underscores Node.js’s event-driven model, which works well for moderate concurrency but struggles under extreme loads.
  
  
  Why Rust is the Best Choice for an AI Gateway
Predictable, Scalable Performance:Rust’s ability to maintain 75ms latency at 15,000 connections demonstrates its scalability. Its near-linear latency growth makes it ideal for high-concurrency systems.Concurrency Without Compromise:Rust’s async programming model (e.g., Tokio) efficiently manages thousands of simultaneous connections. Unlike Python, Rust avoids the bottlenecks of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and utilizes system resources optimally.Rust compiles directly to machine code, ensuring minimal runtime overhead. Its memory safety and zero-cost abstractions allow for predictable and efficient resource management.Rust provides fine-grained control over threading and memory, making it the best choice for performance-critical applications like AI gateways.
  
  
  Why Python and JavaScript Fall Short
: The GIL prevents true multi-threading, causing severe bottlenecks under high load.: Python's interpreted nature adds significant latency, making it unsuitable for latency-sensitive applications.: As connections increase, Python's performance deteriorates rapidly, with latency exceeding acceptable thresholds.: Node.js performs well under moderate concurrency but struggles as the number of simultaneous connections grows beyond 7,500.: While Node.js handles asynchronous I/O well, it lacks the low-level control offered by Rust, leading to degraded performance at scale.
  
  
  Why AI Gateways Must Be Built with Performance in Mind
An AI gateway is more than a simple intermediary. It plays a critical role in ensuring: Users expect tokenized outputs to arrive with minimal delay, making low latency essential. AI gateways must handle thousands or tens of thousands of simultaneous connections to accommodate large-scale applications. Inconsistent performance or connection drops can severely impact user experience and application reliability.Rust excels in all these areas, delivering predictable, stable performance at scale, making it the ideal language for building high-performance AI gateways.
  
  
  The Takeaway: Rust is the Future of AI Gateways
Our benchmark results clearly show that while Python and JavaScript (Node.js) have their strengths, they are ill-suited for building performance-critical AI gateways: struggles with concurrency and runtime overhead, leading to exponential latency growth. performs better but falters under extreme loads, making it unreliable for high-concurrency scenarios., on the other hand, delivers consistent, scalable performance with low latency, even at . By choosing Rust for our AI gateway, we’ve built an infrastructure that can handle the demands of modern AI applications with ease.If you’re building an AI gateway or any performance-critical infrastructure, Rust isn’t just an option—it’s the solution. When every millisecond matters, Rust is the language that ensures you meet the challenge head-on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coding Interviews were HARD Until I Learned These 20 Tips</title><link>https://blog.algomaster.io/p/20-coding-interviews-tips</link><author>Ashish Pratap Singh</author><category>dev</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61c3f6c0-4027-4d37-b4a7-a30fc183fa12_1602x1032.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:30:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.algomaster.io/">Algomaster</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I gave my first  in 2016—and failed.

Practice it beforehand so that you can deliver it smoothly.Understand the Problem (5-10 mins):  Carefully read the problem statement, ask clarifying questions, and walk through sample inputs and expected outputs.Plan the Approach (10-20 mins): Brainstorm possible solutions, evaluate trade-offs, and discuss time and space complexity.Implement the Code (20-30 mins): Write a clean, modular and readable code.Dry-run your code with sample inputs, debug any issues, and ensure edge cases are handled.Follow-ups and Wrap Up (35-45 mins): Answer follow up questions, and ask thoughtful questions to the interviewer about the company, role, or team.One of the biggest mistakes candidates make in coding interviews is jumping into coding too soon.If you don't fully understand the question, you might end up solving the Here’s how to ensure you grasp the problem before coding:Read the Problem CarefullyTake a moment to absorb the problem statement. Rephrase it in your own words to confirm your understanding. Identify the expected input/output format and any hidden constraints.If anything is unclear, ask questions before diving into the solution. Interviewers appreciate when you seek clarity. Never assume details that aren’t explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.Common clarifications include:Are there duplicate values?Can the input be empty? If so, what should the output be?Should the solution handle negative numbers?Should the output maintain the original order of elements?Is the graph directed or undirected?Does the input contain only lowercase English letters, or can it have uppercase, digits, or special characters?What should happen if multiple solutions exist? Should I return any valid solution, or does the problem have specific requirements?Walk Through Input/Output ExamplesOnce you understand the problem statement and constraints, go over a few input and output examples to make sure you get it.Draw them out if it helps, especially for visual data structures like trees or graphs.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios of the problem. Think about any  that might come up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Looking back at our Bug Bounty program in 2024</title><link>https://engineering.fb.com/2025/02/13/security/looking-back-at-our-bug-bounty-program-in-2024/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:00:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://engineering.fb.com/">Facebook engineering</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ads audience tools designed to help people choose a target audience for their ads: Mixed reality hardware products:Organizing community events and presenting joint research:Providing resources and timely updates for the research community:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python vs R for data science: Which should you choose?</title><link>https://www.datasciencecentral.com/python-vs-r-for-data-science-which-should-you-choose/</link><author>Mike Steven</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 15:37:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/">Data Science Central</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to another comparison article where you will understand the features, intricacies, pros, and cons of two different stacks of the information technology industry.

This Sprint has gotten me into a lot of joy and pain, and let me tell you all about it.A proposal to add an  queryGET https://foo.com

There is also a  but I've the impression that user expectation is more on primary ip.Question: what's about port ? Does the query  exctract the IP address and the port (), or do we have a separate  query that we can do latter?GET https://foo.com

port == 8080
With /as separated queries, we can also have  and  predicates:GET https://foo.com

ip isIPv6

This week I've been working to implement this feature to enable hurl users to assert on IP addresses for each request. Since there were quite a few things to do, I decided to break it into multiple PRs.

  
  
  Add ip address to http::Response (Link)
This was a continuation from last week's research. To make the asserts work, first I had to capture that from libcurl and include it in Hurl's  module.To achieve that, I used the method  provided by the  crate. There was some issues regarding the return type of this method and the implementation of type conversions, but we worked it out during the previous Sprint.Other than that, nothing much happened in this PR. There was some changes regarding names and documentation, but it was merged quickly after.
  
  
  Allow assert on ip address (Link)
After last week's discussion, we decided to simply use the  type to handle ip address queries in the Hurl file. At that point I didn't really understand much of the code, but I was able to find a similar query option : . Imitating the code, I was able to create a new query entry.To my surprise, when I tested it afterwards, everything worked! ,  or ... All the keywords was properly working. Turned out Hurl already had the code to handle all string typed queries generically, so all I had to do was creating the query and plugging it right in. Super cool!
  
  
  Allow asserts on ip versions (Link)
This was technically a different feature but it was still a part of the original issue. In this PR, instead of treating the IP address as a string and query on the text content, I had to figure out way to evaluate the IP version.The maintainer suggested to simply take the IP query strings and convert them to . Since this is an enum built-in with the  and  variants, if the conversion succeeds, I could match the pattern to get the IP version.However, this task was not nearly as straightforward as the last PR. Since I didn't fully understand the code, I had a very difficult time locating where I even implement this conversion.First I was determined to figure this out myself. I sat down and carefully read the code, I drafted a few diagrams to help me understand the workflow. However, in Hurl's file parser, whenever I tried to print something, or use the debugger to display something, I would get a strange-looking structure instead of actual text like so:I was beyond confused. I had to ask the maintainer about this. Turned out they were using something called an AST (abstract syntax tree). This structure maps the relative locations of each section of the file without actually parsing them. You can read more in the maintainer's comment.With that knowledge in mind and a bit more research, I finally was able to implement this feature. Now I'm still going back and forth with the maintainer regarding error handling, but I'm sure this feature will land soon!
  
  
  Update @aws-sdk/client-route-53 (Link)
I was looking at Starchart yesterday and saw a list of pull requests opened by , one of which had a failed CI check. I decided to look in a little further. This pull request attempted to update the package  from 3.360.0 to 3.744.0. That's quite a bit gap in version numbers.The CI pipeline failed because of a type mismatch. I started by checking the changelog but I didn't notice any changes regarding types.Fortunately, my IDE was able to help me with locate two new types introduced in the new version:/**
 * @public
 * @enum
 */
export declare const RRType: {
    readonly A: "A";
    readonly AAAA: "AAAA";
    readonly CAA: "CAA";
    readonly CNAME: "CNAME";
    readonly DS: "DS";
    readonly HTTPS: "HTTPS";
    readonly MX: "MX";
    readonly NAPTR: "NAPTR";
    readonly NS: "NS";
    readonly PTR: "PTR";
    readonly SOA: "SOA";
    readonly SPF: "SPF";
    readonly SRV: "SRV";
    readonly SSHFP: "SSHFP";
    readonly SVCB: "SVCB";
    readonly TLSA: "TLSA";
    readonly TXT: "TXT";
};
/**
 * @public
 */
export type RRType = (typeof RRType)[keyof typeof RRType];

/**
 * @public
 * @enum
 */
export declare const ChangeAction: {
    readonly CREATE: "CREATE";
    readonly DELETE: "DELETE";
    readonly UPSERT: "UPSERT";
};
/**
 * @public
 */
export type ChangeAction = (typeof ChangeAction)[keyof typeof ChangeAction];

This part of the code is responsible for managing DNS records.  defines the type of DNS record and  defines the type of changes to perform on an existing record. While all these types were previously represented by .I changed the code to the new types and filed a PR. Later the review came back, suggesting that I create a utility function to handle the type conversion. And this is where I'm at right now.
  
  
  📝 Conclusion and What's Next
This Sprint felt much more eventful than the last one. In the Hurl project, I was working on a different area of code, which means that more time were spent on search and asking questions. I also made more mistakes because of this unfamiliarity. On the Starchart's side, although I haven't taken much action yet, I suspect there to be more to come:For the next Sprint, I might need to dial back a little on the Hurl project, since the maintainer mentioned that they have stopped taking in new features until the next release (). So my plan is to pick a few bugs to investigate there, while shifting my focus a little more to Starchart.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A new tool for visualizing Rust lifetimes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV6Xo_el_2o</link><author>Let&apos;s Get Rusty</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NV6Xo_el_2o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 15:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSp-OaMpsO8K0KkOqyBl7_w">Let&apos;s get Rusty</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[See how RustOwl can help you understand lifetimes in a real Rust codebase.
