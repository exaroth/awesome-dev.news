implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
 label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.Let us know if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but did not know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.No Calls for participation were submitted this week.Are you a new or experienced speaker looking for a place to share something cool? This section highlights events that are being planned and are accepting submissions to join their event as a speaker.No Calls for papers or presentations were submitted this week.Lots of changes this week with results dominated by the 1-5% improvements from
#142941 across lots of primary

which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.Let us know if you would like your PRs, Tracking Issues or RFCs to be tracked as a part of this list.No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.Rusty Events between 2025-07-02 - 2025-07-30 ðŸ¦€If you are running a Rust event please add it to the calendar to get
it mentioned here. Please remember to add a link to the event too.
Email the Rust Community Team for access.I love Rust, so I was already biased to be positive about the Rust for Linux project, even before dabbling with it myself. I'm genuinely surprised to be even more optimistic now than before. The coding part was much easier than I imagined, thanks to the use of reference counting in the kernel.And the promised benefits of Rust over C? They're absolutely real. The Rust version of the driver feels way more robust than the C code, not just regarding memory safety. It didn't have a single bug: Once it compiled, it worked. That's not a huge deal considering it was a direct rewrite, but it counts for something.Despite a lamentable lack of suggestions, llogiq is reasonably pleased with his choice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Industries Adopting Rust</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRgtK2DsEXM</link><author>Let&apos;s Get Rusty</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zRgtK2DsEXM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 14:15:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSp-OaMpsO8K0KkOqyBl7_w">Let&apos;s get Rusty</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you love coding in Rust but arenâ€™t sure how to turn that passion into a full-time career, this video is for you.
