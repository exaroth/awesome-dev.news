completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree
cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional
complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go
over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.
This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,
building four new subsystems.One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,
which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the 
object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the
cloud-controller-manager. The initial  is missing the cloud-provider specific information,
like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the
Node, Region and Instance type information.sequenceDiagram

end
Note over Kube-apiserver: Node is Ready
This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet
was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved
to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem
during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the
controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,
standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using
 (more on this below)Examples of the dependency problemAs noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be
unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few
concrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might
occur.These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource
(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods
rely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it
will schedule properly.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taintAs noted in the Kubernetes documentation, when the kubelet is started with the command line
flag --cloud-provider=external, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint
named node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized added. Because the cloud-controller-manager
is responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a
cloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a 
or , may not be able to schedule.If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the
control plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized no schedule taint. It also means that this taint
will not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no
schedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface
controllers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taintThe next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is
waiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not
tolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI."The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly."One of the conditions that can lead to a  resource having this taint is when the container
network has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible
for adding the IP addresses to a  resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container
network controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some
circumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the
cloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is
not able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container
network controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized and node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taints,
leaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the
specific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the
lifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager
will need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.
Setting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host
networking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as
the host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This
will ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check
your networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the
lifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy
as well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using
these primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple
replicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide
with each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other
controllers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager
controller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.
Use a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the
control plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital
to adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the
physical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run
with a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation
from non-privileged user workloads.
It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running
on the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade
the cloud controller performance.Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud
controller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run
in situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate
the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint, and it should also tolerate any
taints associated with the control plane (for example, node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
or node-role.kubernetes.io/master). It can also be useful to tolerate the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the
node is not yet available for health monitoring.For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,
in a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the
dependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice
for running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network
constraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology
for these scenarios.This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is
important to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please
consult your cloud provider’s documentation.apiVersion: apps/v1

When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that
cluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple
replicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and
redundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance
of a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Terraform Architecture Explained , Terraform Core, State, and Plugins: How Terraform Works Under…</title><link>https://blog.devops.dev/terraform-architecture-explained-terraform-core-state-and-plugins-how-terraform-works-under-a19e4d4dbb09?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4</link><author>Kuseh Simon Wewoliamo</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:51:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.devops.dev/?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4">Devops.dev blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Terraform Architecture Explained , Terraform Core, State, and Plugins: How Terraform Works Under the Hood.1. Introduction 2. Terraform Architecture4. Terraform Best Practices6. ReferencesInfrastructure as Code (IaC), is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure by writing code instead of the manual processes , “ClickOps”. IaC can be described as a mindset where you treat all aspects of operations (servers, databases, networks) as software. When you define your infrastructure using code , it enables you to automate and use all the best practices of software development. IaC eliminates human errors , speeds up infrastructure deployments and ensures infrastructure is version-controlled, just like software code.Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp and the most popular and widely used IaC tool used by DevOps, SREs and cloud architects. Terraform is widely used because of it’s declarative syntax, platform agnostic and its simplicity. Understanding how terraform works behind the hood will go along way to help you in write better terraform code.In this article, we will explore Terraform architecture, its core components, and how it orchestrates infrastructure provisioning efficiently.2. Terraform ArchitectureTerraform follows a standard architecture to fulfill the necessary IaC tasks. Terraform architecture mainly consists of the following components: 1 Terraform core 2 Plugins (Providers and Provisioners) Terraform core is the engine/brain behind how terraform works. It is responsible for reading configurations files , building the dependency graphs from resources and data sources, managing state and applying changes. Terraform Core does not directly interact with cloud providers but communicates with plugins via remote procedure calls (RPCs) and the plugins in turn communicates with their corresponding platforms via HTTPs.Plugins (Providers and Provisioners)Terraform ability is enhance by plugins, which enable terraform to interact with cloud services and configure resources dynamically. Plugins acts as connectors or the glue between terraform and external APIs such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker etc. Each plugin is written in the Go programming language and implements a specific interface. Terraform core knows how to install and execute plugins. Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or commands on a resource after it has been created or modified.State is one of the most important core components of Terraform. Terraform state is a record about all the infrastructure and resources it created. It is a costumed JSON file that terraform uses to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures. By default, state is stored in a local file named “terraform.tfstate”. You can read more about terraform state here There are two ways to manage state: Local State refers to the default way by which Terraform stores state files (terraform.tfstate). It is suitable for small-scale projects or development environments and single person managing Terraform.Remote State refers to storing the Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) in a remote backend rather than locally on your machine. This enables collaboration, prevents state loss, and supports features like state locking and versioning. Some common remote backends include AWS S3,Terraform Cloud, Azure Blob Storage etc. More on Remote StateTerraform follows a structured execution flow to provision, update, and manage infrastructure. This process ensures that infrastructure is deployed in a controlled and predictable manner. Terraform workflow consist of mainly three steps: The first step is to write your terraform configuration just like any other code using any editor of your choice. This is the step where you review your configurations. Terraform plan will define the infrastructure to be created, modified, or destroyed depending on the current configuration and infrastructure. The final step in the workflow is Apply, where you are ready to provision real infrastructure. Once you approve of the changes ,terraform will go ahead perform the desired actions as defined execution.4. Terraform Best Practices1. You should never edit the Terraform state files by hand or write code that reads them directly. If for some reason you need to manipulate the state file which should be a relatively rare occurrence, use the terraform import or terraform state commands.2. It’s a good practice to store your work in a version controlled repository even when you’re just operating as an individual.3. When working as a team, it’s important to delegate ownership of infrastructure across these teams and empower them to work in parallel without conflicts.4. Never Store your state file in a version controlled repository.5. Always use state locking on your state files to prevent data loss, conflicts and state file corruption.6. Integrate Terraform to your CI/CD pipelines to make your DevOps pipeline efficient.Well well, we have come to the end of this deep dive into terraform Architecture.

Think of an API like a waiter in a restaurant — customers (the client application) don’t need to know how the kitchen (the server) prepares their food; they need to know how to place their order through the waiter (the API).I designed and developed an e-commerce web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end,  for the back end, and  for the database. I will use this as an example to explain the core concepts of APIs.E-commerce Web Application API Flow Chart:To check the complete source code:APIs in the E-Commerce ApplicationThis E-Commerce application consists of the following API endpoints:1. Authentication API (auth_routes): /api/auth/login (POST) → Authenticates users and starts a session.: /api/auth/logout (POST) → Clears session and logs out users.2. Product API (product_routes): /api/products (GET) → Returns a list of products.: /api/products/<int:product_id> (GET) → Fetches details of a specific product.3. Cart API (cart_routes): /api/cart (GET) → Returns the current user's cart.: /api/cart (POST) → Adds a product to the cart.: /api/cart/<int:item_id> (DELETE) → Removes an item from the cart.4. Order API (order_routes): /api/orders (POST) → Places an order with the items in the cart.: /api/orders/<int:order_id> (GET) → Fetches details of a specific order.: /api/health (GET) → Provides API uptime, session data, and frontend path.: /<path:filename> (GET) → Serves frontend files.: / (GET) → Serves index.html or API running message.: Handles missing resources.500 Internal Server Error: Handles unexpected issues.: Handles invalid requests.An API consists of several key components that work together:These are the URLs where the  can be accessed. Similar to a , each endpoint serves a specific purpose. For example,📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/products → Retrieves a list of available products.📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/cart → Fetches the current user's shopping cart details.📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/orders → Handles order-related operations.These actions can be performed on the allowed endpoints. They’re like verbs telling the API what to do with the data. → Read data (View products, orders, cart items). → Create new data (Add product, register user, place order). → Update existing data (Update profile, modify cart quantity). → Remove data (Delete cart item, cancel order). Additional data is sent to fine-tune the API request, such as specifying which page of results you want to see.: Parameters are extra details added to an API request to filter or refine the results.Fetch  of products:GET /api/products?category=laptopsSecurity measures ensure that only authorized users can access the API.: Ensures that only authorized users can access the API.When a user logs in, the API gives a :{  "message": "Login successful",  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUz..."}To add a product to the cart, the request must include this :POST /api/cart/addAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUz... Prevents unauthorized access and protects user data. The structure of the data returned by the API, commonly in formats like JSON or XML.: The structure of the data sent back by the API. (because it’s easy to read and use).{  "id": 1,  "price": 799.99,} Frontend uses this data to display products to users.APIs are classified according to their usage patterns and architectures.API Types According to Purposes of Use🔹  — Used within a company, hidden from public access. Helps teams share data securely.🔹  — Available to everyone, can be free or paid. Example: Google Maps API.🔹  — Used between business partners for secure data exchange. Example: E-commerce & shipping company integration.🔹  — Combines multiple APIs into one request for efficiency. Example: Fetching account balance + transaction history in one call.API Types According to Architectural Structure:1. Web APIs (HTTP/HTTPS APIs)These are the most common APIs, operating over the internet using HTTP protocols. They come in several varieties:1.1. REST (Representational State Transfer):The most popular type of web API today. REST APIs follow these principles:Stateless: Each request contains all the information neededResource-based: Everything is treated as a resource with a unique URLUses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)Supports multiple data formats (usually JSON)Example REST API Request in an E-Commerce Web Application:This request fetches all available products from the online store.✅ Request (Client → Server)GET /api/products HTTP/1.1Host: api.ecommerce.comAuthorization: Bearer <User_Token>Content-Type: application/json✅ Response (Server → Client)[    {"id": 1, "name": "iPhone 15", "price": 999.99, "stock": 20},    {"id": 2, "name": "Samsung Galaxy S24", "price": 899.99, "stock": 15}]catalog.html Fetches and Displays Products1️⃣ User Visits catalog.htmlThe user opens the  page in their browser (http://52.90.222.178:5000/catalog.html).The browser  to fetch product data.2️⃣ Frontend (JavaScript) Sends an API RequestJavaScript code in catalog.html makes a GET request to the  /api/products.3️⃣ Backend API (GET /api/products) Fetches DataThe get_all_products() function runs when the frontend calls /api/products.4️⃣ Database Retrieves Product InformationThe backend queries the  in the databaseExample database response:[    {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "price": 799.99},    {"id": 2, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 499.99}]5️⃣ Frontend Renders Product Data in catalog.htmlThe JavaScript loops through the  and dynamically  to display products.<div class="product-card">  <h3>Laptop</h3>  <button onclick="addToCart(1)">Add to Cart</button><div class="product-card">  <p>Price: $499.99</p>  <button onclick="addToCart(2)">Add to Cart</button></div>1.2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):SOAP has strict rules and rigid messaging standards that can make it more secure than protocols such as REST. These types of APIs are frequently used in enterprise applications, particularly for payment processing and customer management, as they are highly safe in nature.A more rigid, protocol-specific API style used in enterprise environments:Highly structured messaging<soap:Envelope>  <soap:Header>    <Authorization>Bearer abc123</Authorization>  </soap:Header>    <GetUser>    </GetUser></soap:Envelope>A modern API query language that gives clients more control:Clients specify precisely what data they needSingle endpoint for all requestsReduces over-fetching and under-fetching of dataFacebook initially developed GraphQL to simplify endpoint management for REST-based APIs. Instead of maintaining multiple endpoints with small amounts of disjointed data, GraphQL provides a single endpoint that inputs complex queries and outputs only as much information as is needed for the query.query {  user(id: "123") {    email      title  }These are programming interfaces provided by software libraries or frameworks:Used directly in your codeNo network requests are neededUsually specific to a programming languageExample using a Python library API:import pandas as pd# Using pandas API to read a CSV filedf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')These allow applications to interact with the operating system:Example using Python’s OS API:import os# Using OS API to create a directoryos.mkdir('new_folder')The foundation of web APIs, using well-defined methods and status codes:PUT: Update existing dataPATCH: Partially update data2xx: Success (e.g., 200 OK)Enables real-time, two-way communication:Ideal for chat apps and live updatesExample WebSocket connection:const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/chat');ws.onmessage = (event) => {    console.log('Received:', event.data);};gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a  framework for inter-service communication in microservices architecture. Unlike REST APIs that use , gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), making it faster and more efficient.Google’s high-performance RPC framework:Excellent for microservicesExample Protocol Buffer definition:📌 How gRPC Works in a Web ApplicationIn an , gRPC can be used for fast communication between microservices.A  must fetch a  from the backend .1️⃣ Defining gRPC Service (product.proto)gRPC services use Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) to define API contracts.GetAllProducts(): Returns a list of products.GetProductById(): Fetches a single product by ID.Product: Defines the product structure.2️⃣ Implementing gRPC Server (product_server.py)The gRPC server implements the service logic.Implements ProductService methods (GetAllProducts, GetProductById).3️⃣ Implementing gRPC Client (product_client.py)The client  to fetch data.Calls GetAllProducts() to fetch all products.Calls GetProductById() to fetch a single product.4️⃣ Running gRPC Server & Client# 1.

GET: Used to retrieve dataIt is a request used to retrieve data. Never used to delete, update or insert data.Product API in E-Commerce Web Applicationcurl -X GET http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/products[   {"id": 1, "name": "iPhone 15", "price": 999.99},   {"id": 2, "name": "Samsung Galaxy S24", "price": 899.99}]If the API returns JSON, you can format the response using curl -X GET http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/products | jqDebugging & TroubleshootingIf you’re not getting the expected response, check:Is the Flask server running?curl -X GET http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/healthHow the /api/health Endpoint Works in FlaskThe endpoint is a  that provides the current status of the application, including . It helps in monitoring the system and ensuring that the API is .I have configured this /api/health endpoint in my E-Commerce Web Application.@app.route("/api/health", methods=["GET"])def health_check():    uptime = time.time() - start_time    return jsonify({        "uptime": f"{uptime:.2f} seconds",        "session_active": "username" in session    }), 2002. POST: Creates new resourcesThe  method is a request used to insert data. Posted data type — JSON.✅ Authentication EndpointsThis is handled in auth_routes.py, prefixed with /api/auth. → The frontend sends a request to the backend API (POST /api/auth/login). This is handled in auth_routes.py, prefixed with /api/auth.User sends a  with username & password.If credentials are valid:The user session is stored.API returns a success message.3. If credentials are invalid:API returns 3. PUT : Updates existing resourcesPUT method is used to create or update (replace) a resource. Useful for syncing data.Ex: We can add a “Change Password” feature for an existing user using a PUT /api/auth/change-password API endpoint.Steps to Implement “Change Password” APIPUT request with their old and new password.curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/auth/change-password      -H "Content-Type: app     -d '{"old_password": "currentPass123", "new_password": "newPass456"}'2. API verifies the old password:If incorrect, return an error (401 Unauthorized).3. If correct, update the password in the database.4. Save the new password (after hashing it for security).5. Return a success message.{"message": "Password changed successfully"}In an e-commerce application like yours, a PUT method would typically be used in: → PUT /api/auth/update-profileUpdating Product Information (Admin) → PUT /api/products/<product_id> → PUT /api/cart/<cart_id> → PUT /api/orders/<order_id>4. DELETE: Removes resourcesThe DELETE method deletes the specified resource./api/cart API to Remove a Product from the Cart1️⃣ Endpoint Definition (Flask API):@cart_bp.route('/cart', methods=['DELETE'])def remove_from_cart():    Remove a product from the cart for the logged-in user.    Expects JSON payload: { product_id }.    """        user_id = session.get('user_id')            return jsonify({"message": "User not authenticated"}), 401        product_id = data.get('product_id')            return jsonify({"message": "'product_id' is required"}), 400        connection = get_db_connection()        cursor = connection.cursor()        delete_query = "DELETE FROM cart_items WHERE user_id = %s AND product_id = %s"        cursor.execute(delete_query, (user_id, product_id))            return jsonify({"message": "Product not found in cart"}), 404        return jsonify({"message": "Product removed from cart successfully"}), 200        return jsonify({"message": "Failed to remove product from cart", "error": str(e)}), 500        close_db_connection(connection)User sends a DELETE request with the product_id they want to remove.API verifies if the user is logged in (checks session['user_id']). (if missing, returns 400 Bad Request). to remove the product from the cart_items table.If the product does not exist, it returns 404 Not Found., it commits the transaction and returns a success message (200 OK).Handles database errors and ensures the connection is closed.3️⃣ Example API Request & Response:Now User wanted to delete iPhone 15 Pro from the cart:Click the  button under “iPhone 15 Pro”.The item should disappear, and the cart total should update.Run this command in the terminal:curl -X DELETE http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/cart      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -H "Cookie: session=00068d4c-4b41-4e3e-8884-7389cabbb9b0"     -d '{"product_id": 4}'{    "message": "Product removed from cart successfully"After deletion of that item:5. PATCH: Partially updates resourcesPATCH method is to request used to update data. Only passed data will be updated. You don’t need to provide all the data set.The  method is used to  a resource. Instead of sending the entire data set, we only send the fields that need to be updated.Use Case: Updating a User’s Profile (PATCH /api/auth/update-profile)Imagine a user wants to update  or  without changing their username.1️⃣ PATCH Endpoint: PATCH /api/auth/update-profile2️⃣ Sending a PATCH RequestIf the user wants to update curl -X PATCH http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/auth/update-profile \     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \     -H "Cookie: session=your_valid_session_id" \     -d '{"email": "newemail@example.com"}'🔹 Only the  field will be updated.✅ {    "message": "Profile updated successfully"❌ If no fields are provided:{    "message": "No valid fields provided for update"{    "message": "User not authenticated"4️⃣ Why Use PATCH Instead of PUT?Conclusion: Understanding APIs, Endpoints, and Methods in Web DevelopmentAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different systems to  with each other. They define how requests and responses are exchanged between a client (browser, app) and a server.An  acts as a bridge between two applications, enabling data exchange.Example: A shopping website uses an API to fetch product details from a database.An  is a URL that clients use to request or send data.Example: GET /api/products retrieves all products. → Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage data. → Lets clients request specific data fields, reducing unnecessary data transfer. → Uses XML messaging, mainly in enterprise applications. → Maintains a continuous connection for real-time updates (e.g., live chat).Use  (JWT, API Keys, OAuth) to restrict access.Protect sensitive data with .Implement  to prevent abuse.APIs are the backbone of modern applications, enabling data sharing between different services. Developers create smooth and efficient digital experiences by designing well-structured and secure APIs.I’d love to hear what you think about this article — feel free to share your opinions in the comments below (or above, depending on your device!).

Ensuring its availability and data persistence is crucial for uninterrupted CI/CD pipelines. In this guide, we’ll walk through deploying Jenkins in Kubernetes, configuring its resources, and setting up persistent storage to safeguard critical data.In this configuration, we have a Deployment resource for deploying Jenkins in Kubernetes, along with associated PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), PersistentVolume (PV), Service, and StorageClass resources.

However, this shared structure introduces complexities in managing access and authorization. A robust authorization strategy is essential to ensure that users can only access resources belonging to their tenant without compromising scalability or performance.This article explores the best practices and technical solutions that we adopt at Xinthe, for implementing efficient authorization mechanisms in multi-tenant systems, with a focus on nested resource structures, such as companies, clients, projects, and tasks. After having read this entire article, you will be armed with actionable insights to build secure, efficient, and future-proof authorization strategies for multi-tenant applications.Understanding Multi-Tenant Database AuthorizationDefinition Of Multi-TenancyMulti-tenancy refers to an architectural pattern where a single instance of a software application and its database serves multiple tenants (e.g., companies, organizations, or users). Each tenant’s data remains logically isolated, ensuring that no tenant can access another’s data, while sharing underlying resources for efficiency.Key Multi-Tenancy Models:Each tenant has a dedicated database or schema.Offers strong isolation and security.Higher costs and maintenance complexity due to multiple instances.Multiple tenants share the same database.Logical separation is maintained through identifiers (e.g., tenant_id or company_id).Cost-effective and scalable but requires robust authorization mechanisms.Challenges Of AuthorizationImplementing authorization in multi-tenant systems is a non-trivial task, especially as the scale and complexity of resources grow. Common challenges include -Cross-Tenant Data Leakage:Risk: Improper queries or configurations can expose data to unauthorized tenants.Example: A user from Company A inadvertently accessing tasks belonging to Company B due to a missing or incorrect WHERE clause.Deeply nested resource structures often require joins across multiple tables.Queries with extensive joins can degrade performance as data volume increases.Scalability & Maintainability:The need to balance fast access controls with a maintainable schema.Adding new authorization rules or resource types without overhauling the system.Data Localization & Compliance:For multi-tenant systems spanning regions, ensuring that tenant data complies with regulations like GDPR can complicate authorization logic.Importance Of Nested Resource StructuresIn many applications, resources are interconnected in a hierarchical fashion. Consider the following nested structure -Company → Client → Project → TaskA  has multiple .Each  manages several .Each  contains multiple .Why Nested Structures Matter:Access Control Complexity: Permissions must flow through the hierarchy (e.g., a user’s access to a task must be verified against their company). Hierarchical access often necessitates multiple joins, impacting query efficiency. Hierarchical structures reflect real-world use cases like SaaS platforms, where users must operate within their organization’s boundaries.A user from Company A should only edit tasks within their projects. Authorization must ensure that the task → project → client → company linkage is maintained without exposing data from Company B.Comparing Authorization ApproachesWhen implementing authorization in a multi-tenant database, there are three common strategies to choose from: the , the , and Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables. Each comes with its own set of benefits and trade-offs. Let’s break them down -1. Flat Model (Adding Tenant IDs)In this approach, a tenant_id or company_id is added to every resource table (e.g., tasks, projects, clients), enabling direct filtering for authorization. Queries can directly filter by tenant_id without traversing the hierarchy.SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id AND id = :task_id; Reduces query complexity by avoiding multiple table joins to enforce access. Straightforward implementation makes it easy to debug and maintain. tenant_id is replicated across multiple tables, introducing redundancy. Adding tenant_id and other metadata can lead to bloated schemas, especially as the number of attributes grows. Schema updates (e.g., adding new relationships) might require extensive changes across multiple tables.Ideal for systems where performance is critical and the schema is relatively stable, such as SaaS platforms with many small tenants.2. Hierarchical Model (Enforcing Relationships)In this approach, the relationships between resources (e.g., task → project → client → company) are strictly enforced through foreign keys. Authorization is achieved by traversing the hierarchy. Avoids redundant fields by relying on inherent relationships.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id),    ...    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    client_id INT REFERENCES clients(id),    ...    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    company_id INT REFERENCES companies(id),    ... Reduces duplication of metadata like tenant_id.Relationship-Centric Queries: Makes it easier to enforce hierarchical constraints and maintain referential integrity. Queries require multiple joins to verify access, which can impact performance.SELECT t.*FROM tasks tJOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.idJOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.idWHERE c.company_id = :tenant_id AND t.id = :task_id; Deep hierarchies with large datasets can significantly increase query execution time. As the hierarchy grows, maintaining performance becomes challenging.Suitable for applications where maintaining strict relationships between resources is essential, such as ERP systems or large enterprise applications.3. Tenant-Specific Databases Or TablesThis approach creates separate databases or tables for each tenant, isolating their data entirely. Each tenant’s data can be managed independently, making it easier to scale horizontally by distributing databases across servers. Ensures complete data isolation, reducing the risk of cross-tenant data leakage. Simplifies adherence to regulations like GDPR by enabling tenant-specific backups, retention policies, and deletions. Managing multiple databases or schemas requires sophisticated deployment and CI/CD pipelines. Schema updates need to be applied consistently across all tenant databases. For tenants with small datasets, the resource consumption of separate databases might be inefficient.Best for large organizations with high regulatory or security requirements, or when dealing with tenants that require dedicated resources (e.g., enterprise customers).Summary Table — Comparing ApproachesCriteria For Choosing An Authorization ModelSelecting the right authorization model for a multi-tenant database is critical for ensuring scalability, performance, and compliance. The decision hinges on a combination of technical, regulatory, and operational factors. Below are the primary criteria to consider -The level of traffic and query complexity your application handles directly impacts the choice of an authorization model.High-Traffic Applications:Benefit from simpler and faster queries, such as those enabled by the .SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id AND id = :task_id;Minimal joins mean lower query latency, ensuring the system performs well under heavy loads.Suitable for SaaS platforms or e-commerce systems with a high volume of tenant interactions.:Can afford the  with more joins, as performance trade-offs are less significant.Allows for cleaner schema designs and strict relational integrity.Suitable for internal enterprise tools or smaller-scale applications.2. Regulatory RequirementsCompliance with data protection and privacy regulations often dictates how data is stored and accessed.Using Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables simplifies compliance for regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.Tenant isolation reduces the risk of data leakage and ensures tenant-specific data retention and deletion policies.An enterprise customer requires dedicated storage with separate backups and audit logs.A  can still meet compliance needs with appropriate access controls and audit mechanisms.Challenges arise in managing and enforcing tenant-specific data governance policies within shared infrastructure.The ability to handle growth in the number of tenants and data volumes is a critical factor.Planning For Tenant Growth:For a rapidly scaling user base, Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables provide the most flexibility -Each tenant can be distributed across servers to balance load.Tenant databases can be independently scaled based on specific needs.A B2B SaaS platform serving both small businesses and large enterprises can allocate resources dynamically based on tenant size.The  can handle larger datasets more efficiently as indexes on tenant_id make filtering faster.The  may struggle as table sizes grow, requiring optimization for complex joins.Ease of schema management and updates is essential for long-term maintainability.Simplified Schema Updates:The  simplifies schema updates by centralizing data attributes like tenant_id.However, redundant fields may increase the risk of errors during updates.The  enforces relational integrity, ensuring data consistency.Complex queries for nested structures may require more effort to maintain and optimize.Automated CI/CD Pipelines:For Tenant-Specific Databases, CI/CD automation becomes critical to manage schema changes across multiple databases.Tools like Octopus Deploy or Liquibase can help automate schema migrations and ensure consistency.Key Considerations SummaryDesigning Authorization Strategies For Multi-TenancyDesigning robust authorization strategies for multi-tenant systems requires careful consideration of schema design, indexing, and data partitioning to ensure scalability, security, and performance. This section outlines best practices for implementing these strategies effectively.The foundation of a successful multi-tenant authorization system lies in a well-thought-out schema.Add a tenant_id column to all relevant tables (e.g., clients, projects, tasks) for direct tenant filtering.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id));Ensure tenant_id is a mandatory field in all write operations to enforce multi-tenancy constraints.Defining Relationships In Hierarchical Structures:Maintain strict referential integrity between hierarchical entities.Example for hierarchical relationships -CREATE TABLE projects (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id)Flat schema enables quick lookups for tenant-specific data.Hierarchical relationships ensure data consistency and logical separation.2. Indexing Best PracticesIndexes are essential for optimizing queries in multi-tenant systems. However, improper indexing can lead to inefficiencies.Compound Indexes For Tenant-Specific Queries:Use composite indexes combining tenant_id with frequently queried columns.CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_tenant_projectON tasks (tenant_id, project_id, status);This enables efficient filtering and sorting within a tenant’s scope.Balancing Indexing Depth & Query Speed:Avoid over-indexing, which can slow down write operations.Prioritize indexing columns involved in filtering, joining, and sorting operations.Regularly analyze query performance using tools like  in PostgreSQL or  in MySQL.Partitioning improves scalability by dividing data into smaller, more manageable segments, reducing query times for tenant-specific operations.Horizontal Partitioning By Tenants:Partition data within a single database based on tenant_id.CREATE TABLE tasks_1 PARTITION OF tasksFOR VALUES IN (1); -- Partition for tenant_id 1Faster tenant-specific queries as partitions reduce the search space.Simplifies maintenance for large datasets.Database Sharding For High-Scale Systems:Distribute tenant data across multiple databases (shards).Example Sharding Strategy -Use tenant_id % shard_count to assign tenants to shards.Tools like  or  can manage sharding in distributed database systems.Eliminates contention in single-database systems.Enhances fault isolation and scalability.Example Use Case — Applying These StrategiesAn application manages 100,000 tenants, each with thousands of projects and tasks.Add tenant_id to all tables.Use foreign keys to link tasks → projects → clients.Create a compound index on tasks (tenant_id, project_id) for common queries like -SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND project_id = 456;For smaller tenants, use horizontal partitioning -CREATE TABLE tasks_tenant_123 PARTITION OF tasks FOR VALUES IN (123);For larger tenants, shard data across multiple databases to scale.A well-designed schema with tenant_id simplifies multi-tenant data filtering.Proper indexing ensures efficient queries, even at scale.Partitioning and sharding prepare the system for growth, reducing query times and enhancing reliability.This section provides concrete examples of implementing different authorization models for multi-tenant systems, including schemas, queries, and tooling. Each approach demonstrates how to enforce tenant-specific access effectively.1. Flat Model ImplementationThe flat model relies on adding a tenant_id column to all relevant tables, ensuring that queries are scoped to the tenant directly.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id)    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id));: Access tasks for a user’s company -SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND status = 'in_progress';Simplifies authorization logic with direct lookups.Reduces query complexity by avoiding joins.Potential schema bloat with additional tenant_id columns.2. Hierarchical Model ImplementationIn this model, tenant authorization is enforced by traversing relationships between resources (e.g., Company → Client → Project → Task).CREATE TABLE companies (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    company_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id));    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id));    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    description TEXT,    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id): Check task access by traversing relationships -SELECT t.* FROM tasks tINNER JOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.idINNER JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.idINNER JOIN companies co ON c.company_id = co.idWHERE co.id = 123 AND t.status = 'in_progress';Maintains normalized relationships.Avoids redundant tenant_id columns.Complex joins increase query costs.Requires optimized indexes to maintain performance.3. Tenant-Specific Database/Table ImplementationFor scenarios requiring strict isolation, separate databases or tables for each tenant can be used.Create a separate database or schema for each tenant -CREATE DATABASE company_123;CREATE TABLE company_123.tasks (    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);: Access tasks for a specific tenant -USE company_123;SELECT * WHERE status = 'in_progress';: Use CI/CD tools like  to manage multi-tenant databases:Automate schema changes across databases.Track versioning for each tenant’s database.Complete tenant isolation for security and compliance (e.g., GDPR).Simplifies data archival and backup for individual tenants.Deployment complexity increases with the number of tenants.Resource-intensive for systems with many small tenants.Choosing The Right ImplementationUse the flat model for simplicity in high-traffic environments.Use the hierarchical model when data relationships must be preserved and redundancy minimized.Opt for tenant-specific databases for strict isolation and compliance requirements.Each implementation can be tailored based on application needs, tenant size, and regulatory requirements. Balancing performance, scalability, and maintainability is key to successful multi-tenant authorization systems.Security Best Practices For AuthorizationEnsuring robust security in multi-tenant systems is essential to prevent data breaches, maintain compliance, and build user trust. This section outlines key practices for implementing secure and reliable authorization mechanisms.1. Strict Access ControlsImplementing strong access controls ensures that only authorized users can access or modify resources.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):Assign roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User) to users based on their responsibilities.Enforce role-specific permissions at the application and database layers.Example: Use database roles to restrict access to tenant-specific tables.CREATE ROLE company_admin;GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO company_admin;REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES FROM PUBLIC; -- Restrict public access:Enforce tenant-level data segregation directly at the database layer.RLS ensures that queries automatically filter data based on the user’s tenant.PostgreSQL Example For RLS:CREATE POLICY tenant_policyON tasksUSING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::BIGINT);ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;SET app.current_tenant = '123'; -- Simulate tenant contextSELECT * FROM tasks; -- Only tasks with tenant_id = 123 will be visible2. Preventing Cross-Tenant Data LeaksPreventing accidental or intentional cross-tenant data leaks is critical in multi-tenant architectures.Multi-Layer Access Checks:Enforce tenant isolation at both the database and application layers.Validate all queries to ensure they are scoped to the user’s tenant.Always include a tenant_id check in database queries.Use database views or abstractions to simplify tenant-specific filtering.Application-Layer Validation:Add additional validation at the application level as a guardrail.Ensure that APIs restrict data access to the authenticated tenant context.def get_user_tasks(user):    if user.tenant_id != request.tenant_id:        raise PermissionDenied("Cross-tenant access is not allowed.")    return db.query(Tasks).filter(Tasks.tenant_id == user.tenant_id).all()Audit logs are essential for monitoring, compliance, and debugging. They provide visibility into access patterns and help detect unauthorized access attempts.User ID and tenant ID for all queries.Access attempts (successful and failed).Data modification operations (insert, update, delete).Timestamps and IP addresses for requests.SQL Example For Logging Queries:CREATE TABLE audit_logs (    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT,    table_name VARCHAR(255),    executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPINSERT INTO audit_logs (user_id, tenant_id, action, table_name, query)VALUES (123, 456, 'SELECT', 'tasks', 'SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 456');Integrating Logging Tools:Use database triggers to log operations automatically.Combine with external tools like  (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or  for advanced monitoring.CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_task_changes()RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$    INSERT INTO audit_logs (user_id, tenant_id, action, table_name, query)    VALUES (current_user_id(), NEW.tenant_id, TG_OP, TG_TABLE_NAME, current_query());    RETURN NEW;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE TRIGGER audit_task_changesAFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON tasksFOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION log_task_changes();Combine RBAC, RLS, and application-level validation for comprehensive protection.Use multi-layered access checks and robust query scoping to ensure tenant isolation.Maintain detailed audit logs to track access and modifications for accountability and compliance.These practices create a secure foundation for multi-tenant authorization systems, ensuring that each tenant’s data is isolated, protected, and auditable.Designing a robust multi-tenant authorization system involves navigating a set of challenges and trade-offs. Each approach has its own set of complexities that must be carefully managed to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.1. Balancing Performance & FlexibilityChoosing between speed and schema cleanliness can significantly impact your database design and performance.Prioritizing Performance (Flat Model):Direct lookups using a tenant_id column ensure fast query execution.Reduced join complexity leads to quicker response times.: May result in data redundancy (e.g., repeating tenant IDs across multiple tables).SQL Example For Optimized Query:SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND status = 'pending';Prioritizing Schema Cleanliness (Hierarchical Model):Using a normalized schema ensures a clean and consistent database structure.: Requires more complex joins and increased query times, especially for deeply nested relationships.Hierarchical Query Example:SELECT tasks.*FROM tasksJOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.idJOIN clients ON projects.client_id = clients.idWHERE clients.tenant_id = 123;Managing tenant-specific setups adds complexity, particularly as the number of tenants grows.Tenant-Specific Databases:Each tenant has its own database, simplifying compliance and data isolation.: Maintaining consistency across databases for schema changes.: Use automation tools like  or  to manage schema migrations across tenants.# Liquibase command to apply migrations to multiple tenant databasesliquibase --url="jdbc:mysql://db_host/tenant1" updateliquibase --url="jdbc:mysql://db_host/tenant2" updateSingle Multi-Tenant Database:Shared schema reduces maintenance but requires more sophisticated query scoping and indexing.: Tracking and isolating tenant data effectively without introducing query overhead.3. Handling Schema Updates In Multi-Tenant DatabasesEnsuring all tenants have consistent schemas while minimizing downtime is one of the most significant challenges in multi-tenant systems.Use versioned migrations to apply incremental updates across all tenants.Maintain backward compatibility to prevent disruptions during updates.CREATE TABLE schema_versions (    tenant_id BIGINT,    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPApply updates to a subset of tenants, validate, and then roll out to the rest.Use feature flags to selectively enable new schema features.Code Example For Rolling Updates:tenants = get_tenant_list()for tenant in tenants:    apply_schema_update(tenant_id=tenant.id)Testing & CI/CD For Multi-Tenant Systems:Test migrations on a staging environment with realistic tenant data before deploying.Use CI/CD tools like  to automate and track updates across tenant databases.Performance Vs. Flexibility:Use a flat model for high-speed queries or hierarchical models for cleaner schemas but expect performance trade-offs.Tenant-specific databases simplify compliance but require robust automation for schema management.Implement version control and rolling updates to ensure seamless schema changes across all tenants.Addressing these challenges with well-defined strategies ensures a scalable and maintainable multi-tenant authorization system, capable of adapting to evolving application needs.Real-world applications of multi-tenant database authorization vary depending on the complexity of the resource structure, performance requirements, and compliance needs. Below are three illustrative scenarios demonstrating how different authorization models can be applied effectively.Scenario 1 — Flat Model For A SaaS CRM AppA SaaS customer relationship management (CRM) application needs to store and manage customer interactions for multiple companies, ensuring users can only access data associated with their organization.: Each company has its own sales team, and users need quick access to customer records and sales data.: Use a flat model by adding tenant_id to every table, such as customers, leads, and sales.CREATE TABLE customers (    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    phone VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    customer_id BIGINT,    status VARCHAR(50),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);SELECT * FROM customers Simple queries without joins for tenant-specific data.High performance due to direct lookups.Wider tables due to the inclusion of tenant_id.Potential redundancy if relationships between entities are not properly normalized.Scenario 2 — Hierarchical Model For A Project Management ToolA project management tool with a nested structure: Company → Client → Project → Task. Users need to manage projects while maintaining strict access control based on their organization.: Each company has multiple clients, each with its own projects and tasks. Users must only access tasks related to their company.: Use a hierarchical model to enforce relationships and control access through joins.CREATE TABLE companies (    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    company_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    description TEXT,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPSELECT tasks.*FROM tasksJOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.idJOIN clients ON projects.client_id = clients.idWHERE clients.company_id = 123;Clean, normalized schema without redundant data.Access naturally follows the hierarchy.Complex queries due to multi-level joins.Slower query performance for deep hierarchies.Scenario 3 — Single-Tenant Databases For An Enterprise AppAn enterprise application handles sensitive data, requiring strict data isolation for compliance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations.: Each tenant’s data must be completely isolated to ensure compliance and scalability.: Use a single-tenant database model where each company has its own dedicated database.Database Names:  tenant_1_db  tenant_3_db: Use  to manage database updates across multiple tenants.deploy:  steps:    - name: Update Tenant Databases      script: |        for db in $(list_databases); do          apply_migrations $dbComplete isolation ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.Scalability: Large tenants can have dedicated resources (e.g., separate hardware).Higher operational complexity in managing multiple databases.Requires robust CI/CD pipelines for schema updates.Each use case demonstrates how careful consideration of application requirements, data relationships, and compliance needs can guide the choice of the best authorization model for a multi-tenant database.Efficient, scalable, and secure authorization in multi-tenant databases as we’ve found often at Xinthe, requires a well-thought-out approach tailored to the application’s needs.Authorization in multi-tenant databases isn’t a one-size-fits-all challenge. Developers and database architects must carefully evaluate their application’s structure, expected growth, and regulatory needs to select the most effective approach. Armed with the insights and strategies outlined in this article, you can design multi-tenant database systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient, ensuring both developer productivity and a seamless user experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Docker, Kubernetes, and NATS — The Backbone of Cloud-Native Apps</title><link>https://blog.devops.dev/docker-kubernetes-and-nats-the-backbone-of-cloud-native-apps-af724f41c17d?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4</link><author>Cristhian Ferrufino</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:48:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.devops.dev/?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4">Devops.dev blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Docker, Kubernetes, and NATS — The Backbone of Cloud-Native AppsWelcome back to the ! In the last article, we explored the world of message brokers and why NATS is a standout choice for modern microservices. Now, it’s time to dive into the backbone of cloud-native applications:  and . If microservices are the chefs in our restaurant analogy, containers are the kitchen tools that keep everything running smoothly. And Kubernetes? That’s the head chef, making sure everyone works in harmony.In this article, we’ll break down  and , explore how they work together, and even touch on how  fits into the mix. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to containerize your applications and orchestrate them like a pro. Let’s get cooking!What Is Containerization, and Why Is It Important?Imagine you’re shipping a fragile package across the world. You’d want to pack it in a sturdy container, right? That’s exactly what containerization does for your applications. It packages your app and all its dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc.) into a lightweight, portable unit called a . This ensures that your app runs consistently across different environments — whether it’s your laptop, a testing server, or a production cluster.Why developers love containers:✅ : “Works on my machine” becomes “Works everywhere.”✅ : No more dependency hell — each app lives in its own bubble.✅ : Deploy to AWS, Azure, or your grandma’s PC (if she’s cool with Kubernetes).✅ : 10x lighter than VMs. Think EVs vs. a gas-guzzling truckIntroduction to Docker: Building, Running, and Managing ContainersDocker is the most popular tool for containerization, and for good reason. It’s simple, powerful, and widely supported. Let’s break it down:To create a container, you start with a  — a text file that defines the steps to build your app’s environment. Here’s a simple example:# Use a lightweight Python image (because nobody likes bloat)FROM python:3.9-slim# Set the stage for your appWORKDIR /app# Install dependencies (Pro tip: Skip the cache to shrink your image)COPY requirements.txt .RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt# Copy the rest of the codeCOPY . .# Open the app’s “front door”EXPOSE 8080CMD ["python", "app.py"]With this Dockerfile, you can build a container image using the `` command:🚀 Run this: docker build -t my-python-app .Once you’ve built your image, you can run it as a container:🎯 Pro tip: Map ports like a pirate mapping treasure.  docker run -p 8080:8080 my-python-appThis command starts your app and maps port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container. Easy, right?Docker also provides tools to manage your containers:: List running containers.docker logs <container_id>: View logs for a specific containerdocker stop <container_id>: Stop a running container.Docker vs. Podman: A Detailed ComparisonWhile Docker is the most popular containerization tool, it’s not the only one.  is a rising star in the container world, and it’s worth understanding how it compares to Docker.+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Feature              | Docker 🐳                           | Podman 📦                         |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Daemon Requirement   | Requires a daemon (dockerd)         | Daemonless (runs containers       ||                      |                                     | directly)                         |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Root vs. Rootless    | Runs as root by default              | Supports rootless containers out  ||                      |                                     | of the box                        |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Compatibility        | Uses Docker CLI and Dockerfiles     | Fully compatible with Docker CLI  ||                      |                                     | and Dockerfiles                   |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Security             | Requires root privileges, which can | Rootless mode reduces attack      ||                      | be a security risk                  | surface                           |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Orchestration        | Requires Docker Swarm for           | Integrates with Kubernetes        ||                      | orchestration                       | natively                          |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Community Support    | Larger community and ecosystem      | Growing community, backed by Red  ||                      |                                     | Hat                               |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+You need a mature, widely supported tool with a large ecosystem.You’re already using Docker Swarm for orchestration.You’re okay with running containers as root.You want a daemonless, more secure alternative to Docker.You’re working in environments where root privileges are restricted.You’re already using Kubernetes and want tighter integration.Both tools are excellent choices, so pick the one that best fits your needs.Kubernetes Overview: Orchestration, Scaling, and Self-HealingWhile Docker is great for running containers, managing them at scale can get tricky. Enter  (or K8s for short), the de facto standard for container orchestration. Think of Kubernetes as the conductor of an orchestra — it ensures all your containers play in harmony.Key Features of Kubernetes: Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containers.: Automatically adjusts the number of running containers based on demand.: Restarts failed containers and replaces unhealthy ones.: Automatically assigns IP addresses and DNS names to containers.Kubernetes organizes containers into , which are the smallest deployable units. A pod can contain one or more containers that share resources like storage and networking. Here’s a simple Kubernetes deployment file:apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: my-python-app  replicas: 3    matchLabels:  template:      labels:    spec:      - name: my-python-app        image: my-python-app:latest        ports:his file tells Kubernetes to run three replicas of your app and expose it on port 8080. You can apply it using:🔥 Run this: kubectl apply -f deployment.yamlHow NATS Shines in a Kubernetes EnvironmentNow, let’s talk about . As a lightweight, high-performance messaging system, NATS plays well with Kubernetes. Here’s how it stands out:Use Cases for NATS in KubernetesService-to-Service Communication: NATS excels at enabling fast, reliable communication between microservices. Its lightweight design makes it perfect for Kubernetes’ dynamic environment.Event-Driven Architectures: NATS’s pub/sub, request-reply or streams patterns make it ideal for event-driven systems, where services need to react to events in real time.Scalability: NATS can handle millions of messages per second, making it a great fit for high-throughput applications running on Kubernetes.Resilience: NATS’s built-in fault tolerance ensures that your messaging system remains reliable, even in the face of node failures.Deploying NATS on KubernetesDeploying NATS on Kubernetes is straightforward. Here’s a basic NATS deployment file:apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: nats  replicas: 1    matchLabels:  template:      labels:    spec:      - name: nats        ports:        - containerPort: 4222 # The messaging highway 🛣️Once deployed, NATS can be used by your microservices for seamless communication.Best Practices for Containerizing MicroservicesTo wrap things up, here are some best practices for containerizing your microservices:Keep Containers Lightweight: Use minimal base images (e.g.,  or  versions) to reduce size and improve performance.: Separate the build and runtime environments to keep production images small.Leverage Kubernetes Features: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data.: Integrate tools like Prometheus and Fluentd for monitoring and logging.: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate building, testing, and deploying containers.In the next article, we’ll explore “NATS as a Service Mesh — The Lightweight Superhero Your Microservices Deserve” and how it simplifies communication between microservices. Spoiler alert: it’s like giving your microservices a supercharged walkie-talkie. Stay tuned!Until then, feel free to drop a comment or share your thoughts.

This powerful build orchestration tool takes the hassle out of managing complex builds and offers simplicity, flexibility, and performance for teams of all sizes.Docker Bake is an orchestration tool that streamlines Docker builds, similar to how Compose simplifies managing runtime environments. With Bake, you can define build stages and deployment environments in a declarative file, making complex builds easier to manage. It also leverages BuildKit’s parallelization and optimization features to speed up build times.While Dockerfiles are excellent for defining image build steps, teams often need to build multiple images and execute helper tasks like testing, linting, and code generation. Traditionally, this meant juggling numerous  commands with their own options and arguments – a tedious and error-prone process.Bake changes the game by introducing a declarative file format that encapsulates all options and image dependencies, referred to as . Additionally, Bake’s ability to parallelize and deduplicate work ensures faster and more efficient builds.Challenges with complex Docker Build configuration:Managing long, complex build commands filled with countless flags and environment variables.Tedious workflows for building multiple images.Difficulty declaring builds for specific targets or environments.Requires a script or 3rd-party tool to make things manageableDocker Bake tackles these challenges with a better way to manage complex builds with a simple, declarative approach.Key benefits of Docker Bake: Replace complex chains of Docker build commands and scripts with a single  command while maintaining clear, version-controlled configuration files that are easy to understand and modify.: Express sophisticated build logic through HCL syntax and matrix builds, enabling dynamic configurations that adapt to different environments and requirements while supporting custom functions for advanced use cases.: Maintain standardized build configurations across teams and environments through version-controlled files and inheritance patterns, eliminating environment-specific build issues and reducing configuration drift.: Automatically parallelize independent builds and eliminate redundant operations through context deduplication and intelligent caching, dramatically reducing build times for complex multi-image workflows.: One simple Docker buildx bake command to replace all the flags and environment variables.Use cases for Docker Bake1. Monorepo and Image BakeryDocker Bake can help developers efficiently manage and build multiple related Docker images from a single source repository. Plus, they can leverage shared configurations and automated dependency handling to enforce organizational standards. Teams can maintain consistent build logic across dozens or hundreds of microservices in a single repository, reducing configuration drift and maintenance overhead. Shared base images and contexts are automatically deduplicated, dramatically reducing build times and storage costs. Enforce organizational standards through inherited configurations, ensuring all services follow security, tagging, and testing requirements. A single source of truth for build configurations makes it easier to implement organization-wide changes like base image updates or security patches.Docker Bake provides seamless compatibility with existing docker-compose.yml files, allowing direct use of your current configurations. Existing Compose users are able to get started using Bake with minimal effort. Teams can incrementally adopt advanced build features while still leveraging their existing compose workflows and knowledge. Use the same configuration for both local development (via compose) and production builds (via Bake), eliminating “works on my machine” issues.: Access powerful features like matrix builds and HCL expressions while maintaining compatibility with familiar compose syntax.: Seamlessly integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines that already understand compose files while adding Bake’s advanced build capabilities.3. Complex build configurationsCross-Platform Compatibility: Matrix builds enable teams to efficiently manage builds across multiple architectures, OS versions, and dependency combinations from a single configuration. HCL expressions allow builds to adapt to different environments, git branches, or CI variables without maintaining multiple configurations. Custom functions enable sophisticated logic for things like version calculation, tag generation, and conditional builds based on git history. Variable validation and inheritance ensure consistent configuration across complex build scenarios, reducing errors and maintenance burden. Groups and targets help organize large-scale build systems with dozens or hundreds of permutations, making them manageable and maintainable.With Bake-optimized builds as the foundation, developers can achieve more efficient Docker Build Cloud performance and faster builds.Enhanced Docker Build Cloud Performance: Instantly parallelize matrix builds across cloud infrastructure, turning hour-long build pipelines into minutes without managing build infrastructure. Leverage Build Cloud’s distributed caching and deduplication to dramatically reduce bandwidth usage and build times, which is especially valuable for remote teams. Save cost with DBC  Bake’s precise target definitions mean you only consume cloud resources for exactly what needs to be built. Teams can run complex multi-architecture builds without powerful local machines, enabling development from any device while maintaining build performance. Offload resource-intensive builds from CI runners to Build Cloud, reducing CI costs and queue times while improving reliability.What’s New in Bake for GA?Docker Bake has been an experimental feature for several years, allowing us to refine and improve it based on user feedback. So, there is already a strong set of ingredients that users love, such as targets and groups, variables, HCL Expression Support, inheritance capabilities, matrix targets, and additional contexts. With this GA release, Bake is now ready for production use, and we’ve added several enhancements to make it more efficient, secure, and easier to use:Deduplicated Context Transfers Significantly speeds up build pipelines by eliminating redundant file transfers when multiple targets share the same build context. Enhances security and resource management by providing fine-grained control over what capabilities and resources builders can access during the build process. Simplifies configuration management by allowing teams to define reusable attribute sets that can be mixed, matched, and overridden across different targets. Prevents wasted time and resources by catching configuration errors before the actual build process begins.Deduplicate context transfersWhen you build targets concurrently using groups, build contexts are loaded independently for each target. If the same context is used by multiple targets in a group, that context is transferred once for each time it’s used. This can significantly impact build time, depending on your build configuration.Previously, the workaround required users to define a named context that loads the context files and then have each target reference the named context. But with Bake, this will be handled automatically now.Bake can automatically deduplicate context transfers from targets sharing the same context. When you build targets concurrently using groups, build contexts are loaded independently for each target. If the same context is used by multiple targets in a group, that context is transferred once for each time it’s used. This more efficient approach leads to much faster build time. Read more about how to speed up your build time in our docs. Bake now includes entitlements to control access to privileged operations, aligning with Build. This prevents unintended side effects and security risks. If Bake detects a potential issue — like a privileged access request or an attempt to access files outside the current directory — the build will fail unless explicitly allowed.To be consistent, the Bake command now supports the flag to grant access to additional entitlements. The following entitlements are currently supported for Bake.Build equivalents
 Allows executions with host networking.--allow security.insecure Allows executions without sandbox. (i.e. —privileged)File system: Grant filesystem access for builds that need access files outside the working directory. This will impact context, output, cache-from, cache-to, dockerfile, secret Grant read and write access to files outside the working directory. Grant read access to files outside the working directory.--allow fs.write=<path|*>  Grant write access to files outside the working directory.ssh
– Allows exposing SSH agent.Several attributes previously had to be defined in CSV (e.g. ). These were challenging to read and couldn’t be easily overridden. The following can now be defined as structured objects:target "app" {
		attest = [
			{ type = "provenance", mode = "max" },
			{ type = "sbom", disabled = true}
		]

		cache-from = [
			{ type = "registry", ref = "user/app:cache" },
			{ type = "local", src = "path/to/cache"}
		]

		cache-to = [
			{ type = "local", dest = "path/to/cache" },
		]

		output = [
			{ type = "oci", dest = "../out.tar" },
			{ type = "local", dest="../out"}
		]

		secret = [
			{ id = "mysecret", src = "path/to/secret" },
			{ id = "mysecret2", env = "TOKEN" },
		]

		ssh = [
			{ id = "default" },
			{ id = "key", paths = ["path/to/key"] },
		]
}As such, the attributes are now composable. Teams can mix, match, and override attributes across different targets which simplifies configuration management. target "app-dev" {
    attest = [
			{ type = "provenance", mode = "min" },
			{ type = "sbom", disabled = true}
		]
  }

  target "app-prod" {
    inherits = ["app-dev"]

    attest = [
			{ type = "provenance", mode = "max" },
		]
  }
Bake now supports validation for variables similar to Terraform to help developers catch and resolve configuration errors early. The GA for Bake also supports the following use cases.To verify that the value of a variable conforms to an expected type, value range, or other condition, you can define custom validation rules using the  block.variable "FOO" {
  validation {
    condition = FOO != ""
    error_message = "FOO is required."
  }
}

target "default" {
  args = {
    FOO = FOO
  }
}
To evaluate more than one condition, define multiple  blocks for the variable. All conditions must be true.variable "FOO" {
  validation {
    condition = FOO != ""
    error_message = "FOO is required."
  }
  validation {
    condition = strlen(FOO) > 4
    error_message = "FOO must be longer than 4 characters."
  }
}

target "default" {
  args = {
    FOO = FOO
  }
}
Dependency on other variablesYou can reference other Bake variables in your condition expression, enabling validations that enforce dependencies between variables. This ensures that dependent variables are set correctly before proceeding.variable "FOO" {}
variable "BAR" {
  validation {
    condition = FOO != ""
    error_message = "BAR requires FOO to be set."
  }
}

target "default" {
  args = {
    BAR = BAR
  }
}
In addition to updating the Bake configuration, we’ve added a new –list option. Previously, if you were unfamiliar with a project or wanted a reminder of the supported targets and variables, you would have to read through the file. Now, the list option will allow you to quickly query a list of them. It also supports the JSON format option if you need programmatic access.Quickly get a list of the targets available in your Bake configuration.docker buildx bake --list targetsdocker buildx bake --list type=targets,format=jsonGet a list of variables available for your Bake configuration.docker buildx bake --list variablesdocker buildx bake --list type=variables,format=jsonThese improvements build on a powerful feature set, ensuring Bake is both reliable and future-ready.Get started with Docker BakeReady to simplify your builds?

It’s here to help developers navigate Docker concepts, fix errors, and boost productivity.Docker’s AI Agent boosts developer productivity  We’re thrilled to introduce Docker AI Agent (also known as Project: Agent Gordon) — an embedded, context-aware assistant seamlessly integrated into the Docker suite. Available within Docker Desktop and CLI, this innovative agent delivers real-time, tailored guidance for tasks like container management and Docker-specific troubleshooting — eliminating disruptive context-switching. Docker AI agent can be used for every Docker-related concept and technology, whether you’re getting started, optimizing an existing Dockerfile or Compose file, or understanding Docker technologies in general. By addressing challenges precisely when and where developers encounter them, Docker AI Agent ensures a smoother, more productive workflow. The first iteration of Docker’s AI Agent is now available in Beta for all signed-in usersThe agent is disabled by default, so user activation is required. Read more about Docker’s New AI Agent and how to use it to accelerate developer velocity here. Figure 1: Asking questions to Docker AI Agent in Docker DesktopSimplify build configurations and boost performance with Docker BakeDocker Bake is an orchestration tool that simplifies and speeds up Docker builds. After launching as an experimental feature, we’re thrilled to make it generally available with exciting new enhancements.While Dockerfiles are great for defining build steps, teams often juggle docker build commands with various options and arguments — a tedious and error-prone process. Bake changes the game by introducing a declarative file format that consolidates all options and image dependencies (also known as targets) in one place. No more passing flags to every build command! Plus, Bake’s ability to parallelize and deduplicate work ensures faster and more efficient builds.Key benefits of Docker Bake Abstract complex build configurations into one simple command. Write build configurations in a declarative syntax, with support for custom functions, matrices, and more. Share and maintain build configurations effortlessly across your team. Bake parallelizes multi-image workflows, enabling faster and more efficient builds.Developers can simplify multi-service builds by integrating Bake directly into their Compose files — Bake supports Compose files natively. It enables easy, efficient building of multiple images from a single repository with shared configurations. Plus, it works seamlessly with Docker Build Cloud locally and in CI. With Bake-optimized builds as the foundation, developers can achieve more efficient Docker Build Cloud performance and faster builds.Shift Left with Multi-Node Kubernetes testing in Docker DesktopIn today’s complex production environments, “shifting left”  is more essential than ever. By addressing concerns earlier in the development cycle, teams reduce costs and simplify fixes, leading to more efficient workflows and better outcomes. That’s why we continue to bring new features and enhancements to integrate feedback directly into the developer’s inner loopDocker Desktop now includes Multi-Node Kubernetes integration, enabling easier and extensive testing directly on developers’ machines. While single-node clusters allow for quick verification of app deployments, they fall short when it comes to testing resilience and handling the complex, unpredictable issues of distributed systems. To tackle this, we’re updating our Kubernetes distribution with  — a lightweight, fast, and user-friendly solution for local test and multi-node cluster simulations.Figure 2: Selecting Kubernetes version and cluster number for testingMulti-node cluster support: Replicate a more realistic production environment to test critical features like node affinity, failover, and networking configurations.Multiple Kubernetes versions: Easily test across different Kubernetes versions, which is a must for validating migration paths.
