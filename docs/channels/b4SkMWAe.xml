Our latest Kubernetes Security Report Refresh is coming soon and will unveil a landscape of both peril and progress. As a special sneak preview, let's explore the key findings that are shaping the future of container security. AKS clusters face probing attempts a mere 18 minutes after deployment.Picture this: Your freshly deployed public , barely out of its digital infancy, already under siege. Our research reveals a startling reality where malicious actors operate at breakneck speeds, probing for weaknesses before the digital ink has even dried on your configuration files. This finding serves as a stark reminder: in the world of Kubernetes, security can never be an afterthought. As of October 2024, Kubernetes 1.29 now leads the pack, dethroning last year's 1.24 End of Support versions down to 46% from 58% last year among the managed clusters Here's a reason to celebrate: Kubernetes operators are leveling up their game. We're witnessing a sea change in version management practices, with teams swiftly adopting the latest releases and bidding farewell to outdated versions. This proactive stance isn't just about chasing the newest features - it's a robust defense against lurking vulnerabilities. Severe vulnerabilities in exposed pods slashed by 50% Significant drop in high-privilege pod counts The data paints a picture of leaner, meaner workloads. Security teams are tightening the screws on , resulting in a dramatic reduction of critical flaws in exposed containers. Moreover, the principle of least privilege is gaining traction, with fewer pods wielding unnecessary powers. It's a testament to the growing sophistication of Kubernetes security practices. While these highlights offer a glimpse into the state of Kubernetes security, they're just the tip of the iceberg. To truly navigate the complexities of  in 2025, you need the full picture. While you await the full report (coming soon), check out some of our other Kubernetes content, including: ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How do you scale to zero and from zero?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1irexg4/how_do_you_scale_to_zero_and_from_zero/</link><author>/u/Electronic_Role_5981</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 08:05:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[   submitted by    /u/Electronic_Role_5981 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Set Up a Persistent Volume for MinIO on GKE Free Tier?

The ingress is easy enough since we have the nginx ingress. The problem comes in with the dns records required to point to the defined resource to 127.0.0.1 in the /etc/hosts file. Since we have quite few services that need to hosted in k8s, it'll really suck to have the devs to add a bunch of records to the hosts fileBasically I want something like a wild card record that always returns 127.0.0.1 outside the cluster. So they can pick whatever name they want and always have that delivered to the ingress.Am I doing this wrong? Is there some other way that I should be approaching this problem?

Among these are Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers, introduced in Kubernetes version 1.27. This feature allows for adjusting the CPU and memory resources of running pods without  them, helping to minimize downtime and optimize resource usage. This blog post explores how this feature works, its practical applications, limitations, and cloud provider support. Understanding this functionality is vital for effectively managing containerized workloads and maintaining system reliability.What Is In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling?Traditionally, modifying the resource allocation for a Kubernetes pod required a restart, potentially disrupting applications and causing downtime. In-place scaling changes this by enabling real-time CPU and memory adjustments while the pod continues running. This is particularly useful for workloads with a very low tolerance for pod evictions.What’s behind the feature gate?The new  spec element allows you to specify how a pod reacts to a patch command that changes its resource requests, enabling changing resource requests without rescheduling the pod.The result of the change attempt is communicated as part of the pods’ status in a field called   (for more information on the new fields, check out the Kubernetes API documentation.)Additionally, this feature introduces the  in the spec element for containers, allowing fine-grained control over resizing behavior and allowing the developer to choose if CPU change or Memory change should lead to rescheduling the pod.Dynamic Scaling: Modify CPU and memory allocations while pods run.No Restarts: Avoid downtime caused by pod restarts.Granular Control: Enable precise resource tuning for better efficiency.The InPlacePodVerticalScaling feature integrates seamlessly into Kubernetes to provide a more dynamic approach to resource allocation. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it operates: Activating the InPlacePodVerticalScaling feature gate in your cluster configuration is required to enable this functionality. This allows the kubelet on each node to detect and process resource updates dynamically.Dynamic Resource Updates via Kube API: With the feature enabled, the kubelet directly applies resource changes to running pods without requiring restarts. Supported container runtimes (e.g., containerd v1.6.9 or later) ensure these updates are applied efficiently. If constraints like insufficient free memory or CPU prevent the changes, the pod follows the regular flow: it is recreated and rescheduled. The  field dictates how CPU and memory adjustments are handled. For instance, you can set  for live updates without restarts or  to force a restart when a specific resource is modified.Limitations and ConsiderationsWhile In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling offers significant benefits, it has limitations:1. Cloud Provider SupportAWS: Not supported by Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) as there is no way to activate the needed feature gate.GCP: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) supports this feature as an alpha capability, starting with Kubernetes version 1.27. It must be enabled during cluster creation and requires disabling auto-repair and auto-upgrade. See the GKE alpha clusters documentation.Several Kubernetes policies and mechanisms govern resource scaling. These include:Resource quotas limit the total CPU and memory usage for a namespace. If an InPlacePodVerticalScaling operation exceeds these limits, the scaling request will fail. For example:apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "10"
    requests.memory: "32Gi"
Limit ranges enforce minimum and maximum resource constraints for individual pods or containers within a namespace. The pod will be denied the resource adjustment if a scaling operation exceeds these bounds. Example configuration:apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: limits
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  limits:
  - type: Container
    max:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: "4Gi"
    min:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "128Mi"
Admission controllers, such as Pod Security Admission or custom webhook controllers, can deny scaling operations if they conflict with security or operational policies. For example, a controller may restrict pods from exceeding certain CPU limits.Not all applications can dynamically consume additional resources or adjust to reduced allocations. Examples include:Thread Pool Bound applications, like Gunicorn or Unicorn, rely on predefined worker counts.Memory-Bound Applications: Applications like Java with fixed Xmx parameters.In cases where the HPA is based on the resource being patched, this can cause an erratic horizontal scaling behavior. For example:HPA scaling behavior is based on CPU average utilizationA pod is changing from 1 core to 2 cores; this can cause a scale-down in pods and affect the bottom-line performance of the application.A pod changes from 2 cores to 1; this can cause a scale-up in pods, creating a waste of resources or potential downstream pressure due to the additional and unexpected pods created. Dynamically allocate resources during training and inference phases. Combine Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling for efficient surge handling. Reduce waste by allocating the right amount of resources to each pod in real-time. Some applications require significantly higher CPU and memory resources during startup compared to their runtime needs. Google’s example, Startup CPU Boost, demonstrates how dynamic resource scaling can address such scenarios effectively.1. Enable the Feature GateAdd the following configuration to enable the InPlacePodVerticalScaling feature:apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    feature-gates: InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true
controllerManager:
  extraArgs:
    feature-gates: InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true
scheduler:
  extraArgs:
    feature-gates: InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true
For GKE, create a cluster with alpha features enabled:gcloud container clusters create poc \
    --enable-kubernetes-alpha \
    --no-enable-autorepair \
    --no-enable-autoupgrade
Define a deployment with initial CPU and memory requests and limits:apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
        resizePolicy:
        - resourceName: cpu
          restartPolicy: NotRequired
        - resourceName: memory
          restartPolicy: NotRequired
Once deployed, you can check the cpu.weight, cpu.max, memory.max, memory.min from within the container to see the initial values that the container starts with.kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.weight

kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max

kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.min

kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max 
Adjust resource allocations for a running pod dynamically:kubectl patch pod $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -p '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"nginx","resources":{"requests":{"cpu":"750m"}}}]}}'
Confirm updated resource settings:kubectl describe pod -l app=app
Additionally, you can connect to the container and see the change in cpu.weight, cpu.max, memory.max, memory.min from within the container.kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.weight

kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max

kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.min

kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=app -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max
In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling is a powerful tool for managing dynamic workloads in Kubernetes, reducing downtime, and optimizing resource usage. While its adoption depends on cloud provider support and application compatibility, this feature offers significant efficiency and cost-saving benefits. As Kubernetes evolves, such features will become essential for effective container orchestration.While Google’s Kube Startup CPU Boost example is just a specific use case scenario, ScaleOps provides an all in one resource management solution to address all needed scenarios related to Kubernetes resource management.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>rke2 and DNS</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iqdela/rke2_and_dns/</link><author>/u/Affectionate_Horse86</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 22:35:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm going crazy trying to get coredns to talk to my DNS server for names in my domain (I'm using a pihole server that is updated by terraform for VM addresses and by external-dns for k8s services)I'm using lablabs ansible role, but a pure rke2 answer is fine, I can figure out the rest.

I would say I’m pretty good at picking up new stuff and already have lots of knowledge and hands on experience (mostly from doing stuff on my own and reading lots of Oreilly books) for someone like me (age 23). Have a CS background. Doing an internship. I was put into a position where I had to use K8s for everyday work and don’t get me wrong I’m ecstatic about being an intern but already having the opportunity to work with deployments etc. What I did was read The kubernetes book by Nigel Poulton and got myself 3 cheap PCs and bootstrapped myself a K3s cluster and installed Longorn as the storage and Nginx as the ingress controller.Right now I can pretty much do most stuff and have some cool projects running on my cluster.I’m also learning new stuff every day. But where I find myself lacking is Networking. Not just in Kubernetes but also generally. There are two examples of me getting frustrated because of my lacking networking knowledge:I wanted to let a GitHub actions step access my cluster through the tailscale K8s operator which runs on my cluster but failedWas wondering why I can’t see the real IPs of people that are accessing my api which is on a pod on my cluster and got intimidated by stuff like Layer 2 Networking and why you need a load balancer for that etc.Do I really have to be as competent as a network engineer to be a good dev ops engineer / data engineer / cloud engineer or anything in ops?I don’t mind it but I’m struggling to learn Networking and it’s not that I don’t have the basics but I don’t have the advanced knowledge needed yet, so how do I actually get there?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How are you monitoring your cluster?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iq94yg/how_are_you_monitoring_your_cluster/</link><author>/u/psavva</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 19:28:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a 3 node bare metal cluster and installed Kube Prometheus Stack helm chart.I'm having a very hard time getting the service monitors working correctly.

I’ve deployed rke2 and i’ve got several questions. Main Question) So i’m trying to install rancher UI on it. When you go to install with helm it asks for a “hostname” and the hostname should be the name of your load balancer…i enabled the load balancer of rke2 but I have no clue how to operate with it…how do I change the configuration to point to rancher? The instructions aren’t very clear on the rke2 site on how to use it other than setting the enable-loadbalancer flag. 2) During my debugging, i ran the command “kubectl get pods -A -o wide. I have a server node and an agent node. In the column of IP it showed the two IPs of the sever and agent. What was odd was that it showed pods running that were running on the agent node that shouldn’t have been running since I stopped the agent service on the agent node and I ran the kill all script. So how in the world can the containers supposedly running on the agent node…actually be running.3) I had some problems with ports not opened initially. Forgot to apply the reload command to make sure the ports were open. I then ran systemctl restart rke2-server on the sever and then systemctl restart rke2-agent on the agent and it was still broken. I finally after 30 min of thinking that wasn’t the problem completely resetting the services by running the killall scripts on both of them before it works…so why in the world won’t k8s actually respect systemctl and restart properly without literally shutting everything down. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Career transition in to Kubernetes</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iq1ka1/career_transition_in_to_kubernetes/</link><author>/u/Similar-Secretary-86</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:41:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["I've spent the last six months working with Docker and Kubernetes to deploy my application on Kubernetes, and I've successfully achieved that.

completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree
cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional
complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go
over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.
This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,
building four new subsystems.One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,
which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the Node
object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the
cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information,
like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the
Node, Region and Instance type information.Chicken and egg problem sequence diagramThis new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet
was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved
to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem
during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the
controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,
standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using
 (more on this below)Examples of the dependency problemAs noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be
unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few
concrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might
occur.These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource
(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods
rely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it
will schedule properly.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taintAs noted in the Kubernetes documentation, when the kubelet is started with the command line
flag --cloud-provider=external, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint
named node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized added. Because the cloud-controller-manager
is responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a
cloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a 
or , may not be able to schedule.If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the
control plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized no schedule taint. It also means that this taint
will not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no
schedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface
controllers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taintThe next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is
waiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not
tolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI."The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly."One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container
network has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible
for adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container
network controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some
circumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the
cloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is
not able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container
network controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized and node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taints,
leaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the
specific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the
lifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager
will need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.
Setting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host
networking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as
the host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This
will ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check
your networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the
lifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy
as well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using
these primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple
replicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide
with each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other
controllers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager
controller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.
Use a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the
control plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital
to adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the
physical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run
with a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation
from non-privileged user workloads.
It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running
on the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade
the cloud controller performance.Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud
controller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run
in situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate
the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint, and it should also tolerate any
taints associated with the control plane (for example, node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
or node-role.kubernetes.io/master). It can also be useful to tolerate the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the
node is not yet available for health monitoring.For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,
in a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the
dependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice
for running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network
constraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology
for these scenarios.This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is
important to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please
consult your cloud provider’s documentation.apiVersion: apps/v1

When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that
cluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple
replicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and
redundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance
of a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AWS CloudTrail network activity events for VPC endpoints now generally available</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-cloudtrail-network-activity-events-for-vpc-endpoints-now-generally-available/</link><author>Esra Kayabali</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 23:17:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/">AWS blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I’m happy to announce the general availability of network activity events for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints in AWS CloudTrail. This feature helps you to record and monitor AWS API activity traversing your VPC endpoints, helping you strengthen your data perimeter and implement better detective controls.Previously, it was hard to detect potential data exfiltration attempts and unauthorized access to the resources within your network through VPC endpoints. While VPC endpoint policies could be configured to prevent access from external accounts, there was no built-in mechanism to log denied actions or detect when external credentials were used at a VPC endpoint. This often required you to build custom solutions to inspect and analyze TLS traffic, which could be operationally costly and negate the benefits of encrypted communications.With this new capability, you can now opt in to log all AWS API activity passing through your VPC endpoints. CloudTrail records these events as a new event type called network activity events, which capture both control plane and data plane actions passing through a VPC endpoint.Network activity events in CloudTrail provide several key benefits: – Log all API activity traversing VPC endpoints, regardless of the AWS account initiating the action.External credential detection – Identify when credentials from outside your organization are accessing your VPC endpoint.Data exfiltration prevention – Detect and investigate potential unauthorized data movement attempts.Enhanced security monitoring – Gain insights into all AWS API activity at your VPC endpoints without the need to decrypt TLS traffic.Visibility for regulatory compliance – Improve your ability to meet regulatory requirements by tracking all API activity passing through.To enable network activity events, I go to the AWS CloudTrail console and choose  in the navigation pane. I choose  to create a new one. I enter a name in the  field and choose an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store the event logs. When I create a trail in CloudTrail, I can specify an existing Amazon S3 bucket or create a new bucket to store my trail’s event logs.If you set Log file SSE-KMS encryption to , you have two options: Choose  to create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key or choose  to choose an existing KMS key. If you chose , you need to type an alias in the  field. CloudTrail encrypts your log files with this KMS key and adds the policy for you. The KMS key and Amazon S3 must be in the same AWS Region. For this example, I use an existing KMS key. I enter the alias in the  field and leave the rest as default for this demo. I choose for the next step.In the  step, I choose  under . I choose the event source from the list of AWS services, such as , , , , and secretsmanager.amazonaws.com. I add two network activity event sources for this demo. For the first source, I select  option. For , I can use templates for common use cases or create fine-grained filters for specific scenarios. For example, to log all API activities traversing the VPC endpoint, I can choose the  template. I choose Log network activity access denied events template to log only access denied events. Optionally, I can enter a name in the  field to identify the log selector template, such as Include network activity events for Amazon EC2.As a second example, I choose  to create custom filters on multiple fields, such as  and . I can specify specific VPC endpoint IDs or filter the results to include only the VPC endpoints that match specific criteria. For Advanced event selectors, I choose  from the  dropdown, choose  as , and enter the VPC endpoint ID. When I expand the JSON view, I can see my event selectors as a JSON block. I choose  and after reviewing the selections, I choose .After it’s configured, CloudTrail will begin logging network activity events for my VPC endpoints, helping me analyze and act on this data. To analyze AWS CloudTrail network activity events, you can use the CloudTrail console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDK to retrieve relevant logs. You can also use CloudTrail Lake to capture, store and analyze your network activity events. If you are using Trails, you can use Amazon Athena to query and filter these events based on speciﬁc criteria. Regular analysis of these events can help you maintain security, comply with regulations, and optimize your network infrastructure in AWS.CloudTrail network activity events for VPC endpoint logging provide you with a powerful tool to enhance your security posture, detect potential threats, and gain deeper insights into your VPC network traffic. This feature addresses your critical needs for comprehensive visibility and control over your AWS environments.Network activity events for VPC endpoints are available in all commercial AWS Regions.— Esra]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Terraform Architecture Explained , Terraform Core, State, and Plugins: How Terraform Works Under…</title><link>https://blog.devops.dev/terraform-architecture-explained-terraform-core-state-and-plugins-how-terraform-works-under-a19e4d4dbb09?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4</link><author>Kuseh Simon Wewoliamo</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:51:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.devops.dev/?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4">Devops.dev blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Terraform Architecture Explained , Terraform Core, State, and Plugins: How Terraform Works Under the Hood.1. Introduction 2. Terraform Architecture4. Terraform Best Practices6. ReferencesInfrastructure as Code (IaC), is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure by writing code instead of the manual processes , “ClickOps”. IaC can be described as a mindset where you treat all aspects of operations (servers, databases, networks) as software. When you define your infrastructure using code , it enables you to automate and use all the best practices of software development. IaC eliminates human errors , speeds up infrastructure deployments and ensures infrastructure is version-controlled, just like software code.Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp and the most popular and widely used IaC tool used by DevOps, SREs and cloud architects. Terraform is widely used because of it’s declarative syntax, platform agnostic and its simplicity. Understanding how terraform works behind the hood will go along way to help you in write better terraform code.In this article, we will explore Terraform architecture, its core components, and how it orchestrates infrastructure provisioning efficiently.2. Terraform ArchitectureTerraform follows a standard architecture to fulfill the necessary IaC tasks. Terraform architecture mainly consists of the following components: 1 Terraform core 2 Plugins (Providers and Provisioners) Terraform core is the engine/brain behind how terraform works. It is responsible for reading configurations files , building the dependency graphs from resources and data sources, managing state and applying changes. Terraform Core does not directly interact with cloud providers but communicates with plugins via remote procedure calls (RPCs) and the plugins in turn communicates with their corresponding platforms via HTTPs.Plugins (Providers and Provisioners)Terraform ability is enhance by plugins, which enable terraform to interact with cloud services and configure resources dynamically. Plugins acts as connectors or the glue between terraform and external APIs such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker etc. Each plugin is written in the Go programming language and implements a specific interface. Terraform core knows how to install and execute plugins. Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or commands on a resource after it has been created or modified.State is one of the most important core components of Terraform. Terraform state is a record about all the infrastructure and resources it created. It is a costumed JSON file that terraform uses to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures. By default, state is stored in a local file named “terraform.tfstate”. You can read more about terraform state here There are two ways to manage state: Local State refers to the default way by which Terraform stores state files (terraform.tfstate). It is suitable for small-scale projects or development environments and single person managing Terraform.Remote State refers to storing the Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) in a remote backend rather than locally on your machine. This enables collaboration, prevents state loss, and supports features like state locking and versioning. Some common remote backends include AWS S3,Terraform Cloud, Azure Blob Storage etc. More on Remote StateTerraform follows a structured execution flow to provision, update, and manage infrastructure. This process ensures that infrastructure is deployed in a controlled and predictable manner. Terraform workflow consist of mainly three steps: The first step is to write your terraform configuration just like any other code using any editor of your choice. This is the step where you review your configurations. Terraform plan will define the infrastructure to be created, modified, or destroyed depending on the current configuration and infrastructure. The final step in the workflow is Apply, where you are ready to provision real infrastructure. Once you approve of the changes ,terraform will go ahead perform the desired actions as defined execution.4. Terraform Best Practices1. You should never edit the Terraform state files by hand or write code that reads them directly. If for some reason you need to manipulate the state file which should be a relatively rare occurrence, use the terraform import or terraform state commands.2. It’s a good practice to store your work in a version controlled repository even when you’re just operating as an individual.3. When working as a team, it’s important to delegate ownership of infrastructure across these teams and empower them to work in parallel without conflicts.4. Never Store your state file in a version controlled repository.5. Always use state locking on your state files to prevent data loss, conflicts and state file corruption.6. Integrate Terraform to your CI/CD pipelines to make your DevOps pipeline efficient.Well well, we have come to the end of this deep dive into terraform Architecture.

Think of an API like a waiter in a restaurant — customers (the client application) don’t need to know how the kitchen (the server) prepares their food; they need to know how to place their order through the waiter (the API).I designed and developed an e-commerce web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end,  for the back end, and  for the database. I will use this as an example to explain the core concepts of APIs.E-commerce Web Application API Flow Chart:To check the complete source code:APIs in the E-Commerce ApplicationThis E-Commerce application consists of the following API endpoints:1. Authentication API (auth_routes): /api/auth/login (POST) → Authenticates users and starts a session.: /api/auth/logout (POST) → Clears session and logs out users.2. Product API (product_routes): /api/products (GET) → Returns a list of products.: /api/products/<int:product_id> (GET) → Fetches details of a specific product.3. Cart API (cart_routes): /api/cart (GET) → Returns the current user's cart.: /api/cart (POST) → Adds a product to the cart.: /api/cart/<int:item_id> (DELETE) → Removes an item from the cart.4. Order API (order_routes): /api/orders (POST) → Places an order with the items in the cart.: /api/orders/<int:order_id> (GET) → Fetches details of a specific order.: /api/health (GET) → Provides API uptime, session data, and frontend path.: /<path:filename> (GET) → Serves frontend files.: / (GET) → Serves index.html or API running message.: Handles missing resources.500 Internal Server Error: Handles unexpected issues.: Handles invalid requests.An API consists of several key components that work together:These are the URLs where the  can be accessed. Similar to a , each endpoint serves a specific purpose. For example,📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/products → Retrieves a list of available products.📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/cart → Fetches the current user's shopping cart details.📌 https://api.ecommerce.com/orders → Handles order-related operations.These actions can be performed on the allowed endpoints. They’re like verbs telling the API what to do with the data. → Read data (View products, orders, cart items). → Create new data (Add product, register user, place order). → Update existing data (Update profile, modify cart quantity). → Remove data (Delete cart item, cancel order). Additional data is sent to fine-tune the API request, such as specifying which page of results you want to see.: Parameters are extra details added to an API request to filter or refine the results.Fetch  of products:GET /api/products?category=laptopsSecurity measures ensure that only authorized users can access the API.: Ensures that only authorized users can access the API.When a user logs in, the API gives a :{  "message": "Login successful",  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUz..."}To add a product to the cart, the request must include this :POST /api/cart/addAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUz... Prevents unauthorized access and protects user data. The structure of the data returned by the API, commonly in formats like JSON or XML.: The structure of the data sent back by the API. (because it’s easy to read and use).{  "id": 1,  "price": 799.99,} Frontend uses this data to display products to users.APIs are classified according to their usage patterns and architectures.API Types According to Purposes of Use🔹  — Used within a company, hidden from public access. Helps teams share data securely.🔹  — Available to everyone, can be free or paid. Example: Google Maps API.🔹  — Used between business partners for secure data exchange. Example: E-commerce & shipping company integration.🔹  — Combines multiple APIs into one request for efficiency. Example: Fetching account balance + transaction history in one call.API Types According to Architectural Structure:1. Web APIs (HTTP/HTTPS APIs)These are the most common APIs, operating over the internet using HTTP protocols. They come in several varieties:1.1. REST (Representational State Transfer):The most popular type of web API today. REST APIs follow these principles:Stateless: Each request contains all the information neededResource-based: Everything is treated as a resource with a unique URLUses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)Supports multiple data formats (usually JSON)Example REST API Request in an E-Commerce Web Application:This request fetches all available products from the online store.✅ Request (Client → Server)GET /api/products HTTP/1.1Host: api.ecommerce.comAuthorization: Bearer <User_Token>Content-Type: application/json✅ Response (Server → Client)[    {"id": 1, "name": "iPhone 15", "price": 999.99, "stock": 20},    {"id": 2, "name": "Samsung Galaxy S24", "price": 899.99, "stock": 15}]catalog.html Fetches and Displays Products1️⃣ User Visits catalog.htmlThe user opens the  page in their browser (http://52.90.222.178:5000/catalog.html).The browser  to fetch product data.2️⃣ Frontend (JavaScript) Sends an API RequestJavaScript code in catalog.html makes a GET request to the  /api/products.3️⃣ Backend API (GET /api/products) Fetches DataThe get_all_products() function runs when the frontend calls /api/products.4️⃣ Database Retrieves Product InformationThe backend queries the  in the databaseExample database response:[    {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "price": 799.99},    {"id": 2, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 499.99}]5️⃣ Frontend Renders Product Data in catalog.htmlThe JavaScript loops through the  and dynamically  to display products.<div class="product-card">  <h3>Laptop</h3>  <button onclick="addToCart(1)">Add to Cart</button><div class="product-card">  <p>Price: $499.99</p>  <button onclick="addToCart(2)">Add to Cart</button></div>1.2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):SOAP has strict rules and rigid messaging standards that can make it more secure than protocols such as REST. These types of APIs are frequently used in enterprise applications, particularly for payment processing and customer management, as they are highly safe in nature.A more rigid, protocol-specific API style used in enterprise environments:Highly structured messaging<soap:Envelope>  <soap:Header>    <Authorization>Bearer abc123</Authorization>  </soap:Header>    <GetUser>    </GetUser></soap:Envelope>A modern API query language that gives clients more control:Clients specify precisely what data they needSingle endpoint for all requestsReduces over-fetching and under-fetching of dataFacebook initially developed GraphQL to simplify endpoint management for REST-based APIs. Instead of maintaining multiple endpoints with small amounts of disjointed data, GraphQL provides a single endpoint that inputs complex queries and outputs only as much information as is needed for the query.query {  user(id: "123") {    email      title  }These are programming interfaces provided by software libraries or frameworks:Used directly in your codeNo network requests are neededUsually specific to a programming languageExample using a Python library API:import pandas as pd# Using pandas API to read a CSV filedf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')These allow applications to interact with the operating system:Example using Python’s OS API:import os# Using OS API to create a directoryos.mkdir('new_folder')The foundation of web APIs, using well-defined methods and status codes:PUT: Update existing dataPATCH: Partially update data2xx: Success (e.g., 200 OK)Enables real-time, two-way communication:Ideal for chat apps and live updatesExample WebSocket connection:const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/chat');ws.onmessage = (event) => {    console.log('Received:', event.data);};gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a  framework for inter-service communication in microservices architecture. Unlike REST APIs that use , gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), making it faster and more efficient.Google’s high-performance RPC framework:Excellent for microservicesExample Protocol Buffer definition:📌 How gRPC Works in a Web ApplicationIn an , gRPC can be used for fast communication between microservices.A  must fetch a  from the backend .1️⃣ Defining gRPC Service (product.proto)gRPC services use Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) to define API contracts.GetAllProducts(): Returns a list of products.GetProductById(): Fetches a single product by ID.Product: Defines the product structure.2️⃣ Implementing gRPC Server (product_server.py)The gRPC server implements the service logic.Implements ProductService methods (GetAllProducts, GetProductById).3️⃣ Implementing gRPC Client (product_client.py)The client  to fetch data.Calls GetAllProducts() to fetch all products.Calls GetProductById() to fetch a single product.4️⃣ Running gRPC Server & Client# 1.

GET: Used to retrieve dataIt is a request used to retrieve data. Never used to delete, update or insert data.Product API in E-Commerce Web Applicationcurl -X GET http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/products[   {"id": 1, "name": "iPhone 15", "price": 999.99},   {"id": 2, "name": "Samsung Galaxy S24", "price": 899.99}]If the API returns JSON, you can format the response using curl -X GET http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/products | jqDebugging & TroubleshootingIf you’re not getting the expected response, check:Is the Flask server running?curl -X GET http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/healthHow the /api/health Endpoint Works in FlaskThe endpoint is a  that provides the current status of the application, including . It helps in monitoring the system and ensuring that the API is .I have configured this /api/health endpoint in my E-Commerce Web Application.@app.route("/api/health", methods=["GET"])def health_check():    uptime = time.time() - start_time    return jsonify({        "uptime": f"{uptime:.2f} seconds",        "session_active": "username" in session    }), 2002. POST: Creates new resourcesThe  method is a request used to insert data. Posted data type — JSON.✅ Authentication EndpointsThis is handled in auth_routes.py, prefixed with /api/auth. → The frontend sends a request to the backend API (POST /api/auth/login). This is handled in auth_routes.py, prefixed with /api/auth.User sends a  with username & password.If credentials are valid:The user session is stored.API returns a success message.3. If credentials are invalid:API returns 3. PUT : Updates existing resourcesPUT method is used to create or update (replace) a resource. Useful for syncing data.Ex: We can add a “Change Password” feature for an existing user using a PUT /api/auth/change-password API endpoint.Steps to Implement “Change Password” APIPUT request with their old and new password.curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/auth/change-password      -H "Content-Type: app     -d '{"old_password": "currentPass123", "new_password": "newPass456"}'2. API verifies the old password:If incorrect, return an error (401 Unauthorized).3. If correct, update the password in the database.4. Save the new password (after hashing it for security).5. Return a success message.{"message": "Password changed successfully"}In an e-commerce application like yours, a PUT method would typically be used in: → PUT /api/auth/update-profileUpdating Product Information (Admin) → PUT /api/products/<product_id> → PUT /api/cart/<cart_id> → PUT /api/orders/<order_id>4. DELETE: Removes resourcesThe DELETE method deletes the specified resource./api/cart API to Remove a Product from the Cart1️⃣ Endpoint Definition (Flask API):@cart_bp.route('/cart', methods=['DELETE'])def remove_from_cart():    Remove a product from the cart for the logged-in user.    Expects JSON payload: { product_id }.    """        user_id = session.get('user_id')            return jsonify({"message": "User not authenticated"}), 401        product_id = data.get('product_id')            return jsonify({"message": "'product_id' is required"}), 400        connection = get_db_connection()        cursor = connection.cursor()        delete_query = "DELETE FROM cart_items WHERE user_id = %s AND product_id = %s"        cursor.execute(delete_query, (user_id, product_id))            return jsonify({"message": "Product not found in cart"}), 404        return jsonify({"message": "Product removed from cart successfully"}), 200        return jsonify({"message": "Failed to remove product from cart", "error": str(e)}), 500        close_db_connection(connection)User sends a DELETE request with the product_id they want to remove.API verifies if the user is logged in (checks session['user_id']). (if missing, returns 400 Bad Request). to remove the product from the cart_items table.If the product does not exist, it returns 404 Not Found., it commits the transaction and returns a success message (200 OK).Handles database errors and ensures the connection is closed.3️⃣ Example API Request & Response:Now User wanted to delete iPhone 15 Pro from the cart:Click the  button under “iPhone 15 Pro”.The item should disappear, and the cart total should update.Run this command in the terminal:curl -X DELETE http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/cart      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -H "Cookie: session=00068d4c-4b41-4e3e-8884-7389cabbb9b0"     -d '{"product_id": 4}'{    "message": "Product removed from cart successfully"After deletion of that item:5. PATCH: Partially updates resourcesPATCH method is to request used to update data. Only passed data will be updated. You don’t need to provide all the data set.The  method is used to  a resource. Instead of sending the entire data set, we only send the fields that need to be updated.Use Case: Updating a User’s Profile (PATCH /api/auth/update-profile)Imagine a user wants to update  or  without changing their username.1️⃣ PATCH Endpoint: PATCH /api/auth/update-profile2️⃣ Sending a PATCH RequestIf the user wants to update curl -X PATCH http://52.90.222.178:5000/api/auth/update-profile \     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \     -H "Cookie: session=your_valid_session_id" \     -d '{"email": "newemail@example.com"}'🔹 Only the  field will be updated.✅ {    "message": "Profile updated successfully"❌ If no fields are provided:{    "message": "No valid fields provided for update"{    "message": "User not authenticated"4️⃣ Why Use PATCH Instead of PUT?Conclusion: Understanding APIs, Endpoints, and Methods in Web DevelopmentAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different systems to  with each other. They define how requests and responses are exchanged between a client (browser, app) and a server.An  acts as a bridge between two applications, enabling data exchange.Example: A shopping website uses an API to fetch product details from a database.An  is a URL that clients use to request or send data.Example: GET /api/products retrieves all products. → Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage data. → Lets clients request specific data fields, reducing unnecessary data transfer. → Uses XML messaging, mainly in enterprise applications. → Maintains a continuous connection for real-time updates (e.g., live chat).Use  (JWT, API Keys, OAuth) to restrict access.Protect sensitive data with .Implement  to prevent abuse.APIs are the backbone of modern applications, enabling data sharing between different services.

Ensuring its availability and data persistence is crucial for uninterrupted CI/CD pipelines. In this guide, we’ll walk through deploying Jenkins in Kubernetes, configuring its resources, and setting up persistent storage to safeguard critical data.In this configuration, we have a Deployment resource for deploying Jenkins in Kubernetes, along with associated PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), PersistentVolume (PV), Service, and StorageClass resources. Let’s break down each partkind: StorageClassapiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1  name: localstorageprovisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisionervolumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumerThis StorageClass resource defines storage provisioning and management policies.Since provisioner is set to kubernetes.io/no-provisioner, it indicates that no dynamic provisioning is performed by Kubernetes.volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer ensures that volume binding waits for the first Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim to be created.PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Resource:apiVersion: v1kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  name: pvc-jenkinsspec:  storageClassName: localstorage  accessModes:  resources:      storage: 2GiThis PVC resource requests storage from a PersistentVolume using the localstorage StorageClass.It requests 2Gi of storage with access mode ReadWriteOnce, meaning it can be mounted as read-write by a single node.PersistentVolume (PV) Resource:apiVersion: v1kind: PersistentVolume  name: pv-jenkins    type: local  claimRef:    namespace: jenkins    storage: 3Gi    - ReadWriteOnce    path: /mnt  storageClassName: localstorageThis PV resource represents the actual storage volume available for use by the PVC.It is bound to the PVC pvc-jenkins within the jenkins namespace.The PV has a capacity of 3Gi and is accessible in ReadWriteOnce mode.The storage is provided by a hostPath /mnt on the host machine, with storage class localstorage.apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: jenkins-deployment    name: jenkinsspec:    matchLabels:  replicas: 1    metadata:      labels:    spec:        - name: deployment-jenkins          image: jenkins/jenkins:lts          resources:              memory: "0.5Gi"            requests:              cpu: "125m"            - name: http-port            - name: jnlp-port          livenessProbe:              path: "/login"            initialDelaySeconds: 60            timeoutSeconds: 5          readinessProbe:              path: "/login"            initialDelaySeconds: 60            timeoutSeconds: 5          volumeMounts:              mountPath: /var/jenkins_home        - name: data-jenkins            claimName: pvc-jenkins        runAsUser: 0        fsGroup: 0This Deployment resource defines how Jenkins is deployed.It specifies a single replica (replicas: 1) of the Jenkins container.The container is based on the jenkins/jenkins:lts image.Resource limits and requests for CPU and memory are set to ensure resource allocation.Ports 8080 and 50000 are exposed for HTTP and JNLP respectively.Liveness and readiness probes are configured to check the health of the container.The Jenkins home directory (/var/jenkins_home) is mounted to a PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc-jenkins) named data-jenkins.SecurityContext ensures that Jenkins runs with the appropriate user and group permissions. securityContext:        runAsUser: 0        fsGroup: 0When you deploy this deployment instance in kubernetes cluster, make sure the user have the right privileges to read and write the host volume For this demo purpose, I am using the root user to do this task, but this is not encouraged to do in real environment.apiVersion: v1kind: Service  name: jenkins-servicespec:    app: jenkins-pod  ports:      port: 8080      nodePort: 32000This Service resource exposes the Jenkins deployment internally within the jenkins namespace.It selects pods with the label app: jenkins-pod.The service type is NodePort, making the service accessible from outside the cluster on each node's IP at a static port (nodePort: 32000).Port 8080 is mapped to the targetPort 8080 where Jenkins is listening.Once you execute all the manifiest file in kubernetes cluster.Check the host volume path ls -al /mntExecute the below command to see the whether the same files are present in the jenkins containerkubectl exec -it POD_NAME /bin/bash -n jenkinsls -al /var/jenkins_homeThis configuration sets up Jenkins deployment in Kubernetes with persistence using a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim. It ensures that Jenkins data stored in /var/jenkins_home persists across container restarts and pod rescheduling. Additionally, the Service resource exposes Jenkins for external access within the Kubernetes cluster.For now, that’s it guys, If you like this article don’t forget to give a clap. 👏]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Build and Deploy a Simple Frontend App with Python Backend</title><link>https://blog.devops.dev/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-simple-frontend-app-with-python-backend-108b505be2be?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4</link><author>krth1k</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:50:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.devops.dev/?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4">Devops.dev blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building a full-stack web application might seem daunting, especially if you’re primarily a backend developer.

However, this shared structure introduces complexities in managing access and authorization. A robust authorization strategy is essential to ensure that users can only access resources belonging to their tenant without compromising scalability or performance.This article explores the best practices and technical solutions that we adopt at Xinthe, for implementing efficient authorization mechanisms in multi-tenant systems, with a focus on nested resource structures, such as companies, clients, projects, and tasks. After having read this entire article, you will be armed with actionable insights to build secure, efficient, and future-proof authorization strategies for multi-tenant applications.Understanding Multi-Tenant Database AuthorizationDefinition Of Multi-TenancyMulti-tenancy refers to an architectural pattern where a single instance of a software application and its database serves multiple tenants (e.g., companies, organizations, or users). Each tenant’s data remains logically isolated, ensuring that no tenant can access another’s data, while sharing underlying resources for efficiency.Key Multi-Tenancy Models:Each tenant has a dedicated database or schema.Offers strong isolation and security.Higher costs and maintenance complexity due to multiple instances.Multiple tenants share the same database.Logical separation is maintained through identifiers (e.g., tenant_id or company_id).Cost-effective and scalable but requires robust authorization mechanisms.Challenges Of AuthorizationImplementing authorization in multi-tenant systems is a non-trivial task, especially as the scale and complexity of resources grow. Common challenges include -Cross-Tenant Data Leakage:Risk: Improper queries or configurations can expose data to unauthorized tenants.Example: A user from Company A inadvertently accessing tasks belonging to Company B due to a missing or incorrect WHERE clause.Deeply nested resource structures often require joins across multiple tables.Queries with extensive joins can degrade performance as data volume increases.Scalability & Maintainability:The need to balance fast access controls with a maintainable schema.Adding new authorization rules or resource types without overhauling the system.Data Localization & Compliance:For multi-tenant systems spanning regions, ensuring that tenant data complies with regulations like GDPR can complicate authorization logic.Importance Of Nested Resource StructuresIn many applications, resources are interconnected in a hierarchical fashion. Consider the following nested structure -Company → Client → Project → TaskA  has multiple .Each  manages several .Each  contains multiple .Why Nested Structures Matter:Access Control Complexity: Permissions must flow through the hierarchy (e.g., a user’s access to a task must be verified against their company). Hierarchical access often necessitates multiple joins, impacting query efficiency. Hierarchical structures reflect real-world use cases like SaaS platforms, where users must operate within their organization’s boundaries.A user from Company A should only edit tasks within their projects. Authorization must ensure that the task → project → client → company linkage is maintained without exposing data from Company B.Comparing Authorization ApproachesWhen implementing authorization in a multi-tenant database, there are three common strategies to choose from: the , the , and Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables. Each comes with its own set of benefits and trade-offs. Let’s break them down -1. Flat Model (Adding Tenant IDs)In this approach, a tenant_id or company_id is added to every resource table (e.g., tasks, projects, clients), enabling direct filtering for authorization. Queries can directly filter by tenant_id without traversing the hierarchy.SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id AND id = :task_id; Reduces query complexity by avoiding multiple table joins to enforce access. Straightforward implementation makes it easy to debug and maintain. tenant_id is replicated across multiple tables, introducing redundancy. Adding tenant_id and other metadata can lead to bloated schemas, especially as the number of attributes grows. Schema updates (e.g., adding new relationships) might require extensive changes across multiple tables.Ideal for systems where performance is critical and the schema is relatively stable, such as SaaS platforms with many small tenants.2. Hierarchical Model (Enforcing Relationships)In this approach, the relationships between resources (e.g., task → project → client → company) are strictly enforced through foreign keys. Authorization is achieved by traversing the hierarchy. Avoids redundant fields by relying on inherent relationships.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id),    ...    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    client_id INT REFERENCES clients(id),    ...    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    company_id INT REFERENCES companies(id),    ... Reduces duplication of metadata like tenant_id.Relationship-Centric Queries: Makes it easier to enforce hierarchical constraints and maintain referential integrity. Queries require multiple joins to verify access, which can impact performance.SELECT t.*FROM tasks tJOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.idJOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.idWHERE c.company_id = :tenant_id AND t.id = :task_id; Deep hierarchies with large datasets can significantly increase query execution time. As the hierarchy grows, maintaining performance becomes challenging.Suitable for applications where maintaining strict relationships between resources is essential, such as ERP systems or large enterprise applications.3. Tenant-Specific Databases Or TablesThis approach creates separate databases or tables for each tenant, isolating their data entirely. Each tenant’s data can be managed independently, making it easier to scale horizontally by distributing databases across servers. Ensures complete data isolation, reducing the risk of cross-tenant data leakage. Simplifies adherence to regulations like GDPR by enabling tenant-specific backups, retention policies, and deletions. Managing multiple databases or schemas requires sophisticated deployment and CI/CD pipelines. Schema updates need to be applied consistently across all tenant databases. For tenants with small datasets, the resource consumption of separate databases might be inefficient.Best for large organizations with high regulatory or security requirements, or when dealing with tenants that require dedicated resources (e.g., enterprise customers).Summary Table — Comparing ApproachesCriteria For Choosing An Authorization ModelSelecting the right authorization model for a multi-tenant database is critical for ensuring scalability, performance, and compliance. The decision hinges on a combination of technical, regulatory, and operational factors. Below are the primary criteria to consider -The level of traffic and query complexity your application handles directly impacts the choice of an authorization model.High-Traffic Applications:Benefit from simpler and faster queries, such as those enabled by the .SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id AND id = :task_id;Minimal joins mean lower query latency, ensuring the system performs well under heavy loads.Suitable for SaaS platforms or e-commerce systems with a high volume of tenant interactions.:Can afford the  with more joins, as performance trade-offs are less significant.Allows for cleaner schema designs and strict relational integrity.Suitable for internal enterprise tools or smaller-scale applications.2. Regulatory RequirementsCompliance with data protection and privacy regulations often dictates how data is stored and accessed.Using Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables simplifies compliance for regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.Tenant isolation reduces the risk of data leakage and ensures tenant-specific data retention and deletion policies.An enterprise customer requires dedicated storage with separate backups and audit logs.A  can still meet compliance needs with appropriate access controls and audit mechanisms.Challenges arise in managing and enforcing tenant-specific data governance policies within shared infrastructure.The ability to handle growth in the number of tenants and data volumes is a critical factor.Planning For Tenant Growth:For a rapidly scaling user base, Tenant-Specific Databases or Tables provide the most flexibility -Each tenant can be distributed across servers to balance load.Tenant databases can be independently scaled based on specific needs.A B2B SaaS platform serving both small businesses and large enterprises can allocate resources dynamically based on tenant size.The  can handle larger datasets more efficiently as indexes on tenant_id make filtering faster.The  may struggle as table sizes grow, requiring optimization for complex joins.Ease of schema management and updates is essential for long-term maintainability.Simplified Schema Updates:The  simplifies schema updates by centralizing data attributes like tenant_id.However, redundant fields may increase the risk of errors during updates.The  enforces relational integrity, ensuring data consistency.Complex queries for nested structures may require more effort to maintain and optimize.Automated CI/CD Pipelines:For Tenant-Specific Databases, CI/CD automation becomes critical to manage schema changes across multiple databases.Tools like Octopus Deploy or Liquibase can help automate schema migrations and ensure consistency.Key Considerations SummaryDesigning Authorization Strategies For Multi-TenancyDesigning robust authorization strategies for multi-tenant systems requires careful consideration of schema design, indexing, and data partitioning to ensure scalability, security, and performance. This section outlines best practices for implementing these strategies effectively.The foundation of a successful multi-tenant authorization system lies in a well-thought-out schema.Add a tenant_id column to all relevant tables (e.g., clients, projects, tasks) for direct tenant filtering.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id));Ensure tenant_id is a mandatory field in all write operations to enforce multi-tenancy constraints.Defining Relationships In Hierarchical Structures:Maintain strict referential integrity between hierarchical entities.Example for hierarchical relationships -CREATE TABLE projects (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id)Flat schema enables quick lookups for tenant-specific data.Hierarchical relationships ensure data consistency and logical separation.2. Indexing Best PracticesIndexes are essential for optimizing queries in multi-tenant systems. However, improper indexing can lead to inefficiencies.Compound Indexes For Tenant-Specific Queries:Use composite indexes combining tenant_id with frequently queried columns.CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_tenant_projectON tasks (tenant_id, project_id, status);This enables efficient filtering and sorting within a tenant’s scope.Balancing Indexing Depth & Query Speed:Avoid over-indexing, which can slow down write operations.Prioritize indexing columns involved in filtering, joining, and sorting operations.Regularly analyze query performance using tools like  in PostgreSQL or  in MySQL.Partitioning improves scalability by dividing data into smaller, more manageable segments, reducing query times for tenant-specific operations.Horizontal Partitioning By Tenants:Partition data within a single database based on tenant_id.CREATE TABLE tasks_1 PARTITION OF tasksFOR VALUES IN (1); -- Partition for tenant_id 1Faster tenant-specific queries as partitions reduce the search space.Simplifies maintenance for large datasets.Database Sharding For High-Scale Systems:Distribute tenant data across multiple databases (shards).Example Sharding Strategy -Use tenant_id % shard_count to assign tenants to shards.Tools like  or  can manage sharding in distributed database systems.Eliminates contention in single-database systems.Enhances fault isolation and scalability.Example Use Case — Applying These StrategiesAn application manages 100,000 tenants, each with thousands of projects and tasks.Add tenant_id to all tables.Use foreign keys to link tasks → projects → clients.Create a compound index on tasks (tenant_id, project_id) for common queries like -SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND project_id = 456;For smaller tenants, use horizontal partitioning -CREATE TABLE tasks_tenant_123 PARTITION OF tasks FOR VALUES IN (123);For larger tenants, shard data across multiple databases to scale.A well-designed schema with tenant_id simplifies multi-tenant data filtering.Proper indexing ensures efficient queries, even at scale.Partitioning and sharding prepare the system for growth, reducing query times and enhancing reliability.This section provides concrete examples of implementing different authorization models for multi-tenant systems, including schemas, queries, and tooling. Each approach demonstrates how to enforce tenant-specific access effectively.1. Flat Model ImplementationThe flat model relies on adding a tenant_id column to all relevant tables, ensuring that queries are scoped to the tenant directly.CREATE TABLE tasks (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id)    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id));: Access tasks for a user’s company -SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND status = 'in_progress';Simplifies authorization logic with direct lookups.Reduces query complexity by avoiding joins.Potential schema bloat with additional tenant_id columns.2. Hierarchical Model ImplementationIn this model, tenant authorization is enforced by traversing relationships between resources (e.g., Company → Client → Project → Task).CREATE TABLE companies (    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    company_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id));    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id));    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    description TEXT,    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id): Check task access by traversing relationships -SELECT t.* FROM tasks tINNER JOIN projects p ON t.project_id = p.idINNER JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.idINNER JOIN companies co ON c.company_id = co.idWHERE co.id = 123 AND t.status = 'in_progress';Maintains normalized relationships.Avoids redundant tenant_id columns.Complex joins increase query costs.Requires optimized indexes to maintain performance.3. Tenant-Specific Database/Table ImplementationFor scenarios requiring strict isolation, separate databases or tables for each tenant can be used.Create a separate database or schema for each tenant -CREATE DATABASE company_123;CREATE TABLE company_123.tasks (    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    status VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);: Access tasks for a specific tenant -USE company_123;SELECT * WHERE status = 'in_progress';: Use CI/CD tools like  to manage multi-tenant databases:Automate schema changes across databases.Track versioning for each tenant’s database.Complete tenant isolation for security and compliance (e.g., GDPR).Simplifies data archival and backup for individual tenants.Deployment complexity increases with the number of tenants.Resource-intensive for systems with many small tenants.Choosing The Right ImplementationUse the flat model for simplicity in high-traffic environments.Use the hierarchical model when data relationships must be preserved and redundancy minimized.Opt for tenant-specific databases for strict isolation and compliance requirements.Each implementation can be tailored based on application needs, tenant size, and regulatory requirements. Balancing performance, scalability, and maintainability is key to successful multi-tenant authorization systems.Security Best Practices For AuthorizationEnsuring robust security in multi-tenant systems is essential to prevent data breaches, maintain compliance, and build user trust. This section outlines key practices for implementing secure and reliable authorization mechanisms.1. Strict Access ControlsImplementing strong access controls ensures that only authorized users can access or modify resources.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):Assign roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User) to users based on their responsibilities.Enforce role-specific permissions at the application and database layers.Example: Use database roles to restrict access to tenant-specific tables.CREATE ROLE company_admin;GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO company_admin;REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES FROM PUBLIC; -- Restrict public access:Enforce tenant-level data segregation directly at the database layer.RLS ensures that queries automatically filter data based on the user’s tenant.PostgreSQL Example For RLS:CREATE POLICY tenant_policyON tasksUSING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::BIGINT);ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;SET app.current_tenant = '123'; -- Simulate tenant contextSELECT * FROM tasks; -- Only tasks with tenant_id = 123 will be visible2. Preventing Cross-Tenant Data LeaksPreventing accidental or intentional cross-tenant data leaks is critical in multi-tenant architectures.Multi-Layer Access Checks:Enforce tenant isolation at both the database and application layers.Validate all queries to ensure they are scoped to the user’s tenant.Always include a tenant_id check in database queries.Use database views or abstractions to simplify tenant-specific filtering.Application-Layer Validation:Add additional validation at the application level as a guardrail.Ensure that APIs restrict data access to the authenticated tenant context.def get_user_tasks(user):    if user.tenant_id != request.tenant_id:        raise PermissionDenied("Cross-tenant access is not allowed.")    return db.query(Tasks).filter(Tasks.tenant_id == user.tenant_id).all()Audit logs are essential for monitoring, compliance, and debugging. They provide visibility into access patterns and help detect unauthorized access attempts.User ID and tenant ID for all queries.Access attempts (successful and failed).Data modification operations (insert, update, delete).Timestamps and IP addresses for requests.SQL Example For Logging Queries:CREATE TABLE audit_logs (    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT,    table_name VARCHAR(255),    executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPINSERT INTO audit_logs (user_id, tenant_id, action, table_name, query)VALUES (123, 456, 'SELECT', 'tasks', 'SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 456');Integrating Logging Tools:Use database triggers to log operations automatically.Combine with external tools like  (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or  for advanced monitoring.CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_task_changes()RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$    INSERT INTO audit_logs (user_id, tenant_id, action, table_name, query)    VALUES (current_user_id(), NEW.tenant_id, TG_OP, TG_TABLE_NAME, current_query());    RETURN NEW;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE TRIGGER audit_task_changesAFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON tasksFOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION log_task_changes();Combine RBAC, RLS, and application-level validation for comprehensive protection.Use multi-layered access checks and robust query scoping to ensure tenant isolation.Maintain detailed audit logs to track access and modifications for accountability and compliance.These practices create a secure foundation for multi-tenant authorization systems, ensuring that each tenant’s data is isolated, protected, and auditable.Designing a robust multi-tenant authorization system involves navigating a set of challenges and trade-offs. Each approach has its own set of complexities that must be carefully managed to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.1. Balancing Performance & FlexibilityChoosing between speed and schema cleanliness can significantly impact your database design and performance.Prioritizing Performance (Flat Model):Direct lookups using a tenant_id column ensure fast query execution.Reduced join complexity leads to quicker response times.: May result in data redundancy (e.g., repeating tenant IDs across multiple tables).SQL Example For Optimized Query:SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE tenant_id = 123 AND status = 'pending';Prioritizing Schema Cleanliness (Hierarchical Model):Using a normalized schema ensures a clean and consistent database structure.: Requires more complex joins and increased query times, especially for deeply nested relationships.Hierarchical Query Example:SELECT tasks.*FROM tasksJOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.idJOIN clients ON projects.client_id = clients.idWHERE clients.tenant_id = 123;Managing tenant-specific setups adds complexity, particularly as the number of tenants grows.Tenant-Specific Databases:Each tenant has its own database, simplifying compliance and data isolation.: Maintaining consistency across databases for schema changes.: Use automation tools like  or  to manage schema migrations across tenants.# Liquibase command to apply migrations to multiple tenant databasesliquibase --url="jdbc:mysql://db_host/tenant1" updateliquibase --url="jdbc:mysql://db_host/tenant2" updateSingle Multi-Tenant Database:Shared schema reduces maintenance but requires more sophisticated query scoping and indexing.: Tracking and isolating tenant data effectively without introducing query overhead.3. Handling Schema Updates In Multi-Tenant DatabasesEnsuring all tenants have consistent schemas while minimizing downtime is one of the most significant challenges in multi-tenant systems.Use versioned migrations to apply incremental updates across all tenants.Maintain backward compatibility to prevent disruptions during updates.CREATE TABLE schema_versions (    tenant_id BIGINT,    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPApply updates to a subset of tenants, validate, and then roll out to the rest.Use feature flags to selectively enable new schema features.Code Example For Rolling Updates:tenants = get_tenant_list()for tenant in tenants:    apply_schema_update(tenant_id=tenant.id)Testing & CI/CD For Multi-Tenant Systems:Test migrations on a staging environment with realistic tenant data before deploying.Use CI/CD tools like  to automate and track updates across tenant databases.Performance Vs. Flexibility:Use a flat model for high-speed queries or hierarchical models for cleaner schemas but expect performance trade-offs.Tenant-specific databases simplify compliance but require robust automation for schema management.Implement version control and rolling updates to ensure seamless schema changes across all tenants.Addressing these challenges with well-defined strategies ensures a scalable and maintainable multi-tenant authorization system, capable of adapting to evolving application needs.Real-world applications of multi-tenant database authorization vary depending on the complexity of the resource structure, performance requirements, and compliance needs. Below are three illustrative scenarios demonstrating how different authorization models can be applied effectively.Scenario 1 — Flat Model For A SaaS CRM AppA SaaS customer relationship management (CRM) application needs to store and manage customer interactions for multiple companies, ensuring users can only access data associated with their organization.: Each company has its own sales team, and users need quick access to customer records and sales data.: Use a flat model by adding tenant_id to every table, such as customers, leads, and sales.CREATE TABLE customers (    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    phone VARCHAR(20),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    customer_id BIGINT,    status VARCHAR(50),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);SELECT * FROM customers Simple queries without joins for tenant-specific data.High performance due to direct lookups.Wider tables due to the inclusion of tenant_id.Potential redundancy if relationships between entities are not properly normalized.Scenario 2 — Hierarchical Model For A Project Management ToolA project management tool with a nested structure: Company → Client → Project → Task. Users need to manage projects while maintaining strict access control based on their organization.: Each company has multiple clients, each with its own projects and tasks. Users must only access tasks related to their company.: Use a hierarchical model to enforce relationships and control access through joins.CREATE TABLE companies (    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    company_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255),    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    project_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    description TEXT,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMPSELECT tasks.*FROM tasksJOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.idJOIN clients ON projects.client_id = clients.idWHERE clients.company_id = 123;Clean, normalized schema without redundant data.Access naturally follows the hierarchy.Complex queries due to multi-level joins.Slower query performance for deep hierarchies.Scenario 3 — Single-Tenant Databases For An Enterprise AppAn enterprise application handles sensitive data, requiring strict data isolation for compliance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations.: Each tenant’s data must be completely isolated to ensure compliance and scalability.: Use a single-tenant database model where each company has its own dedicated database.Database Names:  tenant_1_db  tenant_3_db: Use  to manage database updates across multiple tenants.deploy:  steps:    - name: Update Tenant Databases      script: |        for db in $(list_databases); do          apply_migrations $dbComplete isolation ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.Scalability: Large tenants can have dedicated resources (e.g., separate hardware).Higher operational complexity in managing multiple databases.Requires robust CI/CD pipelines for schema updates.Each use case demonstrates how careful consideration of application requirements, data relationships, and compliance needs can guide the choice of the best authorization model for a multi-tenant database.Efficient, scalable, and secure authorization in multi-tenant databases as we’ve found often at Xinthe, requires a well-thought-out approach tailored to the application’s needs.Authorization in multi-tenant databases isn’t a one-size-fits-all challenge. Developers and database architects must carefully evaluate their application’s structure, expected growth, and regulatory needs to select the most effective approach. Armed with the insights and strategies outlined in this article, you can design multi-tenant database systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient, ensuring both developer productivity and a seamless user experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Docker, Kubernetes, and NATS — The Backbone of Cloud-Native Apps</title><link>https://blog.devops.dev/docker-kubernetes-and-nats-the-backbone-of-cloud-native-apps-af724f41c17d?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4</link><author>Cristhian Ferrufino</author><category>devops</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:48:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.devops.dev/?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4">Devops.dev blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Docker, Kubernetes, and NATS — The Backbone of Cloud-Native AppsWelcome back to the ! In the last article, we explored the world of message brokers and why NATS is a standout choice for modern microservices. Now, it’s time to dive into the backbone of cloud-native applications:  and . If microservices are the chefs in our restaurant analogy, containers are the kitchen tools that keep everything running smoothly. And Kubernetes? That’s the head chef, making sure everyone works in harmony.In this article, we’ll break down  and , explore how they work together, and even touch on how  fits into the mix. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to containerize your applications and orchestrate them like a pro. Let’s get cooking!What Is Containerization, and Why Is It Important?Imagine you’re shipping a fragile package across the world. You’d want to pack it in a sturdy container, right? That’s exactly what containerization does for your applications. It packages your app and all its dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc.) into a lightweight, portable unit called a . This ensures that your app runs consistently across different environments — whether it’s your laptop, a testing server, or a production cluster.Why developers love containers:✅ : “Works on my machine” becomes “Works everywhere.”✅ : No more dependency hell — each app lives in its own bubble.✅ : Deploy to AWS, Azure, or your grandma’s PC (if she’s cool with Kubernetes).✅ : 10x lighter than VMs. Think EVs vs. a gas-guzzling truckIntroduction to Docker: Building, Running, and Managing ContainersDocker is the most popular tool for containerization, and for good reason. It’s simple, powerful, and widely supported. Let’s break it down:To create a container, you start with a  — a text file that defines the steps to build your app’s environment. Here’s a simple example:# Use a lightweight Python image (because nobody likes bloat)FROM python:3.9-slim# Set the stage for your appWORKDIR /app# Install dependencies (Pro tip: Skip the cache to shrink your image)COPY requirements.txt .RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt# Copy the rest of the codeCOPY . .# Open the app’s “front door”EXPOSE 8080CMD ["python", "app.py"]With this Dockerfile, you can build a container image using the `` command:🚀 Run this: docker build -t my-python-app .Once you’ve built your image, you can run it as a container:🎯 Pro tip: Map ports like a pirate mapping treasure.  docker run -p 8080:8080 my-python-appThis command starts your app and maps port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container. Easy, right?Docker also provides tools to manage your containers:: List running containers.docker logs <container_id>: View logs for a specific containerdocker stop <container_id>: Stop a running container.Docker vs. Podman: A Detailed ComparisonWhile Docker is the most popular containerization tool, it’s not the only one.  is a rising star in the container world, and it’s worth understanding how it compares to Docker.+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Feature              | Docker 🐳                           | Podman 📦                         |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Daemon Requirement   | Requires a daemon (dockerd)         | Daemonless (runs containers       ||                      |                                     | directly)                         |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Root vs. Rootless    | Runs as root by default              | Supports rootless containers out  ||                      |                                     | of the box                        |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Compatibility        | Uses Docker CLI and Dockerfiles     | Fully compatible with Docker CLI  ||                      |                                     | and Dockerfiles                   |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Security             | Requires root privileges, which can | Rootless mode reduces attack      ||                      | be a security risk                  | surface                           |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Orchestration        | Requires Docker Swarm for           | Integrates with Kubernetes        ||                      | orchestration                       | natively                          |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Community Support    | Larger community and ecosystem      | Growing community, backed by Red  ||                      |                                     | Hat                               |+----------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+You need a mature, widely supported tool with a large ecosystem.You’re already using Docker Swarm for orchestration.You’re okay with running containers as root.You want a daemonless, more secure alternative to Docker.You’re working in environments where root privileges are restricted.You’re already using Kubernetes and want tighter integration.Both tools are excellent choices, so pick the one that best fits your needs.Kubernetes Overview: Orchestration, Scaling, and Self-HealingWhile Docker is great for running containers, managing them at scale can get tricky. Enter  (or K8s for short), the de facto standard for container orchestration. Think of Kubernetes as the conductor of an orchestra — it ensures all your containers play in harmony.Key Features of Kubernetes: Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containers.: Automatically adjusts the number of running containers based on demand.: Restarts failed containers and replaces unhealthy ones.: Automatically assigns IP addresses and DNS names to containers.Kubernetes organizes containers into , which are the smallest deployable units. A pod can contain one or more containers that share resources like storage and networking. Here’s a simple Kubernetes deployment file:apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: my-python-app  replicas: 3    matchLabels:  template:      labels:    spec:      - name: my-python-app        image: my-python-app:latest        ports:his file tells Kubernetes to run three replicas of your app and expose it on port 8080. You can apply it using:🔥 Run this: kubectl apply -f deployment.yamlHow NATS Shines in a Kubernetes EnvironmentNow, let’s talk about . As a lightweight, high-performance messaging system, NATS plays well with Kubernetes. Here’s how it stands out:Use Cases for NATS in KubernetesService-to-Service Communication: NATS excels at enabling fast, reliable communication between microservices. Its lightweight design makes it perfect for Kubernetes’ dynamic environment.Event-Driven Architectures: NATS’s pub/sub, request-reply or streams patterns make it ideal for event-driven systems, where services need to react to events in real time.Scalability: NATS can handle millions of messages per second, making it a great fit for high-throughput applications running on Kubernetes.Resilience: NATS’s built-in fault tolerance ensures that your messaging system remains reliable, even in the face of node failures.Deploying NATS on KubernetesDeploying NATS on Kubernetes is straightforward. Here’s a basic NATS deployment file:apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: nats  replicas: 1    matchLabels:  template:      labels:    spec:      - name: nats        ports:        - containerPort: 4222 # The messaging highway 🛣️Once deployed, NATS can be used by your microservices for seamless communication.Best Practices for Containerizing MicroservicesTo wrap things up, here are some best practices for containerizing your microservices:Keep Containers Lightweight: Use minimal base images (e.g.,  or  versions) to reduce size and improve performance.: Separate the build and runtime environments to keep production images small.Leverage Kubernetes Features: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data.: Integrate tools like Prometheus and Fluentd for monitoring and logging.: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate building, testing, and deploying containers.In the next article, we’ll explore “NATS as a Service Mesh — The Lightweight Superhero Your Microservices Deserve” and how it simplifies communication between microservices. Spoiler alert: it’s like giving your microservices a supercharged walkie-talkie. Stay tuned!Until then, feel free to drop a comment or share your thoughts.

There have been hundreds of re:Invent recap events around the world since the beginning of the year, including in-person all-day official AWS events with multiple tracks to help you discover and dive deeper into the releases you care about, as well as community and virtual events.Last month, I was lucky to be a co-host for AWS EMEA re:Invent re:Cap which was a nearly 4-hour livestream with experts featuring demos, whiteboard sessions, and a live Q&A. The good news is that you can now watch it on-demand! We had a great team and thousands of people enjoyed learning through the virtual experience. I recommend you check it out or share it with colleagues who have not been able to attend any re:Invent re:Cap events.The Korean team also did an amazing job hosting their own virtual re:Invent re:Cap event, and it’s also now available on-demand. So if you speak Korean I do recommend you check it out.If you’re more of a reader, then we have a treat for you. You can download the full official re:Invent re:Cap deck with all the slides covering releases across all areas by visiting community.aws! While there, you can also check all the upcoming in-person re:Invent re:Cap community events remaining across the globe for a chance to still attend one of those in a city near you.But as we know, new releases, announcements, and updates don’t stop at re:Invent. Every week there are even more, and this is why we have this Weekly Roundup series that you can read every Monday to get the AWS news highlights from the week before.So here’s what caught my attention last week.Here are some other releases that caught my attention this week from a variety of other AWS services:AWS CloudFormation introduces stack refactoring – You can now split your CloudFormation stacks, move resources from one stack to another, and change the logical name of resources within the same stack. This adds a lot of flexibility enabling you to keep up with changes within your organization and architectures, such as streamlining resource lifecycle management for existing stacks, keeping up with naming convention changes, and other cases. You can refactor your stacks by using the AWS command line interface (CLI) or AWS SDK.AWS Config now supports 4 new release types – AWS Config is great for monitoring resources across your AWS environment and help you towards ensuring alignment with your company and security policies as well as compliance requirements. It now has four new types of resources enabling you to monitor Amazon VPC block public access settings, any exceptions made within those settings, as well as monitor S3 Express One Zone bucket policies and directory bucket settings.Upcoming changes to the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) global endpoint – To help improve the resiliency and performance of your applications, we are making changes to the AWS STS global endpoint (https://sts.amazonaws.com), with no action required from customers. Starting in early 2025, requests to the STS global endpoint will be automatically served in the same Region as your AWS deployed workloads. For example, if your application calls  from the US West (Oregon) Region, your calls will be served locally in the US West (Oregon) Region instead of being served by the US East (N. Virginia) Region. These changes will be released in the coming weeks and we will gradually roll it out to AWS Regions that are enabled by default by mid-2025.Looking for some reading recommendations? At the beginning of every year Dr. Werner Vogles, VP and CTO of Amazon, publishes a list of recommended books that he believes should have your attention. This year’s list is looking particularly good in my opinion!AWS Public Sector Day London, February 27 — Join public sector leaders and innovators to explore how AWS is enabling digital transformation in government, education, and healthcare.AWS Innovate GenAI + Data Edition — A free online conference focusing on generative AI and data innovations. Available in multiple Regions: APJC and EMEA (March 6), North America (March 13), Greater China Region (March 14), and Latin America (April 8).That’s it for this week!
