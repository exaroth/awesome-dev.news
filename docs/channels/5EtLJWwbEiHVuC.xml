Friday, February 14, 2025Kubernetes 1.31
completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree
cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional
complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go
over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.
This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,
building four new subsystems.One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,
which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the Node
object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the
cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information,
like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the
Node, Region and Instance type information.Chicken and egg problem sequence diagramThis new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet
was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved
to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem
during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the
controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,
standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using
 (more on this below)Examples of the dependency problemAs noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be
unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few
concrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might
occur.These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource
(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods
rely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it
will schedule properly.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taintAs noted in the Kubernetes documentation, when the kubelet is started with the command line
flag --cloud-provider=external, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint
named node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized added. Because the cloud-controller-manager
is responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a
cloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a 
or , may not be able to schedule.If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the
control plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized no schedule taint. It also means that this taint
will not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no
schedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface
controllers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taintThe next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is
waiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not
tolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI."The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly."One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container
network has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible
for adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container
network controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some
circumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the
cloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is
not able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container
network controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized and node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taints,
leaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the
specific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the
lifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager
will need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.
Setting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host
networking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as
the host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This
will ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check
your networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the
lifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy
as well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using
these primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple
replicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide
with each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other
controllers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager
controller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.
Use a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the
control plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital
to adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the
physical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run
with a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation
from non-privileged user workloads.It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running
on the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade
the cloud controller performance.Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud
controller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run
in situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate
the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint, and it should also tolerate any
taints associated with the control plane (for example, node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
or node-role.kubernetes.io/master). It can also be useful to tolerate the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the
node is not yet available for health monitoring.For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,
in a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the
dependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice
for running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network
constraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology
for these scenarios.This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is
important to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please
consult your cloud provider’s documentation.apiVersion: apps/v1

When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that
cluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple
replicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and
redundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance
of a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Talos on IPv6 only network?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ivumee/talos_on_ipv6_only_network/</link><author>/u/Moleventions</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 22:15:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Does anyone know if you can deploy Talos on an IPv6 only network in AWS?   submitted by    /u/Moleventions ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why K8s when there’s k3s with less resource requirements?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ivu87n/why_k8s_when_theres_k3s_with_less_resource/</link><author>/u/Crafty0x</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:57:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I don’t get why a business will run the more demanding k8s instead of k3s.

the right to impose restrictions or apply additional charges to accounts
exhibiting excessive data and storage consumption.Docker Hub has an abuse rate limit to protect the application and
infrastructure. This limit applies to all requests to Hub properties including
web pages, APIs, and image pulls. The limit is applied per IPv4 address or per

other factors, it's in the order of thousands of requests per minute. The abuse
limit applies to all users equally regardless of account level.You can differentiate between the pull rate limit and abuse rate limit by

First, all device vendors expose their devices to containers in different ways. Second, device support in container runtimes is fragmented. This imposes high costs on both AI chip vendors and the open-source community. Yes, these circumstances clearly illustrate why a standard interface is necessary. Now AI chip vendors can support various container runtimes through standardized interfaces by implementing CDI. Docker also supports it as an experimental feature, but it is expected to become a default feature in the near future since containerd now supports it as a default feature. Originally, CDI was part of the DRA. However, it now has a greater influence on the entire container ecosystem.In addition to standardized device exposure, CDI delivers several benefits for enterprise deployments using different kinds of AI hardware (such as RNGD):Simplified runtime supportReduced implementation costsFuriosa has built RNGD to be the best accelerator for real world deployments using large language models, multimodal models and agentic AI systems. To achieve this, we will leverage new Kubernetes functionality like CDI and DRA.  RNGD uses the CDI to define how devices are assigned to containers. The CDI specification lays out the format, guidelines, and interfaces needed to properly describe these devices. For example, RNGD’s vendor-specific interfaces like device nodes and sysfs files can be expressed using the interfaces provided by the CDI. This makes it simpler for container-related systems to understand which system resources need to be present when running workloads on RNGD hardware. We’re currently building a DRA plugin for flexible and efficient resource scheduling. When we release the plugin in 2025, users will be able to request RNGD resources defined through the DRA interface. One key benefit of DRA is that it allows users to specify their desired hardware topology. For example, a user might say they need four RNGD devices under a single physical CPU socket, or two RNGD devices under a specific PCIe switch. They can even specify that multiple servers must be located beneath a particular network switch. When the scheduler hands off the RNGD scheduling task to the Furiosa DRA plugin, the plugin calculates which server meets the user’s topology requirements. Among the servers that match these conditions, it then assigns the requested RNGD resources to the user’s container (reality is binding the user's pod on that server).Future outlook for Kubernetes and ML workloadsThe evolution of Kubernetes, driven by advancements like DRA and CDI, is crucial for the future of AI. As the industry moves beyond traditional GPUs and embraces more efficient chip architectures like RNGD, the ability to effectively orchestrate and manage these resources will become even more critical.This will accelerate the adoption of specialized hardware, leading to faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective ML inference.The ongoing collaboration between the Kubernetes community and AI chip vendors is essential to ensure that Kubernetes continues to meet the evolving needs of the AI landscape. By working together, we can unlock the full potential of AI and drive innovation across industries. We believe that sharing our experience with developing and deploying RNGD will contribute to this important effort. We also hope to foster more open-source contributions that will speed progress toward an open ecosystem that supports a wide range of AI-specific hardware to serve different needs in the industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dapr.io - enterprise enabler for boosting developer productivity</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoNcJYoJkRY</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XoNcJYoJkRY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 21:51:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

My classmates and I found it tedious to manually change environment variables or modify Kubernetes configurations by hand. Merging configurations can be straightforward but often feels cumbersome and annoying.To address this, I created Kubemgr, a Rust crate that abstracts a command for merging Kubernetes configurations:KUBECONFIG=config1:config2... kubectl config view --flatten Available on crates.io, this CLI makes the process less painful and more intuitive.But that's not all! For those who prefer not to install the crate locally, I also developed a user interface using Next.js and WebAssembly (WASM). The goal was to ensure that both the interface and the CLI use the exact same logic while keeping everything client-side for security reasons.I understand that this project might not be useful for everyone, especially those who are already experienced with Kubernetes. However, it was primarily a learning exercise for me to explore new technologies and improve my skills. I'm eager to get feedback and hear any ideas for new features or improvements that could make Kubemgr more useful for the community.The project is open-source, so feel free to check out the code and provide recommendations or suggestions for improvement on GitHub. Contributions are welcome!If you like the project, please consider starring the GitHub repo!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CNCF Research End User Group: Managing Kubeflow deployments and updates at CERN (February 19, 2025)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvNIS0M0VJE</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QvNIS0M0VJE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:08:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

The Kubernetes resource semantic conventions specify, among others, pairs of  and  attributes for pods ( and ), as well for all workloads “higher level” constructs (which in Kubernetes are also called “resources”, but we don’t want to confuse the two terms), like deployment ( and ), daemonset ( and ) and so on.Nevertheless, despite the well-defined attributes, it is not entirely straightforward to have all the right Kubernetes-related metadata attached to your telemetry.Among all the resource attributes that describe telemetry coming from your workloads on Kubernetes,  is by far the most important: through it, you can add most other pieces of k8s-related metadata by funneling your telemetry through the  component of an OpenTelemetry collector running inside the same cluster. The  “fills” the blanks using data it gets from Kubernetes API, and with the right tool, you can effortlessly filter and group your telemetry across all types of aggregations.The fact that the  exists actually fills a very important gap in telemetry metadata: the OpenTelemetry SDKs running within your containers have access to virtually no metadata about the pod surrounding them is running. They are not going to know, unless you specifically add it to the pod, e.g., using environment variables, which daemonset scheduled the pod, or which replicaset of which deployment.As a matter of fact, without additional assistance by you, for example via environment variables (either setting values yourself, or adding pod uid, pod name, and namespace name to the environment via Kubernetes’ Downward API), an OpenTelemetry SDK within a container can pretty much know only the pod uid (though very esoteric magic involving the parsing of cgroup metadata, see e.g. this resource detector in the Dash0 distribution of OpenTelemetry for Node.js) and the pod name (via the networking hostname). And unfortunately, as of writing, OpenTelemetry SDKs do not even implement those consistently (see, e.g., this issue).A Kubernetes pod spec template snippet showing how to use the Downward API together with the  environment variable to set the  resource attribute.By the way, the  is capable of identifying which pod is sending telemetry to it via the unique pod ip (see the “associations” configurations): the processor in the OpenTelemetry Collector matches the IP address of the “other side” of the TCP connection that sends the telemetry, and since each pod in a Kubernetes cluster has a unique IP address assigned to it, it can figure out from which pod it’s coming from. And here, there is a caveat: the detection of the pod based on the IP address is known not to work reliably if you use a service mesh or some of the less conventional network setups. (Don’t ask us how we know. It was not fun to troubleshoot that.) So, better safe than sorry: ensure your telemetry is annotated with  and, if you are OK with proxying your telemetry through an OpenTelemetry Collector inside the cluster, have that fill most of the resource attributes mentioned in the remainder of this article for you using a configuration like this.Pod UIDs are effectively unique across all your workloads. (And all Kubernetes workloads anywhere, ever.) But long, random strings of characters are not something we humans are good at remembering things by, or even searching for in lists.So, in a similar way same way we set the  resource attribute, we can set the :A Kubernetes pod spec template snippet showing how to use the Downward API together with the  environment variable to set the  resource attribute.Did you know that the Kubernetes pod, i.e., one or more containers that share local networking and other resources like CPU and memory allotment and volumes, is called like that because:“pod” is the collective name of a group of whalesthe logo of Docker, the original container runtime of Kubernetes, is a whaleIf your pod has more than one container, you are really going to need to know which of them is having issues. Usually, applications on Kubernetes have just one “main” container, running your application and may have one or more “sidecars”, i.e., containers that have inside ancillary processes like log collectors or service mesh proxies. The  (see previous section) cannot tell containers apart (all your containers in the same pod share the same IP address and pod uid, among other things), so you should set the  yourself. It can be a bit toilsome, because you cannot do it generically using the Downward API the way we did for , but in the end is as simple as adding another entry to :A Kubernetes pod spec template snippet showing how to use the  environment variable to set the  resource attribute. Be sure to set it to the same value of the container name!Note that  could be redundant: the  attribute is supposed to contain the same data, and there are detectors in most OpenTelemetry SDKs (see e.g. for Node.js), that can collect  for you by parsing, for example, the  metadata (cgroups are one of the foundational Linux facilities for containers). However, it may not always be possible to add detectors to your containerized applications, especially when you are using sidecars from 3rd parties. But if they support the  environment variable, you can fill the gaps in resource attributes through the process environment.The same way you are likely to have a  service in most applications () service, that service will likely be powered by a  deployment (). Names in Kubernetes are unique only for resources of the same type (e.g., deployments) within the same Kubernetes namespace. If you want to avoid confusion and simplify your life aggregating data, set not only  but also , and use the UIDs to group.After reading the previous paragraph, you might have wondered:“The deployment name is unique inside the namespace, and the namespace name is unique inside the cluster. So why do I need unique identifiers anyhow?”That logic works if you deploy your software in only one cluster. But that is seldom the case. Between development, testing, and various production clusters (which is a rather common type of layout), most organizations run the same software, at the same time, on  of Kubernetes clusters. And, to make matters more complicated, telling Kubernetes clusters apart is harder than it should (see next section).The fun with identifiers is not over yet. Now let’s talk about some identifiers that . Specifically, the identifier of a specific Kubernetes cluster. In most Kubernetes setups, it literally does not exist. In other words, a Kubernetes cluster has no own notion of identity!You surely have names for your clusters, but the name “prod-eu-awesomesauce” that you define in your Kubernetes cluster management tool is more a matter of how you call the profile in  to connect to that cluster rather than some metadata you can find from within the cluster itself! (Your mileage may vary with specific setups and Kubernetes flavor; but in general, this is the case.) So, you should use the OpenTelemetry collector’s  to inject the value of  like this:A snippet of the OpenTelemetry collector configuration to add the  resource attribute to all telemetry coming through.Moreover, the same way most Kubernetes  attributes have matching  ones, so does  have a match in . The common practice in this case is to set  using as value the uid of the  namespace, which is pretty much the only namespace you are guaranteed to find in every Kubernetes cluster you will ever see (as it is the one that by default hosts the control plane components).The  attribute, and its far lesser used  sibling, are really useful when investigating performance issues due to resource underprovisioning (pods on the same node fighting for resources like CPU or memory) or node-pressure evictions. The only notable exception to this is when you run on AWS EKS on Fargate, where each pod, from the point of view of Kubernetes, runs on a dedicated node.If you have already set up the  so that it can add resource attributes to your telemetry, it can also take care of  for you. Otherwise, setting the  attribute is pretty simple using Kubernetes’ Downward API and “dependent environment variables”:A Kubernetes pod spec template snippet showing how to use the Downward API together with the  environment variable to set the  resource attribute.Resource attributes are a key ingredient to make your telemetry useful. In this blog post, we have looked at the OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions for Kubernetes, and how you can ensure to always know which workload of which cluster is sending the errors.In this post, we kept to the fundamental Kubernetes metadata your telemetry should have. There is, of course, a lot more to be said about OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, even just for resources on Kubernetes. For example, you will find more resource attributes specified in the Kubernetes resource semantic conventions. Also, there are semantic conventions for metrics about Kubernetes, which are, at the time of writing, in an experimental state (meaning: the convention is not declared stable, so it might still change in backwards-incompatible ways) and are based on what the OpenTelemetry Collector knows how to collect with various receivers like  and .By the way, if you liked this article, you are probably going to love Ben's "Top 10 OpenTelemetry Collector Components" blog post. It will likely give you a bunch more ideas about what you can do to ensure that your resource metadata is top-notch.And if you want all the awesomeness of the resource metadata we covered in this post, but do none of the work to get them, give the Dash0 operator a spin: it is open source, built on OpenTelemetry components with opinionation and an appliance-like philosophy (“it just works™”), and under the hood it uses most of the techniques described in this post to get your telemetry annotated to the state of the art, with literally none of the toil from on your side.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Has anyone used Nginx Ingress controller with the AWS Load Balancer Controller service instead of the default service?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1it16ic/has_anyone_used_nginx_ingress_controller_with_the/</link><author>/u/lynxerious</author><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 09:01:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So the nginx-ingress-controller creates a LoadBalancer service by default, this load balancer is created by the in-tree controller managed by EKS.
