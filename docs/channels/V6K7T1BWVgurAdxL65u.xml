Lyude and Danilo are doing a wonderful job and I've put all my trust into them.However, there is one thing I can't stand and it's hurting me the most. I'm convinced, no, my core believe is, that inclusivity and respect, working with others as equals, no power plays involved, is how we should work together within the Free and Open Source community.I can understand maintainers needing to learn, being concerned on technical points. Everybody deserves the time to understand and learn. It is my true belief that most people are capable of change eventually. I truly believe this community can change from within, however this doesn't mean it's going to be a smooth process.The moment I made up my mind about this was reading the following words written by a maintainer within the kernel community:"we are the thin blue line"This isn't okay. This isn't creating an inclusive environment. This isn't okay with the current political situation especially in the US. A maintainer speaking those words can't be kept. No matter how important or critical or relevant they are. They need to be removed until they learn. Learn what those words mean for a lot of marginalized people. Learn about what horrors it evokes in their minds.I can't in good faith remain to be part of a project and its community where those words are tolerated. Those words are not technical, they are a political statement. Even if unintentionally, such words carry power, they carry meanings one needs to be aware of. They do cause an immense amount of harm.I wish the best of luck for everybody to continue to try to work from within. You got my full support and I won't hold it against anybody trying to improve the community, it's a thankless job, it's a lot of work. People will continue to burn out.I got burned out enough by myself caring about the bits I maintained, but eventually I had to realize my limits. The obligation I felt was eating me from inside. It stopped being fun at some point and I reached a point where I simply couldn't continue the work I was so motivated doing as I've did in the early days.Please respect my wishes and put this statement as is into the tree. Leaving anything out destroys its entire meaning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Richard Stallman in Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipz4wy/richard_stallman_in_polytechnic_university_of/</link><author>/u/ShockleyTransistor</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 11:05:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux in any distribution is unobtainable for most people because the first two installation steps are basically impossible.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipyc1o/linux_in_any_distribution_is_unobtainable_for/</link><author>/u/trollfinnes</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:05:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, just before Christmas, I decided to check out Linux again (tried it ~20 years ago) because Windows 11 was about to cause an aneurysm.I was expecting to spend the "weekend" getting everything to work; find hardware drivers, installing various open source software and generally just 'hack together something that works'.To my surprise everything worked flawlessly first time booting up. I had WiFi, sound, usb, webcam, memory card reader, correct screen resolution. I even got battery status and management! It even came with a nice litte 'app center' making installation of a bunch of software as simple as a click!And I remember thinking any Windows user could  install Linux and would get comfortable using it in an afternoon.I'm pretty 'comfortable' in anything PC and have changed boot orders and created bootable things since the early 90's and considered that part of the installation the easiest part.However, most people have never heard about any of them, and that makes the two steps seem 'impossible'.I recently convinced a friend of mine, who also couldn't stand Window11, to install Linux instead as it would easily cover all his PC needs. And while he is definitely in the upper half of people in terms of 'tech savvyness', both those "two easy first steps" made it virtually impossible for him to install it. He easily managed downloading the .iso, but turning that iso into a bootable USB-stick turned out to be too difficult. But after guiding him over the phone he was able to create it.But he wasn't able to get into bios despite all my attempts explaining what button to push and whenNext day he came over with his laptop. And just out of reflex I just started smashing the F2 key (or whatever it was) repeatingly and got right into bios where I enabled USB boot and put it at the top at the sequence.After that he managed to install Linux just fine without my supervision.But it made me realise that the two first steps in installing Linux, that are second nature to me and probably everyone involved with Linux from people just using it to people working on huge distributions, makes them virtually impossible for most people to install it.I don't know enough about programming to know of this is possible:Instead of an .iso file for download some sort of .exe file can be downloaded that is able to create a bootable USB-stick and change the boot order?That would 'open up' Linux to  more people, probably orders of magnitude..]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>what was the Linux expirance like in the 90&apos;s and 00&apos;s?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipql9k/what_was_the_linux_expirance_like_in_the_90s_and/</link><author>/u/mrcrabs6464</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:35:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I started using Linux about 2 years ago really right at the beginning of the proton revolution.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dynamic triple/double buffering merge request for GNOME was just merged!</title><link>https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1441</link><author>/u/joojmachine</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:09:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is It Time For a Change In GNOME Leadership?</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/13/0150244/is-it-time-for-a-change-in-gnome-leadership?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>slashdot</category><category>linux</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Longtime Slashdot reader BrendaEM writes: Command-line aside, Cinnamon is the most effective keeper of the Linux desktop flame -- by not abandoning desktop and laptop computers. Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.
 
The programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as "Activities," you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.
 
I remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind. Perhaps in a future, GNOME could return to the Linux desktop and join forces with Cinnamon -- so that we may once again have the year of the Linux desktop.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FSF talked about education, copyright management, and free machine learning at FOSDEM 2025</title><link>http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-at-fosdem-2025</link><author></author><category>linux</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/recent-blog-posts">Dev - Free Software Foundation</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Four FSF staff members had a great time sharing their knowledge and learning at FOSDEM 2025 in Brussels. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I ♥ Free Software Day 2025: Let&apos;s celebrate the people who make and maintain free software</title><link>http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/i-love-free-software-2025</link><author></author><category>linux</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/recent-blog-posts">Dev - Free Software Foundation</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's celebrate the people behind free software and tell them how much we appreciate their work! ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Do Linux Kernel Developers Think of Rust?</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/08/0455231/what-do-linux-kernel-developers-think-of-rust?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>slashdot</category><category>linux</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 17:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Keynotes at this year's FOSDEM included free AI models and systemd, reports Heise.de — and also a progress report from Miguel Ojeda, supervisor of the Rust integration in the Linux kernel.

Only eight people remain in the core team around Rust for Linux... Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. 
The reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: 

- "2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers..." — Daniel Almedia 

- "I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time." — Andrea Righi

 - "[T]he project faces unique challenges. Rust's biggest weakness, as a language, is that relatively few people speak it. Indeed, Rust is not a language for beginners, and systems-level development complicates things even more. That said, the Linux kernel project has historically attracted developers who love challenging software — if there's an open source group willing to put the extra effort for a better OS, it's the kernel devs." — Carlos Bilbao 

- "I played a little with [Rust] in user space, and I just absolutely hate the cargo concept... I hate having to pull down other code that I do not trust. At least with shared libraries, I can trust a third party to have done the build and all that... [While Rust should continue to grow in the kernel], if a subset of C becomes as safe as Rust, it may make Rust obsolete..." Steven Rostedt 

Rostedt wasn't sure if Rust would attract more kernel contributors, but did venture this opinion. "I feel Rust is more of a language that younger developers want to learn, and C is their dad's language." 

But still "contention exists within the kernel development community between those pro-Rust and -C camps," argues The New Stack, citing the latest remarks from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig (who had earlier likened the mixing of Rust and C to cancer). Three days later Hellwig reiterated his position again on the Linux kernel mailing list:

"Every additional bit that another language creeps in drastically reduces the maintainability of the kernel as an integrated project. The only reason Linux managed to survive so long is by not having internal boundaries, and adding another language completely breaks this. You might not like my answer, but I will do everything I can do to stop this. This is NOT because I hate Rust. While not my favourite language it's definitively one of the best new ones and I encourage people to use it for new projects where it fits. I do not want it anywhere near a huge C code base that I need to maintain." 

But the article also notes that Google "has been a staunch supporter of adding Rust to the kernel for Linux running in its Android phones."
The use of Rust in the kernel is seen as a way to avoid memory vulnerabilities associated with C and C++ code and to add more stability to the Android OS. "Google's wanting to replace C code with Rust represents a small piece of the kernel but it would have a huge impact since we are talking about billions of phones," Ojeda told me after his talk. 

In addition to Google, Rust adoption and enthusiasm for it is increasing as Rust gets more architectural support and as "maintainers become more comfortable with it," Ojeda told me. "Maintainers have already told me that if they could, then they would start writing Rust now," Ojeda said. "If they could drop C, they would do it...." 

Amid the controversy, there has been a steady stream of vocal support for Ojeda. Much of his discussion also covered statements given by advocates for Rust in the kernel, ranging from lead developers of the kernel and including Linux creator Linus Torvalds himself to technology leads from Red Hat, Samsung, Google, Microsoft and others.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
