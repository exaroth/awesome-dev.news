Then switched to Fedora and used it for a long time until recently I switched again. This time I finally experienced Ubuntu. I know it's usually the first distro of most of the users, but I avoided it because I heard people badmouth it a lot for some reason and I blindly believed them. I was disgusted by Snaps and was a Flatpak Fanboy, until I finally tried them for the first time on Ubuntu. I was so brainwashed that I hated Ubuntu and Snaps for no reason. And I decided to switch to it only because I was given permission to work on a project using my personal laptop (because office laptop had some technical issues and I wasn't going to get one for a month) and I didn't wanted to take risk so I installed Ubuntu as the Stack we use is well supported on Ubuntu only.And damn I was so wrong about Ubuntu! Everything just worked out of the box. No driver issues, every packege I can imagine is available in the repos and all of them work seemlessly. I found Snaps to be better than Flatpaks because Apps like Android Studio and VS Code didn't work out of the box as Flatpaks (because of absurd sandboxing) but I faced no issues at all with Snaps. I also found that Ubuntu is much smoother and much more polished than any distro I have used till now. I really love the Ubuntu experience so far, and I don't understand the community's irrational hate towards it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Quote of the day</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iqz9we/linus_quote_of_the_day/</link><author>/u/bhagwano-ka-bhagwan</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 18:47:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FOSDEM 2025 - Linux × VR!

Lyude and Danilo are doing a wonderful job and I've put all my trust into them.However, there is one thing I can't stand and it's hurting me the most. I'm convinced, no, my core believe is, that inclusivity and respect, working with others as equals, no power plays involved, is how we should work together within the Free and Open Source community.I can understand maintainers needing to learn, being concerned on technical points. Everybody deserves the time to understand and learn. It is my true belief that most people are capable of change eventually. I truly believe this community can change from within, however this doesn't mean it's going to be a smooth process.The moment I made up my mind about this was reading the following words written by a maintainer within the kernel community:"we are the thin blue line"This isn't okay. This isn't creating an inclusive environment. This isn't okay with the current political situation especially in the US. A maintainer speaking those words can't be kept. No matter how important or critical or relevant they are. They need to be removed until they learn. Learn what those words mean for a lot of marginalized people. Learn about what horrors it evokes in their minds.I can't in good faith remain to be part of a project and its community where those words are tolerated. Those words are not technical, they are a political statement. Even if unintentionally, such words carry power, they carry meanings one needs to be aware of. They do cause an immense amount of harm.I wish the best of luck for everybody to continue to try to work from within. You got my full support and I won't hold it against anybody trying to improve the community, it's a thankless job, it's a lot of work. People will continue to burn out.I got burned out enough by myself caring about the bits I maintained, but eventually I had to realize my limits. The obligation I felt was eating me from inside. It stopped being fun at some point and I reached a point where I simply couldn't continue the work I was so motivated doing as I've did in the early days.Please respect my wishes and put this statement as is into the tree. Leaving anything out destroys its entire meaning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Richard Stallman in Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipz4wy/richard_stallman_in_polytechnic_university_of/</link><author>/u/ShockleyTransistor</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 11:05:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux in any distribution is unobtainable for most people because the first two installation steps are basically impossible.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipyc1o/linux_in_any_distribution_is_unobtainable_for/</link><author>/u/trollfinnes</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:05:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, just before Christmas, I decided to check out Linux again (tried it ~20 years ago) because Windows 11 was about to cause an aneurysm.I was expecting to spend the "weekend" getting everything to work; find hardware drivers, installing various open source software and generally just 'hack together something that works'.To my surprise everything worked flawlessly first time booting up. I had WiFi, sound, usb, webcam, memory card reader, correct screen resolution. I even got battery status and management! It even came with a nice litte 'app center' making installation of a bunch of software as simple as a click!And I remember thinking any Windows user could  install Linux and would get comfortable using it in an afternoon.I'm pretty 'comfortable' in anything PC and have changed boot orders and created bootable things since the early 90's and considered that part of the installation the easiest part.However, most people have never heard about any of them, and that makes the two steps seem 'impossible'.I recently convinced a friend of mine, who also couldn't stand Window11, to install Linux instead as it would easily cover all his PC needs. And while he is definitely in the upper half of people in terms of 'tech savvyness', both those "two easy first steps" made it virtually impossible for him to install it. He easily managed downloading the .iso, but turning that iso into a bootable USB-stick turned out to be too difficult. But after guiding him over the phone he was able to create it.But he wasn't able to get into bios despite all my attempts explaining what button to push and whenNext day he came over with his laptop. And just out of reflex I just started smashing the F2 key (or whatever it was) repeatingly and got right into bios where I enabled USB boot and put it at the top at the sequence.After that he managed to install Linux just fine without my supervision.But it made me realise that the two first steps in installing Linux, that are second nature to me and probably everyone involved with Linux from people just using it to people working on huge distributions, makes them virtually impossible for most people to install it.I don't know enough about programming to know of this is possible:Instead of an .iso file for download some sort of .exe file can be downloaded that is able to create a bootable USB-stick and change the boot order?That would 'open up' Linux to  more people, probably orders of magnitude..]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;Dongly Things&quot; by Douglas Adams (of Hitchhikers Guide) - Adams wrote this article in the early days of Mac computers, about manufacturers making things difficult with a million different proprietary cables/ports etc.</title><link>https://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-03-a.html</link><author>/u/CaesarSalvage</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:47:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>what was the Linux expirance like in the 90&apos;s and 00&apos;s?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipql9k/what_was_the_linux_expirance_like_in_the_90s_and/</link><author>/u/mrcrabs6464</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:35:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I started using Linux about 2 years ago really right at the beginning of the proton revolution.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is It Time For a Change In GNOME Leadership?</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/13/0150244/is-it-time-for-a-change-in-gnome-leadership?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>slashdot</category><category>linux</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Longtime Slashdot reader BrendaEM writes: Command-line aside, Cinnamon is the most effective keeper of the Linux desktop flame -- by not abandoning desktop and laptop computers. Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.
 
The programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as "Activities," you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.
 
I remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind.
