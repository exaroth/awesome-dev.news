in it being incompatible with any <= 2.3 configuration file.Thus, the dovecot service will no longer be able to start until the

It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to securely connect AI models with data sources while maintaining provider freedom. This gives organizations the ability to run AI-driven automation without relying on a single ecosystem. With a 16-year lifecycle, reproducible builds, instant rollback capabilities, and post-2038 readiness, SLES 16 also doubles down on long-term reliability and transparency.
 
For enterprises, this launch marks a clear step toward embedding intelligence at the infrastructure level. The system can now perform AI-assisted administration via Cockpit or the command line, potentially cutting downtime and operational costs. SUSE's timing might feel late given the AI boom, but its implementation appears deliberate -- balancing innovation with the stability enterprises demand. It's likely to pressure Red Hat and Canonical to follow suit, redefining what "AI-ready" means for Linux in corporate environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nearly 90% of Windows Games Now Run on Linux, Latest Data Shows</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/10/28/206219/nearly-90-of-windows-games-now-run-on-linux-latest-data-shows?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>slashdot</category><category>linux</category><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 20:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly nine in ten Windows games can now run on Linux systems, according to data from ProtonDB compiled by Boiling Steam. The gains came through work by developers of WINE and Proton translation layers and through interest in hardware like the Steam Deck. 

ProtonDB tracks games across five categories. Platinum-rated games run perfectly without adjustment. Gold titles need minor tweaks. Silver games are playable but imperfect. Bronze exists between silver and borked. Borked games refuse to launch. The proportion of new releases earning platinum ratings has grown. The red and dark red zones have thinned. Some popular titles remain incompatible, however. Boiling Steam noted that other developers appear averse to non-Windows gamers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FSD meeting recap 2025-10-24</title><link>http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsd-meeting-recap-2025-10-24</link><author></author><category>linux</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 14:43:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/recent-blog-posts">Free Software Foundation</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the important work our volunteers accomplished

Focusing on real-world scenarios, Canonical Academy aims to foster practical skills rather than theoretical knowledge. The end goal? Getting professionals ready for the actual challenges they will face on the job. The learning platform is already live with its first course offering, the System Administrator track (with three certification exams), which is tailored for anyone looking to validate their Linux and Ubuntu expertise. 

The exams use cloud-based testing environments that simulate real workplace scenarios. Each assessment is modular, meaning you can progress through individual exams and earn badges for each one. Complete all the exams in this track to earn the full Sysadmin qualification... Canonical is also looking for community members to contribute as beta testers and subject-matter experts (SME). If you are interested in helping shape the platform or want to get started with your certification, you can visit the Canonical Academy website. 

The sys-admin track offers exams for Linux Terminal, Ubuntu Desktop 2024, Ubuntu Server 2024, and "managing complex systems," according to an official FAQ. "Each exam provides an in-browser remote desktop interface into a functional Ubuntu Desktop environment running GNOME. From this initial node, you will be expected to troubleshoot, configure, install, and maintain systems, processes, and other general activities associated with managing Linux. The exam is a hybrid format featuring multiple choice, scenario-based, and performance-based questions..." 

"Test-takers interested in the types of material covered on each exam can review links to tutorials and documentation on our website." 

The FAQ advises test takers to use a Chromium-based browser, as Firefox "is NOT supported at this time... There is a known issue with keyboards and Firefox in the CUE.01 Linux 24.04 preview release at this time, which will be resolved in the CUE.01 Linux 24.10 exam release."]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
