I was in middle of actually shopping for some extra brand new USBs to replace my old ones when I encountered this for the first time. It looked like there were quite a good number of people on marketplace platforms like eBay and Mercari selling bootable USB flash drives with a Linux distro pre-installed on it. Majority of the ones I saw were Ubuntu (like what I had pictured) on there, but I also saw a good amount of ones with Kali and different versions of Linux Mint as well. Seems like you get the USB according to said listings with instructions on how to properly boot it or install it on your computer, and in some cases even provide contact information for support if needed. The prices on some of these are slightly in the higher side when compared to those I had screenshots of in the examples, and the sellers all had a large amount of sales and positive responses. Now, of course, I'd personally just stick to what I've been doing and just create the bootable drive myself for literally free like I have from the start. So to me it was interesting to see these out there actually being bought when the process of doing this yourself is relatively easy with step-by-step guides on the respective distro's website and even YouTube tutorials if you wish to follow those. So in short, what's everyone think of these?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What&apos;s your recommendation on video editors?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iw2aae/whats_your_recommendation_on_video_editors/</link><author>/u/chuzambs</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 04:50:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi there !

I know I'm young and still don't know much, but I'd like to write about this anyway. I think I started using computers during the Windows XP era. My father worked repairing computers. My mom says I learned to type on a computer before writing on paper. I was like one of today's kids who spend all day on their phones, except with computers. During my childhood, I spent my time chronically online, playing various games and browsing the internet. I remember Windows XP very well, along with Windows 7 and Minecraft. Those were good times, but as I grew older, things changed very quickly. My father stopped working with computer repairs, and soon I knew more than everyone else in the family.I could fix all kinds of computers easily for my friends; back then, everything was Windows. My first contact with Linux was at school when we started having computer classes, when I was around 15. The school computers were slow and had Ubuntu installed. It was slow, ugly, and very limited because the computers were managed by the school. That was my first impression: a slow system for government computers.Microsoft tried various things. I remember Windows 8 when formatting laptops, and then that Windows 8.1 update where they changed the menu. A lot happened, and it seems to have passed so quickly. At school, I always used Office suite programs: Word, PowerPoint, etc., and in computer classes, you had to use LibreOffice on a very slow government computer. it was ugly and seemed very difficult to use.My family's financial situation didn't improve much, so I ended up with limited access to new technologies. My phone was already old, and my computers were getting old. I still remember Windows 10's launch very well. My relatives would bring computers for me to repair and format, wanting the latest version of Windows with Office and everything else, but the computers were already old and barely worked with Windows 8.I begged my father to buy me a laptop, and after much insistence, I finally convinced him. It was an Asus X450LA. A mid-range computer for its time. It came with Windows 8, I think, but I did that upgrade to Windows 10. I used it until I finished high school, but then Windows 11 came along, and my laptop was cut from the list of computers that could upgrade. it was the end of my laptop's life.I was already working at my father's market, so I bought myself a new gaming computer with Windows 11. I had time again to spend on the internet and started to worry about my father's business expenses. Using Office costs money, sales programs are expensive, everything is expensive, and maybe my gaming laptop won't even be able to use the next Windows.I started researching Linux. At first, I was a bit scared because everyone on Reddit talked about terminals, command lines to install anything, etc., but I decided to take my old laptop and refurbish it. I bought a new battery, an SSD, and an 8GB RAM stick. I researched on Reddit which distro was best for beginners, got an old USB drive, put Mint on it, and formatted my computer: Love at first sight.I customized Mint and left it in a way that I spend more than 15 minutes before doing anything just appreciating it. I used LibreOffice for everything I did in Office. I used Firefox and liked it a lot. The system is very fast, strangely seems faster than my new computer with Windows 11. I downloaded my daily-use programs from Mint's app center: Spotify, Bitwarden, everything's there. I spent hours playing with the terminal with ChatGPT's help. I extracted running process logs to txt, system information. it's very easy to use. I even managed to install a game I played in my childhood, a BF2 mod: Forgotten Hope 2 from Windows on Mint using Lutris (I swear it's the last Windows thing I'll use).I'm in love with my old laptop again. I cleaned it, spent hours looking at it, I love using Mint, made it my own. I'm going to buy a new computer for my room and install Mint for my personal use. I'll have a laptop and a computer with Linux. My current computer with Windows 11 will be only for sales programs and government programs that only work on Windows. I showed it to my father, and he liked Linux too. Windows never again. Using Windows now feels like one of those mobile games full of ads]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Found this on a piece of digital signage in a bathroom</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivwydq/found_this_on_a_piece_of_digital_signage_in_a/</link><author>/u/A_Sc00py_b0i</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:06:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing wctx - A simple CLI tool for window context info on Wayland &amp; X11</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivw7xn/introducing_wctx_a_simple_cli_tool_for_window/</link><author>/u/slightlyfaulty</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 23:30:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I just released my first package for Linux. It's called  (short for window context). It's a simple CLI tool that provides real-time information about the current  window (focused window) or  window (under the mouse cursor) on Wayland and X11. It's (mostly) written in Rust.It's not very useful on its own, but it makes it much easier for programs and scripts to work with windows. For example, you could create hotkeys that only work in specific apps, or change your mouse scroll speed when the cursor is in a browser window, or turn your monitor brightness up when it has a fullscreen window.You can of course already do these things, with a bit of effort. The main advantage of wctx is that it works across multiple desktop environments, which means programs and scripts using it will too. It's also dead simple to use, with several CLI output options and formats, as well as a D-Bus interface.Currently it supports these desktop environments, with more to come if there's enough interest in them:For other distros an installation script is included, with more info in the readme.I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. This is also my first real Rust project, so please be nice 😄 (or rip me a new one so I can learn).Feedback and contributions are very welcome!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My first time with Linux</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivvcxn/my_first_time_with_linux/</link><author>/u/Acu17y</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 22:49:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh my god guys, I'm speechless.

Every week we cover as much as possible of what's happening in the world of KDE Plasma and its associated apps like Discover, System Monitor, and more.This week, we've been rapidly fixing the bugs that people found in Plasma 6.3, as well as some older bugs as well. In addition to that, some smaller UI improvements have started to trickle in! There's some larger work in progress too, but not merged yet. Have a look at what did merge this week:Improved the weather widget's display of search results from the BBC weather service to reduce unhelpful visual noise. (Ismael Asensio, link)Eliminated the visual difference between how Night Light looks on Wayland compared to on X11. (Xaver Hugl, link)The Digital Clock widget's context menu is now less cluttered with things you're not likely to use. (Nate Graham, link)Rephrased some settings on System Settings' General Behavior page to be clearer about what it is that they actually do. (Nate Graham, link)Improved the accessibility of the Widget Explorer sidebar. (Christoph Wolk, link)Fixed the issue mentioned last week where KWin built with LTO on GCC 15 could show a black screen on login when using an ICC profile; we found a way to restructure the code that avoids the issue. (Vlad Zahorodnii and Xaver Hugl, link)Fixed a case where Plasma could crash when you tried to access the Properties dialog for a file in the Recently or Frequently Used file lists in the Kickoff Application Launcher. (Nicolas Fella, link)Fixed a regression that caused the volume change OSD to fail to appear when adjusting the volume with the integrated volume buttons of a Bluetooth headset. (David Redondo, link)Fixed a regression that caused the + clipboard popup to lose its visual highlights when navigated by keyboard. (Christoph Wolk, link)Fixed an issue in KWin that caused the new "Prefer efficiency" option when using an ICC profile to not actually be very efficient on some hardware, and another one that broke Night Light while using the "Prefer color accuracy" setting. (Xaver Hugl, link 1 and link 2)Taking screenshots on Wayland in FreeBSD now works. (Vlad Zahorodnii, link)Fixed a few bugs in the Color Picker widget, such as the shortcut option not working, and the tooltip not looking correct in certain circumstances. (Christoph Wolk, link 1 and link 2)Fixed a bug with the Task Manager widgets that broke the ability to move the pointer diagonally to a tooltip without dismissing it by accident while using a right-to-left language like Arabic or Hebrew. (Christoph Wolk, link)Made several improvements and fixes for keyboard navigation in the Kicker Application Menu widget. (Christoph Wolk, link 1, link 2, and link 3)Fixed a regression that caused desktop icons selected by dragging a box around them to become inappropriately deselected if the pointer ended right over one of the icons when releasing the mouse button. (David Edmundson, link)Fixed a regression that caused the automatic tablet mode feature to accidentally get blocked on certain types of devices, but only when using the feature to re-bind mouse buttons. (Vlad Zahorodnii, link)Fixed a bug that caused the desktop and panels to go missing when applying a new Global Theme and using the option to replace the existing layout. This also fixed a bug that caused deleted widgets to not be deleted from the plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc config file. (Marco Martin, link 1 and link 2)Fixed a set of subtle bugs in the implementation of the new "prefer symbolic icons" behavior of the System Tray that caused it to actually do the opposite, showing you colorful icons instead! (Nate Graham and David Redondo, link 1 and link 2)Extremely long weather station names no longer overflow and break the widget popup's layout. (Ismael Asensio, link)The inline file renaming text field on the desktop is now colored correctly when using a mixed light/dark setup, as with Breeze Twilight. (Evgeniy Harchenko, link)Limited the Power Management setting "Change screen brightness" to only take effect for built-in screens on battery-powered systems (e.g. laptops), which avoids certain timing-related brightness bugs for external monitors and makes the settings page less confusing. (Jakob Petsovits, link)Fixed an issue that could cause user switching from KRunner to behave strangely and eventually cause a crash. (David Edmundson, link)Fixed an older regression that broke the "highlight non-default settings" features for pages in System Settings written using QtWidgets. The fact that this was overlooked for so long goes to show how few are left these days! (David Redondo, link)Switched KWin's render loop initialization code to use a more precise type of timer that should reduce frame drops. (Apostolos Dimitromanolakis, link)When the  daemon crashes, now it automatically restarts itself in the background.

However half of the budget being covered means half of it isn’t. Or in other words: the Foundation is not yet sustainable, despite running on the strictest possible budget, and is burning through its (relatively small) reserves. And we are at the point where the end of the road is in sight.The Matrix.org Foundation exists to act as a neutral  and to nurture it as efficiently as possible as a single unfragmented standard, for the greater benefit of the whole ecosystem, not benefiting or privileging any single player or subset of players.Without the Foundation and its programs, the Matrix protocol itself faces existential threats:Without Trust & Safety efforts, bad actors and communities would proliferate on the network and make it unlivable for the rest.Without a canonical specification, the shared infrastructure and a Spec Core Team to maintain it, the protocol would become fragmented, losing its effective interoperability – increasing the costs on all downstream users.Without a neutral entity as the custodian of the specification, the ecosystem would first shatter and then consolidate around the biggest (likely for-profit) actor.Without advocacy, conferences, documentation and tutorials, Matrix would become a niche protocol used by a few enthusiasts for side projects, whilst big proprietary and siloed networks continue to hold the world’s communications.But there is light at the end of the tunnel! Concretely, the Foundation delivers most of its value by fostering a healthy, fair and fertile ecosystem around Matrix. It needs to strike the right balance between:Making Matrix accessible & visible.For the general public it means maintaining an easy default onboarding server (Matrix.org).For server administrators it means providing the right tooling to keep their users (and themselves!) safe.For developers it means making it easy to develop products using Matrix, via documentation, tutorials, and in-person events.Making Matrix compelling to build on.This means maintaining the Matrix Specification as a canonical, unencumbered, patent free and royalty free specification.Being responsive and vendor-neutral when an organisation or individual contributes.Promoting the good players within the ecosystem.Ensuring the network grows and attracts more users.Making Matrix a product that benefits the greater good.This means ensuring that the general public can easily build safe & easy to use communities on Matrix.Ensuring that bad actors are proactively chased and discouraged to use Matrix.Matrix has been here for 10 years, and will hopefully be here for many more! But to continue to grow and thrive, it needs the Foundation to be around and healthy, which means carefully allocating its budget in order to continue to exist and fulfill its mission. This is why it needs to focus on critical programs and shut down some of its activities.We view the following programs as critical to the Foundation’s mission:Maintaining the canonical, backwards compatible, stable Matrix SpecDeveloping protocol enhancements and Trust and Safety tooling, making the tools available to the ecosystem and moderating the servers under its control (typically Matrix.org) - see our recent blog postRunning the Matrix.org homeserver as an initial home for newcomersPromoting the Matrix protocol via online content, conferences and meet-ups and other marketing strategiesWe might fine tune our approach, but we can't cease any of those programs without severe consequences for the ecosystem.Meanwhile, bridges have been at the heart of Matrix for a long time. Public bridges hosted by the Matrix.org Foundation have been a very good resource to show the power of interoperability, connect communities together, and onboard many people into their Matrix journey.However, these bridges require regular maintenance as the bridged platforms evolve their APIs, and significant engineering and moderation support to run. Luckily, the Matrix ecosystem is now more mature than it was at the time we spun up those public Slack, XMPP and IRC bridge instances. There are now commercial players like Beeper providing a user-friendly offering for people who want to get all their conversations in a single app, or IndieHosters and Fairkom offering hosting for Matrix server and bridge instances (and much more).So unless the Foundation manages to raise $100,000 of funding by the end of March 2025, we will have to focus our resources on the critical lines of work, and consequently we will have to shut down all the remaining bridges hosted by the Matrix.org Foundation. This includes bridges to Slack, XMPP, OFTC (IRC), and Snoonet (IRC). We will also mark the software behind those bridges as archived, as we don't have the resources to accept new contributions.In practice, the Foundation needs an additional $610K in revenue to break-even, but this $100K would extend our runway 1 month while we work on landing grants and new members. To put this in context, we nearly doubled our revenue in 2024, reaching $561K, but it was also the first year in which we carried the full cost of our operations: $1.2M. To make ends meet, we liquidated $283K worth of cryptocurrency donations and ended the year with a $356K deficit. We are currently on target for $587K revenue in 2025, with a modest increase in expenses.🔗Growing the ecosystem and the networkChoosing to shut the bridges down is a difficult decision to make, but will allow us to focus on the critical projects which will keep the ecosystem growing. The success of Matrix depends on how widely it is used by the general public and by organisations – preferably natively rather than via bridges.The more people and organisations rely on Matrix, the more attractive it becomes for organisations to build products and services on top of it, the more funding the Foundation gets, and the more the Foundation can in turn reinvest into the ecosystem and run initiatives that benefit all stakeholders for the growth of the network.Once the Foundation is cashflow positive, it will be able to accelerate and eventually get on with the multiple projects the team and Governing Board have in mind to make Matrix fun, exciting, reliable, safe, easy to use, and above all useful. And we hope to get there by the end of the year.Most importantly, despite the Trust and Safety team being the Foundation’s biggest expense, as explained in our blog post, the team is still underresourced: they are understaffed and under a lot of pressure to deliver protocol improvements, better tooling for server admins, and ensure Matrix.org is a good citizen of the open federation. T&S will be the first area to see increased funding.Separately, the Foundation wants to continue executing on its mission! Among others, better connect the doers in the ecosystem with the people and organisations who need their energy, share the successes and learnings from the community: the Matrix Conference was an incredible success and we want to see more of that.We’ve also seen a clear change in how many users and organisations were adopting Matrix in the last few months: the world needs a decentralised end-to-end encrypted network to communicate more than ever, and it shows! We want to uplift the good players which are driving this growth.There is so much more that we could do to make Matrix better and realise its full potential. Right now, the Foundation urgently needs your financial help. For the sake of a safe network, our primary focus today, but also to be able to deliver on the reason we all want Matrix to succeed.People should have full control over their own communication.People should not be locked into centralised communication silos, but instead be free to pick who hosts their communication without limiting who they can reach.The ability to converse securely and privately is a basic human right.Communication should be available to everyone as a free and open, unencumbered, standard and global network.If you are an organisation building on top of Matrix, you can help by , which also gives you the opportunity to be eligible to participate in the Governing Board, and other perks. If you are an organisation buying Matrix services or products, you can help by ensuring that your vendor is financially contributing back to the project or becoming a member yourself.If you are an individual using Matrix, you can help by .If you are a philanthropist or other funder, you can help by getting in touch with us at  to discuss funding options. It isn’t the firsttime we’ve rung the alarm bell, and it is no fun to beg for help. We are at a crossroads, where the vibrancy of the ecosystem and enthusiasm around Matrix is not reflected in the support the Foundation gets, and we are at risk of losing this common resource and all it offers.But all in all, we are optimists – we wouldn’t have begun this journey if we weren’t – and we believe that there are people out there who realise that sovereign and secure communication is as high on the list of today’s essential technology – if not higher – as ensuring AI is safe, so let’s spread the word and let’s continue working on a safer and more sovereign world!

It safeguards all data on your hard drive by encrypting it and makes it unreadable without an decryption key. This level of protection is vital for preventing unauthorized access if your laptop or desktop is lost or stolen.FDE with openSUSE is both user-friendly and powerful. The setup with advanced security features is easy.For users seeking feature parity with Windows BitLocker, openSUSE offers Full Disk Encryption (FDE) secured by a TPM2 chip or a FIDO2 key. This advanced setup enhances security by storing encryption keys within the TPM, which ensures that only a trusted system configuration can unlock the disk. For a step-by-step guide on enabling this feature, read the Quickstart in Full Disk Encryption with TPM and YaST2 article.Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up FDE on your system:Step 1: Download and Boot openSUSEVisit get.opensuse.org to download the latest version of openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed.Restart your computer and boot from the USB drive to begin the installation process.Step 2: Configure Encryption During InstallationOnce the installer starts, select your preferred language and keyboard layout.In the partitioning setup, choose Guided Setup with Encrypted LVM.Set a strong passphrase for encryption. This passphrase will be required every time the system boots.   - Use a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters for optimal security.Proceed with the installation as directed by the installer.Step 3: Verify Encryption SettingsAfter installation is complete and the system restarts, you’ll be prompted to enter your encryption passphrase. Once entered, openSUSE tools will decrypt the disk and boot normally. To confirm encryption is active:Open a terminal or console.Run the command  to verify that your disk is listed with the encryption type (e.g., ).The output might look something similar to the following:NAME        FSTYPE      FSVER LABEL UUID                                   FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT

While FDE protects your data, it does not prevent data loss from hardware failure or accidental deletion. Regularly back up your data to an encrypted external drive or a secure cloud service to ensure its safety.Enhanced Security for Modern ChallengesSetting up full disk encryption on openSUSE not only protects your data but also aligns with the Upgrade to Freedom campaign’s mission of empowering users to maintain control over their hardware and privacy. By combining open-source software with good security practices, openSUSE ensures that users can confidently embrace a more secure digital future.For additional guidance and community support, visit the openSUSE forums or join discussions at your local Linux user group. Please be aware that some hardward configurations may require additional drivers or BIOS settings adjustments for full disk encryption to fully function properly. Check your device’s compatibility and update your firmware before proceeding. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COSMIC Alpha 6: Big Leaps Forward</title><link>https://blog.system76.com/post/cosmic-alpha-6-big-leaps-forward</link><author>/u/Schnurres</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:40:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Our COSMIC mission continues! This month, we finished up some essential features and fixes in preparation for the upcoming beta alongside some amazing COSMIC contributors. Check out what’s new in Alpha 6, and make sure you’re fully updated to see these changes for yourself!Desktop Zoom can now be activated in Settings > Accessibility, from the Accessibility applet in the panel, or using the shortcuts Super + =, Super + -, or Super + Mouse Scroll.More accessibility features in the books! Clicking the Accessibility icon at login gives you access to various settings toggles for:Reads on-screen text aloud Scrolling up while holding Super magnifies the region of the screen where your cursor is locatedNavigates you to Accessibility SettingsAdditional accessibility features for high-contrast, color inversion and various color filters for colorblindness are being worked on soon.Desktop view is now supported in COSMIC. Right-clicking an empty desktop and selecting “Desktop view options” opens a settings window for your desktop. Show or hide desktop folders, drives, or the Trash; you can also adjust icon size and spacing between icons from this window. A fix for the window appearing below other windows will arrive in a later update. Files and folders can also be dragged between the desktop view and COSMIC Files.Additional Scaling OptionsAn additional scaling setting has been added to scale the screen slightly, from 5% to 20% larger. For example, on a display set to 125% scaling, those desiring larger text can use this new setting to increase scaling to 130%, 135%, 140%, or 145%.Workspaces received some updates to really make the feature sparkle. For starters, you can now scroll between workspaces in the overview as a quick and easy way of navigating to your intended destination. Clicking on the preview of the current workspace or empty space in the workspace overview will allow you to exit the workspace view.Previews for horizontal workspace now include name and number. Workspace previews on rotated displays will show the correct orientation. The last workspace is now removed if it follows another empty workspace.Additionally, minimized windows can now be dragged and dropped between workspaces, while windows can be moved to another display by dropping them in the workspace overview. Dragging a window out of a stack will match expectations and no longer move the whole stack. Window titles in the overview are now at the top left of the window and match the users theme. Additional workspace features, including pinned workspaces, will arrive in a future update.Windows Gravitate to EdgesToggling on “Floating windows gravitate to nearby edges” in Window Management Settings will automatically align a window’s edge to the adjacent screen border when dragged close to it, removing the struggle of aligning it with the edge manually.If a search in the Launcher yields more than eight entries, users can now scroll to see the additional options. In addition, the Launcher has been updated to trigger a countdown timer whenever Power Off, Restart, and Log Out are selected, matching the behavior of the Power applet.File path completion is now in COSMIC Files. Hitting the Down arrow when typing a file path into the search bar will automatically finish the file path you’re searching for. Meanwhile, copying a file allows pasting of the file path in other applications. COSMIC Files uses Home and End keys for navigating the app. You can now compress and extract password protected zip files and drag selecting will scroll the content window.Copy/paste using the middle mouse button has been implemented. Sweet convenience.A nav bar has been added for viewing folders in a tree view to display the video files available to open in the Media Player. File menu options have also been completed:When a music file is playing, the Media Player image will display the song title, album, artist, and year released. Down the line we’d like to explore adding further metadata, such as album artwork and song lyrics. Mpris control has been added to show and control currently-playing media in the sound applet, and the scrubber now moves to a second line for improved single-column usability.A Revert all changes feature has been added to COSMIC Edit to revert your file back to the most recent saved state. If you decide to scrap everything or start a new file from scratch, go to File > Close Project to remove the project from the NavBar and bring up a new document and tab. When multiple tabs are open, cycle project tabs using Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab shortcuts.Zoom has also been implemented. Zoom in and out from the View menu, or using Ctrl + or Ctrl - shortcuts. Reset back to default using Ctrl + 0.Opens Sans replaces Fira Sans as the default font for COSMIC. The team liked Open Sans for its better legibility, glyph and language support, and a more modern aesthetic. Likewise, Noto Sans Mono will be used for the default monospace font.Memory usage has been greatly reduced in a number of areas, including minimize, COSMIC Files, and workspaces. A related update made to libcosmic should prevent memory fragmentation. In addition, optimizations to cosmic-text and freedesktop-icons have reduced memory usage across all COSMIC apps and applets.A Whole Swarm of Bug Fixes…and More!Fixed a bug with server-side decorations that caused the cursor to drag a window after a single clickWhen clicking an app icon of an app with multiple windows opened, window previews now adapt to the size and shape of the windowImplemented a fix in cosmic-comp related to keyboard grabbing after a window is focusedImplemented behavior to COSMIC Files for exiting the context menuCOSMIC Files now changes view away from the external drive after the drive is mounted and removedImplemented a fix for COSMIC Files attempting to read an unreadable .hidden fileFixed a crash involving the file picker related to a11y in libcosmicCOSMIC Terminal now uses a hollow block cursor design when the window is unfocusedRemoved Spell Check menu option from COSMIC Edit, to be returned once the feature existsIn COSMIC Edit, “Find” searches now highlight all occurrences, and the currently selected item is highlighted at a higher opacityScrolling now occurs as expected when dragging to highlight text in COSMIC EditSaving a root or read-only file in COSMIC Edit now prompts the user for their password, removing the need to run the application as rootScreenshot tool now respects the user’s time zone when naming screenshot filesImplemented a fix preventing icons from disappearing from the screenshot toolFixed a bug preventing the Delete key from moving a desktop file to the TrashImplemented a fix for a bug causing Steam to crashFixed an issue causing some Radeon RX users to be unable to log inThe context menu in COSMIC Settings now closes when another option is selected in the NavBarImplemented the ability to import environment variables from systemdFixed a regression with libcosmic affecting the ComboBox widgetAdded a slight delay when the cursor hovers from one applet to the next to account for intentAdded support for using the middle mouse button to copy/pasteClicking next/previous month in the calendar widget no longer selects the dayResolved a bug with Firefox not recognizing it’s the default web browser when it’s not set as the default mail clientRemoved WPS suggestion from the WiFi applet when WPS is not supportedAdded support to cosmic-bg for compositors without fractional scaling supportPop!_OS 24.04 Linux kernel updated to version 6.12.10Head to the COSMIC page for a fresh install of Alpha 6.

It took me a while for me to return to GNOME as I was discovering KDE Plasma's (5.24) customization potential. I loved it at first, but I noticed how the DE slowly became unstable after a lot of customising (Plasma has GREATLY improved by now, last time I tried 5.27 on Q4OS and it was blazing fast and rock solid). I was annoyed at how people took a liking to the hideous DE known as GNOME, and for me there was little difference between it and Windows 8, as they were basically tablet centric with GNOME and it's wasted space. I eventually got tired of Plasma, because it had way too many features that I didn´t wan´t to use. Tried XFCE, MATE and Budgie, and they felt too outdated for my liking; Budgie felt off. I decided to give GNOME a shot and installed Ubuntu 22.04. For once I was starting to like GNOME. It felt more unified and simple than KDE, but just more modern than the other desktops. However, this was NOT stock GNOME. I installed vanilla GNOME on the same OS and decided to give it a shot. Moving on from Ubuntu's Yaru theme to Adwaita felt like a MASSIVE downgrade. Except the looks, GNOME's true workflow actually started to make sense to me and it was more productive than any desktop I tried. Of course, I installed some extensions like Blur my Shell, but I can use GNOME without extensions nowadays. As I'm writing this, GNOME 48 would bring a new Adwaita font with Inter as it's base, which will improve the looks of GNOME by a bit, IMO. Currently using Zorin OS, which has a GNOME theme that is MILES better compared to Libadwaita / Adwaita.  What I understood is GNOME is not all about looks, it makes the UI simpler and easier to understand, with ONLY the things you need, and it stays out of your way and focuses on your work. It might be dumbing down the desktop for some, but that's exactly what GNOME's for. A solid philosophy IMO- but definitely lagging in some important areas. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How donations helped the LibreOffice project and community in 2024</title><link>https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2025/02/21/how-your-donations-helped-the-libreoffice-project-in-2024/</link><author>/u/themikeosguy</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 09:28:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thank you for visiting our website and your interest in our services and products.

While I'm not a developer myself, I've found another way to contribute: filing bug reports.I'll admit my early attempts were probably pretty rough – missing crucial context and details. But practice makes perfect (or at least close!), and these days my bug reports are often addressed within a day or so.There's something incredibly satisfying about uncovering a problem, meticulously documenting it, submitting a report, seeing it assigned to someone, and finally witnessing the fix. It's a tangible way to make a difference in the software we all rely on.This level of responsiveness and respect simply doesn't exist in proprietary ecosystems. I've tried reporting bugs on Windows and macOS with little success – it often feels like shouting into the void. But in the open-source world, even smaller projects welcome contributions and treat you seriously.So, I encourage everyone to embrace bug reporting! Start with a simpler project to get comfortable with the process, then gradually tackle more complex ones. Not only will you be improving the software for everyone, but you'll also experience that warm glow of knowing you made a positive impact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Torvalds rips into Hellwig for blocking Rust for Linux</title><link>https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/CAHk-=wgLbz1Bm8QhmJ4dJGSmTuV5w_R0Gwvg5kHrYr4Ko9dUHQ@mail.gmail.com/</link><author>/u/eugay</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:49:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Installed Ubuntu on my Nan&apos;s laptop:</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iueq5x/installed_ubuntu_on_my_nans_laptop/</link><author>/u/Unique_Ad4547</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:18:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Libreboot 20241206, 10th revision released!

The changelog on this page is written, relative to Libreboot 20241206 revision 9 which was released on 12 February 2025. The  Libreboot 20241206 release came out on 6 December 2024. You can find the full list of revisions here and the original release here.Open source BIOS/UEFI firmware[link]Libreboot is a free/open source BIOS/UEFI replacement on x86 and ARM, providing boot firmware that initialises the hardware in your computer, to then load an operating system (e.g. Linux/BSD). It is specifically a , in the same way that Debian is a Linux distribution. It provides an automated build system to produce coreboot ROM images with a variety of payloads such as GRUB or SeaBIOS, with regular well-tested releases to make coreboot as easy to use as possible for non-technical users. From a project management perspective, this works in  the same way as a Linux distro, providing a source-based package manager (called lbmk) which patches sources and compiles coreboot images. It makes use of coreboot for hardware initialisation, and then a payload such as SeaBIOS or GRUB to boot your operating system; on ARM(chromebooks), we provide  (as a coreboot payload).We also provide an experimental U-Boot setup on x86, as a coreboot payload for providing a minimal UEFI implementation.Normally, revisions would only be documented on the Libreboot 20241206 revisions page, but this revision contains , so it was decided that there should be a full announcement, to ensure that more people see it.Summarised list of changes[link]GRUB released  to its main branch, fixing a large number of security issues. You can read about them here:This updates GRUB to revision 4dc6166571645780c459dde2cdc1b001a5ec844c from 18 February 2025. Several OOB heap writes, buffer overflows, use after frees and so on, are now prevented with this update.In addition to the security fixes, several out-of-tree fixes from Libreboot’s main branch have been merged for GRUB, fixing bugs in the xHCI driver, and adding support for non-root USB2 hubs on platforms that use the  GRUB tree.Changes to the GRUB configuration have been made, to make scanning of LVM volume/group names more reliable, including on full-disk-encryption setups.

I’m glad to finally start paying my blogging debt :) as this
is something I’ve been planning to do for quite some time now. To get the
ball rolling, I’ve shared some bits about me in my very first blog post
Olá Mundo.In this article, I’m going to walk through what we’ve been working on
since last year in the Chromium Ozone/Wayland project, on which I’ve
been involved (directly or indirectly) since I’ve joined Igalia back in
2018.Lets start with some context, the project consists of implementing,
shipping and maintaining native Wayland support in the
Chromium project. Our team at Igalia has been leading the
effort since it was first merged upstream back in 2016. For more
historical context, there are a few blogposts and this amazing talk, by my colleagues
Antonio Gomes and Max Ihlenfeldt, presented at last year’s Web Engines
Hackfest.Especially due to the Lacros project, progresses on Linux
Desktop has been slower over the last few years. Fortunately, the
scenario changed since last year, when a new sponsor came up and made it
possible to address most of the outstanding missing features and issues
required to move Ozone Wayland to the finish line.It’s been a few months since Chromium Wayland backend has started to be
tested as the main browser backend by Google employees, through a finch
trial experiment, as well as internally at Igalia. Feedback collected
since then is quite positive in general. The exception is Nvidia setups,
which, depending on the driver version, may face major regressions (see
Explicit Sync section below for more details).While official roll-out has been under discussion, it’s still disabled
by default on Linux Desktop. Early adopters willing to test it are
encouraged to explicitly opt-in by flipping the 
chrome flag to  or . Issue reports are welcome at
crbug.com/new.There are also a few other Wayland-specific flags which might be
selectively enabled, if you feel brave enough :) such as, ui scaling,
text input v3, etc; all described in more details below.Chrome Wayland flags available in M135.Initial fractional scaling support for Linux Desktop was originally
implemented by an external contributor back in
2023.
After some months of stabilization, reports of blurriness and some
other subtle issues started to
pop up, which were listed as top-priority when this new project phase
kicked off back in 2024 June.After some analysis, we could confirm that there were some fundamental
missing bits in the process. Which was the actual usage of the fractional
scale values provided by the Wayland compositor, via
the fractional-scale-v1
protocol extension. Rather than using it, fractional scales were being
 using xdg-output
protocol instead, which is unsupported (for such usage) and prone to
precision issues.The screenshot above shows a sharp Chrome window scaled by a 1.25
factor, running on Gnome Shell 47.The work involved a considerable architectural refactoring to make it
possible to support the per-window scaling design of the Wayland
protocol, without breaking the standard per-display scaling implemented
in Chromium. The feature started shipping experimentally in Milestone
128, behind the  chrome flag and disabled by
default until M135. I plan to cover it in more details soon in separate
blog post.IME has been yet another major pain point for some Wayland users. Back
in last June, a careful study was conducted by my colleague Orko
Garai in order to understand and consolidate the
possible approaches to tackle it, as well as pros, cons and potential
road-blockers for each of them. Besides the detailed outcomes of that
study, publicly available in the form of a design
document,
Orko has recently started a blog post series about the topic
here.Experimental support for
text-input-v3
protocol was implemented on the Chromium side, with ongoing work on the
Wayland community side to fullfill browser use cases from a protocol
perspective, which is expected to come soon as part of version
3.2
of the text-input protocol.In the meantime, we keep working with the Chromium community on
improvements to the client-side implementation of the protocol, although
progress has been slow as we are still looking for some key browser
requirements to be solved on the protocol side to have the confidence
and buy-in for productization.Supporting the full original user experience for Chrome’s tab dragging
under Wayland has proved to be complex, especially because the core
Wayland protocol does not cover all of its requirements. Back in 2021,
we designed a brand new protocol and implemented it in ChromeOS’ Exo
Wayland compositor, in the context of Lacros project, to fullfill those
gaps.Years later,
xdg-toplevel-drag
has emerged as a community effort to standardize it upstream, thanks
David Redondo and Robert Mader for working on it. It consists of a
trimmed down version of the original  protocol with
some tweaks to make it more aligned with Wayland design principles. A
few months ago, initial support for it has landed in Chromium and we’ve
been stabilizing it since then.Full UX support in Mutter#Back in last November, xdg-toplevel-drag was
supported
only in KWin and Jay compositors, when a demand to implement support for
it in Mutter was raised by our customer, and the task was assigned to
me.Long story short, it was a pretty interesting and challenging experience
which I’m glad to have had. As a curiosity, last time I had coded in C
and glib had been , maybe >13 years? 😱 Also, it was my
first time hacking on Mutter and Gnome code base. After all, the
MR did
landed and will start shipping as part of Gnome 48, next month.xdg-toplevel-drag-v1 demo on Gnome Shell 48.I’m preparing a blog post to share more technical details about the
protocol implementation from the perspective of a browser developer and
Gnome/Mutter newcomer.Let me take the opportunity to say thanks to the Gnome developers who
helped me a lot in the process: Jonas Ådahl, Carlos Garnacho, Georges
Stavracas and Sebastian Wick. Really appreciate your help and patience,
guys!In parallel to the work on the regular tab drag experience through
xdg-toplevel-drag, a fallback implementation relying solely on core
Wayland drag-and-drop protocol has been led by my colleague Max
Ihlenfeldt. A few days ago, Max has published an awesome in-depth blog
post about his
work on it. Enjoy the read!Fallback tab dragging UX demoThe main difference to the regular UX is that, rather than instantly
creating a browser window when it gets dragged out of its tab strip, a
drag icon containing the tab thumbnail is used instead. Browser window
creation is then deferred to when the drop happens, as can be seen in
the video above. The feature was recently enabled by default, and
started shipping in Chrome 133.Linux desktop environments usually support system-wide “text scaling”
settings, which are supposed to be handled by applications. On
Gnome-based environments, it can be triggered via several ways,
such as the “Large Text” accessibility feature.Historically, it has been supported in Chromium X11 by resizing the
whole browser UI elements, instead of just text items. After an in-depth
analysis, it was decided to follow the very same approach for the
Wayland initial implementation. The main motivation was that there seems
to be gaps in both Chromium’s internal UI framework as well as in
Chrome’s UI/layout code, which would need to be fixed before supporting
such text-only live resizing/relayout.Quick demo of text scale in action on Chromium Wayland on Gnome 47.Technically, the solution involved implementing an additional scaling
layer in Ozone/Wayland, so called “ui scale” which make the browser UI
to get fully resized/re-laid out instantly in reaction to system’s “text
scaling factor” updates.The feature has started shipping in Milestone 131, disabled by default
as usual. Users can enable it by using the chrome://flags/#wayland-ui-scaling
flag.To address some display tearing reports,
support for the linux-drm-syncobj-v1
protocol has been implemented. The patch series has landed and started
shipping in version 132.0.6834.83, and can be enabled using the
wayland-linux-drm-syncobj chrome flag.Feedback has been positive so far. If you’re willing to give it a try,
please bear in mind that Linux kernel version >= 6.11 is required, and
don’t hesitate to get back to us with your remarks.Besides overall stabilization and maintenance, there is a large ongoing
effort led by my colleague Orko to get Chromium’s interactive UI tests
infrastructure and code working with major Wayland compositors,
primary focus is Mutter/Gnome, though wlroots is also considered
for the future.Another area we are currently investigating is “session management”,
which will make it possible to restore browser window attributes, such
as, position, display and workspace across restarts.Aside from that, there are a bunch of technical debt and follow-up
issues which spun off from some of the features and fixes listed above,
such as:New sponsors and partners are always welcome, so please don’t hesitate
to mail us to discuss how we coud be of help.Yay! Quite busy and exciting times!! I’d like to thank once more all of
our supporters, sponsors and, of course, Igalia for making all
this possible ❤️ Looking forward to the challenges ahead! Stay tuned for
more updates and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or
other remarks. 👋👋]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Fedora Project Leader is willfully ignorant about Flathub</title><link>https://blogs.gnome.org/alatiera/2025/02/19/the-fedora-project-leader-is-willfully-ignorant-about-flathub/</link><author>/u/Worldly_Topic</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:12:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I woke up to a link of an interview from the current Fedora Project Leader, Matthew Miller. Brodie who conducted the interview mentioned that Miller was the one that reached out to him. The background of this video was the currently ongoing issue regarding OBS, Bottles and the Fedora project, which Niccolò made an excellent video explaining and summarizing the situation. You can also find the article over at thelibre.news. “Impressive” as this story is, it’s for another time.What I want to talk in this post, is the outrageous, smearing and straight up slanderous statements about Flathub that the Fedora Project Leader made during the interview..I am not directly involved with the Flathub project (A lot of my friends are), however I am a maintainer of the GNOME Flatpak Runtime, and a contributor to the Freedesktop-sdk and ElementaryOS Runtimes. I also maintain applications that get published on Flathub directly. So you can say I am someone invested in the project and that has put a lot of time into it. It was extremely frustrating to hear what would only qualify as reddit-level completely made up arguments with no base in reality coming directly from Matthew Miller.Below is a transcript, slightly edited for brevity, of all the times Flathub and Flatpak was mentioned. You can refer to the original video as well as there were many more interesting things Miller talked about.It starts off with an introduction and some history and around the 10-minute mark, the conversation starts to involve Flathub.Miller: [..] long way of saying I think for something like OBS we’re not really providing anything by packaging that. Miller: I think there is an overall place for the Fedora Flatpaks, because Flathub part of the reason its so popular (there’s a double edged sword), (its) because the rules are fairly lax about what can go into Flathub and the idea is we want to make it as easy for developers to get their things to users, but there is not really much of a reviewThis is not the main reason why Flathub is popular, its a lot more involved and interesting in practice. I will go into this in a separate post hopefully soon.Claiming that Flathub does not have any review process or inclusion policies is straight up wrong and incredibly damaging. It’s the kind of thing we’ve heard ad nauseam from Flathub haters, but never from a person in charge of one of the most popular distributions and that should have really really known better.You can find the Requirements in the Flathub documentation if you spend 30 seconds to google for them, along with the submission guidelines for developers. If those documents qualify as a wild west and free for all, I can’t possibly take you seriously.I haven’t maintained a linux distribution package myself so I won’t go to comparisons between Flathub and other distros, however you can find people, with red hats even, that do so and talked about it. Of course this is one off examples and social bias from my part. But it proves how laughable of a claim is that things are not reviewed. Additionally, the most popular story I hear from developers is how Flathub requirements are often stricter and sometimes cause annoyances.Additionally, Flathub has been the driving force behind encouraging applications to update their metadata, completely reworking the User Experience and handling off permissions and made them prominent to the user. (To the point where even network access is marked as potentially-unsafe).Miller: [..] the thing that says verified just says that it’s verified from the developer themselves.No, verified does not mean that the developer signed off into it. Let’s take another 30 seconds to look into the Flathub documentation page about exactly this.A verified app on Flathub is one whose developer has confirmed their ownership of the app ID […]. This usually also may mean that either the app is maintained directly by the developer or a party authorized or approved by them.It still went through the review process and all the rest of requirements and policies apply. The verified program is basically a badge to tell users this is a supported application by the upstream developers, rather than the free for all that exists currently where you may or may not get an application released from years ago depending on how stable your distribution is.Sidenote, did you know that 1483/3003 applications on Flathub are verified as of the writing of this post? As opposed to maybe a dozen of them at best in the distributions. You can check for yourselfMiller: .. and it doesn’t necessarily verify that it was build with good practices, maybe it was built in a coffee shop on some laptop or whatever which could be infected with malware or whatever could happenAgain if Miller had done the bare minimum effort, he would have come across the Requirements page which describes exactly how an Application in Flathub is built, instead of further spreading made up takes about the infrastructure. I can’t stress enough how damaging it has been throughout the years to claim that “Flathub may be potential Malware”. Why it’s malware? Because I don’t like its vibes and I just assume so..I am sure If I did the same about Fedora in a very very public medium with thousand of listeners I would probably end up with a Layers letter from Redhat.Now Applications in Flathub are all built without a network access, in Flathub’s build servers, using flatpak-builder and Flatpak Manifests which are a declarative format, which means all the sources required to build the application are known, validated/checksumed, the build is reproducible to the extend possible, you can easily inspect the resulting binaries and the manifest itself used to build the application ends up in  which you can also inspect with the following command and use it to rebuild the application yourself exactly like how it’s done in Flathub.The exception to this, are proprietary applications naturally, and a handful of applications (under an OSI approved license) where Flathub developers helped the upstream projects integrate a direct publishing workflow into their Deployment pipelines. I am aware of Firefox and OBS as the main examples, both of which publish in Flathub through their Continues Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline the same way they generate their builds for other platforms they support and the code for how it happens is available on their repos.If you have issues trusting Mozilla’s infrastructure, then how are you trusting Firefox in the first place and good luck auditing gecko to make sure it does not start to ship malware. Surely distribution packagers audit every single change that happens from release to release for each package they maintain and can verify no malicious code ever gets merged. The xz backdoor was very recent, and it was identified by pure chance, none of this prevented it.Then Miller proceeds to describe the Fedora build infrastructure and afterward we get into the following:Miller: I will give an example of something I installed in Flathub, I was trying to get some nice gui thing that would show me like my system Hardware stats […] one of them ones I picked seemed to do nothing, and turns out what it was actually doing, there was no graphical application it was just a script, it was running that script in the background and that script uploaded my system stats to a server somewhere.Firstly we don’t really have many details to be able to identify which application it was, I would be very curious to know. Now speculating on my part, the most popular application matching that description it’s Hardware Probe and it absolutely has a GUI, no matter how minimal. It also asks you before uploading.Maybe there is a org.upload.MySystem application that I don’t know about, and it ended up doing what was in the description, again I would love to know more and update the post if you could recall!Miller: No one is checking for things like that and there’s no necessarily even agreement that that was was bad.Second time! Again with the “There is no review and inclusion process in Flathub” narrative. There absolutely is, and these are the kinds of things that get brought up during it.Miller: I am not trying to be down on Flathub because I think it is a great resourceYes, I can see that, however in your ignorance you were something much worse than “Down”. This is pure slander and defamation, coming from the current “Fedora Project Leader”, the “Technically Voice of Fedora” (direct quote from a couple seconds later). All the statements made above are manufactured and inaccurate. Myths that you’d hear from people that never asked, looked or cared about any of these cause the moment you do you its obvious how laughable all these claims are.Miller: And in a lot of ways Flathub is a competing distribution to Fedora’s packaging of all applications.Precisely, he is spot on here, and I believe this is what kept Miller willfully ignorant and caused him to happily pick the first anit-flatpak/anti-flathub arguments he came across on reddit and repeat the verbatim without putting any thought into it. I do not believe Miller is malicious on purpose, I do truly believe he means well and does not know better.However, we can’t ignore the conflict that arises from his current job position as an big influence to why incidents like this happened. Nor the influence and damage this causes when it comes from a person of Matthew Miller’s position.Miller: One of the other things I wanted to talk about Flatpak, is the security and sandboxing around it. Miller: Like I said the stuff in the Flathub are not really reviewed in detail and it can do a lot of things:Third time with the no review theme. I was fuming when I first heard this, and I am very very angry about still, If you can’t tell. Not only is this an incredibly damaging lie as covered above, it gets repeated over and over again.With Flatpak basically the developer defines what the permissions are. So there is a sandbox, but the sandbox is what the person who put it there is, and one can imagine that if you were to put malware in there you might make your sandboxing pretty loose.Brodie: One of the things you can say is “I want full file system access, and then you can do anything”No, again it’s stated in the Flathub documentation, permissions are very carefully reviewed and updates get blocked when permissions change until another review has happened.Miller: Android and Apple have pretty strong leverage against application developers to make applications work in their sandboxBrodie: the model is the other way around where they request permissions and then the user grants them whereas Flatpak, they get the permission and then you could reject them laterThis is partially correct, the first part about leverage will talk about in a bit, but here’s a primer on how permissions work in Flatpak and how it compares to the sandboxing technologies in iOS and Android.In all of them we have a separation between Static and Dynamic permissions. Static are the ones the application always has access to, for example the network, or the ability to send you notifications. These are always there and are mentioned at install time usually. Dynamic permissions are the ones where the application has to ask the user before being able to access a resource. For example opening a file chooser dialog so the user can upload a file, the application the only gets access to the file the user consented or none. Another example is using the camera on the device and capturing photos/video from it.Brodie here gets a bit confused and only mentions static permissions. If I had to guess it would be cause we usually refer to the dynamic permissions system in the Flatpak world as “Portals”.Miller: it didn’t used to be that way and and in fact um Android had much weaker sandboxing like you could know read the whole file system from one app and things like that […] they slowly tightened it and then app developers had to adjust Miller: I think with the Linux ecosystem we don’t really have the way to tighten that kind of thing on app developers … Flatpak actually has that kind of functionality […] with portals […] but there’s no not really a strong incentive for developers to do that because, you know well, first of all of course my software is not going to be bad so why should I you know work on sandboxing it, it’s kind of extra work and I I don’t know I don’t know how to solve that. I would like to get to the utopian world where we have that same security for applications and it would be nice to be able to install things from completely untrusted places and know that they can’t do anything to harm your system and that’s not the case with it right nowAs with any technology and adoption, we don’t get to perfection from day 1. Static permissions are necessary to provide a migration path for existing applications and until you have developed the appropriate and much more complex dynamic permissions mechanisms that are needed. For example up until iOS 18 it wasn’t possible to give applications access to a subset of your contacts list. Think of it like having to give access your entire filesystem instead of the specific files you want. Similarly partial-only access to your photos library arrived couple years ago in IOS and Android.In an ideal world all permissions are dynamic, but this takes time and resources and adaptation for the needs of applications and the platform as development progresses.Now about the leverage part.I do agree that “the Linux ecosystem” as a whole does not have any leverage on applications developers. This is cause Miller is looking at the wrong place for it. There is no Linux ecosystem but rather Platforms developers target.GNOME and KDE, as they distribute all their applications on Flathub absolutely have leverage. Similarly Flathub itself has leverage by changing the publishing requirements and inclusion guidelines. Which I kept being told they don’t exist.. Every other application that wants to publish also has to adhere by the rules on Flathub. ElementaryOS and their Appcenter has leverage on developers. Canonical does have the same pull as well with the Snapstore. Fedora on the other hand doesn’t have any leverage cause the Fedora Flatpak repository is irrelevant, broken and nobody wants to use it.[..] The xz backdoor gets brought up when discussing dependencies and how software gets composed together.Miller: we try to keep all of those things up to date and make sure everything is patched across the dist even when it’s even when it’s difficult. I think that really is one of the best ways to keep your system secure and because the sandboxing isn’t very strong that can really be a problem, you know like the XZ thing that happened before. If XZ is just one place it’s not that hard of an update but if you’ve got a 100 Flatpaks from different places […] and no consistency to it it’s pretty hard to manage thatI am not going to get in depth about this problem domain and the arguments over it. In fact I have been writing another blog post for a while. I hope to publish shortly. Till then I can not recommend high enough Emmanuele’s and Lennart’s blog posts, as well as one of the very early posts from Alex when Flatpak was in early design phase on the shortcomings of the current distribution model.Now about bundled dependencies. The concept of Runtimes has served us well so far, and we have been doing a pretty decent job providing most of the things applications need but would not want to bundle themselves. This makes the Runtimes a single place for most of the high profile dependencies (curl, openssl, webkitgtk and so on) that you’d frequently update for security vulnerabilities and once it’s done they roll out to everyone without needing to do anything manual to update the applications or even rebuilt them.Applications only need to bundle their direct dependencies,and as mentioned above, the flatpak manifest includes the exact definition of all of them. They are available to anyone to inspect and there’s tooling that can scan them and hopefully in the future alert us.If the Docker/OCI model where you end bundling the entire toolchain, runtime, and now you have to maintain it and keep up with updates and rebuild your containers is good enough for all those enterprise distributions, then the Flatpak model which is much more efficient, streamlined and thought out and much much much less maintenance intensive, it is probably fine.Miller: part of the idea of having a distro was to keep all those things consistent so that it’s easier for everyone, including the developersAs mentioned above, nothing that fundamentally differs from the leverage that Flathub and the Platform Developers have.Brodie: took us 20 minutes to get to an explanation [..] but the tldr Fedora Flatpak is basically it is built off of the Fedora RPM build system and because that it is more well tested and sort of intended, even if not entirely for the Enterprise, designed in a way as if an Enterprise user was going to use it the idea is this is more well tested and more secure in a lot of cases not every case.
Miller: Yea that’s basically itThis is a question/conclusion that Brodie reaches with after the previous statements and by far the most enraging thing in this interview. This is also an excellent example of the damage Matthew Miller caused today and if I was a Flathub developer I would stop on nothing sort of a public apology from the Fedora project itself. Hell I want this just being an application developer that publishes on it. The interview has been basically shitting on both the Developers of Flathub  the people that choose to publish in it. And if that’s not enough there should be an apology just out of decency. Dear god..Brodie: how should Fedora handle upstreams that don’t want to be packaged  like the OBS case here where they did not want there to be a package in Fedora Flatpak or another example is obviously bottles which has made a lot of noise about the packagingLastly I want to touch on this closing question in light of recent events.Miller: I think we probably shouldn’t do it. We should respect people’s wishes there. At least when it is an open source project working in good faith there. There maybe some other cases where the software, say theoretically there’s somebody who has commercial interests in some thing and they only want to release it from their thing even though it’s open source. We might want to actually like, well it’s open source we can provide things, we in that case we might end up you having a different name or something but yeah I can imagine situations where it makes sense to have it packaged in Fedora still but in general especially and when it’s a you know friendly successful open source project we should be friendly yeah. The name thing is something people forget history like that’s happened before with Mozilla with Firefox and Debian.This is an excellent idea! But it gets better:Miller: so I understand why they strict about that but it was kind of frustrating um you know we in Fedora have basically the same rules if you want to take Fedora Linux and do something out of it, make your own thing out of it, put your own software on whatever, you can do that but we ask you not to call it Fedora if it’s a fedora remix brand you can use in some cases otherwise pick your own name it’s all open source but you know the name is ours. yeah and I the Upstream as well it make totally makes sense.Brodie: yeah no the name is completely understandable especially if you do have a trademark to already even if you don’t like it’s it’s common courtesy to not name the thing the exact same thingMiller: yeah I mean and depending on the legalities like you don’t necessarily have to register a trademark to have the trademark kind of protections under things so hopefully lawyers you can stay out of the whole thing because that always makes the situations a lot more complicated, and we can just get along talking like human beings who care about making good software and getting it to users.And I completely agree with all of these, all of it. But let’s break it down a bit because no matter how nice the words and intentions it hasn’t been working out this way with the Fedora community so far.First, Miller agrees the Fedora project should be respecting of application developer’s wishes to not have their application distributed by fedora but rather it be a renamed version if Fedora wishes to keep distributing it.However, every single time a developer has asked for this, they have been ridiculed, laughed at and straight up bullied by Fedora packagers and the rest of the Fedora community. It has been a similar response from other distribution projects and companies as well, it’s not just Fedora. You can look at Bottle’s story for the most recent example. It is very nice to hear Miller’s intentions but means nothing in practice.Then Miller proceeds to assure us why he understand that naming and branding is such a big deal to those projects (unlike the rest of the Fedora community again). He further informs us how Fedora has the exact same policies and asks from people that want to fork Fedora. Which makes the treatment that every single application developer has received when asking about the same exact thing ever more outrageous.What I didn’t know is that in certain cases you don’t even need to have a trademark yet to be covered by some of the protections, depending on jurisdiction and all.And last we come into lawyers. Neither Fedora nor application developers would want it to ever come to this, and it was stated multiple times by Bottles developers that they don’t want to have to file for a trademark so they can be taken seriously. Similarly, OBS developers said how resorting to legal action would be the last thing they would want to do and would rather have the issue resolved before that. But it took until OBS, a project of a high enough profile, with the resources required to acquire a trademark and to threaten legal action before the Fedora Leadership cared to treat application developers like human beings and get the Fedora packagers and community members to comply. (Something which they had stated multiple times they simply couldn’t do).I hate all of this. Fedora and all the other distributions need to do better. They all claim to care about their users but happily keep shipping broken and miss configured software to them over the upstream version, just cause it’s what aligns with their current interests. In this case is the promotion of Fedora tooling and Fedora Flatpaks over the application in Flathub they have no control over. In previous incidents it was about branding applications like the rest of the system even though it was making them unusable. And I can find you and list you with a bunch of examples from other distributions just as easily.They don’t care about their users, they care about their bottom line first and foremost. Any civil attempts at fixing issues get ignored and laughed at, up until there is a threat of a legal action or a big enough PR damage, drama and shitshow that they can’t ignore it anymore and have to backtrack on them.This is my two angry cents. Overall I am not exactly sure how Matthew Miller managed in a rushed and desperate attempt at damage control for the OBS drama, to not only to make it worse, but to piss off the entire Flathub community at the same time. But what’s done is done, let’s see what we can do to address the issues that have festered and persisted for years now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Greg Kroah-Hartman Makes A Compelling Case For New Linux Kernel Drivers To Be Written In Rust</title><link>http://phoronix.com/news/Greg-KH-On-New-Rust-Code</link><author>/u/Xaneris47</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:35:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["As someone who has seen almost EVERY kernel bugfix and security issue for the past 15+ years (well hopefully all of them end up in the stable trees, we do miss some at times when maintainers/developers forget to mark them as bugfixes), and who sees EVERY kernel CVE issued, I think I can speak on this topic.
The majority of bugs (quantity, not quality/severity) we have are due to the stupid little corner cases in C that are totally gone in Rust. Things like simple overwrites of memory (not that rust can catch all of these by far), error path cleanups, forgetting to check error values, and use-after-free mistakes.  That's why I'm wanting to see Rust get into the kernel, these types of issues just go away, allowing developers and maintainers more time to focus on the REAL bugs that happen (i.e. logic issues, race conditions, etc.)
I'm all for moving our C codebase toward making these types of problems impossible to hit, the work that Kees and Gustavo and others are doing here is wonderful and totally needed, we have 30 million lines of C code that isn't going anywhere any year soon.  That's a worthy effort and is not going to stop and should not stop no matter what.
But for new code / drivers, writing them in rust where these types of bugs just can't happen (or happen much much less) is a win for all of us, why wouldn't we do this?  C++ isn't going to give us any of that any decade soon, and the C++ language committee issues seem to be pointing out that everyone better be abandoning that language as soon as possible if they wish to have any codebase that can be maintained for any length of time.
Rust also gives us the ability to define our in-kernel apis in ways that make them almost impossible to get wrong when using them.  We have way too many difficult/tricky apis that require way too much maintainer review just to "ensure that you got this right" that is a combination of both how our apis have evolved over the years (how many different ways can you use a 'struct cdev' in a safe way?) and how C doesn't allow us to express apis in a way that makes them easier/safer to use.  Forcing us maintainers of these apis to rethink them is a GOOD thing, as it is causing us to clean them up for EVERYONE, C users included already, making Linux better overall.
And yes, the Rust bindings look like magic to me in places, someone with very little Rust experience, but I'm willing to learn and work with the developers who have stepped up to help out here.  To not want to learn and change based on new evidence (see my point about reading every kernel bug we have.)
Rust isn't a "silver bullet" that will solve all of our problems, but it sure will help in a huge number of places, so for new stuff going forward, why wouldn't we want that?
Linux is a tool that everyone else uses to solve their problems, and here we have developers that are saying "hey, our problem is that we want to write code for our hardware that just can't have all of these types of bugs automatically".
Why would we ignore that?
Yes, I understand our overworked maintainer problem (being one of these people myself), but here we have people actually doing the work!
Yes, mixed language codebases are rough, and hard to maintain, but we are kernel developers dammit, we've been maintaining and strengthening Linux for longer than anyone ever thought was going to be possible. We've turned our development model into a well-oiled engineering marvel creating something that no one else has ever been able to accomplish. Adding another language really shouldn't be a problem, we've handled much worse things in the past and we shouldn't give up now on wanting to ensure that our project succeeds for the next 20+ years.  We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together.

On top of all the recent x86/x86_64 Linux kernel crypto improvements made recently by Google engineer Eric Biggers to better laverage AVX-512 and other modern x86 ISA features, a new patch-set posted today by Biggers would help make all x86/x86_64 kernel encryption/decryption at least slightly faster.
The new patch series isn't about making use of some new CPU ISA features or anything wild like that but rather just cleaning up some existing code so that the x86 kernel-mode FPU always works reliably with soft IRQs so that some old SIMD helper crypto fallback code can be removed. That fallback code was "really bad for performance" and presented performance implications for those not even needing to rely on it.
In turn this code to remove the no-SIMD encryption/decryption fallbacks can help with performance by a few percent or even as much as a 23% improvement has been noted for AES-XTS.
Eric Biggers explained with this RFC patch series:
"This patchset fixes a longstanding issue where kernel-mode FPU (i.e., SIMD) was not reliably usable in softirqs in x86, which was creating the need for a fallback.  The fallback was really bad for performance, and it even hurt performance for users that never encountered the edge case where kernel-mode FPU was not usable.
This patchset aligns x86 with other architectures such as arm, arm64, and riscv by making kernel-mode FPU work in softirqs reliably.  There are a few possible ways to achieve that, and for now I just went with the simplest way; see patch 1 for details.
Patch 2 eliminates all uses of the "crypto SIMD helper" from x86, as patch 1 makes it unnecessary.  For the RFC it is just one big patch; I'll probably split patch 2 up if this progresses past RFC status.
Performance results have been positive.  All en/decryption is now slightly faster on x86, as it no longer take a detour through crypto/simd.c.  I get a 7% or 23% improvement for AES-XTS, for example.
I also benchmarked bidirectional IPsec, which has been claimed to often hit the edge case where kernel-mode FPU was previously not usable in softirq context.  Ultimately, I was not actually able to reproduce that edge case being reached unless I reduced the number of CPUs to 1, in which case it then started being occasionally reached.  Regardless, even without that case being reached, IPsec throughput still improved by 2%. In situations where that case was being reached, or where users required a synchronous algorithm, a much larger improvement should be seen."Great work and beyond the performance benefits, cleaning up this old fallback/helpers introduces just 100 lines of code while dropping 360 lines of existing code.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mesa 25.0.0 Release Notes / 2025-02-19 — The Mesa 3D

privacy reasons and will now stay because Linux made using a PC fun again. In a way using Linux is like back then when PCs where new and, for the most part, something creative. Where Windows kept evolving and everything was new and exciting. Linux, probably due to its open source nature, still feels exactly like that. Tons of ways to use it, tons of distros, you can tinker with it however you want to. It obviously has flaws when all you know is Windows where most things work out of the box but the gained freedom is just worth SO much more. In a way the same applies to everything FOSS. If there is one thing I grew tired of in todays digital world its how utterly corporate and sanitized everything is. Everything needs to be as foolproof as possible, everything needs to be as inoffensive as possible and because of that you get told what youre allowed to do. Linux and the whole FOSS community is the exact opposite. You actually need to do your research, You need to tinker but in return youre the one who tells your software what its allowed to do and what not. All kinds of DEs, everyone uses Linux different. Its really nostalgic and still has the magic from the past. Depending on your usecase and hardware using Linux is rough at times, frustrating even, but I honestly wouldnt want it any different.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Simple TUI SQLite Browser</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1itbtzn/simple_tui_sqlite_browser/</link><author>/u/JonkeroTV</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:56:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[JDbrowser is small and simple application to browse an SQLite database with a Text User Interface.

They run fast and snappy with SSDs.We found that even with a TPM 2.0, they don't meet the CPU requirements. My partner is not tech savvy at all but usually plays older games and some steam indie games, most of which run on his laptop and if not that, our desktop.This is where we finally decided to be the change regarding big corporations that really don't care. From cars that won't start without an update to trying to force decommissioning of good hardware seeing as moores law has long since ended. 3 working computers don't go into landfill even if a single capacitor pops in this house, as why waste money and ruin the environment more? The most we do is replace the batteries. I prefer older business grade hardware when I get it as that stuff doesn't seem to break. A surface laptop got all of 3 years before it's screen began to fail.So I realised Linux would be our only option. I've been away years (was on Ubuntu for a while, then windows 7 came out and I immensely liked the OS), until I tried Kubuntu. Fast, stable and so snappy. Like everything just opens instantly. Light footprint. Even has an 'app store' kind of thing, good for a layman.With wine all my partner's games run, and steam with proton makes gaming on Linux a reality. I used the terminal to set things up for us, as I'm the one with the tech knowledge in the house.And my partner said it looks and feels almost identical to windows. He's not tech savvy at all, I set it up, but once running he can install windows apps as he normally would and use native ones.We both have the view the windows 11 requirements were probably one last grab to get everyone to buy new PCs with their distribution partners and finally got rid of Microsoft. Currently windows 10 is still on our NAS box but that will change when it reaches end of support. I swapped paying for cloud storage to occasionally rotating HDDs at friends houses and keeping a small free one to upload encrypted small rapidly changing data sets.Shocked that Kubuntu even came with a working office suite that didn't have to be installed, absolutely free. A hidden gem for the layman.I do wish they still did .deb files though, makes it easy to keep offline setup files. I just fished them out of the cache.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Server Setup - Part 2: What’s Next After Installation</title><link>https://linuxblog.io/linux-server-after-installation/</link><author>/u/Unprotectedtxt</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:52:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Setting up a Linux server is rewarding and opens up all kinds of possibilities. You can run a personal website, a media server, or cloud storage—there’s so much potential. By following foundational steps like choosing the right distribution, configuring SSH, and enabling firewalls, you already have a secure and flexible platform.If you’ve already followed the basics from Linux Server Setup – Part 1, then it’s time to dig deeper into monitoring, logging, troubleshooting, and additional tools to keep your Linux server running at peak performance. Monitoring, Logs, and TroubleshootingMonitoring, logging, and troubleshooting are the keys to a stable and performant Linux server. Monitoring tools provide real-time insights, logs reveal detailed events, and troubleshooting ensures that issues are resolved quickly. Let’s break this down, starting with monitoring tools.Installing System Monitoring Tools (examples)The  command is usually already installed by default. However, here’s how you can install some other useful command-line server monitoring tools:: A more interactive and visually appealing alternative to . It allows you to sort and manage processes with ease.sudo apt install htop  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install htop  # Fedora/RHEL (Alma, Rocky, etc): Offers a broader overview of system performance, including disk I/O and network activity, in a single dashboard.sudo apt install glances  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install glances  # Fedora/RHELIn addition to real-time monitoring, understanding system logs is crucial for diagnosing issues and ensuring your server runs smoothly. Logs (Datadog is a blog partner) help diagnose issues with services and provide insights into server behavior. Tools like  can assist in reviewing logs for specific services, making troubleshooting more effective.Logs are invaluable for diagnosing and resolving server issues. They provide detailed insights into server behavior and errors. Here’s how to use logs effectively when troubleshooting a Linux server:: System logs are typically found in . Common logs include:
 or  for general system events. for authentication events. or  for web server logs.: For systems using ,  provides an efficient way to view logs:
journalctl -u sshd
journalctl -b  # Logs from the current boot: Use  to filter logs for specific terms:
grep "error" /var/log/syslogMonitor Logs in Real-Time: Use  to watch logs as they are updated:
tail -f /var/log/auth.logUnderstanding and analyzing logs regularly can help you detect potential issues early and ensure the long-term stability of your server.Troubleshooting Common IssuesWhen setting up a new Linux server, errors and issues can arise. Being able to troubleshoot common problems effectively is a vital skill for maintaining uptime and ensuring the smooth operation of your server. Let’s look at resolving connection issues and also how to use logs when troubleshooting Linux.Debugging Connection ProblemsHere are some steps to troubleshooting common networking issues:Verify Network Configuration: Ensure your server has the correct IP address, gateway, and DNS settings. Use tools like  or  to check network interfaces and  to test connectivity.: Review your firewall settings to confirm that required ports are open. Use commands such as:
sudo ufw status
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all: If SSH is not working, try verbose mode to get detailed output:
ssh -v username@your_server_ip: Ensure the necessary services are running:
sudo systemctl status ssh: Check for physical issues with cables or routers if self-hosting. For cloud servers, confirm that the hosting provider has no outages or restrictions (check their status page).Building your Linux knowledge is easier when you’re part of a community. Whether you’re troubleshooting, sharing success stories, or looking for inspiration, there’s no substitute for real-time human-interaction with other Linux enthusiasts.

The first, tracked as CVE-2025-26465, allows an active machine-in-the-middle attack on the OpenSSH client when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled. The second, CVE-2025-26466, affects both the OpenSSH client and server, enabling a pre-authentication denial-of-service attack.The attack against the OpenSSH client (CVE-2025-26465) succeeds regardless of whether the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is set to “yes” or “ask” (its default is “no”), requires no user interaction, and does not depend on the existence of an SSHFP resource record (an SSH fingerprint) in DNS. VerifyHostKeyDNS is an OpenSSH client configuration option that lets the SSH client look up and verify a server’s host key using DNS records (specifically, SSHFP records). The vulnerability was introduced in December 2014, just before the release of OpenSSH 6.8p1. Although VerifyHostKeyDNS is disabled by default, it was enabled by default on FreeBSD from September 2013 until March 2023.The OpenSSH client and server are vulnerable (CVE-2025-26466) to a pre-authentication denial-of-service attack–an asymmetric resource consumption of both memory and CPU–that was introduced in August 2023 (shortly before the release of OpenSSH 9.5p1). On the server side, this attack can be mitigated by leveraging existing mechanisms in OpenSSH, such as LoginGraceTime, MaxStartups, and the more recent PerSourcePenalties. OpenSSH 9.9p2 addresses these vulnerabilities mentioned above. To ensure continued security, we strongly advise upgrading affected systems to 9.9p2 as soon as possible.OpenSSH is a free, open-source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that enables encrypted communications over insecure networks. Widely adopted across Unix-like systems (including Linux and macOS) and many modern operating systems, it replaces clear-text protocols such as Telnet and FTP by providing secure remote login, file transfers, port forwarding, and tunneling.With robust encryption, privilege separation, sandboxing, and modern memory allocators, OpenSSH minimizes the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. Its enterprise-grade scalability supports automated processes, data backups, and complex DevOps workflows—all while enforcing strong access controls. Despite these two vulnerabilities, OpenSSH’s overall track record in maintaining confidentiality and integrity has made it a benchmark in software security, ensuring secure communications for organizations worldwide.Affected OpenSSH versions:OpenSSH versions from 6.8p1 through 9.9p1 are vulnerable to CVE-2025-26465, the flaw introduced in December 2014.OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 through 9.9p1 are vulnerable to CVE-2025-26466, the flaw introduced in August 2023.OpenSSH 9.9p2 addresses the vulnerabilities mentioned above. Upgrade promptly to maintain security.If an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack via CVE-2025-26465, the client may accept the attacker’s key instead of the legitimate server’s key. This would break the integrity of the SSH connection, enabling potential interception or tampering with the session before the user even realizes it. SSH sessions can be a prime target for attackers aiming to intercept credentials or hijack sessions. If compromised, hackers could view or manipulate sensitive data, move across multiple critical servers laterally, and exfiltrate valuable information such as database credentials. Such breaches can lead to reputational damage, violate compliance mandates (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), and potentially disrupt critical operations by forcing system downtime to contain the threat.SSH is a critical service for remote system administration. If attackers can repeatedly exploit the flaw CVE-2025-26466, they may cause prolonged outages or prevent administrators from managing servers, effectively locking legitimate users out. An enterprise facing this vulnerability could see critical servers become unreachable, interrupting routine operations and stalling essential maintenance tasks.When the Qualys research team confirmed the vulnerability, Qualys initiated a responsible disclosure process and worked with OpenSSH to coordinate its announcement.You can find the technical details of this vulnerability at: Qualys is releasing the QIDs in the table below as they become available.

Embedded Web Server and REST APIWe’ve integrated a new REST API and embedded web server directly into the  binary. This eliminates the need for  and , reducing the installation footprint and boosting performance. The new API also offers server-side pagination for the query log, ensuring a faster and more responsive interface.As  has been embedded into the  binary for some time now, we have been able to leverage this to rewrite the web interface.2. Advanced Filtering and AllowlistsPi-hole v6 introduces support for subscribed allowlists (Otherwise known as “Antigravity”). These lists work in much the same way as blocklists, but they domains instead of  them3. Consolidated Configuration FilesWe’ve streamlined configuration management by consolidating multiple settings files into a single, richly commented  file, making it easier to manage and understand your settings. If you are migrating from v5, your existing configurations will be migrated automatically into this file. It can be found at Configuration can be set in multiple ways:Directly editing the  fileVia the command line, e.g pihole-FTL --config dns.upstreams 8.8.8.8Via the web interface (which uses the API 😉)Via environment variables named, e.g FTLCONF_dns_upstreams=8.8.8.8If setting via environment variables, it should be noted that this effectively makes the setting read-only, as the environment variable will always force the value to match itself. This is the preferred way to configure FTL in the docker container.4. Redesigned User InterfaceThe web interface has been completely overhauled with settings split into Basic and Expert modes. This allows users to customize their experience based on their comfort level and needs.Pi-hole v6 includes native HTTPS support, with options to provide your own certificates or use auto-generated ones.Additionally, the Docker image is now based on Alpine, significantly reducing the image size and opening up possibilities for future system support.The release notes for each component can be found at the following pages:Upgrading and Getting StartedUpgrading to Pi-hole v6 should be straightforward. For existing users, we recommend backing up your current configuration before proceeding, as the upgrade is strictly a one-way operation.During the upgrade operation, you will be presented with a dialog box asking if you wish to disable . Doing so is probably appropriate for most users – unless you are using it to host web pages  Pi-hole’s, in which case you may choose to keep it enabled. With  disabled,  will attempt to bind to ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. If there is any conflict on these ports, then it will revert to port 8080 for HTTP.As always, you can upgrade using the command  on the terminal.The docker image has undergone a complete rewrite from the ground up, and is now based on Alpine rather than Debian. The same migration scripts that run on bare metal will also run on Docker – your configurations will be migrated to the new format.The exception to this is environment variables. You can start the container with the old variables in place but don’t expect them to work! It is recommended to read the docker section of our docs page before upgrading.Pi-hole thrives thanks to our vibrant and supportive community.

He also says Linus Torvalds has privately stated he will override objections to Rust code, effectively making its adoption inevitable. Phoronix's Michael Larabel has the latest: The latest on Hellwig's perspective of Rust code within the Linux kernel is below. Some interesting insight from a dissenting view. The thread in full can be found on the Rust for Linux mailing list.
 
[Here's an excerpt from the thread:] "I don't think having a web page in any form is useful. If you want it to be valid it has to be in the kernel tree and widely agreed on. It also states factually incorrect information. E.g. 'Some subsystems may decide they do not want to have Rust code for the time being, typically for bandwidth reasons. This is fine and expected.' while Linus in private said that he absolutely is going to merge Rust code over a maintainers objection. (He did so in private in case you are looking for a reference). So as of now, as a Linux developer or maintainer you must deal with Rust if you want to or not. [...] Right now the rules is Linus can force you whatever he wants (it's his project obviously) and I think he needs to spell that out including the expectations for contributors very clearly."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rhino Linux 2025.2 releases with plenty of fixes.</title><link>https://blog.rhinolinux.org/news-19</link><author>/u/MrBeeBenson</author><category>linux</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:39:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rhino Linux Team,It's been just about a month since our last snapshot, and we are happy to bring the release of Rhino Linux 2025.2. A lot of development has progressed, with the team working to resolve multiple longer standing issues in our Bug Tracker. Our release notes are shorter this time around, but pack a solid amount of fixes that we hope improve the overall usage and stability of Rhino Linux. Last month's release kicked off the year with a bit of a bumpy start. Several major bugs slipped through our final testing stage, and we worked quickly and diligently to resolve the issues users were facing, but we strive to provide a better and fuller experience for our users, and the last release may not have met those expectations.
