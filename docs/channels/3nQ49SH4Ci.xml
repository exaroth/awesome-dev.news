Today, many organizations use cloud services and micro-services. In such environments, IP addresses assigned to virtual machines or services can often be volatile, meaning they can change or be reassigned to other organizations or users. This presents a risk for services relying on static IPs for security configurations and may introduce impersonation or data leakage issues.This morning, I was setting up a new environment. I got a new IP address assigned by my hosting company and deployed a classic configuration: a reverse-proxy redirecting to many web services and generating Let’s Encrypt certificates.Once the reverse proxy was in place, I started to deploy more services but detected some activity in the log (always keep an eye on your logs!) and saw this:{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T06:22:33Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \"postmaster.xxxxxxxx.hu\""}
{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T06:46:36Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \"pop3.xxxxxxxx.hu\""}
{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T07:04:16Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \”xxxxxxxx.hu\""}
A quick DNS request confirmed that these hosts are resolving to my newly assigned IP!Worse, this organization seems to still be using POP3, and a user (or a script) is still trying to fetch emails using this protocol!When you move to another hosting solution, update your DNS recordsCleanup your DNS zones and remove unwanted entriesUse mechanisms to preserve your IP addresses (like “Elastic IPs” provided by AWS)Xavier Mertens (@xme)

Critical functions have been halted, tens of thousands of federal staffers are being encouraged to resign, and congressional mandates are being disregarded. The next phase: The Department of Government Efficiency reportedly wants to use AI to cut costs. According to , Musk’s group has started to run sensitive data from government systems through AI programs to analyze spending and determine what could be pruned. This may lead to the elimination of human jobs in favor of automation. As one government official who has been tracking Musk’s DOGE team told the, the ultimate aim is to use AI to replace “the human workforce with machines.” (Spokespeople for the White House and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment.)Using AI to make government more efficient is a worthy pursuit, and this is not a new idea. The Biden administration disclosed more than 2,000 AI applications in development across the federal government. For example, FEMA has started using AI to help perform damage assessment in disaster areas. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started using AI to look for fraudulent billing. The idea of replacing dedicated and principled civil servants with AI agents, however, new—and complicated.The civil service—the massive cadre of employees who operate government agencies—plays a vital role in translating laws and policy into the operation of society. New presidents can issue sweeping executive orders, but they often have no real effect until they actually change the behavior of public servants. Whether you think of these people as essential and inspiring do-gooders, boring bureaucratic functionaries, or as agents of a “deep state,” their sheer number and continuity act as ballast that resists institutional change.This is why Trump and Musk’s actions are so significant. The more AI decision making is integrated into government, the easier change will be. If human workers are widely replaced with AI, executives will have unilateral authority to instantaneously alter the behavior of the government, profoundly raising the stakes for transitions of power in democracy. Trump’s unprecedented purge of the civil service might be the last time a president needs to replace the human beings in government in order to dictate its new functions. Future leaders may do so at the press of a button.To be clear, the use of AI by the executive branch doesn’t have to be disastrous. In theory, it could allow new leadership to swiftly implement the wishes of its electorate. But this could go very badly in the hands of an authoritarian leader. AI systems concentrate power at the top, so they could allow an executive to effectuate change over sprawling bureaucracies instantaneously. Firing and replacing tens of thousands of human bureaucrats is a huge undertaking. Swapping one AI out for another, or modifying the rules that those AIs operate by, would be much simpler.Social-welfare programs, if automated with AI, could be redirected to systematically benefit one group and disadvantage another with a single prompt change. Immigration-enforcement agencies could prioritize people for investigation and detainment with one instruction. Regulatory-enforcement agencies that monitor corporate behavior for malfeasance could turn their attention to, or away from, any given company on a whim.Even if Congress were motivated to fight back against Trump and Musk, or against a future president seeking to bulldoze the will of the legislature, the absolute power to command AI agents would make it easier to subvert legislative intent. AI has the power to diminish representative politics. Written law is never fully determinative of the actions of government—there is always wiggle room for presidents, appointed leaders, and civil servants to exercise their own judgment. Whether intentional or not, whether charitably or not, each of these actors uses discretion. In human systems, that discretion is widely distributed across many individuals—people who, in the case of career civil servants, usually outlast presidencies.Today, the AI ecosystem is dominated by a small number of corporations that decide how the most widely used AI models are designed, which data they are trained on, and which instructions they follow. Because their work is largely secretive and unaccountable to public interest, these tech companies are capable of making changes to the bias of AI systems—either generally or with aim at specific governmental use cases—that are invisible to the rest of us. And these private actors are both vulnerable to coercion by political leaders and self-interested in appealing to their favor. Musk himself created and funded xAI, now one of the world’s largest AI labs, with an explicitly ideological mandate to generate anti-“woke” AI and steer the wider AI industry in a similar direction.But there’s a second way that AI’s transformation of government could go. AI development could happen inside of transparent and accountable public institutions, alongside its continued development by Big Tech. Applications of AI in democratic governments could be focused on benefitting public servants and the communities they serve by, for example, making it easier for non-English speakers to access government services, making ministerial tasks such as processing routine applications more efficient and reducing backlogs, or helping constituents weigh in on the policies deliberated by their representatives. Such AI integrations should be done gradually and carefully, with public oversight for their design and implementation and monitoring and guardrails to avoid unacceptable bias and harm.Governments around the world are demonstrating how this could be done, though it’s early days. Taiwan has pioneered the use of AI models to facilitate deliberative democracy at an unprecedented scale. Singapore has been a leader in the development of public AI models, built transparently and with public-service use cases in mind. Canada has illustrated the role of disclosure and public input on the consideration of AI use cases in government. Even if you do not trust the current White House to follow any of these examples, U.S. states—which have much greater contact and influence over the daily lives of Americans than the federal government—could lead the way on this kind of responsible development and deployment of AI.As the political theorist David Runciman has written, AI is just another in a long line of artificial “machines” used to govern how people live and act, not unlike corporations and states before it. AI doesn’t replace those older institutions, but it changes how they function. As the Trump administration forges stronger ties to Big Tech and AI developers, we need to recognize the potential of that partnership to steer the future of democratic governance—and act to make sure that it does not enable future authoritarians.This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in The Atlantic.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake BSOD Delivered by Malicious Python Script, (Fri, Feb 14th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31686</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:18:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I found a Python script that implements a funny anti-analysis trick. The script has a low score on VT (4/59) (SHA256:d716c2edbcdb76c6a6d31b21f154fee7e0f8613617078b69da69c8f4867c9534)[1]. This sample attracted my attention because it uses the tkinter[2] library. This library is used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides tools to create windows, dialogs, buttons, labels, text fields, and other interactive elements, allowing developers to build desktop applications with visual interfaces in Python. Most Python scripts are intended to be executed from a command line. That's why I consider this library as a good sign of suspicious behavior (It does not mean that all Python scripts using this library are malicious!)While reviewing the script, a variable contains an interesting piece of text:info = "\nA problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage\nto your computer ... (removed) ..."The interesting piece of code is here:root = tk.Tk()
root.configure(background="dark blue")
ex = Example(root)
w, h = root.winfo_screenwidth(), root.winfo_screenheight()
root.overrideredirect(1)
root.geometry("%dx%d+0+0" % (w, h))
root.wm_attributes("-topmost", 1)
root.mainloop()
The attribute "-topmost" set to "1" or "TRUE" will make the window remain open on top of all windows. The window will also be created to fill the screen without any control elements to close or resize it. When the script is executed, you will get this screen:To be honest, that's not the best BSOD ("Blue Screen of Death") that I saw... but it's a nice trick to annoy the victim or slow down (a bit) the analysis of the file.Xavier Mertens (@xme)

Shortly after that investigation was published,  said it would stop bundling Onerep with the  browser and wind down its partnership with the company. But nearly a year later, Mozilla is still promoting it to Firefox users.Mozilla offers Onerep to Firefox users on a subscription basis as part of Mozilla Monitor Plus. Launched in 2018 under the name Firefox Monitor, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website Have I Been Pwned? to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.The ink on that partnership agreement had barely dried before KrebsOnSecurity published a story showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder  launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called  that sells background reports on people. This seemed to contradict Onerep’s stated motto, “We believe that no one should compromise personal online security and get a profit from it.”Shelest released a lengthy statement (PDF) wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in , a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he started Onerep.Onerep.com CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest, as pictured on the “about” page of onerep.com.Shelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.“I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.”When asked to comment on the findings, Mozilla said then that although customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep’s CEO did not align with their values.“We’re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first,” Mozilla said.In October 2024, Mozilla published a statement saying the search for a different provider was taking longer than anticipated.“While we continue to evaluate vendors, finding a technically excellent and values-aligned partner takes time,” Mozilla wrote. “While we continue this search, Onerep will remain the backend provider, ensuring that we can maintain uninterrupted services while we continue evaluating new potential partners that align more closely with Mozilla’s values and user expectations. We are conducting thorough diligence to find the right vendor.”Asked for an update, Mozilla said the search for a replacement partner continues.“The work’s ongoing but we haven’t found the right alternative yet,” Mozilla said in an emailed statement. “Our customers’ data remains safe, and since the product provides a lot of value to our subscribers, we’ll continue to offer it during this process.”It’s a win-win for Mozilla that they’ve received accolades for their principled response while continuing to partner with Onerep almost a year later. But if it takes so long to find a suitable replacement, what does that say about the personal data removal industry itself?Onerep appears to be working in partnership with another problematic people-search service: , which has a history of ignoring opt-out requests or failing to honor them. A week before breaking the story about Onerep, KrebsOnSecurity published research showing the co-founders of Radaris were two native Russian brothers who’d built a vast network of affiliate marketing programs and consumer data broker services.Lawyers for the Radaris co-founders threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that story was retracted in full, claiming the founders were in fact Ukrainian and that our reporting had defamed the brothers by associating them with the actions of Radaris. Instead, we published a follow-up investigation which showed that not only did the brothers from Russia create Radaris, for many years they issued press releases quoting a fictitious CEO seeking money from investors.Several readers have shared emails they received from Radaris after attempting to remove their personal data, and those messages show Radaris has been promoting Onerep.An email from Radaris promoting Onerep.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_izoDLdUW0</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>Darknet diaries</category><category>infosec</category><category>video</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n_izoDLdUW0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Jack Rhysider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications

And the implications for national security are profound.First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had accessedtheUSTreasury computer system, giving them the ability to collect data on and potentially control the department’s roughly $5.45 trillion in annual federal payments.Then, we learned that uncleared DOGE personnel had gained access to classified data from the US Agency for International Development, possibly copying it onto their own systems. Next, the Office of Personnel Management—which holds detailed personal data on millions of federal employees, including those with security clearances—wascompromised. After that, Medicaid and Medicare records were compromised.Meanwhile, only partially redacted names of CIA employees were sent over an unclassified email account. DOGE personnel are also reported to be feeding Education Department data into artificial intelligence software, and they have also started working at the Department of Energy.This story is moving very fast. On Feb. 8, a federal judge blocked the DOGE team from accessing the Treasury Department systems any further. But given that DOGE workers have already copied data and possibly installed and modified software, it’s unclear how this fixes anything.In any case, breaches of other critical government systems are likely to follow unless federal employees stand firm on the protocols protecting national security.The systems that DOGE is accessing are not esoteric pieces of our nation’s infrastructure—they are the sinews of government.For example, the Treasury Department systems contain the technical blueprints for how the federal government moves money, while the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) network contains information on who and what organizations the government employs and contracts with.What makes this situation unprecedented isn’t just the scope, but also the method of attack. Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. The Chinese government’s 2015 breach of OPM was a significant US security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.In this case, external operators with limited experience and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny: gaining the highest levels of administrative access and making changes to the United States’ most sensitive networks, potentially introducing new security vulnerabilities in the process.But the most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted. It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—by removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.The Treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: No single person should have unlimited power. Just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.This approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. When your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. When a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. These aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. These measures have been bypassed or ignored. It’s as if someone found a way to rob Fort Knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.The implications for national security are staggering. Sen. Ron Wyden said his office had learned that the attackers gained privileges that allow them to modify core programs in Treasury Department computers that verify federal payments, access encrypted keys that secure financial transactions, and alter audit logs that record system changes. Over at OPM, reports indicate that individuals associated with DOGE connected an unauthorized server into the network. They are also reportedly trainingAI software on all of this sensitive data.This is much more critical than the initial unauthorized access. These new servers have unknown capabilities and configurations, and there’s no evidence that this new code has gone through any rigorous security testing protocols. The AIs being trained are certainly not secure enough for this kind of data. All are ideal targets for any adversary, foreign or domestic, also seeking access to federal data.There’s a reason why every modification—hardware or software—to these systems goes through a complex planning process and includes sophisticated access-control mechanisms. The national security crisis is that these systems are now much more vulnerable to dangerous attacks at the same time that the legitimate system administrators trained to protect them have been locked out.By modifying core systems, the attackers have not only compromised current operations, but have also left behind vulnerabilities that could be exploited in future attacks—giving adversaries such as Russia and China an unprecedentedopportunity. These countries have long targeted these systems. And they don’t just want to gather intelligence—they also want to understand how to disrupt these systems in a crisis.Now, the technical details of how these systems operate, their security protocols, and their vulnerabilities are now potentially exposed to unknown parties without any of the usual safeguards. Instead of having to breach heavily fortified digital walls, these parties  can simply walk through doors that are being propped open—and then erase evidence of their actions.The security implications span three critical areas.First, system manipulation: External operators can now modify operations while also altering audit trails that would track their changes. Second, data exposure: Beyond accessing personal information and transaction records, these operators can copy entire system architectures and security configurations—in one case, the technical blueprint of the country’s federal payment infrastructure. Third, and most critically, is the issue of system control: These operators can alter core systems and authentication mechanisms while disabling the very tools designed to detect such changes. This is more than modifying operations; it is modifying the infrastructure that those operations use.To address these vulnerabilities, three immediate steps are essential. First, unauthorized access must be revoked and proper authentication protocols restored. Next, comprehensive system monitoring and change management must be reinstated—which, given the difficulty of cleaning a compromised system, will likely require a complete system reset. Finally, thorough audits must be conducted of all system changes made during this period.This is beyond politics—this is a matter of national security. Foreign national intelligence organizations will be quick to take advantage of both the chaos and the new insecurities to steal US data and install backdoors to allow for future access.Each day of continued unrestricted access makes the eventual recovery more difficult and increases the risk of irreversible damage to these critical systems. While the full impact may take time to assess, these steps represent the minimum necessary actions to begin restoring system integrity and security protocols.Assuming that anyone in the government still cares.This essay was written with Davi Ottenheimer, and originally appeared in Foreign Policy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Thursday, February 13th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9322, (Thu, Feb 13th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31682</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 01:26:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Presumably the projects don’t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines—and then abandoned.Naturally, we registered them, just to see what would happen—”how many people are really trying to request software updates from S3 buckets that appear to have been abandoned months or even years ago?”, we naively thought to ourselves.Turns out they got eight million requests over two months.Had this been an actual attack, they would have modified the code in those buckets to contain malware and watch as it was incorporated in different software builds around the internet. This is basically the SolarWinds attack, but much more extensive.But there’s a second dimension to this attack. Because these update buckets are abandoned, the developers who are using them also no longer have the power to patch them automatically to protect them. The mechanism they would use to do so is now in the hands of adversaries. Moreover, often—but not always—losing the bucket that they’d use for it also removes the original vendor’s ability to identify the vulnerable software in the first place. That hampers their ability to communicate with vulnerable installations.Software supply-chain security is an absolute mess. And it’s not going to be easy, or cheap, to fix. Which means that it won’t be. Which is an even worse mess.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Achieve Transformative Network Security With Cisco Hybrid Mesh Firewall</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/achieve-transformative-network-security-with-cisco-hybrid-mesh-firewall/</link><author>Rick Miles</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hybrid Mesh Firewall addresses 3 forces: Fine-grained composition & distribution of apps in data centers, complex modern networks & sophisticated threats.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cisco and Wiz Collaborate to Enhance Cloud Security: Tackling AI-Generating Threats in Complex IT Infrastructures</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-and-wiz-collaborate-to-enhance-cloud-security/</link><author>Rick Miles</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cisco is collaborating with Wiz.

This patch should be a priority for enterprises, as Microsoft says it is being exploited, has low attack complexity, and no requirements for user interaction. senior staff research engineer  noted that since 2022, there have been nine elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in this same Windows component — three each year — including one in 2024 that was exploited in the wild as a zero day (CVE-2024-38193).“CVE-2024-38193 was exploited by the North Korean APT group known as Lazarus Group to implant a new version of the FudModule rootkit in order to maintain persistence and stealth on compromised systems,” Narang said. “At this time, it is unclear if CVE-2025-21418 was also exploited by Lazarus Group.”The other zero-day, CVE-2025-21391, is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Storage that could be used to delete files on a targeted system. Microsoft’s advisory on this bug references something called “CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access,” says no user interaction is required, and that the attack complexity is low., lead software engineer at , said although the advisory provides scant detail, and even offers some vague reassurance that ‘an attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,’ it would be a mistake to assume that the impact of deleting arbitrary files would be limited to data loss or denial of service.“As long ago as 2022, ZDI researchers set out how a motivated attacker could parlay arbitrary file deletion into full SYSTEM access using techniques which also involve creative misuse of symbolic links,”Barnett wrote.One vulnerability patched today that was publicly disclosed earlier is CVE-2025-21377, another weakness that could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on a vulnerable Windows system. Specifically, this is yet another Windows flaw that can be used to steal NTLMv2 hashes — essentially allowing an attacker to authenticate as the targeted user without having to log in.According to Microsoft, minimal user interaction with a malicious file is needed to exploit CVE-2025-21377, including selecting, inspecting or “performing an action other than opening or executing the file.”“This trademark linguistic ducking and weaving may be Microsoft’s way of saying ‘if we told you any more, we’d give the game away,'” Barnett said. “Accordingly, Microsoft assesses exploitation as more likely.”The SANS Internet Storm Center has a handy list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.It’s getting harder to buy Windows software that isn’t also bundled with Microsoft’s flagship Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) feature. Last month Microsoft started bundling Copilot with , which Redmond has since rebranded as “.” Ostensibly to offset the costs of its substantial AI investments, Microsoft also jacked up prices from 22 percent to 30 percent for upcoming license renewals and new subscribers.Office-watch.com writes that existing Office 365 users who are paying an annual cloud license do have the option of “Microsoft 365 Classic,” an AI-free subscription at a lower price, but that many customers are not offered the option until they attempt to cancel their existing Office subscription.In other security patch news,  has shipped iOS 18.3.1, which fixes a zero day vulnerability (CVE-2025-24200) that is showing up in attacks. has issued security updates that fix a total of 45 vulnerabilities across , , , , ,  and . at  notes that  is shipping an update today which will trigger updates for Chromium based browsers including , so be on the lookout for Chrome and Edge updates as we proceed through the week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Risky Business #779 -- DOGE staffer linked to The Com</title><link>https://risky.biz/RB779/</link><author></author><category>Risky Business blog</category><category>infosec</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media3.risky.biz/RB779.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 03:18:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://risky.biz/">Risky Business</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An ontology for threats, cybercrime and digital forensic investigation on Smart City Infrastructure, (Wed, Feb 12th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31676</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 02:05:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Blue teams have it hard – they maintain a watchful eye on whatever technology is deployed to detect threats, respond to incidents, perform digital forensics and reverse malware (or make malware happy!) when needed. Hopefully, no one has to handle all these roles alone since there is also the continuous learning aspect of getting up to speed with the latest threat vectors, vulnerabilities and exploit techniques. Adversaries only need one attack to succeed to gain actions on objective. In contrast, defenders have to detect and stop every attack to prevent adversaries from being successful. Let’s now extrapolate to an even bigger problem – what if this happens on emerging/future technologies and adversaries can get away with such crimes?Multiple countries are gradually considering the concept of Smart Cities, a key consideration in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As such technologies are implemented, the responsibility of defending this critical infrastructure again falls on the shoulders of blue teams. Smart Cities have yet to be fully implemented, but it does not mean we should not be proactive in preparing defenders to handle future problems. Current issues, even without Smart Cities in the fray, already cause blue team grief (e.g. different technology platforms, different contexts, information sharing, collaboration and tool interoperability). Given these complexities, an ontology would allow a shared understanding of vocabulary, facilitate data sharing, and even enable automated data reasoning.Wanting to pre-emptively solve future issues of attacks and cybercrime on Smart City Infrastructure (SCI), I (along with my co-authors in the SUTD ASSET Group) set out to create the Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE). SCOPE was designed to be an ontology for threats, cybercrime and digital forensic investigation on SCI. We did not create the ontology from scratch but chose to adhere to ontology best practices and extended the venerable Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) [1] and Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) [2]. UCO and CASE have gained some traction, and these ontologies have been experimentally adopted in forensic tools such as Cellebrite, Magnet Forensics, and MSAB XRY [3]. However, UCO and CASE did not have any SCI representation, and expecting overwhelmed blue teams to create them from scratch would most certainly be the straw that broke the camel’s back. Smart City Infrastructure Definition (reproduced with permission from the authors) [4]We deliberated on several design factors. Firstly, we defined smart cities using a technology-agnostic approach while adhering to international standards (with reference to Figure 1) that adopted the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (this was done in a previous work) [4]. By doing so, we ensured that the evolution of technologies or vendors would not affect the fundamental principle of Smart Cities. Secondly, we identified possible threats, cybercrime, and digital forensic evidence sources from the Smart City, which were defined in the first step (also from the same previous work) [4]. Thirdly, we included MITRE ATT&CK techniques and MITRE CAPEC into SCOPE for analysts and investigators to provide additional context to forensic evidence. Finally, we followed the ontological style and design practices when creating SCOPE, an expansion profile from UCO and CASE.We evaluated SCOPE via real-world attack scenarios attributed to publicly reported real-world incidents attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. With reference to Figure 2, the evaluation process workflow is shown. We successfully represented the attack scenarios, cybercrime committed, incident details, evidence and attack patterns (to name a few). SCOPE Evaluation Process (reproduced with permission from the authors) [3]Will SCOPE ever be helpful? Not yet. I hope it will come in handy in future for digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies when cybercrime on SCI becomes prevalent. As mentioned, SCOPE is technology-agnostic while adhering to several ISO standards. Additionally, it contains enough granularity to allow users to pinpoint key information while ensuring it can capture abstract definitions covering emerging technologies. We have made SCOPE publicly available to the digital forensic community to assist future smart city infrastructure investigations. SCOPE’s GitHub project link is https://github.com/scopeProject, and the official ontology website is https://scopeontology.org. If readers want to find out the complete details of SCOPE, you can find the full published paper in Volume 52 of Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation (FSIDI) or at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2025.301883.

Among these, 4 are classified as critical, highlighting the potential for significant impact if exploited. Notably, 2 vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild, underscoring the urgency for immediate updates. Additionally, 1 vulnerability has been disclosed prior to this patch cycle, marking it as a zero-day. Users are strongly advised to prioritize these updates to safeguard their systems against potential threats.Significant Vulnerabilities Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21418)
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21418, has a severity rating of Important with a CVSS score of 7.8. It is currently being exploited in the wild but has not been publicly disclosed, making it a significant concern for affected systems. The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges, thereby elevating their access and control over the compromised system. Immediate attention and remediation are advised to mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability.
This is a disclosed vulnerability with a severity rating of Important and a CVSS score of 7.1, which is currently being exploited in the wild. This vulnerability allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to delete targeted files on a system, significantly impacting the integrity and availability of the system without compromising confidentiality. The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the deletion of critical data, potentially rendering services unavailable. Despite its exploitation, it has not been publicly disclosed as a zero-day, and users are advised to implement appropriate security measures to mitigate its impact.
This is a disclosed zero-day vulnerability with a severity rating of Important and a CVSS score of 6.5, though it is not currently exploited in the wild. This vulnerability can lead to a total loss of confidentiality by allowing an attacker to obtain a user's NTLMv2 hash, which could be used to authenticate as the user. Exploitation requires minimal user interaction, such as selecting or inspecting a malicious file. It affects all supported versions of Microsoft Windows, and despite the retirement of Internet Explorer 11 and the deprecation of Microsoft Edge Legacy, updates are necessary due to the continued use of the MSHTML and EdgeHTML platforms in various applications. To ensure full protection, users are advised to install both Security Only updates and IE Cumulative updates.Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21177)
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21177, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, classifying it as a non-zero-day. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 8.7, indicating a significant risk of elevation of privilege if exploited. Although the vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and elevate their privileges within the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales environment, Microsoft has fully mitigated the issue, requiring no action from users. This CVE serves to enhance transparency regarding cloud service vulnerabilities.Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21376)
This is a critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 8.1, which has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, thus not classified as a zero-day. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, posing a significant threat if exploited. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable LDAP server, potentially causing a buffer overflow. The attack complexity is high, as successful exploitation requires the attacker to win a race condition. Mitigation efforts should focus on securing LDAP servers and monitoring for unusual activity to prevent potential exploitation.
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21381, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, making it a non-zero-day threat. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 7.8, indicating a significant risk of remote code execution. Despite the CVSS metric indicating a local attack vector, the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code remotely by convincing a user, through social engineering, to download and open a specially crafted file. The attack can be executed locally, with the Preview Pane serving as a potential attack vector. Users are advised to exercise caution when opening files from untrusted sources and to apply any available security updates to mitigate this risk.DHCP Client Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21379)
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21379, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, classifying it as a non-zero-day threat. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 7.1, indicating a significant risk of remote code execution. The vulnerability requires a high attack complexity, necessitating a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker must intercept the logical network path between the target and the resource. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it is limited to systems on the same network segment, such as those connected to the same network switch or virtual network. This limitation prevents the attack from being executed across multiple networks, such as a WAN.Microsoft High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21198)
is a critical security flaw with a CVSS score of 9.0, rated as Important, and is currently neither exploited in the wild nor publicly disclosed. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, requiring an attacker to have low privileges and access to the network connecting the targeted HPC clusters and nodes. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it relies on intra-net or private network access rather than exposure to the public internet. Exploitation involves sending a specially crafted HTTPS request to the head node or Linux compute node, potentially allowing the attacker to execute code on other clusters or nodes connected to the targeted head node. The scope of the attack is changed, indicating that successful exploitation could lead to broader impacts beyond the initially compromised system.Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21190)
This is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, classified as Important. Although it has not been exploited in the wild or disclosed publicly, this vulnerability poses a risk of remote code execution. An attacker could exploit it by deceiving a user into sending a request to a malicious server, which could then return harmful data leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The attack vector is network-based, requiring user interaction, as the attacker needs a client to connect to the malicious server to execute code on the client system.Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21200)
This is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, rated as Important, though it has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, thus not classified as a zero-day. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, where an attacker could potentially trick a user into sending a request to a malicious server. The server could then return malicious data, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The attack vector is network-based, requiring user interaction, as the client must connect to a malicious server, which could enable the attacker to execute code on the client machine. Mitigation strategies should focus on user awareness and network security measures to prevent such exploitations.
This summary of Microsoft's monthly updates highlights several critical vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for immediate attention to certain threats. The Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock vulnerability (CVE-2025-21418) is currently being exploited and poses a significant risk due to its potential for SYSTEM privilege escalation. Users should prioritize patching this vulnerability. Additionally, the Windows Storage vulnerability (CVE-2025-21391) is actively exploited, risking data integrity and availability. The NTLM Hash Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2025-21377), a zero-day, threatens confidentiality and requires prompt updates. Other critical vulnerabilities, such as those affecting Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and Windows LDAP, though not exploited, demand vigilance and timely updates to prevent potential exploitation. Users are advised to prioritize these updates and enhance security measures to mitigate risks effectively.February 2025 Security UpdatesFebruary 2025 Security UpdatesExploitability (old versions)Azure Network Watcher VM Extension Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityChromium: CVE-2025-0444 Use after free in SkiaChromium: CVE-2025-0445 Use after free in V8Chromium: CVE-2025-0451 Inappropriate implementation in Extensions APIDHCP Client Service Denial of Service VulnerabilityDHCP Client Service Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityHackerOne: CVE-2023-32002 Node.js `Module._load()` policy Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityInternet Connection Sharing (ICS) Denial of Service VulnerabilityKernel Streaming WOW Thunk Service Driver Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft Digest Authentication Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Dynamics 365 Sales Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft Edge (Chromium-based) Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Edge (Chromium-based) Spoofing VulnerabilityMicrosoft Edge for IOS and Android Spoofing VulnerabilityMicrosoft Excel Information Disclosure VulnerabilityMicrosoft Excel Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Denial of Service VulnerabilityMicrosoft Office Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Outlook Spoofing VulnerabilityMicrosoft PC Manager Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft SharePoint Server Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Surface Security Feature Bypass VulnerabilityNTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing VulnerabilityVisual Studio Code Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityVisual Studio Code JS Debug Extension Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityVisual Studio Installer Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Active Directory Domain Services API Denial of Service VulnerabilityWindows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Core Messaging Elevation of Privileges VulnerabilityWindows Deployment Services Denial of Service VulnerabilityWindows Disk Cleanup Tool Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Installer Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Kerberos Denial of Service VulnerabilityWindows Kernel Security Feature Bypass VulnerabilityWindows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows NTFS Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Remote Desktop Configuration Service Tampering VulnerabilityWindows Resilient File System (ReFS) Deduplication Service Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows Setup Files Cleanup Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Storage Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Telephony Server Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows Win32 Kernel Subsystem Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability

The problem is that Mark-of-Web (MoW) isn't propagated correctly: when extracted, a file inside a ZIP file inside another ZIP file will not have the MoW propagated from the outer ZIP file.That's good to know, but what I personally consider more important to know, is that MoW isn't propagated at all by 7-zip in its default configuration.I wrote about this a couple years ago in diary entry "7-Zip & MoW", when this new feature was introduced.You have to enable MoW propagation in the GUI or via the registry. And that is still the case with the latest versions of 7-zip.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Apple can appeal the U.K. capability notice to a secret technical panel, which would consider arguments about the expense of the requirement, and to a judge who would weigh whether the request was in proportion to the government’s needs. But the law does not permit Apple to delay complying during an appeal.In March, when the company was on notice that such a requirement might be coming, it told Parliament: “There is no reason why the U.K. [government] should have the authority to decide for citizens of the world whether they can avail themselves of the proven security benefits that flow from end-to-end encryption.”Apple is likely to turn the feature off for UK users rather than break it for everyone worldwide. Of course, UK users will be able to spoof their location. But this might not be enough. According to the law, Apple would not be able to offer the feature to anyone who is in the UK at any point: for example, a visitor from the US.And what happens next? Australia has a law enabling it to ask for the same thing. Will it? Will even more countries follow?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Teen on Musk’s DOGE Team Graduated from ‘The Com’</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>Krebs on Security</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 00:32:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ reported this week that a 19-year-old working for ‘s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given access to sensitive US government systems even though his past association with cybercrime communities should have precluded him from gaining the necessary security clearances to do so. As today’s story explores, the DOGE teen is a former denizen of ‘,’ an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network for facilitating instant collaboration.Since President Trump’s second inauguration, Musk’s DOGE team has gained access to a truly staggering amount of personal and sensitive data on American citizens, moving quickly to seize control over databases at the , the Office of Personnel Management, the , and the Department of Health and Human Resources, among others. first reported on Feb. 2 that one of the technologists on Musk’s crew is a 19-year-old high school graduate named , who reportedly goes by the nickname “Big Balls” online. One of the companies Coristine founded, , was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old.“Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains,”  reported. “One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review.”Mr. Coristine has not responded to requests for comment. In a follow-up story this week,  found that someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine solicited a DDoS-for-hire service in 2022, and that he worked for a short time at a company that specializes in protecting customers from DDoS attacks.A profile photo from Coristine’s WhatsApp account.Internet routing records show that Coristine runs an Internet service provider called  (AS400495). Also known as “,” Packetware currently hosts tesla[.]sexy and diamondcdn[.]com, among other domains.DiamondCDN was advertised and claimed by someone who used the nickname “” on several Com-based Discord channels over the years. A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as “Edward.”From late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage’s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies. In November 2022, Rivage could be seen requesting recommendations for a reliable and powerful DDoS-for-hire service.Rivage made that request in the cybercrime channel “,” a core Com hub where users could buy and sell attack services. Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized in 2024 as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.Coristine’s LinkedIn profile said that in 2022 he worked at an anti-DDoS company called , which  generously described as a “network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers.”  wrote:“At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn résumé. Path has at times listed as employees , also known as Cosmo the God, a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It’s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.”The other founder of BackConnect Security LLC was , a Georgia man who pleaded guilty in 2020 to paying a DDoS-for-hire service to launch attacks against others.The aforementioned Path employee Eric Taylor pleaded guilty in 2017 to charges including an attack on our home in 2013. Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department about a supposed hostage situation at our residence in Virginia. In response, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs at gunpoint before the police realized it was all a dangerous hoax known as “swatting.”CosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackers set up the Web site exposed[dot]su, which “doxed” dozens of public officials and celebrities by publishing the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information on the former First Lady Michelle Obama, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general, among others. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed. noted that Coristine only worked at Path for a few months in 2022, but the story didn’t mention why his tenure was so short. A screenshot shared on the website pathtruths.com includes a snippet of conversations in June 2022 between Path employees discussing Coristine’s firing.According to that record, Path founder Marshal Webb dismissed Coristine for leaking internal documents to a competitor. Not long after Coristine’s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations. Among other things, those chats revealed that one of Path’s technicians was a Canadian man named  who was convicted in 2017 of perpetrating dozens of swatting attacks and fake bomb threats — including at least two attempts against our home in 2014.A snippet of text from an internal Path chat room, wherein members discuss the reason for Coristine’s termination: Allegedly, leaking internal company information. Source: Pathtruths.com.On May 11, 2024, Rivage posted on a Discord channel for a DDoS protection service that is chiefly marketed to members of The Com. Rivage expressed frustration with his time spent on Com-based communities, suggesting that its profitability had been oversold.“I don’t think there’s a lot of money to be made in the com,” Rivage lamented. “I’m not buying Heztner [servers] to set up some com VPN.”Rivage largely stopped posting messages on Com channels after that.  reports that Coristine subsequently spent three months last summer working at , Elon Musk’s brain implant startup.The trouble with all this is that even if someone sincerely intends to exit The Com after years of consorting with cybercriminals, they are often still subject to personal attacks, harassment and hacking long after they have left the scene.That’s because a huge part of Com culture involves harassing, swatting and hacking other members of the community. These internecine attacks are often for financial gain, but just as frequently they are perpetrated by cybercrime groups to exact retribution from or assert dominance over rival gangs.Experts say it is extremely difficult for former members of violent street gangs to gain a security clearance needed to view sensitive or classified information held by the U.S. government. That’s because ex-gang members are highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang, and that alone presents an unacceptable security risk for intelligence agencies.And make no mistake: The Com is the English-language cybercriminal hacking equivalent of a violent street gang. KrebsOnSecurity has published numerous stories detailing how feuds within the community periodically spill over into real-world violence.When Coristine’s name surfaced in ‘s report this week, members of The Com immediately took notice. In the following segment from a February 5, 2025 chat in a Com-affiliated hosting provider, members criticized Rivage’s skills, and discussed harassing his family and notifying authorities about incriminating accusations that may or may not be true.2025-02-05 16:29:44 UTC vperked#0 they got this nigga on indiatimes man

2025-02-05 16:35:19 UTC chainofcommand#0 i dont think they’ll care tbhGiven the speed with which Musk’s DOGE team was allowed access to such critical government databases, it strains credulity that Coristine could have been properly cleared beforehand. After all, he’d recently been dismissed from a job for allegedly leaking internal company information to outsiders.According to the national security adjudication guidelines (PDF) released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), eligibility determinations take into account a person’s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, judgment, and ability to protect classified information.The DNI policy further states that “eligibility for covered individuals shall be granted only when facts and circumstances indicate that eligibility is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of national security.”On Thursday, 25-year-old DOGE staff member  resigned after being linked to a deleted social media account that advocated racism and eugenics. Elez resigned after asked the White House about his connection to the account.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. “Normalize Indian hate,” the account wrote the same month, in reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley.Elez’s resignation came a day after the Department of Justice agreed to limit the number of DOGE employees who have access to federal payment systems. The DOJ said access would be limited to two people, Elez and , the CEO of a company called Cloud Software Group.Earlier today, Musk said he planned to rehire Elez after  and  reportedly endorsed the idea. Speaking at The White House today, Trump said he wasn’t concerned about the security of personal information and other data accessed by DOGE, adding that he was “very proud of the job that this group of young people” are doing.A White House official told on Wednesday that Musk and his engineers have appropriate security clearances and are operating in “full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.”reports Trump added that his administration’s cost-cutting efforts would soon turn to the Education Department and the Pentagon, “where he suggested without evidence that there could be ‘trillions’ of dollars in wasted spending within the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2024.”GOP leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Senate have largely shrugged about Musk’s ongoing efforts to seize control over federal databases, dismantle agencies mandated by Congress, freeze federal spending on a range of already-appropriated government programs, and threaten workers with layoffs.Meanwhile, multiple parties have sued to stop DOGE’s activities. ABC News says a federal judge was to rule today on whether DOGE should be blocked from accessing Department of Labor records, following a lawsuit alleging Musk’s team sought to illegally access highly sensitive data, including medical information, from the federal government.At least 13 state attorneys general say they plan to file a lawsuit to stop DOGE from accessing federal payment systems containing Americans’ sensitive personal information, reports.Reuters reported Thursday that the U.S. Treasury Department had agreed not to give Musk’s team access to its payment systems while a judge is hearing arguments in a lawsuit by employee unions and retirees alleging Musk illegally searched those records.writes that The Department of Education (DoE) was sued Friday by a California student association demanding an “immediate stop” to DOGE’s “unlawfully” digging through student loan data to potentially dismantle the DoE.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friday Squid Blogging: The Colossal Squid</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/friday-squid-blogging-the-colossal-squid.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>Schneider on Security</category><category>infosec</category><category>blog</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 22:02:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Story Behind Bike Index</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6-3s4OH8Gs</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>Darknet diaries</category><category>infosec</category><category>video</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/W6-3s4OH8Gs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 19:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Jack Rhysider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Story Behind Bike Index

But experts caution that many of DeepSeek’s design choices — such as using hard-coded encryption keys, and sending unencrypted user and device data to Chinese companies — introduce a number of glaring security and privacy risks.Public interest in the DeepSeek AI chat apps swelled following widespread media reports that the upstart Chinese AI firm had managed to match the abilities of cutting-edge chatbots while using a fraction of the specialized computer chips that leading AI companies rely on. As of this writing, DeepSeek is the third most-downloaded “free” app on the Apple store, and #1 on Google Play.DeepSeek’s rapid rise caught the attention of the mobile security firm , a Chicago-based company that helps clients screen mobile apps for security and privacy threats. In a teardown of the DeepSeek app published today, NowSecure urged organizations to remove the DeepSeek iOS mobile app from their environments, citing security concerns.NowSecure founder  said they haven’t yet concluded an in-depth analysis of the DeepSeek app for  devices, but that there is little reason to believe its basic design would be functionally much different.Hoog told KrebsOnSecurity there were a number of qualities about the DeepSeek iOS app that suggest the presence of deep-seated security and privacy risks. For starters, he said, the app collects an awful lot of data about the user’s device.“They are doing some very interesting things that are on the edge of advanced device fingerprinting,” Hoog said, noting that one property of the app tracks the device’s name — which for many iOS devices defaults to the customer’s name followed by the type of iOS device.The device information shared, combined with the user’s Internet address and data gathered from mobile advertising companies, could be used to deanonymize users of the DeepSeek iOS app, NowSecure warned. The report notes that DeepSeek communicates with , a cloud platform developed by  (the makers of ), although NowSecure said it wasn’t clear if the data is just leveraging ByteDance’s digital transformation cloud service or if the declared information share extends further between the two companies.Perhaps more concerning, NowSecure said the iOS app transmits device information “in the clear,” without any encryption to encapsulate the data. This means the data being handled by the app could be intercepted, read, and even modified by anyone who has access to any of the networks that carry the app’s traffic.“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels,” the report observed. “Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet.”Hoog said the app does selectively encrypt portions of the responses coming from DeepSeek servers. But they also found it uses an insecure and now deprecated encryption algorithm called 3DES (aka Triple DES), and that the developers had hard-coded the encryption key. That means the cryptographic key needed to decipher those data fields can be extracted from the app itself.There were other, less alarming security and privacy issues highlighted in the report, but Hoog said he’s confident there are additional, unseen security concerns lurking within the app’s code.“When we see people exhibit really simplistic coding errors, as you dig deeper there are usually a lot more issues,” Hoog said. “There is virtually no priority around security or privacy. Whether cultural, or mandated by China, or a witting choice, taken together they point to significant lapse in security and privacy controls, and that puts companies at risk.”Apparently, plenty of others share this view. reported on January 30 that U.S. congressional offices are being warned not to use the app.“[T]hreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,” read the notice from the chief administrative officer for the House of Representatives. “To mitigate these risks, the House has taken security measures to restrict DeepSeek’s functionality on all House-issued devices.”reports that Italy and Taiwan have already moved to ban DeepSeek over security concerns. writes that  has blocked access to DeepSeek. says also banned employees from using the service, as did the .Beyond security concerns tied to the DeepSeek iOS app, there are indications the Chinese AI company may be playing fast and loose with the data that it collects from and about users. On January 29, researchers at said they discovered a publicly accessible database linked to DeepSeek that exposed “a significant volume of chat history, backend data and sensitive information, including log streams, API secrets, and operational details.”“More critically, the exposure allowed for full database control and potential privilege escalation within the DeepSeek environment, without any authentication or defense mechanism to the outside world,” Wiz wrote. [Full disclosure: Wiz is currently an advertiser on this website.]KrebsOnSecurity sought comment on the report from DeepSeek and from Apple.

An investigation into the history of these communities shows their apparent co-founders quite openly operate an Internet service provider and a pair of e-commerce platforms catering to buyers and sellers on both forums.In this 2019 post from Cracked, a forum moderator told the author of the post (Buddie) that the owner of the RDP service was the founder of Nulled, a.k.a. “Finndev.” Image: Ke-la.com.On Jan. 30, the U.S. Department of Justicesaid it seized eight domain names that were used to operate Cracked, a cybercrime forum that sprang up in 2018 and attracted more than four million users. The DOJ said the law enforcement action, dubbed Operation Talent, also seized domains tied to , Cracked’s payment processor.In addition, the government seized the domain names for two popular anonymity services that were heavily advertised on Cracked and Nulled and allowed customers to rent virtual servers: StarkRDP[.]io, and rdp[.]sh.Those archived webpages show both RDP services were owned by an entity called . According to corporate records compiled by , 1337 Services GmbH is also known as  and is incorporated in Hamburg, Germany.The Cracked forum administrator went by the nicknames “” and “” on multiple cybercrime forums. Meanwhile, a LinkedIn profile for a . from Germany refers to this person as the co-founder of Sellix and founder of 1337 Services GmbH.Northdata’s business profile for 1337 Services GmbH shows the company is controlled by two individuals: 32-year-old  and , 28.An organization chart showing the owners of 1337 Services GmbH as Florian Marzahl and Finn Grimpe. Image: Northdata.com.Neither Marzahl nor Grimpe responded to requests for comment. But Grimpe’s first name is interesting because it corresponds to the nickname chosen by the founder of Nulled, who goes by the monikers “Finn” and “Finndev.” NorthData reveals that Grimpe was the founder of a German entity called , which rented out high-end sports cars and motorcycles.The email address used for those accounts was . DomainTools.com reports f.grimpe@gmail.com was used to register at least nine domain names, including  and . Neither of these domains were among those seized in Operation Talent.Intel471 finds the user FlorainN registered across multiple cybercrime forums using the email address . The breach tracking service Constella Intelligence says this email address used the same password (and slight variations of it) across many accounts online — including at hacker forums — and that the same password was used in connection with dozens of other email addresses, such as florianmarzahl@hotmail.de, and .The Justice Department said the Nulled marketplace had more than five million members, and has been selling stolen login credentials, stolen identification documents and hacking services, as well as tools for carrying out cybercrime and fraud, since 2016.Perhaps fittingly, both Cracked and Nulled have been hacked over the years, exposing countless private messages between forum users. A review of those messages archived by Intel 471 showed that dozens of early forum members referred privately to Finndev as the owner of , an e-commerce platform that caters to the same clientele as Sellix.Shoppy was not targeted as part of Operation Talent, and its website remains online. Northdata reports that Shoppy’s business name —  — is registered at an address in Gan-Ner, Israel, but there is no ownership information about this entity. Shoppy did not respond to requests for comment.Constella found that a user named Shoppy registered on Cracked in 2019 using the email address . Constella says that email address is tied to a Twitter/X account for Shoppy Ecommerce in Israel.The DOJ said one of the alleged administrators of Nulled, a 29-year-old Argentinian national named , was arrested in Spain. The government has not announced any other arrests or charges associated with Operation Talent.Indeed, both StarkRDP and FloraiN have posted to their accounts on  that there were no charges levied against the proprietors of 1337 Services GmbH. FlorainN told former customers they were in the process of moving to a new name and domain for StarkRDP, where existing accounts and balances would be transferred.“StarkRDP has always been operating by the law and is not involved in any of these alleged crimes and the legal process will confirm this,” the StarkRDP Telegram account wrote on January 30. “All of your servers are safe and they have not been collected in this operation. The only things that were seized is the website server and our domain. Unfortunately, no one can tell who took it and with whom we can talk about it. Therefore, we will restart operation soon, under a different name, to close the chapter [of] ‘StarkRDP.'”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top 10 web hacking techniques of 2024</title><link>https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2024</link><author></author><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 15:01:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://portswigger.net/research">Dev - PortSwitgger Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the Top 10 Web Hacking Techniques of 2024, the 18th edition of our annual community-powered effort to identify the most innovative must-read web security research published in the last year]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cybersecurity for Businesses of All Sizes: A Blueprint for Protection</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cybersecurity-for-businesses-of-all-sizes-a-blueprint-for-protection/</link><author>Yuri Kramarz</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 13:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Developing a robust cybersecurity practice involves implementing multiple layers of security measures that are interconnected and continually monitored.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DtSR Episode 639 - Richard Bird Famous With 12 People</title><link></link><author></author><category>Down the Security Rabbit Hole Podcast</category><category>infosec</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/www.buzzsprout.com/2153215/episodes/16549969-dtsr-episode-639-richard-bird-famous-with-12-people.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogwh1t3rabbit.medium.com/">Down the Security Rabbithole Podcast (DtSR)</source></item><item><title>AI Cyber Threat Intelligence Roundup: January 2025</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/ai-cyber-threat-intelligence-roundup-january-2025/</link><author>Adam Swanda</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 13:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI threat research is a fundamental part of Cisco’s approach to AI security.

The proprietors of the service, who use the collective nickname “,” have been the subject of three stories published here since 2015. The FBI said the main clientele are organized crime groups that try to trick victim companies into making payments to a third party.One of several current Fudtools sites run by the principals of The Manipulators.On January 29, the FBI and the Dutch national police seized the technical infrastructure for a cybercrime service marketed under the brands ,  and  (and many other “fud” variations). The “fud” bit stands for “Fully Un-Detectable,” and it refers to cybercrime resources that will evade detection by security tools like antivirus software or anti-spam appliances.The Dutch authorities said 39 servers and domains abroad were seized, and that the servers contained millions of records from victims worldwide — including at least 100,000 records pertaining to Dutch citizens.A statement from the U.S. Department of Justice refers to the cybercrime group as , after a pseudonym The Manipulaters communally used to promote their spam, malware and phishing services on social media.“The Saim Raza-run websites operated as marketplaces that advertised and facilitated the sale of tools such as phishing kits, scam pages and email extractors often used to build and maintain fraud operations,” the DOJ explained.The core Manipulaters product is , a spam delivery service whose homepage openly advertised phishing kits targeting users of various Internet companies, including , , , ,  and , to name a few.The government says transnational organized crime groups that purchased these services primarily used them to run business email compromise (BEC) schemes, wherein the cybercrime actors tricked victim companies into making payments to a third party.“Those payments would instead be redirected to a financial account the perpetrators controlled, resulting in significant losses to victims,” the DOJ wrote. “These tools were also used to acquire victim user credentials and utilize those credentials to further these fraudulent schemes. The seizure of these domains is intended to disrupt the ongoing activity of these groups and stop the proliferation of these tools within the cybercriminal community.”Manipulaters advertisement for “Office 365 Private Page with Antibot” phishing kit sold via Heartsender. “Antibot” refers to functionality that attempts to evade automated detection techniques, keeping a phish deployed and accessible as long as possible. Image: DomainTools.KrebsOnSecurity first wrote about The Manipulaters in May 2015, mainly because their ads at the time were blanketing a number of popular cybercrime forums, and because they were fairly open and brazen about what they were doing — even who they were in real life.We caught up with The Manipulaters again in 2021, with a story that found the core employees had started a web coding company in Lahore called  — presumably as a way to account for their considerable Heartsender income. That piece examined how WeCodeSolutions employees had all doxed themselves on Facebook by posting pictures from company parties each year featuring a large cake with the words  written in icing.A follow-up story last year about The Manipulaters prompted messages from various WeCodeSolutions employees who pleaded with this publication to remove stories about them. The Saim Raza identity told KrebsOnSecurity they were recently released from jail after being arrested and charged by local police, although they declined to elaborate on the charges.The Manipulaters never seemed to care much about protecting their own identities, so it’s not surprising that they were unable or unwilling to protect their own customers. In an analysis released last year,  found the web-hosted version of Heartsender leaked an extraordinary amount of user information to unauthenticated users, including customer credentials and email records from Heartsender employees.Almost every year since their founding, The Manipulaters have posted a picture of a FudCo cake from a company party celebrating its anniversary.DomainTools also uncovered evidence that the computers used by The Manipulaters were all infected with the same password-stealing malware, and that vast numbers of credentials were stolen from the group and sold online.“Ironically, the Manipulaters may create more short-term risk to their own customers than law enforcement,” DomainTools wrote. “The data table ‘User Feedbacks’ (sic) exposes what appear to be customer authentication tokens, user identifiers, and even a customer support request that exposes root-level SMTP credentials–all visible by an unauthenticated user on a Manipulaters-controlled domain.”Police in The Netherlands said the investigation into the owners and customers of the service is ongoing.“The Cybercrime Team is on the trail of a number of buyers of the tools,” the Dutch national police said. “Presumably, these buyers also include Dutch nationals. The investigation into the makers and buyers of this phishing software has not yet been completed with the seizure of the servers and domains.”U.S. authorities this week also joined law enforcement in Australia, France, Greece, Italy, Romania and Spain in seizing a number of domains for several long-running cybercrime forums and services, including  and . According to a statement from the European police agency , the two communities attracted more than 10 million users in total.Other domains seized as part of “” included , an e-commerce platform that was frequently used by cybercrime forum members to buy and sell illicit goods and services.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Evaluating Security Risk in DeepSeek and Other Frontier Reasoning Models</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/evaluating-security-risk-in-deepseek-and-other-frontier-reasoning-models/</link><author>Paul Kassianik</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The performance of DeepSeek models has made a clear impact, but are these models safe and secure?

Research published this week on one such outfit — a sprawling network tied to Chinese organized crime gangs and aptly named “” — highlights a persistent whac-a-mole problem facing cloud services.In October 2024, the security firm  published a lengthy analysis of how  and  were providing services to Funnull, a two-year-old Chinese content delivery network that hosts a wide variety of fake trading apps, pig butchering scams, gambling websites, and retail phishing pages.Funnull made headlines last summer after it acquired the domain name , previously the home of a widely-used open source code library that allowed older browsers to handle advanced functions that weren’t natively supported. There were still tens of thousands of legitimate domains linking to the Polyfill domain at the time of its acquisition, and Funnull soon after conducted a supply-chain attack that redirected visitors to malicious sites.Silent Push’s October 2024 report found a vast number of domains hosted via Funnull promoting gambling sites that bear the logo of the , a Chinese entity named in a 2024 UN report (PDF) for laundering millions of dollars for the North Korean Lazarus Group.It is likely the gambling sites coming through Funnull are abusing top casino brands as part of their money laundering schemes. In reporting on Silent Push’s October report, obtained a comment from Bwin, one of the casinos being advertised en masse through Funnull, and Bwin said those websites did not belong to them.Gambling is illegal in China except in Macau, a special administrative region of China. Silent Push researchers say Funnull may be helping online gamblers in China evade the Communist party’s “Great Firewall,” which blocks access to gambling destinations.Silent Push’s  said that upon revisiting Funnull’s infrastructure again this month, they found dozens of the same Amazon and Microsoft cloud Internet addresses still forwarding Funnull traffic through a dizzying chain of auto-generated domain names before redirecting malicious or phishous websites.Edwards said Funnull is a textbook example of an increasing trend Silent Push calls “infrastructure laundering,” wherein crooks selling cybercrime services will relay some or all of their malicious traffic through U.S. cloud providers.“It’s crucial for global hosting companies based in the West to wake up to the fact that extremely low quality and suspicious web hosts based out of China are deliberately renting IP space from multiple companies and then mapping those IPs to their criminal client websites,” Edwards told KrebsOnSecurity. “We need these major hosts to create internal policies so that if they are renting IP space to one entity, who further rents it to host numerous criminal websites, all of those IPs should be reclaimed and the CDN who purchased them should be banned from future IP rentals or purchases.”A Suncity gambling site promoted via Funnull. The sites feature a prompt for a Tether/USDT deposit program.Reached for comment, Amazon referred this reporter to a statement Silent Push included in a report released today. Amazon said AWS was already aware of the Funnull addresses tracked by Silent Push, and that it had suspended all known accounts linked to the activity.Amazon said that contrary to implications in the Silent Push report, it has every reason to aggressively police its network against this activity, noting the accounts tied to Funnull used “fraudulent methods to temporarily acquire infrastructure, for which it never pays. Thus, AWS incurs damages as a result of the abusive activity.”“When AWS’s automated or manual systems detect potential abuse, or when we receive reports of potential abuse, we act quickly to investigate and take action to stop any prohibited activity,” Amazon’s statement continues. “In the event anyone suspects that AWS resources are being used for abusive activity, we encourage them to report it to AWS Trust & Safety using the report abuse form. In this case, the authors of the report never notified AWS of the findings of their research via our easy-to-find security and abuse reporting channels. Instead, AWS first learned of their research from a journalist to whom the researchers had provided a draft.”Microsoft likewise said it takes such abuse seriously, and encouraged others to report suspicious activity found on its network.“We are committed to protecting our customers against this kind of activity and actively enforce acceptable use policies when violations are detected,” Microsoft said in a written statement. “We encourage reporting suspicious activity to Microsoft so we can investigate and take appropriate actions.” is threat intelligence lead at . Hummel said it used to be that “noisy” and frequently disruptive malicious traffic — such as automated application layer attacks, and “brute force” efforts to crack passwords or find vulnerabilities in websites — came mostly from botnets, or large collections of hacked devices.But he said the vast majority of the infrastructure used to funnel this type of traffic is now proxied through major cloud providers, which can make it difficult for organizations to block at the network level.“From a defenders point of view, you can’t wholesale block cloud providers, because a single IP can host thousands or tens of thousands of domains,” Hummel said.In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on Stark Industries Solutions, an ISP that materialized at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has been used as a global proxy network that conceals the true source of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against enemies of Russia. Experts said much of the malicious traffic  traversing Stark’s network (e.g. vulnerability scanning and password brute force attacks) was being bounced through U.S.-based cloud providers.Stark’s network has been a favorite of the Russian hacktivist group called , which frequently launches huge distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against a variety of targets seen as opposed to Moscow. Hummel said NoName’s history suggests they are adept at cycling through new cloud provider accounts, making anti-abuse efforts into a game of whac-a-mole.“It almost doesn’t matter if the cloud provider is on point and takes it down because the bad guys will just spin up a new one,” he said. “Even if they’re only able to use it for an hour, they’ve already done their damage. It’s a really difficult problem.”Edwards said Amazon declined to specify whether the banned Funnull users were operating using compromised accounts or stolen payment card data, or something else.“I’m surprised they wanted to lean into ‘We’ve caught this 1,200+ times and have taken these down!’ and yet didn’t connect that each of those IPs was mapped to [the same] Chinese CDN,” he said. “We’re just thankful Amazon confirmed that account mules are being used for this and it isn’t some front-door relationship. We haven’t heard the same thing from Microsoft but it’s very likely that the same thing is happening.”Funnull wasn’t always a bulletproof hosting network for scam sites. Prior to 2022, the network was known as , based in the Philippines. One of Anjie’s properties was a website called . Loading that domain reveals a pop-up message by the original Anjie CDN owner, who said their operations had been seized by an entity known as  and , the parent company of Funnull.A machine-translated message from the former owner of Anjie CDN, a Chinese content delivery network that is now Funnull.“After I got into trouble, the company was managed by my family,” the message explains. “Because my family was isolated and helpless, they were persuaded by villains to sell the company. Recently, many companies have contacted my family and threatened them, believing that Fangneng CDN used penetration and mirroring technology through customer domain names to steal member information and financial transactions, and stole customer programs by renting and selling servers. This matter has nothing to do with me and my family. Please contact Fangneng CDN to resolve it.”In January 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a proposed rule that would require cloud providers to create a “Customer Identification Program” that includes procedures to collect data sufficient to determine whether each potential customer is a foreign or U.S. person.According to the law firm , the Commerce rule also would require “infrastructure as a service” (IaaS) providers to report knowledge of any transactions with foreign persons that might allow the foreign entity to train a large AI model with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity.“The proposed rulemaking has garnered global attention, as its cross-border data collection requirements are unprecedented in the cloud computing space,” Crowell wrote. “To the extent the U.S. alone imposes these requirements, there is concern that U.S. IaaS providers could face a competitive disadvantage, as U.S. allies have not yet announced similar foreign customer identification requirements.”It remains unclear if the new White House administration will push forward with the requirements. The Commerce action was mandated as part of an executive order President Trump issued a day before leaving office in January 2021.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top Threat Tactics and How to Address Them</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/top-threat-tactics-and-how-to-address-them/</link><author>Jennifer Golden</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 13:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[See the key takeaways for the most recent Cisco Talos Incident Response report and learn how you can use Cisco Security products to help defend against these.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
