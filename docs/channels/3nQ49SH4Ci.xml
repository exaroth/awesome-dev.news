For my setup, I did a bare-metal install of the network analysis tool Malcolm to use as an NSM/IDS.  I setup a 5-port managed switch and configured a monitor port for the honeypot with the mirror sending packets to my Malcolm sensor. This setup allowed me to collect and analyze all traffic going to and from my honeypot.Malcolm is a network capture and analysis tool smartly comprised of various open-source tools; Arkime, OpenSearch, Logstash, Filebeat, OpenSearch Dashboards, Zeek, Suricata, Yara, Capa, ClamAV, CyberChef, jQuery File Upload, NetBox, PostgresSQL, Redis, Keycloak, OpenResty, nginx-auth-ldap, Fluent Bit, Mark Baggett’s (SANS Instructor) freq.py, Florian Roth’s Signature-Base Yara Rules, Bart Blaze’s Yara Rules, RerversingLabs’ Yara Rules and multiple Zeek Packages.[1]
*Graphic Sourced from https://malcolm.fyi/docs/components.html Malcolm was created by Idaho National Labs as part of a CISA contract to assist with protecting critical infrastructure, most notably it incorporates ICS protocol parsers not commonly seen with other tools, albeit their inclusion is growing.   There is an additional tool that can be used with Malcolm, Hedgehog Linux. Deployment of a Hedgehog sensor seemed overkill for my use case, but it’s an option nonetheless.   Hedgehog Linux can be installed on a separate appliance as a PCAP ingestion sensor freeing up Malcolm resources for analysis.  The Hedgehog sensor monitors network interfaces, captures traffic and generates PCAPs, detects file transfers in network traffic and extracts/scans the files for threats, generates and forward Zeek logs, Arkime sessions, and other information to Malcolm [2].  It’s important to note you do not need the Hedgehog Linux sensor for Malcolm to work.  During the Malcolm install there is an option to have Malcolm ingest packets or use a Hedgehog Linux sensor. 
*Graphic Sourced from https://malcolm.fyi/docs/hedgehog.htmlMalcolm can be installed via an ISO or ran in a Docker/Kubernetes container.  I opted for the bare-metal option as I had a spare Intel NUC computer that fit my needs, and having a dedicated compact capture sensor seemed like a good idea.  The Malcolm ISO is quite large, anywhere from 4 – 6 GBs requiring the ISO to be downloaded in chunks from GitHub. There is an included script (release_cleaver.ps1) to stitch everything together.  Once downloaded and assembled, the ISO can be used to create a bootable drive using your favorite tool – Rufus, Balena Etcher…etc.The install is straight forward and runs through multiple prompts for selecting a customized installation. The documentation is quite robust on the Malcolm page (https://malcolm.fyi/)  which mirrors their GitHub page. While previous installations resulted in some tweaks here and there, the most recent ISO worked as advertised post installation. I am always surprised by the amount of people who are unaware of this tool.  The features and workflow made this internship so much easier than simply pulling and parsing honeypot logs.  Below is a common workflow that I used for one of the attacks I analyzed.I found info for this particular attack in the Zeek Weird Logs.  Zeek Weird logs are generated by protocol anomalies [3].  Weird.logs are often overlooked but can be advantageous to review, especially in my case where I only had traffic from one device.  There are other ways to filter for this example such as selecting Telenet from the Common Protocols List.  From here I filtered NUL_in_line to get the below. These logs indicate null bytes (\x00) are found in unexpected places.  From here I chose an IP originating from a country which I had a significant higher number of attacks – RUS.  Note:  Not captured on the previous dashboard image, but further down the screen was a world map with the IP activity level for each country. Selecting any identifying characteristic creates a dashboard filter.  Note the destination port number 23; Telnet. Once I have an IP, date, and time I pivot over to Arkime.  From here I create a filter for the IP and input the appropriate date and time.  Arkime provides session data and the ability to download the pcap to open in Wireshark for a more thorough deep dive.  Note under the Data Source Zeek is displayed.  There are multiple data sources (Arkime, Suricata, Zeek…etc.) that can be separately displayed or displayed all at once. Below Arkime is selected as the data source.  This view will provide the option to download the pcap which we will do next. We’ll expand the session and select “Download PCAP.”In Wireshark we see the below activity:Since this is an unencrypted TCP session, we can right click and select follow stream to view the below output:We see some root password guessing here with success using jvbzd, a default UNIX password SANS ISC advised against using this default password in 2016. [4]We see some recon attempts for mount points and attempts to reach out using wget. With this being a honeypot, the threat actor’s mobility was restricted and they eventually realized this and exited the box.  This is another strong reminder that only you can prevent easy exploitation by changing your default password. 
Malcolm is a great tool and free to implement.  [1] https://malcolm.fyi/docs/components.html

Friday, May 16th, 10:10 am, to be exact. Something interesting to note about the domain configuration is there’s a catchall account in place, so all email addresses are valid.Starting May 28th the new account started receiving targeted phishing email messages. The subject was either blank or a variation of my name (Chris or Christopher), and the sender's "From" address had a call to action and urgency:From: "EMERGENCY: PROVIDE YOUR CELL NUMBER IMMEDIATELY"
From: "EMERGENCY:PROVIDE YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER IMMEDIATELY ASAP"
From: "EMERGENCY; PROVIDE YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER IMMEDIATELY"
From: GET BACK TO ME IMMEDIATELY
From: Quick Response
From: Timely ReminderThe messages all indicated that there were some urgent tasks to perform and that I supposedly needed the person’s phone number. There were 8 unique email addresses used, all of which invoke the concept of urgency:hoursworking605--at--gmail_com
immediatelyofficemail79--at--gmail_com
officeoperatedeskboxx360--at--gmail_com
promotionaltask747--at--gmail_com
promotiontask910--at--gmail_com
quickreply946--at--gmail_com
quicktask5511--at--gmail_com
urgentmails696--at--gmail_comAll of these went into the Spam folder until June 10th, when a couple got through.  Noteworthy, almost all of the email salutations used the recipient’s LinkedIn name. This is obvious because his name on LI includes certifications. Then on June 10th, they sent him a text message:This is likely reasonably automated phishing with low targeting specificity, but the identification of the new account and fast phishing was interesting. In my case, it was easy to observe since there are so few accounts in the domain and he’s a vigilant and cyber-aware person. MFA is enabled.One question I have for readers: does anyone have a script or know of a project that’s an equivalent of Invoke-MSOLSpray targeting Google Workspace domains? Someone must be using something like that to discover new accounts. The email address wasn’t posted online anywhere. His LinkedIn profile has a different email address. So, there was some amount of correlation the sender of the spam did.Nothing especially surprising, but a reminder that they’re watching for opportunities. Someone new at the company and eager to appear responsive seems like a good phishing target!

If AI recommends glue as a pizza topping, then you’re safe for another day.But the fact remains that AI already has definite advantages over even the most skilled humans, and knowing where these advantages arise—and where they don’t—will be key to adapting to the AI-infused workforce.AI will often not be as effective as a human doing the same job. It won’t always know more or be more accurate. And it definitely won’t always be fairer or more reliable. But it may still be used whenever it has an advantage over humans in one of four dimensions: speed, scale, scope and sophistication. Understanding these dimensions is the key to understanding AI-human replacement.First, speed. There are tasks that humans are perfectly good at but are not nearly as fast as AI. One example is restoring or upscaling images: taking pixelated, noisy or blurry images and making a crisper and higher-resolution version. Humans are good at this; given the right digital tools and enough time, they can fill in fine details. But they are too slow to efficiently process large images or videos.Real-time performance matters in these cases, and the speed of AI is necessary to enable them.The second dimension of AI’s advantage over humans is scale. AI will increasingly be used in tasks that humans can do well in one place at a time, but that AI can do in millions of places simultaneously. A familiar example is ad targeting and personalization. Human marketers can collect data and predict what types of people will respond to certain advertisements. This capability is important commercially; advertising is a trillion-dollar market globally.AI models can do this for every single product, TV show, website and internet user. This is how the modern ad-tech industry works. Real-time bidding markets price the display ads that appear alongside the websites you visit, and advertisers use AI models to decide when they want to pay that price—thousands of times per second.Next, scope. AI can be advantageous when it does more things than any one person could, even when a human might do better at any one of those tasks. Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT can engage in conversation on any topic, write an essay espousing any position, create poetry in any style and language, write computer code in any programming language, and more. These models may not be superior to skilled humans at any one of these things, but no single human could outperform top-tier generative models across them all.It’s the combination of these competencies that generates value. Employers often struggle to find people with talents in disciplines such as software development and data science who also have strong prior knowledge of the employer’s domain. Organizations are likely to continue to rely on human specialists to write the best code and the best persuasive text, but they will increasingly be satisfied with AI when they just need a passable version of either.Finally, sophistication. AIs can consider more factors in their decisions than humans can, and this can endow them with superhuman performance on specialized tasks. Computers have long been used to keep track of a multiplicity of factors that compound and interact in ways more complex than a human could trace. The 1990s chess-playing computer systems such as Deep Blue succeeded by thinking a dozen or more moves ahead.Modern AI systems use a radically different approach: Deep learning systems built from many-layered neural networks take account of complex interactions—often many billions—among many factors. Neural networks now power the best chess-playing models and most other AI systems.Chess is not the only domain where eschewing conventional rules and formal logic in favor of highly sophisticated and inscrutable systems has generated progress. The stunning advance of AlphaFold2, the AI model of structural biology whose creators Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were recognized with the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2024, is another example.This breakthrough replaced traditional physics-based systems for predicting how sequences of amino acids would fold into three-dimensional shapes with a 93 million-parameter model, even though it doesn’t account for physical laws. That lack of real-world grounding is not desirable: No one likes the enigmatic nature of these AI systems, and scientists are eager to understand better how they work.Those are the four dimensions where AI can excel over humans. Accuracy still matters. You wouldn’t want to use an AI that makes graphics look glitchy or targets ads randomly—yet accuracy isn’t the differentiator. The AI doesn’t need superhuman accuracy. It’s enough for AI to be merely good and fast, or adequate and scalable. Increasing scope often comes with an accuracy penalty, because AI can generalize poorly to truly novel tasks. The 4 S’s are sometimes at odds. With a given amount of computing power, you generally have to trade off scale for sophistication.Even more interestingly, when an AI takes over a human task, the task can change. Sometimes the AI is just doing things differently. Other times, AI starts doing different things. These changes bring new opportunities and new risks.For example, high-frequency trading isn’t just computers trading stocks faster; it’s a fundamentally different kind of trading that enables entirely new strategies, tactics and associated risks. Likewise, AI has developed more sophisticated strategies for the games of chess and Go. And the scale of AI chatbots has changed the nature of propaganda by allowing artificial voices to overwhelm human speech.It is this “phase shift,” when changes in degree may transform into changes in kind, where AI’s impacts to society are likely to be most keenly felt. All of this points to the places that AI can have a positive impact. When a system has a bottleneck related to speed, scale, scope or sophistication, or when one of these factors poses a real barrier to being able to accomplish a goal, it makes sense to think about how AI could help.Equally, when speed, scale, scope and sophistication are not primary barriers, it makes less sense to use AI. This is why AI auto-suggest features for short communications such as text messages can feel so annoying. They offer little speed advantage and no benefit from sophistication, while sacrificing the sincerity of human communication.Many deployments of customer service chatbots also fail this test, which may explain their unpopularity. Companies invest in them because of their scalability, and yet the bots often become a barrier to support rather than a speedy or sophisticated problem solver.Keep this in mind when you encounter a new application for AI or consider AI as a replacement for or an augmentation to a human process. Looking for bottlenecks in speed, scale, scope and sophistication provides a framework for understanding where AI provides value, and equally where the unique capabilities of the human species give us an enduring advantage.This essay was written with Nathan E.
