Today, many organizations use cloud services and micro-services. In such environments, IP addresses assigned to virtual machines or services can often be volatile, meaning they can change or be reassigned to other organizations or users. This presents a risk for services relying on static IPs for security configurations and may introduce impersonation or data leakage issues.This morning, I was setting up a new environment. I got a new IP address assigned by my hosting company and deployed a classic configuration: a reverse-proxy redirecting to many web services and generating Let’s Encrypt certificates.Once the reverse proxy was in place, I started to deploy more services but detected some activity in the log (always keep an eye on your logs!) and saw this:{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T06:22:33Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \"postmaster.xxxxxxxx.hu\""}
{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T06:46:36Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \"pop3.xxxxxxxx.hu\""}
{"level":"debug","time":"2025-02-15T07:04:16Z","caller":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v3/pkg/tls/tlsmanager.go:228","message":"Serving default certificate for request: \”xxxxxxxx.hu\""}
A quick DNS request confirmed that these hosts are resolving to my newly assigned IP!Worse, this organization seems to still be using POP3, and a user (or a script) is still trying to fetch emails using this protocol!When you move to another hosting solution, update your DNS recordsCleanup your DNS zones and remove unwanted entriesUse mechanisms to preserve your IP addresses (like “Elastic IPs” provided by AWS)Xavier Mertens (@xme)

Critical functions have been halted, tens of thousands of federal staffers are being encouraged to resign, and congressional mandates are being disregarded. The next phase: The Department of Government Efficiency reportedly wants to use AI to cut costs. According to , Musk’s group has started to run sensitive data from government systems through AI programs to analyze spending and determine what could be pruned. This may lead to the elimination of human jobs in favor of automation. As one government official who has been tracking Musk’s DOGE team told the, the ultimate aim is to use AI to replace “the human workforce with machines.” (Spokespeople for the White House and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment.)Using AI to make government more efficient is a worthy pursuit, and this is not a new idea. The Biden administration disclosed more than 2,000 AI applications in development across the federal government. For example, FEMA has started using AI to help perform damage assessment in disaster areas. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started using AI to look for fraudulent billing. The idea of replacing dedicated and principled civil servants with AI agents, however, new—and complicated.The civil service—the massive cadre of employees who operate government agencies—plays a vital role in translating laws and policy into the operation of society. New presidents can issue sweeping executive orders, but they often have no real effect until they actually change the behavior of public servants. Whether you think of these people as essential and inspiring do-gooders, boring bureaucratic functionaries, or as agents of a “deep state,” their sheer number and continuity act as ballast that resists institutional change.This is why Trump and Musk’s actions are so significant. The more AI decision making is integrated into government, the easier change will be. If human workers are widely replaced with AI, executives will have unilateral authority to instantaneously alter the behavior of the government, profoundly raising the stakes for transitions of power in democracy. Trump’s unprecedented purge of the civil service might be the last time a president needs to replace the human beings in government in order to dictate its new functions. Future leaders may do so at the press of a button.To be clear, the use of AI by the executive branch doesn’t have to be disastrous. In theory, it could allow new leadership to swiftly implement the wishes of its electorate. But this could go very badly in the hands of an authoritarian leader. AI systems concentrate power at the top, so they could allow an executive to effectuate change over sprawling bureaucracies instantaneously. Firing and replacing tens of thousands of human bureaucrats is a huge undertaking. Swapping one AI out for another, or modifying the rules that those AIs operate by, would be much simpler.Social-welfare programs, if automated with AI, could be redirected to systematically benefit one group and disadvantage another with a single prompt change. Immigration-enforcement agencies could prioritize people for investigation and detainment with one instruction. Regulatory-enforcement agencies that monitor corporate behavior for malfeasance could turn their attention to, or away from, any given company on a whim.Even if Congress were motivated to fight back against Trump and Musk, or against a future president seeking to bulldoze the will of the legislature, the absolute power to command AI agents would make it easier to subvert legislative intent. AI has the power to diminish representative politics. Written law is never fully determinative of the actions of government—there is always wiggle room for presidents, appointed leaders, and civil servants to exercise their own judgment. Whether intentional or not, whether charitably or not, each of these actors uses discretion. In human systems, that discretion is widely distributed across many individuals—people who, in the case of career civil servants, usually outlast presidencies.Today, the AI ecosystem is dominated by a small number of corporations that decide how the most widely used AI models are designed, which data they are trained on, and which instructions they follow. Because their work is largely secretive and unaccountable to public interest, these tech companies are capable of making changes to the bias of AI systems—either generally or with aim at specific governmental use cases—that are invisible to the rest of us. And these private actors are both vulnerable to coercion by political leaders and self-interested in appealing to their favor. Musk himself created and funded xAI, now one of the world’s largest AI labs, with an explicitly ideological mandate to generate anti-“woke” AI and steer the wider AI industry in a similar direction.But there’s a second way that AI’s transformation of government could go. AI development could happen inside of transparent and accountable public institutions, alongside its continued development by Big Tech. Applications of AI in democratic governments could be focused on benefitting public servants and the communities they serve by, for example, making it easier for non-English speakers to access government services, making ministerial tasks such as processing routine applications more efficient and reducing backlogs, or helping constituents weigh in on the policies deliberated by their representatives. Such AI integrations should be done gradually and carefully, with public oversight for their design and implementation and monitoring and guardrails to avoid unacceptable bias and harm.Governments around the world are demonstrating how this could be done, though it’s early days. Taiwan has pioneered the use of AI models to facilitate deliberative democracy at an unprecedented scale. Singapore has been a leader in the development of public AI models, built transparently and with public-service use cases in mind. Canada has illustrated the role of disclosure and public input on the consideration of AI use cases in government. Even if you do not trust the current White House to follow any of these examples, U.S. states—which have much greater contact and influence over the daily lives of Americans than the federal government—could lead the way on this kind of responsible development and deployment of AI.As the political theorist David Runciman has written, AI is just another in a long line of artificial “machines” used to govern how people live and act, not unlike corporations and states before it. AI doesn’t replace those older institutions, but it changes how they function. As the Trump administration forges stronger ties to Big Tech and AI developers, we need to recognize the potential of that partnership to steer the future of democratic governance—and act to make sure that it does not enable future authoritarians.This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in The Atlantic.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake BSOD Delivered by Malicious Python Script, (Fri, Feb 14th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31686</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:18:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I found a Python script that implements a funny anti-analysis trick. The script has a low score on VT (4/59) (SHA256:d716c2edbcdb76c6a6d31b21f154fee7e0f8613617078b69da69c8f4867c9534)[1]. This sample attracted my attention because it uses the tkinter[2] library. This library is used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides tools to create windows, dialogs, buttons, labels, text fields, and other interactive elements, allowing developers to build desktop applications with visual interfaces in Python. Most Python scripts are intended to be executed from a command line. That's why I consider this library as a good sign of suspicious behavior (It does not mean that all Python scripts using this library are malicious!)While reviewing the script, a variable contains an interesting piece of text:info = "\nA problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage\nto your computer ... (removed) ..."The interesting piece of code is here:root = tk.Tk()
root.configure(background="dark blue")
ex = Example(root)
w, h = root.winfo_screenwidth(), root.winfo_screenheight()
root.overrideredirect(1)
root.geometry("%dx%d+0+0" % (w, h))
root.wm_attributes("-topmost", 1)
root.mainloop()
The attribute "-topmost" set to "1" or "TRUE" will make the window remain open on top of all windows. The window will also be created to fill the screen without any control elements to close or resize it. When the script is executed, you will get this screen:To be honest, that's not the best BSOD ("Blue Screen of Death") that I saw... but it's a nice trick to annoy the victim or slow down (a bit) the analysis of the file.Xavier Mertens (@xme)

Shortly after that investigation was published,  said it would stop bundling Onerep with the  browser and wind down its partnership with the company. But nearly a year later, Mozilla is still promoting it to Firefox users.Mozilla offers Onerep to Firefox users on a subscription basis as part of Mozilla Monitor Plus. Launched in 2018 under the name Firefox Monitor, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website Have I Been Pwned? to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.The ink on that partnership agreement had barely dried before KrebsOnSecurity published a story showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder  launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called  that sells background reports on people. This seemed to contradict Onerep’s stated motto, “We believe that no one should compromise personal online security and get a profit from it.”Shelest released a lengthy statement (PDF) wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in , a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he started Onerep.Onerep.com CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest, as pictured on the “about” page of onerep.com.Shelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.“I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.”When asked to comment on the findings, Mozilla said then that although customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep’s CEO did not align with their values.“We’re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first,” Mozilla said.In October 2024, Mozilla published a statement saying the search for a different provider was taking longer than anticipated.“While we continue to evaluate vendors, finding a technically excellent and values-aligned partner takes time,” Mozilla wrote. “While we continue this search, Onerep will remain the backend provider, ensuring that we can maintain uninterrupted services while we continue evaluating new potential partners that align more closely with Mozilla’s values and user expectations. We are conducting thorough diligence to find the right vendor.”Asked for an update, Mozilla said the search for a replacement partner continues.“The work’s ongoing but we haven’t found the right alternative yet,” Mozilla said in an emailed statement. “Our customers’ data remains safe, and since the product provides a lot of value to our subscribers, we’ll continue to offer it during this process.”It’s a win-win for Mozilla that they’ve received accolades for their principled response while continuing to partner with Onerep almost a year later. But if it takes so long to find a suitable replacement, what does that say about the personal data removal industry itself?Onerep appears to be working in partnership with another problematic people-search service: , which has a history of ignoring opt-out requests or failing to honor them. A week before breaking the story about Onerep, KrebsOnSecurity published research showing the co-founders of Radaris were two native Russian brothers who’d built a vast network of affiliate marketing programs and consumer data broker services.Lawyers for the Radaris co-founders threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that story was retracted in full, claiming the founders were in fact Ukrainian and that our reporting had defamed the brothers by associating them with the actions of Radaris. Instead, we published a follow-up investigation which showed that not only did the brothers from Russia create Radaris, for many years they issued press releases quoting a fictitious CEO seeking money from investors.Several readers have shared emails they received from Radaris after attempting to remove their personal data, and those messages show Radaris has been promoting Onerep.An email from Radaris promoting Onerep.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_izoDLdUW0</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>Darknet diaries</category><category>infosec</category><category>video</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n_izoDLdUW0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Jack Rhysider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Cheap Jammer That Disrupted Airport Communications

And the implications for national security are profound.First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had accessedtheUSTreasury computer system, giving them the ability to collect data on and potentially control the department’s roughly $5.45 trillion in annual federal payments.Then, we learned that uncleared DOGE personnel had gained access to classified data from the US Agency for International Development, possibly copying it onto their own systems. Next, the Office of Personnel Management—which holds detailed personal data on millions of federal employees, including those with security clearances—wascompromised. After that, Medicaid and Medicare records were compromised.Meanwhile, only partially redacted names of CIA employees were sent over an unclassified email account. DOGE personnel are also reported to be feeding Education Department data into artificial intelligence software, and they have also started working at the Department of Energy.This story is moving very fast. On Feb. 8, a federal judge blocked the DOGE team from accessing the Treasury Department systems any further. But given that DOGE workers have already copied data and possibly installed and modified software, it’s unclear how this fixes anything.In any case, breaches of other critical government systems are likely to follow unless federal employees stand firm on the protocols protecting national security.The systems that DOGE is accessing are not esoteric pieces of our nation’s infrastructure—they are the sinews of government.For example, the Treasury Department systems contain the technical blueprints for how the federal government moves money, while the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) network contains information on who and what organizations the government employs and contracts with.What makes this situation unprecedented isn’t just the scope, but also the method of attack. Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. The Chinese government’s 2015 breach of OPM was a significant US security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.In this case, external operators with limited experience and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny: gaining the highest levels of administrative access and making changes to the United States’ most sensitive networks, potentially introducing new security vulnerabilities in the process.But the most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted. It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—by removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.The Treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: No single person should have unlimited power. Just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.This approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. When your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. When a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. These aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. These measures have been bypassed or ignored. It’s as if someone found a way to rob Fort Knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.The implications for national security are staggering. Sen. Ron Wyden said his office had learned that the attackers gained privileges that allow them to modify core programs in Treasury Department computers that verify federal payments, access encrypted keys that secure financial transactions, and alter audit logs that record system changes. Over at OPM, reports indicate that individuals associated with DOGE connected an unauthorized server into the network. They are also reportedly trainingAI software on all of this sensitive data.This is much more critical than the initial unauthorized access. These new servers have unknown capabilities and configurations, and there’s no evidence that this new code has gone through any rigorous security testing protocols. The AIs being trained are certainly not secure enough for this kind of data. All are ideal targets for any adversary, foreign or domestic, also seeking access to federal data.There’s a reason why every modification—hardware or software—to these systems goes through a complex planning process and includes sophisticated access-control mechanisms. The national security crisis is that these systems are now much more vulnerable to dangerous attacks at the same time that the legitimate system administrators trained to protect them have been locked out.By modifying core systems, the attackers have not only compromised current operations, but have also left behind vulnerabilities that could be exploited in future attacks—giving adversaries such as Russia and China an unprecedentedopportunity. These countries have long targeted these systems. And they don’t just want to gather intelligence—they also want to understand how to disrupt these systems in a crisis.Now, the technical details of how these systems operate, their security protocols, and their vulnerabilities are now potentially exposed to unknown parties without any of the usual safeguards. Instead of having to breach heavily fortified digital walls, these parties  can simply walk through doors that are being propped open—and then erase evidence of their actions.The security implications span three critical areas.First, system manipulation: External operators can now modify operations while also altering audit trails that would track their changes. Second, data exposure: Beyond accessing personal information and transaction records, these operators can copy entire system architectures and security configurations—in one case, the technical blueprint of the country’s federal payment infrastructure. Third, and most critically, is the issue of system control: These operators can alter core systems and authentication mechanisms while disabling the very tools designed to detect such changes. This is more than modifying operations; it is modifying the infrastructure that those operations use.To address these vulnerabilities, three immediate steps are essential. First, unauthorized access must be revoked and proper authentication protocols restored. Next, comprehensive system monitoring and change management must be reinstated—which, given the difficulty of cleaning a compromised system, will likely require a complete system reset. Finally, thorough audits must be conducted of all system changes made during this period.This is beyond politics—this is a matter of national security. Foreign national intelligence organizations will be quick to take advantage of both the chaos and the new insecurities to steal US data and install backdoors to allow for future access.Each day of continued unrestricted access makes the eventual recovery more difficult and increases the risk of irreversible damage to these critical systems. While the full impact may take time to assess, these steps represent the minimum necessary actions to begin restoring system integrity and security protocols.Assuming that anyone in the government still cares.This essay was written with Davi Ottenheimer, and originally appeared in Foreign Policy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Thursday, February 13th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9322, (Thu, Feb 13th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31682</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 01:26:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Presumably the projects don’t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines—and then abandoned.Naturally, we registered them, just to see what would happen—”how many people are really trying to request software updates from S3 buckets that appear to have been abandoned months or even years ago?”, we naively thought to ourselves.Turns out they got eight million requests over two months.Had this been an actual attack, they would have modified the code in those buckets to contain malware and watch as it was incorporated in different software builds around the internet. This is basically the SolarWinds attack, but much more extensive.But there’s a second dimension to this attack. Because these update buckets are abandoned, the developers who are using them also no longer have the power to patch them automatically to protect them. The mechanism they would use to do so is now in the hands of adversaries. Moreover, often—but not always—losing the bucket that they’d use for it also removes the original vendor’s ability to identify the vulnerable software in the first place. That hampers their ability to communicate with vulnerable installations.Software supply-chain security is an absolute mess. And it’s not going to be easy, or cheap, to fix. Which means that it won’t be. Which is an even worse mess.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Achieve Transformative Network Security With Cisco Hybrid Mesh Firewall</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/achieve-transformative-network-security-with-cisco-hybrid-mesh-firewall/</link><author>Rick Miles</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hybrid Mesh Firewall addresses 3 forces: Fine-grained composition & distribution of apps in data centers, complex modern networks & sophisticated threats.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cisco and Wiz Collaborate to Enhance Cloud Security: Tackling AI-Generating Threats in Complex IT Infrastructures</title><link>https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-and-wiz-collaborate-to-enhance-cloud-security/</link><author>Rick Miles</author><category>Cisco Security Blog</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blogs.cisco.com/security">Security @ Cisco Blogs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cisco is collaborating with Wiz.

This patch should be a priority for enterprises, as Microsoft says it is being exploited, has low attack complexity, and no requirements for user interaction. senior staff research engineer  noted that since 2022, there have been nine elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in this same Windows component — three each year — including one in 2024 that was exploited in the wild as a zero day (CVE-2024-38193).“CVE-2024-38193 was exploited by the North Korean APT group known as Lazarus Group to implant a new version of the FudModule rootkit in order to maintain persistence and stealth on compromised systems,” Narang said. “At this time, it is unclear if CVE-2025-21418 was also exploited by Lazarus Group.”The other zero-day, CVE-2025-21391, is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Storage that could be used to delete files on a targeted system. Microsoft’s advisory on this bug references something called “CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access,” says no user interaction is required, and that the attack complexity is low., lead software engineer at , said although the advisory provides scant detail, and even offers some vague reassurance that ‘an attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,’ it would be a mistake to assume that the impact of deleting arbitrary files would be limited to data loss or denial of service.“As long ago as 2022, ZDI researchers set out how a motivated attacker could parlay arbitrary file deletion into full SYSTEM access using techniques which also involve creative misuse of symbolic links,”Barnett wrote.One vulnerability patched today that was publicly disclosed earlier is CVE-2025-21377, another weakness that could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on a vulnerable Windows system. Specifically, this is yet another Windows flaw that can be used to steal NTLMv2 hashes — essentially allowing an attacker to authenticate as the targeted user without having to log in.According to Microsoft, minimal user interaction with a malicious file is needed to exploit CVE-2025-21377, including selecting, inspecting or “performing an action other than opening or executing the file.”“This trademark linguistic ducking and weaving may be Microsoft’s way of saying ‘if we told you any more, we’d give the game away,'” Barnett said. “Accordingly, Microsoft assesses exploitation as more likely.”The SANS Internet Storm Center has a handy list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.It’s getting harder to buy Windows software that isn’t also bundled with Microsoft’s flagship Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) feature. Last month Microsoft started bundling Copilot with , which Redmond has since rebranded as “.” Ostensibly to offset the costs of its substantial AI investments, Microsoft also jacked up prices from 22 percent to 30 percent for upcoming license renewals and new subscribers.Office-watch.com writes that existing Office 365 users who are paying an annual cloud license do have the option of “Microsoft 365 Classic,” an AI-free subscription at a lower price, but that many customers are not offered the option until they attempt to cancel their existing Office subscription.In other security patch news,  has shipped iOS 18.3.1, which fixes a zero day vulnerability (CVE-2025-24200) that is showing up in attacks. has issued security updates that fix a total of 45 vulnerabilities across , , , , ,  and . at  notes that  is shipping an update today which will trigger updates for Chromium based browsers including , so be on the lookout for Chrome and Edge updates as we proceed through the week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Risky Business #779 -- DOGE staffer linked to The Com</title><link>https://risky.biz/RB779/</link><author></author><category>Risky Business blog</category><category>infosec</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media3.risky.biz/RB779.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 03:18:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://risky.biz/">Risky Business</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An ontology for threats, cybercrime and digital forensic investigation on Smart City Infrastructure, (Wed, Feb 12th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31676</link><author></author><category>Sans Edu Diaries</category><category>infosec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 02:05:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Blue teams have it hard – they maintain a watchful eye on whatever technology is deployed to detect threats, respond to incidents, perform digital forensics and reverse malware (or make malware happy!) when needed. Hopefully, no one has to handle all these roles alone since there is also the continuous learning aspect of getting up to speed with the latest threat vectors, vulnerabilities and exploit techniques. Adversaries only need one attack to succeed to gain actions on objective. In contrast, defenders have to detect and stop every attack to prevent adversaries from being successful. Let’s now extrapolate to an even bigger problem – what if this happens on emerging/future technologies and adversaries can get away with such crimes?Multiple countries are gradually considering the concept of Smart Cities, a key consideration in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As such technologies are implemented, the responsibility of defending this critical infrastructure again falls on the shoulders of blue teams. Smart Cities have yet to be fully implemented, but it does not mean we should not be proactive in preparing defenders to handle future problems. Current issues, even without Smart Cities in the fray, already cause blue team grief (e.g. different technology platforms, different contexts, information sharing, collaboration and tool interoperability). Given these complexities, an ontology would allow a shared understanding of vocabulary, facilitate data sharing, and even enable automated data reasoning.Wanting to pre-emptively solve future issues of attacks and cybercrime on Smart City Infrastructure (SCI), I (along with my co-authors in the SUTD ASSET Group) set out to create the Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE). SCOPE was designed to be an ontology for threats, cybercrime and digital forensic investigation on SCI. We did not create the ontology from scratch but chose to adhere to ontology best practices and extended the venerable Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) [1] and Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) [2]. UCO and CASE have gained some traction, and these ontologies have been experimentally adopted in forensic tools such as Cellebrite, Magnet Forensics, and MSAB XRY [3]. However, UCO and CASE did not have any SCI representation, and expecting overwhelmed blue teams to create them from scratch would most certainly be the straw that broke the camel’s back. Smart City Infrastructure Definition (reproduced with permission from the authors) [4]We deliberated on several design factors. Firstly, we defined smart cities using a technology-agnostic approach while adhering to international standards (with reference to Figure 1) that adopted the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (this was done in a previous work) [4]. By doing so, we ensured that the evolution of technologies or vendors would not affect the fundamental principle of Smart Cities. Secondly, we identified possible threats, cybercrime, and digital forensic evidence sources from the Smart City, which were defined in the first step (also from the same previous work) [4]. Thirdly, we included MITRE ATT&CK techniques and MITRE CAPEC into SCOPE for analysts and investigators to provide additional context to forensic evidence. Finally, we followed the ontological style and design practices when creating SCOPE, an expansion profile from UCO and CASE.We evaluated SCOPE via real-world attack scenarios attributed to publicly reported real-world incidents attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. With reference to Figure 2, the evaluation process workflow is shown. We successfully represented the attack scenarios, cybercrime committed, incident details, evidence and attack patterns (to name a few). SCOPE Evaluation Process (reproduced with permission from the authors) [3]Will SCOPE ever be helpful? Not yet. I hope it will come in handy in future for digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies when cybercrime on SCI becomes prevalent. As mentioned, SCOPE is technology-agnostic while adhering to several ISO standards. Additionally, it contains enough granularity to allow users to pinpoint key information while ensuring it can capture abstract definitions covering emerging technologies. We have made SCOPE publicly available to the digital forensic community to assist future smart city infrastructure investigations. SCOPE’s GitHub project link is https://github.com/scopeProject, and the official ontology website is https://scopeontology.org. If readers want to find out the complete details of SCOPE, you can find the full published paper in Volume 52 of Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation (FSIDI) or at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2025.301883.

Among these, 4 are classified as critical, highlighting the potential for significant impact if exploited. Notably, 2 vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild, underscoring the urgency for immediate updates. Additionally, 1 vulnerability has been disclosed prior to this patch cycle, marking it as a zero-day. Users are strongly advised to prioritize these updates to safeguard their systems against potential threats.Significant Vulnerabilities Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21418)
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21418, has a severity rating of Important with a CVSS score of 7.8. It is currently being exploited in the wild but has not been publicly disclosed, making it a significant concern for affected systems. The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges, thereby elevating their access and control over the compromised system. Immediate attention and remediation are advised to mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability.
This is a disclosed vulnerability with a severity rating of Important and a CVSS score of 7.1, which is currently being exploited in the wild. This vulnerability allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to delete targeted files on a system, significantly impacting the integrity and availability of the system without compromising confidentiality. The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the deletion of critical data, potentially rendering services unavailable. Despite its exploitation, it has not been publicly disclosed as a zero-day, and users are advised to implement appropriate security measures to mitigate its impact.
This is a disclosed zero-day vulnerability with a severity rating of Important and a CVSS score of 6.5, though it is not currently exploited in the wild. This vulnerability can lead to a total loss of confidentiality by allowing an attacker to obtain a user's NTLMv2 hash, which could be used to authenticate as the user. Exploitation requires minimal user interaction, such as selecting or inspecting a malicious file. It affects all supported versions of Microsoft Windows, and despite the retirement of Internet Explorer 11 and the deprecation of Microsoft Edge Legacy, updates are necessary due to the continued use of the MSHTML and EdgeHTML platforms in various applications. To ensure full protection, users are advised to install both Security Only updates and IE Cumulative updates.Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21177)
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21177, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, classifying it as a non-zero-day. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 8.7, indicating a significant risk of elevation of privilege if exploited. Although the vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and elevate their privileges within the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales environment, Microsoft has fully mitigated the issue, requiring no action from users. This CVE serves to enhance transparency regarding cloud service vulnerabilities.Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21376)
This is a critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 8.1, which has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, thus not classified as a zero-day. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, posing a significant threat if exploited. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable LDAP server, potentially causing a buffer overflow. The attack complexity is high, as successful exploitation requires the attacker to win a race condition. Mitigation efforts should focus on securing LDAP servers and monitoring for unusual activity to prevent potential exploitation.
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21381, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, making it a non-zero-day threat. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 7.8, indicating a significant risk of remote code execution. Despite the CVSS metric indicating a local attack vector, the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code remotely by convincing a user, through social engineering, to download and open a specially crafted file. The attack can be executed locally, with the Preview Pane serving as a potential attack vector. Users are advised to exercise caution when opening files from untrusted sources and to apply any available security updates to mitigate this risk.DHCP Client Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21379)
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21379, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, classifying it as a non-zero-day threat. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 7.1, indicating a significant risk of remote code execution. The vulnerability requires a high attack complexity, necessitating a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker must intercept the logical network path between the target and the resource. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it is limited to systems on the same network segment, such as those connected to the same network switch or virtual network. This limitation prevents the attack from being executed across multiple networks, such as a WAN.Microsoft High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21198)
is a critical security flaw with a CVSS score of 9.0, rated as Important, and is currently neither exploited in the wild nor publicly disclosed. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, requiring an attacker to have low privileges and access to the network connecting the targeted HPC clusters and nodes. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it relies on intra-net or private network access rather than exposure to the public internet. Exploitation involves sending a specially crafted HTTPS request to the head node or Linux compute node, potentially allowing the attacker to execute code on other clusters or nodes connected to the targeted head node. The scope of the attack is changed, indicating that successful exploitation could lead to broader impacts beyond the initially compromised system.Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21190)
This is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, classified as Important. Although it has not been exploited in the wild or disclosed publicly, this vulnerability poses a risk of remote code execution. An attacker could exploit it by deceiving a user into sending a request to a malicious server, which could then return harmful data leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The attack vector is network-based, requiring user interaction, as the attacker needs a client to connect to the malicious server to execute code on the client system.Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-21200)
This is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, rated as Important, though it has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, thus not classified as a zero-day. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, where an attacker could potentially trick a user into sending a request to a malicious server. The server could then return malicious data, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The attack vector is network-based, requiring user interaction, as the client must connect to a malicious server, which could enable the attacker to execute code on the client machine. Mitigation strategies should focus on user awareness and network security measures to prevent such exploitations.
This summary of Microsoft's monthly updates highlights several critical vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for immediate attention to certain threats. The Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock vulnerability (CVE-2025-21418) is currently being exploited and poses a significant risk due to its potential for SYSTEM privilege escalation. Users should prioritize patching this vulnerability. Additionally, the Windows Storage vulnerability (CVE-2025-21391) is actively exploited, risking data integrity and availability. The NTLM Hash Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2025-21377), a zero-day, threatens confidentiality and requires prompt updates. Other critical vulnerabilities, such as those affecting Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and Windows LDAP, though not exploited, demand vigilance and timely updates to prevent potential exploitation. Users are advised to prioritize these updates and enhance security measures to mitigate risks effectively.February 2025 Security UpdatesFebruary 2025 Security UpdatesExploitability (old versions)Azure Network Watcher VM Extension Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityChromium: CVE-2025-0444 Use after free in SkiaChromium: CVE-2025-0445 Use after free in V8Chromium: CVE-2025-0451 Inappropriate implementation in Extensions APIDHCP Client Service Denial of Service VulnerabilityDHCP Client Service Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityHackerOne: CVE-2023-32002 Node.js `Module._load()` policy Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityInternet Connection Sharing (ICS) Denial of Service VulnerabilityKernel Streaming WOW Thunk Service Driver Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft Digest Authentication Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Dynamics 365 Sales Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft Edge (Chromium-based) Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Edge (Chromium-based) Spoofing VulnerabilityMicrosoft Edge for IOS and Android Spoofing VulnerabilityMicrosoft Excel Information Disclosure VulnerabilityMicrosoft Excel Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Denial of Service VulnerabilityMicrosoft Office Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Outlook Spoofing VulnerabilityMicrosoft PC Manager Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityMicrosoft SharePoint Server Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityMicrosoft Surface Security Feature Bypass VulnerabilityNTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing VulnerabilityVisual Studio Code Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityVisual Studio Code JS Debug Extension Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityVisual Studio Installer Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Active Directory Domain Services API Denial of Service VulnerabilityWindows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Core Messaging Elevation of Privileges VulnerabilityWindows Deployment Services Denial of Service VulnerabilityWindows Disk Cleanup Tool Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Installer Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Kerberos Denial of Service VulnerabilityWindows Kernel Security Feature Bypass VulnerabilityWindows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows NTFS Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Remote Desktop Configuration Service Tampering VulnerabilityWindows Resilient File System (ReFS) Deduplication Service Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows Setup Files Cleanup Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Storage Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityWindows Telephony Server Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityWindows Win32 Kernel Subsystem Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability

The problem is that Mark-of-Web (MoW) isn't propagated correctly: when extracted, a file inside a ZIP file inside another ZIP file will not have the MoW propagated from the outer ZIP file.That's good to know, but what I personally consider more important to know, is that MoW isn't propagated at all by 7-zip in its default configuration.I wrote about this a couple years ago in diary entry "7-Zip & MoW", when this new feature was introduced.You have to enable MoW propagation in the GUI or via the registry. And that is still the case with the latest versions of 7-zip.
