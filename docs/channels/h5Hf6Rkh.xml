However, when every individual character change has a specific price tag, and you can take multiple "detours" through other characters to save money, the problem transforms into a fascinating pathfinding challenge.Two strings,  and , of the same length.A set of allowed character transformations (e.g., change 'a' to 'b') and their associated costs.The ability to use multiple steps to reach a target character (e.g., 'a' to 'c' to 'b').Calculate the minimum total cost to transform every character in  to the corresponding character in .Return -1 if any character in the  cannot be transformed into the required  character. source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20] 28 To convert the string "abcd" to string "acbe":Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost. source = "aaaa", target = "bbbb", original = ["a","c"], changed = ["c","b"], cost = [1,2] 12 To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred. source = "abcd", target = "abce", original = ["a"], changed = ["e"], cost = [10000] -1 It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.1 <= source.length == target.length <= 105source, target consist of lowercase English letters.1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000original[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.original[i] != changed[i]
  
  
  Intuition: Thinking in Graphs
Think of the English alphabet as 26 distinct cities. Every transformation rule given in the input is a one-way road between these cities with a specific toll (the cost). Our task is to find the cheapest route from "City A" to "City B" for every character pair in our strings.Since we only have 26 possible characters, we can pre-calculate the shortest path between every possible pair of letters. Even if the input gives us a direct path from 'a' to 'b' costing 10, there might be a cheaper way: 'a' to 'c' (cost 2) and then 'c' to 'b' (cost 3), totaling only 5.We use the  to solve this. It systematically checks if passing through an intermediate letter 'k' provides a cheaper path between letters 'i' and 'j'. Once we have this 26x26 matrix of minimum costs, we simply iterate through our strings and sum up the values.
  
  
  Walkthrough: Understanding the Examples
Example 1: source = "abcd", target = "acbe" 'a' to 'a'. Cost is 0. 'b' to 'c'. The direct cost is 5. 'c' to 'b'. Direct cost is not available, but we can go 'c' to 'e' (1) and 'e' to 'b' (2). Total cost is 3. 'd' to 'e'. Direct cost is 20.Example 2: source = "aaaa", target = "bbbb"Rules: 'a' to 'c' (1), 'c' to 'b' (2).To get from 'a' to 'b', we must go through 'c'. Cost per character is .Since there are 4 characters, total cost is . When you need to find the shortest path between all possible nodes in a small graph (like the 26 letters of the alphabet), Floyd-Warshall is your best friend. Many problems that don't look like "maps" can be treated as graphs if they involve transitions between states with specific costs. When calculating minimums, initialize your values to a sufficiently large number to represent "impossible" paths, but ensure it doesn't cause overflow in your language.This problem is a classic example of why recognizing patterns is more important than memorizing code. In a real-world software system, this logic is used in things like network routing protocols or  where we need to find the most efficient connection between two points through various intermediaries. Mastering this ensures you can handle optimization tasks where the best path isn't always the most obvious one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧩 Building a Number Snake Puzzle Generator in Python (with PDF &amp; JPG Export)</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/building-a-number-snake-puzzle-generator-in-python-with-pdf-jpg-export-2hho</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:34:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build a desktop app in Python that generates Number Snake math puzzles. The app:Creates solvable arithmetic “snake” pathsSupports Easy (3×3), Medium (4×4), and Hard (5×5) gridsShows step-by-step solutionsExports puzzles to PDF or JPGCan batch-generate multiple worksheetsttkbootstrap for modern stylingThis guide is written for beginners and breaks everything into small, understandable steps.Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.Then install the required packages:pip install ttkbootstrap reportlab pillowWe’ll place everything inside this file.🧱 Step 1 — Imports and Basic SetupStart by importing the libraries we’ll need:import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox, filedialog
import random
import operator
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
from pathlib import Path
ttkbootstrap → modern dark theme + widgetsrandom + operator → puzzle mathreportlab → PDF generationPath → clean file handling🐍 Step 2 — Create the Main App ClassNow we define our application class:class NumberSnake:
    APP_NAME = "Number Snake Generator"
    APP_VERSION = "1.0"

    OPERATORS = {
        "+": operator.add,
        "-": operator.sub,
        "*": operator.mul,
        "/": operator.floordiv
    }
APP_NAME and APP_VERSION are just labelsOPERATORS maps symbols to real Python math functionsThis lets us randomly choose operations later.🖥️ Step 3 — Initialize the WindowInside , we configure the GUI:def __init__(self):
    self.root = tk.Tk()
    tb.Style(theme="darkly")

    self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
    self.root.geometry("1100x680")

    self.difficulty_var = tk.StringVar(value="Easy")
    self.num_puzzles_var = tk.IntVar(value=1)

    self.grid_numbers = []
    self.grid_ops = []
    self.solution_path = []
    self.target_number = None

    self.rows = self.cols = 0

    self._build_ui()
Sets defaults for difficulty and puzzle countInitializes empty puzzle dataCalls _build_ui() to draw the interface🎛️ Step 4 — Build the User InterfaceNow we create labels, dropdowns, and buttons:def _build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME,
             font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)

    opts = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Options", padding=10)
    opts.pack(fill="x", padx=10)

    tb.Label(opts, text="Difficulty:").pack(side="left")
    tb.Combobox(opts,
        values=["Easy","Medium","Hard"],
        textvariable=self.difficulty_var,
        width=10
    ).pack(side="left", padx=5)

    tb.Label(opts, text="Number of Puzzles:").pack(side="left", padx=10)
    tb.Spinbox(opts, from_=1, to=20,
               textvariable=self.num_puzzles_var,
               width=5).pack(side="left")
ctrl = tb.Frame(self.root)
ctrl.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=10)

tb.Button(ctrl, text="Generate Single Puzzle",
          bootstyle="success",
          command=self.generate_single_puzzle).pack(side="left", padx=5)

tb.Button(ctrl, text="Multiple PDFs",
          bootstyle="warning",
          command=self.generate_multiple_combined_pdf).pack(side="left", padx=5)

tb.Button(ctrl, text="JPG Export",
          bootstyle="secondary",
          command=self.generate_multiple_jpgs).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Each button simply calls a method we’ll define later.🧠 Step 5 — Generate the Snake PuzzleThis is the heart of the project.def create_puzzle_data(self):
    diff = self.difficulty_var.get()
    self.rows, self.cols = (3,3) if diff=="Easy" else (4,4) if diff=="Medium" else (5,5)

    visited = [[False]*self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]
    r = c = 0

    self.solution_path = [(0,0)]
    visited[0][0] = True
Grid size depends on difficultyvisited tracks where we’ve beenmoves = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]

while len(self.solution_path) < self.rows * self.cols:
    random.shuffle(moves)
    for dr, dc in moves:
        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
        if 0<=nr<self.rows and 0<=nc<self.cols and not visited[nr][nc]:
            r, c = nr, nc
            self.solution_path.append((r,c))
            visited[r][c] = True
            break
This randomly walks through the grid, touching every cell once.➕ Step 6 — Fill Numbers and Operationsnumbers = [[0]*self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]
ops = [[None]*self.cols for _ in range(self.rows)]

current = random.randint(1,9)
numbers[0][0] = current
steps = [f"Start: {current}"]
Then for every next cell:for r,c in self.solution_path[1:]:
    valid = False
    while not valid:
        op = random.choice(list(self.OPERATORS.keys()))
        num = random.randint(1,9)

        if op == "/" and current % num != 0:
            continue
        if op == "-" and current - num <= 0:
            continue

        next_val = self.OPERATORS[op](current, num)
        valid = True

    ops[r][c] = op
    numbers[r][c] = num
    steps.append(f"{current} {op} {num} = {next_val}")
    current = next_val
Avoid fractional divisionEnsure every puzzle is solvable with integers🎯 Step 7 — Display the Grid and SolutionWe draw labels for each cell:def display_grid(self):
    for r in range(self.rows):
        for c in range(self.cols):
            text = str(self.grid_numbers[r][c]) \
                   if self.grid_ops[r][c] is None \
                   else f"{self.grid_ops[r][c]}{self.grid_numbers[r][c]}"
Green cells highlight the snake path.The solution panel prints each math step:def show_solution(self):
    self.solution_text.delete("1.0", tk.END)
    self.solution_text.insert(tk.END, "\n".join(self.steps))
c = canvas.Canvas("puzzle.pdf", pagesize=A4)
c.drawString(50, 800, "Number Snake Puzzle")
Each puzzle can be saved separately or combined.🖼️ Step 9 — Export to JPGimg = Image.new("RGB",(900,700),(34,34,34))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
draw.text((20,20),"Number Snake Puzzle", fill="white")
Save as NumberSnake_1.jpg, NumberSnake_2.jpg, etc.Perfect for printable worksheets.▶️ Final Step — Run the AppAt the bottom of your file:if __name__ == "__main__":
    NumberSnake().run()
You now have a full desktop app that:Generates arithmetic snake puzzlesSupports batch worksheet creation]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I Discovered a Critical Security Gap in Our HashiCorp Vault - And What It Taught Me About Policy Design</title><link>https://dev.to/bhanu_prakash_bd40068f3b6/how-i-discovered-a-critical-security-gap-in-our-hashicorp-vault-and-what-it-taught-me-about-55e3</link><author>Bhanu prakash</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 01:59:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Day I Found a Security Hole in Our Vault Setup
The "Oh Shit" Moment
I was writing a Python script to inventory service accounts across our 50+ Vault namespaces when something caught my eye. Teams were creating auth mounts with weird names - stuff we never approved.Turns out, our wildcard policies had a massive flaw.What We Screwed Up
Our policy looked innocent enough:path "auth/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
We thought: "Let teams manage auth in their namespace. What could go wrong?"Everything. Everything could go wrong.That wildcard meant teams could create any auth mount type, not just the standard AppRole we supported. So they did:Custom AppRole mounts: auth/my-special-approle/Random Kubernetes auth (we don't even use K8s auth)LDAP configs that bypassed our central authExperimental mounts nobody remembered creatingOut of 50+ namespaces, 15% had rogue auth mounts we didn't know existed.Why This Actually Mattered
Monitoring blindspot: Our Splunk dashboards looked for auth/approle/. These custom mounts were invisible.Support hell: Teams configured Vault Agents wrong, got auth failures, opened tickets. We couldn't help because their setup didn't match our docs.Future nightmare: Try migrating 50 namespaces when everyone's doing their own thing.How I Found It
Simple inventory script:for namespace in all_namepaces:
    auth_mounts = vault_client.sys.list_auth_methods()
    for mount in auth_mounts:
        if mount not in ['approle/', 'token/']:
            print(f"WTF is this: {namespace}/{mount}")The output was... concerning.Checked Splunk to see if anyone was actually using these:index=vault_audit request.path="auth/*/login"
| stats count by request.namespace request.path40% had zero logins in 90 days. Dead mounts from old experiments.The Fix
Step 1: Stop the bleeding - locked down policies immediately:`Old (bad)
path "auth/*" { capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"] }path "auth/approle/*" { capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"] }`Step 2: Reached out to teams, made migration plansStep 3: Still migrating production stuff months later (it takes time)What I Learned
Wildcards are dangerous. Be explicit. Always.Your monitoring only catches what you're looking for. Inventory everything, not just what you expect.Standards aren't real until you enforce them. Documentation doesn't count if the system allows chaos.Fixing production takes forever. We're still cleaning this up.The Bigger Issue
This also exposed that our parent/child namespace model was overly complex. We eventually flattened everything - but that's Part 2.If You Run Vault
Check your policies right now:vault policy read your-policy | grep "*"Every wildcard is a potential problem. Can you be more specific?Then actually inventory what exists in your Vault. I bet you'll find surprises.Next up: Why we ditched nested namespaces and went flat. Plus the monitoring system I built to catch this stuff automatically.Drop a comment if you've hit similar issues. I know I'm not the only one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python math.gcd</title><link>https://dev.to/slackman/python-mathgcd-2eo</link><author>slackman</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 01:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[def gcd(a,b):

The AI Assistant Will See You Now</title><link>https://dev.to/david_kershaw_b6916404da6/jsonpath-is-in-the-ai-assistant-will-see-you-now-5cge</link><author>David Kershaw</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 01:22:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[JSONL is a neat and kind of weird data format. It is well-known to be useful for logs and API calls, among other things. And your favorite AI assistant API is one place you'll probably find it.CsvPath Framework supports validating JSONL. (In fact, it supports JSONL for the whole data preboarding lifecycle, but that's a longer story). And now CsvPath Validation Language supports JSONPath expressions. Since AI prompts are only kinda sorta JSONL, having JSONPath to dig into them is helpful.What I mean by kinda-sorta is that your basic prompt sequence is a series of JSON lines, but the lines are all 1-column wide and arbitrarily deep. That sounds more like a series of JSON "documents" than it does like single JSONL stream. Or, anyway, that's my take.Let's look at how to use JSONPath to inspect a JSONL file using CsvPath Validation Language in FlightPath Data. For those of you who don't already know, FlightPath Data is the dev and ops frontend to CsvPath Framework. It is a free and open source download from the Apple MacOS Store or the Microsoft Store.The file is a common example prompt. We'll start by looking at one line.{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a happy assistant that puts a positive spin on everything."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I'm hungry."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Eat a banana!"
    }
  ]
}
From CsvPath Framework's perspective this is a one-header document. The one header is . If you open this in the grid view you see only the one header. (i.e. one column; but with delimited files we try to stick to the word "header" because with "column" your RDBMS-soaked brain starts to make incorrect assumptions).Here's what it looks like: That's not super fun. The reason is that:JSONL doesn't present its headers in the grid view (for good reasons)The  header is arbitrarily deeply nested, unlike the typical JSONL log lineNevertheless, that's what we have. Will it blend? I mean validate? Yes. JSONPath to the rescue. That said I'll pause to admit that I'm not a JSONPath expert.Right-click in the project files tree on the left of FlightPath and create a new  file, e.g. . Drop this simple example in it.$[*][ 
    push("roles", jsonpath(#messages, "$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content") )

    last() -> print("See the variables tab for results")
]
You can see the  function. It is acting on the  header, as we'd want. We're pushing the data pulled by the JSONPath expression into a stack variable named . A stack variable is like a Python list or tuple. You create a variable by using it.  is part of the set of zero or more variables that are available throughout the csvpath statement run. They are captured to the Variables tab for a one-off FlightPath Data test run. For a production run they end up in the  file in the run results.Put your cursor in the csvpath statement and click  (or  on Windows). The output tabs should open at the bottom-middle of the screen, below your csvpath file. Click to the  tab and have a look.$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content
picked out the objects in the  array where  equaled . And from those objects it extracted and returned the value of the  key. Pretty simple stuff. Tho, I have to admit it took me a few minutes to wrap  my JSONPath-inexperienced head around the context for the JSONPath expression. I was thinking of the whole document or the whole line, but that wasn't right.It is obviously the JSON value assigned to the  key, which is an array, in this case. Once I was operating from that correct context, the JSONPath became pretty straightforward. (Those of us with XPath scars need not be as afraid as we might be!)The point here is two-part. First, we can deal with AI prompts or any other JSONL that is deeply nested. Hooray! The data may look odd, if you are comparing it to regular tabular data, but that's no reason to not validate. Second, this example makes the point that we're doing JSONPath rules-based validation within our CsvPath context. How very Schematron-like, since Schematron does XPath validation within XSLT. Maybe this sounds complicated, but really it's not. CsvPath Validation Language is great for all things line-oriented. In this case, there isn't much for it to do, except hand off to JSONPath, which is great at documents (a.k.a. objects). Simple enough.If we wanted to create a bunch of JSONPath rules to validate our AI prompt JSONL, we could do that. To just do a quick throw-away second rule as an example try this:$[*][ 
    push("roles", jsonpath(#messages, "$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content") )

    @stmts = jsonpath(#0, "$.`len`")
    print("Line $.csvpath.line_number: $.variables.stmts")
    @stmts == 3 

    last.nocontrib() -> print("See the variables tab for results")
]
That new rule will net you 2 lines, which are either valid or failed, depending on how you want to use your csvpath statement. You will see them in the  tab.At the same time the expanded csvpath statement will continue to pull in the same data to the variables tab that we got with the first version of the csvpath.To clean it up just a little, you can do:$[*][ 
    push("roles", jsonpath(#messages, "$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content") )

    jsonpath(#0, "$.`len`") == 3
]
There you go, a valid 2-rule validation statement using JSONPath on nested JSON in a JSONL document. Useful? Totally! Give it a try.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Selamat Datang Di Sayabet</title><link>https://dev.to/cssayabet/selamat-datang-di-sayabet-2oni</link><author>Sayabet_Gacor</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:06:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Situs Resmi Dan Terpercaya Tahun 2026!!

It applies a very simple syntax and a large number of functions to validate CSV, JSONL, and Excel files in ways that were never-before possible.And then comes the moment when you want to do some crazy thing that the CsvPath Framework contributors didn't think of. What to do? You create a custom function that does exactly that.Custom functions even work in FlightPath Data and FlightPath Server. I call that out because FlightPath Data is a multi-project environment. And FlightPath Server is both multi-project and also multi-user. That means functions must be scoped and sandboxed. They are and they work great! Let's create a trivial example to show the setup of a custom function. I'll leave the actual functionality as an exercise for the reader, since that part is demonstrated copiously in the CsvPath Framework Github repo.Our goal is to create a function called . It will functionally be the same as . I.e. it returns .Our csvpath statement will be:If you try that in FlightPath Data you will get this error message:The first step is to point to a functions import file. By default, import files are called  and live in the project's  directory. In FlightPath Data, click  at the bottom left of the app to open the config panel. Then click  in the vertical tabs to open the functions config form. The form has just one field for the path to the imports file. The path can be relative or absolute.Once the path is ready click  and then .Next we need to edit the imports file to include our  function. Right click on the blank space in the project files tree and select .Open the config directory and you should see three files, , , and . If you don't see all three don't worry about it; some files are generated just in time. If there is no  create one. Then open it.In  we're going to add one line that imports our  function.This is basically the same form as Python's. It says find the  file and import the  class, using the name  as the function name of the imported class. Simple!Finally we just need to put the custom function in the right place. The right place, starting from the project's home directory, is config/example/one/yes.py.I copied the regular  class from its file in the repo to make my example . Again, we're just setting up a custom function, not showing how to write an awesome function.This is where the  file lives.And... we're basically ready to go. However, if you ran a csvpath already, restart FlightPath to clear the function classes that were already loaded. You can do this programmatically in CsvPath Framework, but there's no button in FlightPath's config yet.That done, back in FlightPath Data right click in your project files tree and create a new file. Call it , or whatever you like.In it, paste our test csvpath:Now, with your cursor inside the csvpath statement, click  (or  on Windows). You should see the message Test run complete. Matched 2 lines. in the status bar and the printouts tab should be blank. (If your status bar says  but has a different number of lines don't worry about it; your test data and mine just aren't the same).For a bit of comfort that all is working as expected, add a print line like this and you should get the same printouts shown.And that's all there is to it. Now you'll never be stumped by the absence of , because you can write it yourself. To be fair, though, while a simple function can be trivial, as we just saw,  more complex functions can be... well, more complex. If you need help creating your awesome function don't hesitate to reach out. We'll be glad to help you get started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Privacy Engineering: Automated PII Detection and Redaction</title><link>https://dev.to/deepak_mishra_35863517037/privacy-engineering-automated-pii-detection-and-redaction-4phl</link><author>Lalit Mishra</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Executive Summary: The Engineering Imperative of Data Sanitization
The digitization of global commerce and the exponential growth of machine learning applications have fundamentally altered the relationship between software architecture and data privacy. Historically, privacy was relegated to the domain of legal compliance—a passive exercise in drafting Terms of Service, consent forms, and retention policies. In the modern data ecosystem, however, privacy has evolved into a hard engineering constraint. It is no longer sufficient to promise privacy; systems must be architected to enforce it deterministically.For senior privacy engineers and data platform architects, the mandate is clear: shift from "compliance by policy" to "compliance by code." The ingestion of unstructured data—whether through high-concurrency web scraping, log aggregation, or third-party API consumption—introduces a significant risk vector. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) acts as a contaminant within the data lake, turning valuable datasets into "toxic assets" that attract regulatory scrutiny and compromise downstream machine learning models.This blog articulates a comprehensive framework for "Privacy Engineering," treating data sanitization as a core software engineering discipline. We explore the architectural failure modes of naive ingestion, the technical supremacy of Microsoft Presidio as a detection standard, and the implementation of robust, privacy-aware pipelines. By integrating Named Entity Recognition (NER), context-aware logic, and advanced cryptographic redaction strategies, engineering teams can dismantle the traditional friction between data utility and data privacy, ensuring alignment with GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI safety standards.Let make our mood light with a pretty funny meme 😊!
  
  
  The Anatomy of a Failure: When "Public" Data Becomes a Liability
To understand the necessity of privacy engineering, one must first analyze the catastrophic failure modes of naive data ingestion. A prevailing misconception among data engineers is that "public" data—information accessible without authentication on the open web—is free from privacy constraints. This assumption is legally perilous and technically flawed.Consider a hypothetical scenario involving "FinScrape Analytics," a fintech entity developing alternative credit scoring models. The engineering team deploys a distributed scraping architecture using headless browsers (e.g., Playwright or Selenium) to aggregate professional profiles from public social media platforms, industry forums, and corporate "About Us" pages. The objective is to extract job titles, employment history, and public endorsements to infer creditworthiness. The scraper is designed to extract  and  content based on CSS selectors. However, the unstructured text within these containers often contains unsolicited PII that the scraper is not designed to recognize or filter. A forum post scraped for sentiment analysis contains a user pasting their personal phone number and email address to resolve a customer service dispute. A scraped corporate biography inadvertently captures a home address listed alongside a business address, or a personal mobile number used for emergency contact. The text contains inferred political opinions, trade union membership, or health data (Special Category Data under GDPR Article 9), which requires explicit consent to process, regardless of its public availability.
  
  
  The Regulatory Blast Radius
Upon ingestion, this raw text is serialized (e.g., JSON or Avro) and dumped into a Data Lake (S3, Azure Blob Storage) and subsequently loaded into a data warehouse like Snowflake. The PII is now "at rest" and replicated across multiple environments (development, staging, production).GDPR Violation (Article 5 - Data Minimization): The company collected data irrelevant to the specified purpose. The principle of data minimization dictates that only data strictly necessary for the purpose should be processed.GDPR Violation (Article 14 - Notification): Since the data was not obtained directly from the subject, the company maintains an obligation to notify the individuals—an operational impossibility given the volume of millions of records. Regulatory bodies like the French CNIL and Irish DPC have aggressively penalized companies for scraping public data without valid legal bases or sanitization measures. For instance, the French DPA fined a data broker €240,000 for scraping LinkedIn profiles without adequate transparency or legal basis, emphasizing that "public" availability does not negate privacy rights. Similarly, Meta (Facebook) faced a €265 million fine related to a scraping leak, underscoring that the failure to implement "technical and organizational measures" to prevent PII harvesting is a punishable offense. The failure was not in the scraping code’s ability to fetch HTML, but in the pipeline’s lack of a "Privacy Firewall." Privacy Engineering dictates that no unstructured text should land in persistent storage without passing through a decontamination layer.
  
  
  Privacy Engineering: A Core Discipline
The transition from legal checkpoints to engineering checkpoints requires a fundamental change in how data pipelines are conceived. Privacy Engineering operationalizes abstract legal principles into concrete code execution, moving the responsibility from the legal department to the DevOps and Data Engineering teams.
  
  
  The Privacy-by-Design Pipeline Model
Traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes often treat privacy as a governance task performed after loading—typically triggered by an audit or a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). Privacy Engineering moves this to the "Transform" phase, or even earlier, to the "Extraction" phase, creating a proactive defense mechanism.Table 1: The Shift from Compliance to EngineeringLegal/Compliance ApproachPrivacy Engineering ApproachIngestion event (Real-time/Batch)Policy documents & retention schedulesCode-level filtering & sanitizationRetroactive deletion/suppressionProactive redaction/tokenizationSpreadsheets, Legal CounselNLP Models, Regex, Vaults, PresidioCompliance Certifications (SOC2, ISO)Recall/Precision of PII Detection, Latency
  
  
  Shift Left: Sanitization at the Edge
The most effective privacy architecture sanitizes data as close to the source as possible. In a scraping context, this means analyzing the text payload within the scraper’s memory space or immediately upon message queue ingestion (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis), before writing to disk. This aligns with the GDPR principle of Data Protection by Design and by Default (Article 25). By stripping PII from the payload before it enters the data lake, the "toxic asset" liability is neutralized immediately. Raw identifiers never spread across logs, backups, or downstream systems, limiting the "blast radius" of any potential breach.This "Shift Left" approach fundamentally changes the economics of data protection. Remediation of PII deep within a data warehouse is computationally expensive and operationally complex (requiring rewrite of immutable partitions). Sanitization at ingestion is a linear cost associated with compute, preventing the compounding debt of privacy risk.
  
  
  Technical Deep Dive: Microsoft Presidio
To implement this vision, engineers require a robust, extensible, and production-ready detection engine. Microsoft Presidio has emerged as the industry standard open-source framework for this purpose. Unlike proprietary SaaS solutions that act as black boxes, Presidio offers the transparency, modularity, and on-premises deployment capabilities required for high-stakes engineering.
  
  
  Architecture: Separation of Concerns
Presidio’s architecture is bifurcated into two distinct, decoupled services: the  and the . This separation is critical for auditability and flexibility, allowing detection logic to evolve independently of redaction policies.
The Analyzer is the detection brain. It ingests unstructured text and outputs a list of detected entities with confidence scores and location indices. It is stateless and read-only regarding the text transformation. The  coordinates the detection process. It manages a registry of "Recognizers" and aggregates their results. These are the logic units. Presidio supports multiple types to maximize coverage and accuracy:

 Use Regular Expressions (Regex) for structured data like credit card numbers, email addresses, and IP addresses. These are computationally efficient and deterministic. Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) models (via spaCy, Stanza, or HuggingFace Transformers) to detect context-dependent entities like Person Names (PER), Locations (LOC), and Organizations (ORG). This allows the system to distinguish "George Washington" (Person) from "Washington" (Location). Implement complex validation logic, such as Luhn algorithm checks for credit cards or checksums for national IDs, reducing false positives from random number sequences. These components boost the confidence score of a detected entity if specific "context words" are found in proximity (e.g., boosting a 9-digit number's score if the word "SSN" or "Social" appears nearby).
The Anonymizer is the transformation muscle. It accepts the original text and the metadata payload from the Analyzer (the list of  objects) to apply specific operations. The Anonymizer executes "Operators" on the detected spans. Standard operators include  (substitution),  (deletion),  (e.g., ), and  (SHA-256/512). Crucially, the Anonymizer supports encryption operators, allowing for reversible pseudonymization if the engineering team manages the encryption keys securely. This enables specific authorized workflows to decrypt data while keeping it opaque to general analytics.
  
  
  NER vs. Regex: The Precision-Recall Trade-off
A sophisticated privacy engineer understands when to deploy NER versus Regex, as the choice impacts both accuracy and system latency.Regular Expressions (Regex): Pattern matching based on character sequences. Highly structured identifiers (Email, IPv4/v6, IBAN, SSN, Phone Numbers). Extremely low latency, deterministic, high precision for strict formats. Fails on unstructured, ambiguous entities. A regex cannot reliably distinguish a person's name from a street name or a common noun. Broad regex patterns (e.g., \d{9}) suffer from high false-positive rates without context.Named Entity Recognition (NER): Statistical models (Deep Learning/Transformers) trained on labeled corpora (e.g., OntoNotes) to predict entity tags based on linguistic context and word vectors. Unstructured entities (Person Names, Organizations, Geopolitical Entities). Context-aware. Can identify "Apple" as an Organization in "Apple released a phone" and as a fruit in "I ate an apple." Higher latency (requires model inference), non-deterministic (probabilistic), requires GPU/TPU for high throughput, larger memory footprint. Evaluation on datasets like CoNLL shows high F1 scores but highlights the computational cost. Presidio excels by combining both. It uses NER to find the "Person" and Regex to find the "Email," then aggregates the results using a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., prioritizing the match with the higher confidence score). This hybrid approach allows engineers to leverage the speed of regex for structured data while relying on the sophistication of NER for ambiguous text.
  
  
  Multilingual Support and NLP Engines
Global scraping operations encounter diverse languages, necessitating a multilingual approach. Presidio’s abstraction layer allows swapping the underlying NLP engine via the . The default engine. Fast, production-ready, with models available for dozens of languages (e.g., , , ). It strikes a balance between performance and accuracy. A Stanford NLP library that often provides higher accuracy for low-resource languages but comes with a higher latency cost. Presidio supports integration with . For state-of-the-art accuracy, engineers can integrate HuggingFace Transformers models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) tailored for NER tasks. While computationally intensive, these models offer superior performance on complex, nuanced text.
  
  
  Architecting the Privacy-Aware Scraping Pipeline
To operationalize Presidio, we propose a "Privacy Firewall" architecture. This pipeline ensures that no raw data is persisted without inspection, adhering to the principle of "Defense in Depth".
  
  
  The Pipeline Flow: Scrape -> Detect -> Redact -> Audit -> Store

  
  
  Python Integration Workflow
The following section details the code implementation of this architecture, demonstrating how to integrate Presidio into a Python-based processing worker.
First, we establish the environment with the necessary libraries. We initialize the  with a registry containing both pre-defined and custom recognizers.4.2.2 The Ingestion and Cleaning Phase
Scraped content is often raw HTML. Analyzing HTML tags directly can confuse NER models (e.g., misinterpreting class names as entities). We must extract visible text while preserving structure where necessary for context.
  
  
  The Detection and Redaction Core
This is the heart of the pipeline. We define a transformation policy: Names are replaced with placeholders, Phones are masked, and specific internal IDs are hashed to allow for referential integrity without exposure.This code snippet demonstrates a self-contained, reproducible unit of the Privacy Firewall. In a production environment, the  function would be the entry point for the Kafka consumer worker.
  
  
  Advanced Redaction Strategies: Beyond Simple Masking
While simple masking () satisfies basic compliance, it often destroys data utility. Analytics and ML teams typically need to preserve the referential integrity of the data without exposing the identity. For example, knowing that "User A" behaved similarly to "User B" is valuable, even if we don't know who "User A" is. Privacy Engineering offers several advanced strategies to bridge this gap.
  
  
  Hashing (Deterministic Anonymization)
Hashing converts PII into a fixed-size string (e.g., SHA-256).. Presidio supports this via the  operator. Consistent. The same email address always hashes to the same string, allowing for  operations across different datasets and frequency analysis (e.g., "How many unique users visited?"). Vulnerable to Rainbow Table attacks if the input space is small (e.g., phone numbers or 6-digit IDs). To mitigate this, engineers must apply a cryptographic salt (a random string added to the input before hashing). Presidio allows configuration of hash types (, , ).
  
  
  Reversible Tokenization (Vault-Based)
For scenarios where PII might need to be recovered (e.g., a support ticket scraping pipeline where an agent might need to contact the user later), irreversible hashing is insufficient. We need .In a Vault-based architecture, the PII is swapped for a random token (UUID or a format-preserving token). The mapping (Token <-> PII) is stored in a secure, isolated "Vault" (e.g., Redis or an encrypted SQL table) with strict access controls.Presidio Integration with Vaults: While Presidio handles the detection and logic, the "Vault" interaction usually requires a custom operator or an integration with the  operator using a symmetric key. When Presidio detects an entity, it calls a custom function that checks the Vault (e.g., Redis). If the PII exists, it retrieves the token; if not, it generates a new token, saves the pair to the Vault, and returns the token to replace the text. This concentrates the risk into the Vault. Securing the Vault (via encryption at rest, strict IAM roles, and network isolation) secures the entire dataset.Table 2: Redaction Strategy ComparisonHigh (Decryption possible)High (Referential integrity)Highest (Data separation)
  
  
  Cryptographic Erasure and Deanonymization
A profound benefit of encryption-based pseudonymization or vault-based tokenization is "Cryptographic Erasure." To comply with a GDPR "Right to be Forgotten" (Article 17) request, one does not need to hunt down every instance of a user's data across petabytes of backups and data lakes. Instead, one simply destroys the encryption key or the Vault mapping associated with that user. The data remains in the lake but is mathematically irretrievable—effectively erased.Conversely, authorized systems can use the Presidio Deanonymize Engine to revert the process. By providing the encrypted text and the correct key (or token and Vault access), the  restores the original PII for legitimate business purposes.
  
  
  GDPR/CCPA Alignment via Code
Privacy Engineering translates legal articles into software functions, providing demonstrable compliance.
  
  
  Data Minimization (GDPR Art. 5(1)(c))
The code in Section 4.2.3 explicitly defines . By detecting only specific types and ignoring others, the system enforces minimization. If the scraper encounters a  but that entity is not in the  list (or is in a configured block-list), it is not processed as PII. Alternatively, if strict minimization is required, the policy can be configured to redact any detected entity type unless explicitly allowed (Allow-list approach).
  
  
  Purpose Limitation (GDPR Art. 5(1)(b))
By segregating the PII into a secure Vault (Tokenization) or hashing it, we technologically enforce purpose limitation. Data Scientists act on the tokenized data for modeling (Purpose A - Analytics). Customer Support accesses the Vault to retrieve the email (Purpose B - Support). Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the Vault enforce the separation, ensuring that analysts cannot accidentally view raw contact details.
  
  
  Contextual Logic for False Positives
Presidio allows "Context Words." For example, to reduce false positives for , the recognizer can be configured to require words like "driver", "license", "id", or "dl" to appear within a window of N tokens around the match. This is crucial for reducing "over-redaction," where non-PII data (like product serial numbers) is mistakenly redacted, destroying data utility. This tuning directly supports data accuracy principles.
  
  
  Operational Excellence: Tuning and Monitoring
Deploying Presidio in production is an iterative process. Models drift, and scraping targets change structure. Operational excellence requires continuous monitoring and tuning.
  
  
  Handling False Positives and Negatives
 Do not deploy straight to production with active redaction. Run the pipeline in "Shadow Mode" where detection results are logged but not applied (or applied to a shadow copy of the data). A human analyst or a secondary automated system samples the logs to verify recall (Did we miss PII?) and precision (Did we redact valid text?). Presidio returns a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0) for each detection.

 (e.g., handling medical data/PHI): Set a  (e.g., 0.3-0.4) to prioritize . It is better to redact a harmless number than to leak a patient ID (False Positive > False Negative). Set a  (e.g., 0.7-0.8) to prioritize Precision. You want to preserve data utility and avoid corrupting the dataset with aggressive redaction. Maintain an allow-list for terms that look like PII but aren't (e.g., company support emails , known dummy numbers, or generic addresses). Presidio supports  functionality to bypass specific values.
  
  
  Performance Tuning and Latency
 NER models (spaCy/Transformers) are CPU/GPU intensive. For high-throughput scraping (thousands of pages/sec), Presidio can become a bottleneck. Benchmarks indicate that out-of-the-box spaCy models have a latency of ~15ms per sample, while Transformer-based models can spike to ~50ms+ per sample.

 Use  to process texts in bulk, amortizing the overhead of model calls. Offload detection to GPU-enabled nodes if using Transformer models. Use Regex-based recognizers primarily and reserve NER only for fields where context is ambiguous. Implementing a Redis cache for repeated text snippets (e.g., common headers/footers in scraped HTML) can drastically reduce inference costs. If the same privacy policy text appears on every scraped page, analyze it once and cache the result.
  
  
  Downstream Benefits: ML and RAG Safety
The investment in upstream Privacy Engineering pays dividends downstream, particularly in the era of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves feeding retrieved documents into an LLM context window to generate answers. If the scraped documents contain PII, the LLM might leak it in the generated answer. By sanitizing the ingestion pipeline, the Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) contains only anonymized embeddings. This ensures that the RAG system is "secure by design"—even if the LLM is prompted to reveal PII, the source data it retrieves is already clean.
  
  
  Removing Bias and Memorization
LLMs trained on datasets containing names and demographics often learn distinct biases associated with those identities (e.g., associating certain names with specific professions). Anonymizing names () and masking demographics helps de-bias the training data. Furthermore, it prevents the model from "memorizing" specific individuals, mitigating Model Inversion Attacks where an attacker queries the model to extract training data.The era of unrestricted data collection is over. For senior engineers, the adoption of tools like Microsoft Presidio represents a necessary evolution in platform architecture. By embedding privacy controls directly into the ingestion pipeline, we move beyond the fragility of "compliance checkboxes" to the robustness of "Privacy Engineering." We do not just protect our users; we protect the future of our data platforms. The code provided herein is your starting block—build your firewall, tune your models, and treat privacy as a first-class citizen in your software stack. The risk of inaction is no longer just legal; it is existential.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Case Study: Saving 20 Hours a Week for a Real Estate Agency with AI Agents</title><link>https://dev.to/frankdotdev/case-study-saving-20-hours-a-week-for-a-real-estate-agency-with-ai-agents-33b9</link><author>Frank Oge</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 20:55:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Real Estate is a numbers game. But it’s also an exhaustion game.
​I recently consulted for a mid-sized agency here in Lagos. Their problem wasn't a lack of leads; it was Lead Fatigue.
For every 100 people who messaged them on WhatsApp asking "How much?", only about 3 were serious buyers with the budget to proceed.
​The agents were spending 4 hours a day just answering the same three questions:
​"Is it still available?"
​"What is the price?"
​They were human FAQs.
​I proposed a solution: Let’s fire the humans from the 'First Response' layer and hire an AI Agent.
​Here is how I built a system that not only answers questions but qualifies leads and books inspections automatically.
​We didn't want a "dumb" chatbot that just gives static replies. We needed an Agent that could query their specific database of properties.
​Brain: OpenAI (GPT-4o) via LangChain.
​Communication: Twilio (WhatsApp API).
​Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector).
​Knowledge Base: A live sync of their property listings.
​Phase 1: The "RAG" Knowledge Base
​The biggest challenge was accuracy. The AI couldn't hallucinate a price.
We used RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
​When a user asks, "Do you have any 3-bedroom flats in Ikeja under N5m?"
​The system converts the query into a vector.
​It searches Supabase for matching properties.
​It retrieves the exact data (Price, Location, Features).
​It feeds this to GPT-4o to generate a polite, human-like response.
​Result: The bot never guesses. It only sells what is in stock.
​Phase 2: The "Guardrail" Qualification
​We instructed the AI to act like a senior sales agent. Its goal wasn't just to chat; it was to qualify.
​"You are a helpful Real Estate Assistant. Your goal is to get the user to book an inspection. Before booking, you must politely ask for their budget and timeline. If they cannot afford the property, politely suggest cheaper alternatives."
​This filter alone saved the human agents hours of driving to inspections with clients who had zero intention of buying.
​Phase 3: The Handoff
​If the user is serious and agrees to a time, the AI Agent uses a "Tool" (via LangChain) to check the human agent's Google Calendar and book the slot.
The human agent gets a notification: "New Inspection Booked: Mr. Obi, 3 Bedroom, Budget Verified."
​After 30 days of running this pilot:
​Response Time: Dropped from ~2 hours to <1 minute.
​Agent Workload: Reduced by ~20 hours/week (no more answering "How much?" at 10 PM).
​Conversion: Inspection bookings increased by 15% because the bot replied instantly while leads were hot.
​Conclusion
​We are past the era of "Chatbots." We are in the era of "AI Agents."
A chatbot follows a script. An Agent uses tools, makes decisions, and performs work.
For this agency, it was the difference between being busy and being profitable.

We have an engineering analysis process that required large amount of inputs to be collected from engineers which contained deeply nested structure with multiple input types. As any sane python developer will do these days, we used pydantic models to both structure our mental model and also to validate this massive input (which comes in the form of a yaml file)Even though yaml is a decent format to use for structured input, it's still quite verbose to hand-craft and it can be quite tricky to get all the indents right. So we needed a decent UI which can be used to fill in this input. The thought was, Instead of writing a UI specifically for our data structure, why not infer the structure dynamically from the already existing pydantic model? It can also give us proper (and upfront) validation errors if there are errors in the input. If we can sprinkle a little more customization on top of the existing pydantic model, it can be quite powerful. That's exactly what I ended up doing (with a lot of help from claude opus 4.5). We thought of open-sourcing our solution.Here's pydantic-ui. It a bit opinionated, but also lets you configure quite a lot.

Python. FastAPI. The technologies AI understands. Now we make sure AI doesn't write garbage.Code reviews are a beautiful fantasy we tell ourselves. "Someone will catch my mistakes." No they won't. They're checking Slack. They're thinking about lunch. They're wondering if that meeting could've been an email.Meanwhile, your  sits there in async code, waiting to murder production at 3 AM on a Saturday. Nobody will catch it. Nobody ever does.So I stopped pretending humans review code. I let robots do it. Robots don't get hungry. Robots don't have feelings. Robots are perfect for this job.And here's the kicker: none of this is even testing. Not a single test runs. This is just linting. Glorified spell-check for code. We haven't even  verifying that the code does what it's supposed to do. We're just making sure it's not obviously broken before we bother checking if it works.The bar is on the floor. And most codebases still trip over it.
  
  
  Ruff: Because Life Is Too Short for Slow Linters
Remember pylint? You'd run it, go make coffee, come back, still running. So everyone disabled it. Problem solved. Also: problems not solved at all.Ruff is written in Rust. It runs in milliseconds. You can't even alt-tab fast enough to avoid it.That ASYNC rule at the bottom? That's the one that saves your weekends.Here's how to tank your server in one line:This blocks the entire event loop. Every user. Every request. Everything stops while your code takes a little nap. No error. No warning. Just... silence. And then your phone rings at 3 AM.No kidding. You put  in async code.ASYNC100: blocking call `time.sleep` in async function
The fix takes two seconds:I make this mistake weekly. Sometimes daily. My brain refuses to learn. Fortunately, Ruff doesn't care about my brain. Ruff just yells. That's the relationship.
  
  
  MyPy: Because "It Works" Is Not a Type
Python is dynamically typed. This means you can write this:What is ? Could be a string. Could be a list. Could be your hopes and dreams. Python doesn't care. Python will try to call  on anything. Python believes in you.Python is wrong to believe in you.MyPy strict mode fixes this by being incredibly annoying:Now you have to actually say what things are:Is this more typing? Yes. Is this tedious? Also yes. Will this save you from a 4-hour debugging session because you passed a dict to a function expecting a string? Absolutely yes.The AI also loves types. Give it typed code and it knows exactly what to generate. Give it untyped code and it hallucinates confidently. Your choice.Linters catch a lot. But not everything. Third-party libraries do weird things. Someone's "async" wrapper is actually sync. Life is full of disappointments.So I run tests with the event loop in paranoid mode:Anything takes longer than 100ms? Test fails. Loudly. Rudely. Exactly as it should.Belt and suspenders. Because I've seen things. Things that work perfectly locally and explode in production. Things that pass every test and still somehow break. Plan accordingly.One job per check. When something fails, you know exactly what.Three jobs. Same stage. Run in parallel. When one fails, you see exactly which one in the pipeline view. No scrolling through logs to find the error. —  starts with a dot. GitLab won't run it directly. It's a template. DRY without the copy-paste. — Each job inherits the template. Same image, same cache, same rules. Only the script changes. — All three jobs run at the same time. Faster feedback. If ruff and mypy both fail, you see both failures immediately. Fix them together instead of playing whack-a-mole. — On every job. This isn't a suggestion. Your MR sits there, rejected, until all three pass.The pipeline doesn't care that it's Friday at 5 PM. The pipeline doesn't care that "it works on my machine." The pipeline is the most reliable colleague you'll ever have.Copy, paste, adapt. It works.I could review code carefully. I could remember all the async gotchas. I could check every type hint manually.I could also juggle chainsaws. Both are technically possible. Neither is a good idea.The reality is: humans forget things. That's not a character flaw—that's human nature. The trick isn't to fight it. The trick is to build systems that work  it.I write the rules once. The machines enforce them forever. They never get tired. They never get distracted. They never think "eh, it's probably fine."The linter catches what I forget. The type checker verifies what I assume. The pipeline blocks what I'd regret.TypeScript or Tears — Same idea, different battlefield. JavaScript lies. TypeScript doesn't.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Boring Is a Feature</title><link>https://dev.to/nicolas_vbgh/boring-is-a-feature-2e01</link><author>nicolas.vbgh</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:55:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Why I Let AI Choose My Technologies
The philosophy is clear: programming by coercion. Make the machine enforce quality. But which machine? Which stack?Here's a confession: I didn't pick this stack because it's the best. I picked it because AI knows it by heart.Python. FastAPI. TypeScript. React. PostgreSQL. Nothing exciting. Nothing cutting-edge. Nothing that will impress anyone at a conference.
  
  
  The Training Data Advantage
AI generates code based on training data. More examples = better output. Simple as that.You can use that fancy new Rust framework with 200 GitHub stars. AI will hallucinate half the API. You'll spend your evening fixing AI mistakes instead of watching your show.Or you can use technologies with millions of examples in the training data. AI gets it right the first time. You ship faster.I chose option two. My ego will recover.Every AI coding benchmark uses Python. HumanEval, MBPP, SWE-bench—all Python. Coincidence? No. AI understands Python better than any other language.AI generates this correctly every time. Try the same in Scala, Go or Rust. Good luck.Flask is fine. Django is fine. But FastAPI has something they don't: types everywhere and OpenAPI out of the box.AI reads this signature and knows exactly what to generate. Input types, output types, dependency injection—all explicit. No guessing."Just write raw SQL, it's simpler."Sure. And AI will generate SQL injection vulnerabilities, wrong column names, and type mismatches. I've seen it. Multiple times. In one afternoon.SQLAlchemy gives AI structure:AI can't accidentally concatenate user input. The ORM pattern is type-safe by design.I naturally chose relational databases—they enforce typing by design.PostgreSQL because it's the industry standard: mature, stable, perfect migrations, unbelievable backward compatibility.MySQL/MariaDB could work, but I prefer real open source without Oracle's shadow. And I'm still unable to rename a database without voodoo file manipulation—am I the only one shocked by this?NoSQL with MongoDB or Neo4j looks cool, but I'll stick with boring PostgreSQL for type enforcement. AI has seen millions of examples. I'm guaranteed to run it seamlessly for years.This one's not about AI. It's about sanity.uv 
uv run pytest
10-100x faster than pip. Deterministic builds. I'm not interested in watching never-ending package installations, even with Netflix on. I switched and never looked back.With 10 sync workers, a 200 ms request caps you at ~50 RPS (25 RPS at 400 ms) because each worker naps while Postgres thinks.
With async, the same setup can handle ~500 RPS (250 RPS at 400 ms) by multitasking instead of staring at the wall.Python async used to be a footgun. AI would forget  constantly.Now we have Ruff with async rules. AI still forgets . The linter catches it. Problem solved.This is programming by coercion in action.
  
  
  The Frontend That Just Works
JavaScript has no types. AI doesn't know what functions expect. Refactoring is prayer-based.TypeScript strict mode forces AI to be explicit:AI knows the input. AI knows the output. AI generates correct code.I use  and . Yes, it's annoying sometimes. That's the point.Vue is great. Svelte is great. But AI has seen more React code than everything else combined.Standard patterns. Predictable hooks. AI generates this in its sleep."Works on my machine" is not a deployment strategy.Docker makes environments reproducible. AI knows Dockerfile patterns. Everyone wins.YAML-based pipelines. Well-documented. AI generates correct CI configs.More importantly: this is where the coercion happens. Every check, every gate, every "you cannot merge this". One file to rule them all.
  
  
  Monorepo: One Home for Everything
/
├── backend/       # FastAPI
├── frontend/      # React
├── infra/         # Helm, k8s
└── .gitlab-ci.yml # The gatekeeper
Backend, frontend, infra—same repo. One clone. One branch. One PR."But separate repos are cleaner!" Sure. And now AI needs to:Make coordinated changes across reposHope the CI in repo A passes before repo B deploysWith a monorepo, AI sees everything. Change the API schema? AI updates the backend endpoint, the frontend types, and the OpenAPI spec. One commit. One pipeline. All checks run together.The pipeline enforces consistency. Frontend types don't match backend? CI fails. Database migration missing? CI fails. Contract broken? CI fails. You can't ship half a feature.Separate repos can't do this. You'd need cross-repo CI triggers, version pinning, deployment coordination. Complexity for complexity's sake.AI works in one context. The pipeline validates one state. Ship with confidence.I could have picked Rust—efficient memory management, blazing fast, amazing type system, solid async.But AI struggles with Rust. Fewer examples, different patterns, even syntax errors.So I use Python. And FastAPI. And all the boring stuff.My side projects ship. My evenings are free. The stack is unremarkable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Phishing Defense Platform Day 13</title><link>https://dev.to/cyberb0x/ai-phishing-defense-platform-day-13-4690</link><author>Arslon Erkinov</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:11:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Day 13 completed: API Security & Usage TrackingToday I finished Day 13 of building my AI Phishing Defense Platform.

    fname = input("What is your first name? ")
    lname = input("What is your last name? ")

    return f"Your first and last names are: {fname}, {lname} respectively"

Ask the user for their first and last name.Return a formatted string with both names.You can call this function as many times as you want without rewriting the input logic each time!Moving straight to the point..."Dunder" is short for  (like , etc.).These are special methods in Python that Python calls automatically when certain things happen, like creating a new object, printing an object, or adding two objects together.And Dunder Methods: What do they do?
Dunder methods are like automatic rules for Python. They are built-in functions that are triggered in specific situations, and you don't need to call them yourself. : this initializes any new object for a classSample Code for Dunder Methodsclass Player:
    # Define a new class named Player

    def __init__(self, name):
        # This function is automatically called when creating a new Player object
        # self refers to the current object you're creating
        self.name = name  # Whatever name you give me, I’ll remember it as self.name

    def __str__(self):
        # This function is automatically called when you try to print the Player object
        return f"Player: {self.name}"  # Return the actual player's name when printed


# Creating a Player object
name = input("What is your name? ")  # Ask for the player's name
player1 = Player(name)  # Create an instance of the Player class with the input name

# Print the player object
print(player1)  # This will automatically call __str__ and print "Player: [Name]"


TLDR?
The syntax is simple :A class is a blueprint or template that encapsulates properties and behaviors for objects.
A class contains attributes (data) and methods (functions).2. 
Constructor Method ():The constructor method  is a special dunder method used to initialize an object when it's created.It contains parameters that are passed when you create an instance of the class.
The self keyword refers to the current instance (object) of the class.def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name  # Save the player's name
    self.age = age  # Save the player's score

3.
Operation Method (e.g., , , etc.):
This is where you define custom behavior for common operations.: Defines how the object will be represented as a string (when you print it).: Defines what happens when you use the + operator with objects of that class.def __str__(self):
    return f"Player: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}"

def __add__(self, other):
    return self.score + other.score  # Add scores of two Player objects

self: A reference to the current object. It’s used inside methods to access the object's attributes (e.g., self.name, self.age).Other parameters: These are the values you pass into the class constructor or operation methods to define the object's state or behavior.class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # This is the constructor method to initialize the object
        self.name = name  # Store the name in the object
        self.age = age    # Store the age in the object

    def __str__(self):
        # This is the __str__ method to return a string representation of the object
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."

# Example Usage
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)  # Create a Person object with name 'Alice' and age 25
print(person1)  # It will print: Alice is 25 years old.

Divirta-se! :)Quando começamos a aprender a programar, uma das primeiras descobertas que nos deparamos é que: as linguagens de programação são todas em inglês! Bom, pelo menos as que são utilizadas no mercado de trabalho.Estatisticamente falando, apenas 5% dos brasileiros entendem inglês em algum nível, enquanto apenas 1% possui fluência. Ou seja, nem todos os falantes de língua portuguesa tem conhecimento do idioma inglês.O que faz com que a pessoa aprendiz passa encontrar barreiras que a faça dispor mais esforço para desenvolver várias habilidades ao mesmo tempo (programar e aprender outro idioma concomitantemente). Ela terá dificuldades de lidar com recursos e instruções da linguagem de programação, o que poderá comprometer sua aprendizagem de lógica e algoritmos.Aí tem-se a importância de existir uma linguagem como o Pituguês, em que a pessoa nativa em português consiga programar em sua língua mãe, eliminando a barreira idiomática.Sua sintaxe é inspirada na da linguagem de programação Python que, embora seu nome faça alusão a uma espécie de cobra e seu símbolo seja composto de duas cobras em Ying & Yang, seus criadores eram muito fãs da série de comédia “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” e batizaram a linguagem com o nome de “Python”.Pegando carona até mesmo no nome, se formos traduzir “python”, temos “píton”. Assim, para trazer a ideia de uma linguagem de programação inspirada em Python para a língua portuguesa, uniu-se “píton” + “português” que resultou em: Pituguês!E, como comentamos, o Pituguês vai se inspirar e buscar trazer características do Python para português, como…Quando lidamos com linguagem de programação, devemos lembrar que existem tipos diferentes de dados, como dados textuais, numéricos, binários e etc.Algumas linguagens exigem que o tipo de dado seja declarado como, por exemplo, em Java, declaramos uma variável da seguinte maneira…Note que, em Java, indicamos o tipo do dado (int, para números inteiro, e String para tipos textuais), escrevemos o nome da variável e, por fim, damos um valor a ela. Se formos comparar com Python, já possui uma diferença acentuada…Como podem ver, já não é necessário indicar o tipo da variável, pois a linguagem irá verificar isso automaticamente, é o que chamamos de “inferir tipo”.No Pituguês, não vai ser diferente, a nossa declaração de variáveis também vai inferir o tipo...A indentação nada mais é que o aninhamento de trechos de código que, no caso do Python, se dá através da tabulação (4 espaçamentos), ela tem o objetivo de determinar quais linhas de código pertencem a um bloco lógico, definindo a estrutura e hierarquia.Ou seja, declaramos uma função, por exemplo, em seguida, escrevemos os dois pontos e, logo abaixo deles, com certo espaçamento, começamos a escrever o que a nossa função irá executar. Dessa forma que definimos o escopo e a hierarquia do código, determinando em que momento o trecho de código é iniciado e finalizado.Caso a indentação não seja feita da maneira correta, sem o espaçamento ou com espaçamento excessivo, o próprio Python irá nos sinalizar com uma mensagem de erro.Na documentação do Pituguês você consegue ter acesso a exemplos de como a indentação funciona:Assim como o Python, o Pituguês também é uma linguagem de Código Livre e está aberta a contribuições e, deste a postagem original deste tutorial e introdução a respeito da linguagem, já aconteceram mudanças bastante significativas...Há pouco tempo atrás, Pituguês adicionava a palavra  na declaração de variáveis, o que o distanciava de Python. No entanto, contribuições mais recentes da comunidade fizeram que consigamos declarar variáveis da mesma forma que em Python:linguagem_de_programacao = "Pituguês"Em resumo, Pituguês existe no repositório de uma outra linguagem de programação em português chamada Delégua e acabou herdando algumas características dela, como a interpolação:var linguagemDeProgramacao = "Delégua"escreva("Linguagem de programação: ${linguagemDeProgramacao}")Este tipo de interpolação também se distanciava do Python, mas contribuições recentes trouxeram proximidade entre Pituguês e Python e, agora, a interpolação segue o padrão f-strings:linguagem_de_programacao = "Pituguês"imprima(f"Linguagem de programação: {linguagemDeProgramacao}")Lembrando que estamos atualização a documentação do Pituguês constantemente e, qualquer dúvida que senha sobre a sintaxe, basta consultá-la!
  
  
  Mas como programar em Pituguês?
Para programar em Pituguês, basta que você instale uma extensão no VS Code. Se na aba de extensões você procurar por "pitugues", deve encontrar a extensão da Design Líquido que possui todo um ecossistema de linguagens em português como: linguagem de programação, de marcação, de estilo, de consulta e etc.Nesta postagem você pode encontrar um tutorial semelhante a este, mas que demonstra por imagens como instalar a extensão e como executar seus programar em Pituguês!O Pituguês é uma iniciativa feita pela comunidade, para a comunidade e toda contribuição conta! 🐍💜

Traditional keyword search fails—even though the content is exactly what they need.This is the fundamental limitation of keyword search: it matches words, not meaning.In this tutorial, we'll build a semantic search system using MindsDB that understands user intent. Using 2 million Stack Overflow posts, we'll create knowledge bases with two different vector storage backends— and —and compare their performance.How MindsDB knowledge bases convert text into searchable vectorsSetting up pgvector (PostgreSQL-based) and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) storageCombining semantic search with metadata filtersBuilding an AI agent that uses your knowledge base to answer questionsA MindsDB account (cloud or self-hosted)PostgreSQL database with the Stack Overflow datasetAn OpenAI API key for embeddings
  
  
  How Semantic Search Works
Before we dive in, let's understand the key difference between keyword and semantic search:Misses "asynchronous requests"Semantic search works by:: Converting text into numerical vectors using an embedding model: Saving these vectors in a vector database: Converting the search query to a vector and finding the closest matchesMindsDB handles all of this through its Knowledge Base abstraction.: Python client for interacting with MindsDB servers: For working with query results as DataFrames

Key columns include: - Unique identifier for each post - The content we'll make semantically searchable - The title of the post (questions only) - Programming language and topic tags (e.g., , ) - Community voting score—useful for prioritizing high-quality content - Popularity metric for filtering - Type of post (1=question, 2=answer) - ID of the accepted answer (for questions), ,  - TimestampsThis rich metadata allows us to combine semantic understanding with traditional filters—for example, finding Python questions about async programming with a score above 10.
  
  
  4. Setting Up Vector Storage Backends
MindsDB supports multiple vector storage options. We'll set up both pgvector and a recently added FAISS and will compare how quick they are.
  
  
  pgvector (PostgreSQL Extension)
pgvector is a PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search. It's ideal when you want to keep vectors alongside your relational data.
python
# Create pgvector database connection
run_query("""
    CREATE DATABASE pg_vector
    WITH ENGINE = "pgvector",
    PARAMETERS = {
        "user": "YOUR_PG_USER",
        "password": "YOUR_PG_PASSWORD",
        "host": "YOUR_PG_HOST",
        "port": "5432",
        "database": "vector"
    }
""", "Created pg_vector database connection")


Created pg_vector database connection

  
  
  FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search developed by Facebook AI Research. It's optimized for fast similarity search on large datasets.
python
# Create FAISS database connection
run_query("""
    CREATE DATABASE db_faiss
    WITH ENGINE = 'duckdb_faiss',
    PARAMETERS = {
        "persist_directory": "/home/ubuntu/faiss"
    }
""", "Created db_faiss database connection")


Created db_faiss database connection

  
  
  Choosing Between pgvector and FAISS
Integration with existing PostgreSQLNative PostgreSQL storageExcellent (billions of vectors)Requires PostgreSQL extensionGood (~19s for 2M vectors)Excellent (~5s for 2M vectors)For this tutorial, we'll implement both so you can see the performance difference firsthand.
  
  
  5. Creating Knowledge Bases
Now we have a table with relational data and two vector stores to keep the embedding vectors. We are ready to create knowledge bases using both storage backends.Use OpenAI's  model for generating embeddingsStore the post  as searchable contentInclude metadata fields for filtering results
  
  
  Knowledge Base with pgvector Storage

python
def kb_exists(kb_name):
    """Check if a knowledge base already exists."""
    try:
        result = server.query("SELECT name FROM information_schema.knowledge_bases").fetch()
        return kb_name in result['name'].values
    except Exception:
        return False

# Create pgvector knowledge base
if kb_exists("kb_stack_vector"):
    print("kb_stack_vector already exists - skipping creation")
else:
    run_query("""
        CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE kb_stack_vector
        USING
            storage = pg_vector.stack,
            embedding_model = {
                "provider": "openai",
                "model_name": "text-embedding-3-small"
            },
            content_columns = ['Body'],
            metadata_columns = [
                "PostTypeId",
                "AcceptedAnswerId",
                "ParentId",
                "Score",
                "ViewCount",
                "Title",

                "Tags"
            ]
    """, "Created kb_stack_vector knowledge base")


Created kb_stack_vector knowledge base

  
  
  Knowledge Base with FAISS Storage

python
# Create FAISS knowledge base
if kb_exists("kb_stack_faiss"):
    print("kb_stack_faiss already exists - skipping creation")
else:
    run_query("""
        CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE kb_stack_faiss
        USING
            storage = db_faiss.stack,
            embedding_model = {
                "provider": "openai",
                "model_name": "text-embedding-3-small"
            },
            content_columns = ['Body'],
            metadata_columns = [
                "PostTypeId",
                "AcceptedAnswerId",
                "ParentId",

Created kb_stack_faiss knowledge base

  
  
  Understanding the Parameters
Specifies the vector database connection and table nameConfiguration for the embedding model (provider and model name)Columns to embed and make semantically searchableColumns available for filtering (not embedded, but stored)
  
  
  6. Loading Data into Knowledge Bases
Now we'll insert the Stack Overflow data into our knowledge bases. This process:Fetches data from the source table in batchesGenerates embeddings for content columns using the OpenAI APIStores vectors and metadata in the vector database
  
  
  Loading Data into pgvector Knowledge Base

python
def is_kb_empty(kb_name):
    """Check if a knowledge base is empty (fast - only fetches 1 row)."""
    result = server.query(f"SELECT id FROM {kb_name} LIMIT 1").fetch()
    return len(result) == 0

if is_kb_empty("kb_stack_vector"):
    print("kb_stack_vector is empty - starting data insertion...")
    server.query("""
        INSERT INTO kb_stack_vector
        SELECT * FROM pg_sample.stackoverflow_2m 
        USING 
            batch_size = 1000, 
            track_column = id
    """).fetch()
    print("Data insertion started for kb_stack_vector")
else:
    print("kb_stack_vector is not empty - skipping data insertion")


Data insertion started for kb_stack_vector

  
  
  Loading Data into FAISS Knowledge Base

python
if is_kb_empty("kb_stack_faiss"):
    print("kb_stack_faiss is empty - starting data insertion...")
    server.query("""
        INSERT INTO kb_stack_faiss
        SELECT * FROM pg_sample.stackoverflow_2m 
        USING 
            batch_size = 1000, 
            track_column = id
    """).fetch()
    print("Data insertion started for kb_stack_faiss")
else:
    print("kb_stack_faiss is not empty - skipping data insertion")


Data insertion started for kb_stack_faiss
Wait until the data insertion is complete.
  
  
  7. Querying the Knowledge Bases
Once data is loaded, you can perform semantic searches combined with metadata filtering.Search for content related to "8-bit music" (finds semantically similar content):
python
import time

# Semantic search on pgvector KB
start = time.time()
results_vector = server.query("""
    SELECT * FROM kb_stack_vector 
    WHERE content = '8-bit music'
    AND Tags LIKE '%python%'
    LIMIT 10
""").fetch()
elapsed_vector = time.time() - start
print(f"pgvector query time: {elapsed_vector:.2f} seconds")
display(results_vector)

# Semantic search on FAISS KB
start = time.time()
results_faiss = server.query("""
    SELECT * FROM kb_stack_faiss 
    WHERE content = '8-bit music'
    AND Tags LIKE '%python%'
    LIMIT 10
""").fetch()
elapsed_faiss = time.time() - start
print(f"FAISS query time: {elapsed_faiss:.2f} seconds")
display(results_faiss)

This is the power of semantic search.Also note the  with FAISS (5 seconds vs 19 seconds for pgvector). For production systems with high query volumes, this difference is significant.
  
  
  Combined Semantic and Metadata Filtering
Find AJAX-related posts tagged with jQuery that have high view counts:
python
# pgvector: Semantic search with metadata filters
start = time.time()
results = server.query("""
    SELECT * FROM kb_stack_vector 
    WHERE content = 'ajax'
        AND Tags LIKE '%jquery%'
        AND ViewCount > 1000.0
        AND relevance > 0.6
    LIMIT 10
""").fetch()
print(f"pgvector query time: {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds")
display(results)

# FAISS: Semantic search with metadata filters
start = time.time()
results = server.query("""
    SELECT * FROM kb_stack_faiss 
    WHERE content = 'ajax'
        AND Tags LIKE '%jquery%'
        AND ViewCount > 1000.0

  Understanding Query Results
The query returns these columns:Identifier for the text chunkJSON object with all metadata fieldsVector distance (lower = more similar)Relevance score (higher = more relevant, 0-1)Get only highly relevant results:
  
  
  The Power of Combined Filtering
The query we just ran demonstrates MindsDB's hybrid search capability:
sql
SELECT * FROM kb_stack_faiss 
WHERE content = 'ajax'              -- Semantic match
    AND Tags LIKE '%jquery%'        -- Metadata filter
    AND ViewCount > 1000            -- Popularity threshold
    AND relevance > 0.6             -- Quality threshold


Are semantically similar to "ajax" (not just keyword matches)Have significant engagement (>1000 views)Meet a minimum relevance scoreThis combination is impossible with traditional search and would require complex custom code with raw vector databases.
python
def run_query_ignore_exists(sql, success_msg="Query executed successfully"):
    """Execute a query, silently ignoring 'already exists' errors."""

To compare JavaScript and TypeScript for building web services, let's look at insights from Stack Overflow posts (see chunk IDs for reference):It is the default language for web development, both on the client (browser) and, with Node.js, on the server (870980:Body:1of1:0to133).JavaScript is flexible and widely supported, but its lack of static typing can lead to runtime errors and makes large codebases harder to maintain.While not directly mentioned in the top results, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and modern language features. It compiles to JavaScript, so it runs anywhere JavaScript does.TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, improves code readability, and is especially beneficial for large projects or teams.TypeScript is increasingly popular for the same purpose, as it provides all the benefits of JavaScript plus type safety and better tooling (e.g., autocompletion, refactoring).Good, but less type-awareExcellent (autocompletion, refactor)Slightly higher (due to types)Same as JS, plus TS-specific toolsCan be challenging in large codeEasier in large codebasesFor small projects or rapid prototyping, JavaScript is sufficient and easy to start with.For larger projects, teams, or when maintainability and reliability are priorities, TypeScript is generally preferred.If you want more specific code examples or a deeper dive into either technology, let me know!We've built a complete semantic search system that:Processes 2 million Stack Overflow postsSupports both pgvector and FAISS backendsCombines semantic search with metadata filteringPowers an AI agent for natural language queriesFAISS is much faster than pgvector for pure search queriesMetadata filtering lets you narrow results by tags, scores, datesKnowledge bases abstract complexity—no need to manage embeddings manuallyAgents can leverage knowledge bases for RAG-style applicationsTry different embedding modelsExplore different chunking strategies]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 30: Implementing FinOps in Python - Calculating GenAI Costs per Request</title><link>https://dev.to/ericrodriguez10/day-30-implementing-finops-in-python-calculating-genai-costs-per-request-4k96</link><author>Eric Rodríguez</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Serverless is cheap, but "pay-per-use" can become a nightmare if you don't track the usage.

A sudden fog or thunderstorm can lead to missed connections, frustrated users, or skewed data. The key to mitigation? METAR for current airport conditions and TAF for 24–30-hour forecasts.
Integrating these via API enables proactive alerts, rerouting, and better decisions. For small businesses, indie developers, students, and researchers, this means operational continuity without high costs. SkyLink API's endpoints provide raw and decoded data for any ICAO airport, with global coverage, 99.99% uptime, and a free tier (1,000 requests/month) starting at $15.99 for production.
  
  
  Why METAR/TAF Matter More Than General Weather APIs
Unlike consumer APIs like OpenWeather, METAR/TAF are aviation-specific. METAR details wind, visibility (in statute miles), cloud layers (in feet), temperature, pressure, and phenomena like mist (BR) or fog (FG). TAF forecasts evolutions with TEMPO (temporary), BECMG (becoming), and PROB (probability) indicators.
These are tied to ICAO codes, sourced from official observations—not models—ensuring precision for runway impacts. Studies show adverse weather causes ~50% of delays; TAF integration can cut arrival holds by enabling alternates. For travel/hospitality, it minimizes guest waits; for logistics, predicts cargo delays; for research, provides reliable datasets for simulations or papers.
  
  
  Core Use Cases: How Integration Delivers Results

  
  
  Travel App / Hospitality Guest Experience
Users often face fog-induced delays. Poll TAF 12–24 hours ahead and METAR near arrival to trigger notifications: "Low visibility at LHR 18:00–20:00—consider alternate transport." Outcomes: 30–50% fewer complaints, higher ratings.
  
  
  Student/Research Aviation Tools
Manual data pulls from NOAA slow studies. API calls for multiple ICAOs feed dashboards or sim plugins, enabling faster prototyping and accurate theses on weather patterns.
  
  
  Small Logistics / Transportation Dashboard
Unexpected precipitation disrupts ETAs. Combine TAF with flight status to auto-adjust schedules and notify stakeholders, improving on-time performance and reducing costs.
Technical Integration Spotlight: SkyLink METAR/TAF Endpoints
SkyLink's GET /v2/weather/metar/{icao} or /v2/weather/taf/{icao} returns structured JSON: raw text, airport name, timestamp, and decoded fields. Benefits include no parsing issues, fast responses (<500ms), and scalable pricing (overage $0.0004/request).
Quick Python example:import requests


headers = {"X-RapidAPI-Key": "YOUR_KEY"}
response = requests.get(
    "https://skylink-api.p.rapidapi.com/v2/weather/taf/KJFK",
    headers=headers
)
taf_data = response.json()

However, it comes with a catch: the first run is very slow. That warmup delay  can be a drag on development iteration and can lead to slower cold starts in production. If you’ve ever swapped a LoRA or made a small model change, you’ve probably noticed that frustrating pause before things get moving again. But what if you could dramatically reduce, or even eliminate, these warmup delays?In this post, we'll dive into two practical techniques, powered by Pruna, to mitigate warmup times. We'll show you how to:Using Pruna's portable compilation feature, eliminate the initial model warmup when deploying or reloading a model on a new machine (with identical hardware).Achieve zero warmup when switching LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) on an already optimized model.Get ready to reclaim those precious seconds (or even minutes!) and make your  experience smoother than ever.
  
  
  The Challenge: Understanding  Warmup
Before we dive into the solutions, let's briefly touch upon why  has a warmup phase. When you first invoke a model compiled with , several things happen under the hood. PyTorch needs to:Capture the computational graph: It traces the execution of your model to understand its structure.Perform graph optimizations: The captured graph is then optimized for better performance.Detect and fuse operators: The backend (such as Inductor) identifies which operations can be combined for faster execution.: Optimized code (often CUDA kernels for GPUs or efficient CPU code) is generated by the chosen backend (like Inductor).: This generated code is then compiled into executable machine instructions.This entire process, especially the code generation and compilation steps, can take a noticeable amount of time, ranging from seconds to minutes, depending on the model's complexity and the hardware. While this is a one-time cost for a given model shape and hardware (as the compiled artifacts are cached), it can be disruptive:: When a new instance of an application starts (e.g., a serverless function or a new pod in Kubernetes), the first request might experience this long warmup, leading to poor user experience.: If you compile a model on one machine and then try to run it on another (even with identical hardware), the cache might not be directly usable, leading to another full warmup.: Swapping LoRAs or other adapters can alter the model graph triggering recompilation.: Waiting for recompilation after minor code changes or restarting a kernel slows the development cycle.Pruna offers elegant ways to mitigate these issues, as we'll see next.
  
  
  Use Case 1: Eliminating Initial Warmup with Pruna's Portable Compilation
Traditionally, running a compiled model on a new machine triggers a full compilation warmup, even if the hardware is identical. This can slow down processes, especially when deploying models to production or sharing them with others.Pruna makes compilation portable. It saves the required artifacts so they can be easily packaged with your model and reused on another machine (with the same hardware architecture and CUDA drivers) without needing to recompile from scratch. That way, the model will run fast right from the first inference.: Skip the first-run delay when deploying pre-compiled models to production servers, especially serverless instances.: Share ready-to-run models with your team.: Speed up CI/CD by avoiding repeated compilation.
  
  
  How-to Use Pruna’s Portable Compilation
Let's walk through how to use this feature:Load your model as normally: In our example, we use a Stable Diffusion pipeline from Diffusers.Configure Pruna for Portable Compilation: This is where the magic happens. Create a  object and configure   to be portable.: Apply the configuration using .: Run your model for the first time trigger compilation process, including the warmup. After that, just save your Pruna-smashed model, and it’ll be ready to use on any other machine.

  
  
  Use case 2: Zero Warmup for LoRA Switching with Diffusers Hotswap and Pruna () Compatibility
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a game-changer for efficiently fine-tuning large models. It allows for quick adaptation by training only a small set of parameters.A powerful workflow involves dynamically switching between different LoRAs on a base model to change its output on the fly—for instance, altering image styles in a generative model. However, a challenge arises when you combine it with compilation. Every LoRA swap can look like a graph change—triggering a long recompilation and wiping out the speed advantage.While Diffusers handles the mechanics of LoRA hotswapping, using Pruna with and leveraging one of its cachers ensures that these Diffusers-driven LoRA swaps are efficient and don't cause recompilation warmups after the initial model compilation.With Pruna and Diffusers together, you get flexible LoRA adaptation and high-performance execution with no warmup delays.: Serve models that adapt to diverse user inputs by loading different LoRAs or applications requiring rapid switching between LoRA-defined styles or functionalities (e.g., in an image generation UI), without the latency of recompilation.Efficient experimentation: Test multiple LoRAs quickly without waiting for recompiles.
  
  
  How-to Leverage Diffusers Hotswap with Pruna for Zero WarmupLet's walk through how this works:Load the Base Model and Enable Diffusers LoRA Hotswapping.: Configure  and enable a cacher. In this example, we will be using the  cacher, but others also maintain compatibility.: Apply the configuration using .: Run the model for the first time triggering the  warmup for the base model and the current LoRA. Then, you’ll be ready to hotswap to a new LoRA

  
  
  Comparing the Solutions: Portable Compilation vs. Pruna Cacher Compatibility
While we separately presented these use cases, they can be easily combined:Use  to create a base smashed model (perhaps with a default LoRA and apply Pruna optimization that loads quickly on new instances.Once loaded, pruna’s compatibility with hot-swapping would ensure that any subsequent LoRA hot swaps (managed by Diffusers) on that instance are also free of  warmup delays.This combined approach would give you a fast cold start  adapter switching.
  
  
  Conclusions: Reclaim Your Time with Pruna
The  warmup can slow down production workflows for cold starts and adapter switching. Pruna addresses these challenges with two key features: (torch_compile_make_portable=True) removes first-run warmup when deploying to identical hardware, enabling immediate peak performance.Diffusers' LoRA hotswapping with  and a  enables instant LoRA switching without recompilation delays.We hope this guide helps you optimize your  workflows.

Think of it like building a house: you can't install the roof (OOP) until you’ve laid the foundation (Basics).Don’t worry this series is designed for beginners. You don’t need to be a senior dev to get started, but having these few tools in your belt will make the transition to OOP feel like a breeze rather than a climb.
  
  
  Core Python Basics You Should Know
To get the most out of this OOP series, ensure you're comfortable with the following three pillars:
  
  
  1. Variables and Data Types
In OOP, we store data inside "Objects." To do that, you must understand how Python handles data. You should be familiar with: For names and descriptions. For counts, ages, or prices. For "True/False" logic (essential for state management). For storing collections of objects. In OOP, these variables will eventually become Attributes the characteristics that define your objects.Functions are the "actions" of your code. Before moving to OOP, you should know:How to define a function ().How to pass arguments (positional and keyword).How to return values to use elsewhere. In the OOP world, functions living inside a class are called Methods. If you can write a function, you’re already 80% of the way to writing a class method.
  
  
  3. Working with Dictionaries
You should understand how Key-Value pairs work because:Dictionaries represent structured data.Internally, Python actually uses dictionaries to store object attributes.If you can pull a value from a dictionary using a key, you'll find the logic of accessing object properties very familiar.
  
  
  What You Do NOT Need to Know
It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the vast Python ecosystem. You do not need to master these before starting this series:Advanced Decorators or Generators: We’ll keep things simple.Web Frameworks: No Django or FastAPI knowledge is required.Database Management: We won’t be touching SQL or NoSQL in the beginning.Our focus is strictly on  step by step.Before we write our first class, make sure your environment is ready:Python Installed: Ensure you have Python 3.x on your machine.Terminal Access: You should be comfortable running a script via . Code Editor: Use whatever you like (VS Code, PyCharm, or even a simple text editor). No complex setup or heavy IDE configuration is required.

  
  
  How to Master This Series
To truly "level up" your skills, don't just be a spectator. Engage with the content:Follow the Sequence: Concepts build on each other. Don't skip ahead!The "Type-Along" Rule: Never just read the code. Type it out. Muscle memory is a real thing in programming.Break Things: Change a value, delete a colon, or rename a variable. Seeing how the code breaks is the fastest way to learn how to fix it.We believe in Hands-on Learning. To support you:All code examples are available on our GitHub repository.Links to the code are provided in our YouTube series descriptions.Clone it, fork it, or copy it just make sure you practice it.Object Oriented Programming isn't just a syntax change; it’s a mindset shift. It will help you write cleaner, reusable, and more professional code. Stay consistent, keep practicing, and don't be afraid to ask questions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux CLI for extracting archives inside a bubblewrap sandbox (alpha)</title><link>https://dev.to/chechelpo/linux-cli-for-extracting-archives-inside-a-bubblewrap-sandbox-alpha-20gp</link><author>Chechelpo</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Test your Python knowledge in a skills quiz with basic to advanced questions. Are you a Novice, Intermediate, Proficient, or Expert?How Long Does It Take to Learn Python Basics?Python is beginner-friendly, and you can start writing simple programs in just a few days. But reaching the  stage still takes consistent practice because you’re learning both the language itself and how to think like a programmer.The following timeline shows how long it typically takes to learn Python basics based on how much time you can practice each week:Typical timeline for basicsRealistic pace for busy adultsConsistent focus and fast feedbackThese ranges assume about . If you add a sixth day, you’ll likely land toward the faster end of each range.You’ll get better results if you use this table as a planning guide. Don’t think of it as rigid deadlines—your learning pace depends on many factors. For example, if you already know another programming language, then you can usually move faster. If you’re brand-new to coding, then expect to be at the slower end of each range.As a general guideline, many beginners reach the basics in about 2 to 6 months with steady practice. If you’re ready to fast-track your learning with an expert-guided small cohort course that gives you live guidance and accountability, then check out Real Python’s live courses!With a focused schedule of around four hours per day, five days per week, you can often reach this stage in roughly 6 to 10 weeks, assuming you’re writing and debugging code most sessions. By then, you should be able to finish several small projects on your own.When you read online that someone learned Python quickly, they’re probably talking about this basics stage. And indeed, with the right mix of dedication, circumstances, and practice, learning Python basics can happen pretty fast!Before you go ahead and lock in a timeline, take a moment to clarify for yourself  you want to learn Python. Understanding your motivation for learning Python will help along the way.Learning Python means  than just learning the Python programming language. You need to know more than just the specifics of a single programming language to do something useful with your programming skills. At the same time, you don’t need to understand every single aspect of Python to be productive.Learning Python is about learning how to accomplish practical tasks with Python programming. It’s about having a skill set that you can use to build projects for yourself or an employer.As your next step, write down your personal goal for learning Python. Always keep that goal in mind throughout your learning journey. Your goal shapes what you need to learn and how quickly you’ll progress.If you’re starting from zero and can spend about 5 to 10 hours per week, the following plan keeps you moving without becoming overwhelming:Aim to finish at least one small project by the end of the month. The project matters more than completing every tutorial or task on your checklist.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gemini 3 Flash: Agentic Vision in LINE Bot - AI Image Annotation and More</title><link>https://dev.to/gde/gemini-3-flash-agentic-vision-in-line-bot-ai-image-annotation-and-more-53lb</link><author>Evan Lin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:55:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This made me think of an interesting use case:A user sends a photo and says, "Help me mark the coffee," and the AI not only replies with a text description but also draws a bounding box and annotates it on the image, then sends the annotated image back to LINE.This article documents the complete process of implementing this function, including the pitfalls and solutions.Traditional image analysis is : you give the model an image, and the model returns a text description.Agentic Vision turns image understanding into an active investigation process, using a Think → Act → Observe cycle:┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

               LINE TextMsg + ImageSendMessage

Agentic Vision requires the user to provide  (e.g., "Mark everyone," "Count how many cats"), unlike general recognition which only needs to "describe the image." Therefore, after selecting Agentic Vision, the user is first asked to input their desired goal.
  
  
  1. Image Temporary Storage Mechanism
Because LINE's Quick Reply is asynchronous (user clicks a button to trigger PostbackEvent), the image needs to be temporarily stored:# main.py
image_temp_store: Dict[str, bytes] = {} # Temporary image storage (user_id → bytes)
pending_agentic_vision: Dict[str, bool] = {} # Waiting for user to input instructions

 Receive image → store in image_temp_store[user_id] User clicks "Agentic Vision" → set pending_agentic_vision[user_id] = True User inputs text → detect pending state, retrieve image + text and send them for analysis
  
  
  2. Quick Reply Implementation
Use LINE SDK's , consistent with the existing YouTube summary and location search Quick Reply modes:quick_reply_buttons = QuickReply(
    items=[
        QuickReplyButton(
            action=PostbackAction(
                label="Recognize Image",
                data=json.dumps({"action": "image_analyze", "mode": "recognize"}),
                display_text="Recognize Image"
            )
        ),
        QuickReplyButton(
            action=PostbackAction(
                label="Agentic Vision",
                data=json.dumps({"action": "image_analyze", "mode": "agentic_vision"}),
                display_text="Agentic Vision"
            )
        ),
    ]
)


  
  
  3. Agentic Vision Analysis Core
# tools/summarizer.py
def analyze_image_agentic(image_data: bytes, prompt: str) -> dict:
    client = _get_vertex_client()

    contents = [
        types.Part.from_text(text=prompt),
        types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_data, mime_type="image/png")
    ]

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
        contents=contents,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            temperature=0.5,
            max_output_tokens=4096,
            tools=[types.Tool(code_execution=types.ToolCodeExecution)],
            thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinkingBudget=2048),
        )
    )

    result_parts = []
    generated_images = []

    for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
        if hasattr(part, 'thought') and part.thought:
            continue # Skip thinking parts
        if part.text is not None:
            result_parts.append(part.text)
        if part.code_execution_result is not None:
            result_parts.append(f"[Code Output]: {part.code_execution_result.output}")
        # Extract the annotated images generated by the model
        img = part.as_image()
        if img is not None:
            generated_images.append(img.image_bytes)

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "analysis": "\n".join(result_parts),
        "images": generated_images # Annotated image bytes
    }


  
  
  4. Image Return Mechanism
LINE's  requires a public HTTPS URL. Because we are deployed on Cloud Run (which is inherently public HTTPS), we directly add an image serving endpoint to FastAPI:# Temporary storage of annotated images (UUID → bytes, 5 minutes TTL)
annotated_image_store: Dict[str, dict] = {}

@app.get("/images/{image_id}")
def serve_annotated_image(image_id: str):
    """Provide temporary annotated images for LINE to download"""
    entry = annotated_image_store.get(image_id)
    if not entry:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    if time.time() - entry["created_at"] > 300: # 5 minutes expired
        annotated_image_store.pop(image_id, None)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    return Response(content=entry["data"], media_type="image/png")

Automatically detect the App's base URL (from the webhook request headers):@app.post("/")
async def handle_webhook_callback(request: Request):
    global app_base_url
    if not app_base_url:
        forwarded_proto = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-proto', 'https')
        host = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-host') or request.headers.get('host', '')
        if host:
            app_base_url = f"{forwarded_proto}://{host}"

Finally, combine into :def _create_image_send_message(image_bytes: bytes):
    image_id = store_annotated_image(image_bytes)
    image_url = f"{app_base_url}/images/{image_id}"
    return ImageSendMessage(
        original_content_url=image_url,
        preview_image_url=image_url,
    )


  
  
  Pitfall 1:  Does Not Exist
ERROR: Error analyzing image: from_image_bytes

: There is types.Part.from_image_bytes() method in the  SDK, the correct one is .# ❌ Incorrect
types.Part.from_image_bytes(data=image_data, mime_type="image/png")

# ✅ Correct
types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_data, mime_type="image/png")


  
  
  Pitfall 2:  enum Does Not Exist
ERROR: module 'google.genai.types' has no attribute 'ThinkingLevel'

:  in  only supports  (integer), and does not support the  enum. Context7 and the examples in the official documentation are based on a newer version of the SDK.# ❌ Does not exist in v1.49.0
types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_level=types.ThinkingLevel.MEDIUM)

# ✅ v1.49.0 supported method
types.ThinkingConfig(thinkingBudget=2048)

: AI-generated code examples may be based on newer or older SDK versions, always use python -c "help(types.ThinkingConfig)" to confirm the actual available parameters.
  
  
  Pitfall 3: Incomplete Image Recognition Results
:  enables thinking by default, and thinking tokens will consume the quota of . Originally set , and thinking used up a large portion, the actual reply was truncated.# ❌ Before: thinking consumed most of the token quota
config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    max_output_tokens=2048,
)

# ✅ After: Disable thinking + increase token quota
config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    max_output_tokens=8192,
    thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinkingBudget=0), # Disable thinking
)

: For simple image descriptions, thinking is an unnecessary overhead.  can disable thinking, allowing all tokens to be used for the reply.┌───────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  1. SDK Version Differences are the Biggest Pitfall
The most time-consuming part of this development was not the functional design, but the SDK version differences. The API of  changes frequently: →  (method name changed) enum does not exist in v1.49.0 (requires  integer)  The impact of  on  is not documented: Before development, run  to confirm the version, and then use  to confirm the actually available API.
  
  
  2. Limitations of LINE Bot Image Returns
LINE's  requires the image to be a public HTTPS URL, and cannot directly transmit bytes. Solutions:Requires bucket and permission settingsFastAPI endpoint serves itselfSimple, no external services requiredDisappears after restart, memory usageI chose the  solution because:  Cloud Run itself is public HTTPS  Annotated images only need to exist briefly (5 minutes TTL)  No need for additional GCS bucket settings
  
  
  3. Thinking is a Double-Edged Sword
 enables thinking by default, which is helpful for complex reasoning, but is a burden for simple image descriptions:  Consumes  quota: Disable thinking for simple tasks (), and only enable it for complex Agentic Vision.
  
  
  4. Trade-offs in State Management
Agentic Vision requires two-step interaction (select mode → input instructions), which introduces state management:image_temp_store: Dict[str, bytes] = {} # Image temporary storage
pending_agentic_vision: Dict[str, bool] = {} # Waiting for instructions

Using an in-memory dict is the simplest, but there is a risk: Cloud Run may restart between two requests. This is acceptable for a personal Bot, but if you want to make it a product-level service, you should switch to Redis or Firestore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Professional Streamlit Styling with CSS and st_yled</title><link>https://dev.to/jonathanalles/professional-streamlit-styling-with-css-and-styled-45o6</link><author>Jonathan Alles</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:48:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Streamlit is an effective tool for building data apps, dashboards, and prototypes in Python. While basic theme properties like primary colors and fonts can be set, customizing specific components often requires additional techniques.This post covers two approaches for styling Streamlit apps:Targeting components with CSS using the  attributeA Python-centric alternative using the  package
  
  
  Styling with CSS and Component Keys
For components that accept a  attribute, Streamlit assigns a corresponding CSS class (). This can be used to apply custom CSS to individual elements.
  
  
  Example 1: Container with Background and Padding
st.html("""
    <style>
    .st-key-my-container {
        background-color: #F6F6F6;
        padding: 16px;
    }
    </style>
""")

with st.container(key="my-container"):
    st.write("This container has a custom background and border.")
In this case the CSS class  is automatically generated by Streamlit based on the component . The container’s background and padding are adjusted via CSS.
  
  
  Example 2: Button with a Custom Border
st.html("""
    <style>
    .st-key-my-button button {
        border: 3px solid #000000;
    }
    </style>
""")

st.button("Click Me", key="my-button", type="primary")
This snippet inserts a  block that targets , allowing customization of the button’s border. The downside is evident: Each component requires different elements to be targeted with the right CSS selectors.These techniques make it possible to customize the appearance of specific components without modifying global theme settings.An alternative approach is to use the package, which allows style properties to be specified directly as arguments in Python.The st_yled philosophy is simple:Write styles in Python right next to your components, no CSSThe approach is to , call  once, then use prefixed components to apply style properties, whenever necessary — while using standard Streamlit components and functions.Instead of styling via CSS, you just pass style properties as arguments to components prefixed with  or  .
  
  
  Example 1: Container with Style Properties
import st_yled as sty

sty.init()

with sty.container(width='content', padding=16, background_color='#F6F6F6'):
    st.write("Hello from Container!")
Here, style properties such as and are passed directly to the container component in Python, without requiring explicit CSS.
  
  
  Example 2: Button with Custom Styling
sty.button(
    "Click Me",
    type="primary",
    border_color='#000000',
    border_style='solid',
    border_width=3
)
This example shows how a button can be styled with border properties through the API. The results are identical to the custom CSS styling in the examples above.
  
  
  Trying new Styles Using st_yled Studio
st_yled Studio is a companion web application built in Streamlit that allows users to interactively explore possible style customizations for common components.Users can select a component, adjust style parameters, and then export either:Python code to insert into your Streamlit appA CSS file to consistently apply styling to all components (this file is automatically loaded by st_yled)This tool can aid in developing consistent visual designs, branding or testing styles before integrating them into code.Post you ideas for new styling options and components below!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PyCharm</title><link></link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:40:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source></item><item><title>Building a Python Puzzle Studio with Tkinter: SixSeven Studio (Step-by-Step)</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/building-a-python-puzzle-studio-with-tkinter-sixseven-studio-step-by-step-56kf</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:16:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build SixSeven Studio — a desktop puzzle generator written in Python.By the end, you’ll have an app that:Displays a modern Tkinter GUIExports layered SVG filesSaves and loads puzzles as JSONThis guide is beginner-friendly and breaks everything into small steps.Step 1 — Install Dependenciespip install ttkbootstrap svgwrite python-barcode pillowttkbootstrap → modern Tkinter UIpython-barcode → barcode imagesStep 2 — Create Your Project Fileimport tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox, colorchooser
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from pathlib import Path
import random
import svgwrite
from barcode import EAN13, Code128
from barcode.writer import ImageWriter
import json
import os
Each module handles a different feature:barcode → barcode creationStep 3 — Create the Main Application Classclass SixSevenStudioV5:
    def __init__(self):
        self.APP_NAME = "SixSeven Studio"
        self.APP_VERSION = "v5"

        self.root = tk.Tk()
        tb.Style(theme="darkly")

        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} {self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.geometry("1100x750")
Step 4 — App State Variablesself.style = tk.StringVar(value="Default")
self.puzzle = tk.StringVar(value="Futoshiki")
self.count = tk.IntVar(value=1)
self.grid_size = tk.IntVar(value=6)

self.bg_color = tk.StringVar(value="#222222")
self.accent_color = tk.StringVar(value="#4caf50")
self.font_size = tk.IntVar(value=24)

self.barcode_type = tk.StringVar(value="EAN13")
self.grid = []
These variables connect your UI controls to logic.Step 5 — Build the User Interfacedef build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME,
             font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)
This shows the app title.opts = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Options", padding=10)

    else:
        self.grid = [[random.choice([6,7,""]) for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]

    self.display_grid()
Step 8 — Exporting SVG Filesdef export_svg(self):

                insert=(100+c*80,100+r*80)))
dwg.save()

Step 9 — Barcode Generation

In this tutorial, we’ll build SpamShield v3.1, a Python app that classifies SMS messages as SPAM or HAM using machine learning. Even if you’re a beginner, you’ll be able to follow along!Step 1: Setting Up the ProjectFirst, create a new folder for your project and install the required Python libraries. Open your terminal and run:pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib ttkbootstrap
pip install tkinterdnd2  # Optional: Enables drag & drop in the GUI
pandas: Handles CSV/TXT data.scikit-learn: Provides machine learning tools.joblib: Saves and loads trained models.ttkbootstrap: Makes your GUI look modern.tkinterdnd2: Adds drag-and-drop support (optional).Step 2: Download the SMS Spam Dataset AutomaticallyWe’ll use the SMSSpamCollection dataset from the UCI repository. The script downloads it automatically if it’s missing.import urllib.request
import zipfile
import os
import sys

def resource_path(file_name):
    base_path = getattr(sys, "_MEIPASS", os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    return os.path.join(base_path, file_name)

def download_dataset():
    url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/smsspamcollection.zip"
    zip_path = resource_path("smsspamcollection.zip")

    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, zip_path)

    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as z:
        z.extractall(resource_path(""))

    os.remove(zip_path)
    print("[INFO] Dataset downloaded successfully!")
This ensures that even if the dataset is missing, the app will fetch it automatically.Step 3: Train the Machine Learning ModelWe’ll use Naive Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization to classify SMS messages.import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

def train_sms_model():
    ds_path = resource_path("SMSSpamCollection")

    if not os.path.exists(ds_path):
        download_dataset()

    df = pd.read_csv(ds_path, sep="\t", header=None, names=["label", "text"])
    df["label_num"] = df["label"].map({"ham": 0, "spam": 1})

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df["text"], df["label_num"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model = make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print(f"[INFO] Model trained — Test Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)*100:.2f}%")

    joblib.dump(model, resource_path("sms_spam_model.pkl"))
    return model
Tip: The TF-IDF vectorizer converts text into numbers, and Naive Bayes predicts whether a message is spam.We’ll create a helper function to load the model if it already exists, otherwise, it trains a new one.def load_model():
    model_path = resource_path("sms_spam_model.pkl")
    if os.path.exists(model_path):
        return joblib.load(model_path)
    return train_sms_model()
Step 5: Create a Worker to Process SMS FilesFor batch classification, we’ll build a SpamWorker class that reads CSV/TXT files and labels messages.import csv

class SpamWorker:
    def __init__(self, files, model):
        self.files = files
        self.model = model

    def run(self):
        for path in self.files:
            with open(path, newline="", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") as f:
                reader = csv.reader(f)
                texts = [row[0].strip() for row in reader if row]

                labels_num = self.model.predict(texts)
                labels = ["SPAM" if l == 1 else "HAM" for l in labels_num]

                for t, lbl in zip(texts, labels):
                    print(f"{lbl} | {t}")
This prints each SMS with its predicted label. Later, we’ll connect it to a GUI for a better user experience.Step 6: Build a GUI with TkinterWe’ll use ttkbootstrap for styling. This allows drag-and-drop support and batch processing.import ttkbootstrap as tb
from tkinter import filedialog

class SpamShieldApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tb.Window(themename="darkly")
        self.root.title("SpamShield v3.1")
        self.model = load_model()
        self.files = []

        self.build_ui()

    def build_ui(self):
        tb.Label(self.root, text="📩 SpamShield - AI SMS Detector", font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)

        self.path_input = tb.Entry(self.root, width=80)
        self.path_input.pack(pady=5)

        tb.Button(self.root, text="📂 Browse Files", bootstyle="info", command=self.browse_files).pack(pady=5)
        tb.Button(self.root, text="🚀 Start Classification", bootstyle="success", command=self.start).pack(pady=5)

    def browse_files(self):
        self.files = filedialog.askopenfilenames(filetypes=[("CSV Files","*.csv"), ("Text Files","*.txt")])
        self.path_input.delete(0, "end")
        self.path_input.insert(0, f"{len(self.files)} files selected")

    def start(self):
        worker = SpamWorker(self.files, self.model)
        worker.run()

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()
The GUI lets users select files and classify messages with one click.Finally, add the  section to run your app:if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = SpamShieldApp()
    app.run()

Rule-based (static priorities, deadlines, heuristics), or
“AI-powered” in name only, applying ML everywhere whether it makes sense or not.
I wanted to explore a third path.
So I built PriorityPilot — a CLI-first task & project manager that learns from your behavior, but only when the data actually justifies it.
Machine Learning is powerful — but only after:the signal is stronger than a simple baselinethe model proves it’s better than heuristicsPriorityPilot starts fully rule-based, and progressively enables ML only when it earns the right to do so.
No magic. No hype. Just measured decisions.
Manage projects and tasks from the terminalestimated vs actual hours
Learn from:your task completion patternsordering decisions you implicitly make
Then it uses ML to:rank tasks pairwise (what should come before what)
All while staying transparent about confidence and limitations.
Because:
context switching kills focus
developers already live in the terminalPriorityPilot supports:
Basic mode → minimal friction
Advanced mode → ML insights, confidence intervals, drift warnings
Same tool, different levels of depth. (This Is the Important Part)
PriorityPilot is ML-first in design, but ML-last in execution.
Below ~10 samples → no ML
Pure heuristics and neutral predictions
Baseline Always Wins by Default
Ridge regression baseline
ML models must outperform it
If they don’t → they’re ignored
Drift Detection
If your behavior changes, the system notices
Models are downgraded automatically
Estimates include confidence intervals
Warnings appear when predictions are unreliable
This is not “AI guessing”. It’s ML behaving responsibly.
Models Used (Nothing Exotic)
Gradient Boosting → priority prediction
Random Forest → effort estimation
Logistic Regression → pairwise ranking
Ridge → baseline sanity check
Simple models. Interpretable. Good enough.If You’re Curious

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! I want to talk about making computers understand human language. It sounds complex, but with Python, we can start with simple steps and build up to impressive applications. Over the years, I've used these methods to analyze customer feedback, automate support, and even generate content. Let me show you how you can do the same.First, we need to prepare our text. Raw text is messy—full of URLs, odd punctuation, and variations. Think of this like washing vegetables before you cook. We clean it to get consistent results. In Python, libraries like  help with this intelligent cleaning, called preprocessing and tokenization.This code turns a sentence into clean, standard parts. The lemma is the base word—"planning" becomes "plan". This consistency is crucial for the next steps.Once text is clean, we can find the important names and places in it. This is called Named Entity Recognition (NER). It's like a highlighter for text, picking out companies, people, and locations automatically. I use this to quickly scan news articles or legal documents for key players.Running this shows that "Microsoft" and "Google" are organizations (ORG), while "Seattle" and "California" are geographic locations (GPE). This automatic tagging saves hours of manual review.Now, let's gauge feeling or opinion in text, which is sentiment analysis. Early tools just classified text as positive or negative. Now, we can detect nuance, like frustration or mild satisfaction. I've built systems that track brand sentiment from social media using these techniques.This gives a measurable score for emotion. For more advanced needs, pre-trained transformer models from libraries like  can detect sarcasm or mixed feelings, which I often integrate for customer service analysis.When you have thousands of documents, you need to find the common themes without reading each one. This is topic modeling. I think of it as a sorting machine that reads all your documents and groups them by hidden topics. LDA is a classic algorithm for this.This might output Topic 0: stocks, markets, tech, highs, surge and Topic 1: climate, emission, goals, reduction, conference. It instantly reveals the main themes: finance and environment.For tasks like spam detection or categorizing support tickets, we use text classification. We teach a model by showing it many labeled examples. Today, fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models gives remarkable accuracy, even with modest amounts of your own data.For production, you'd use the  library by Hugging Face, which handles the complex steps. I've used this to build classifiers that route customer emails to the correct department with over 95% accuracy.Creating conversational agents or generating text requires sequence-to-sequence models. These are the engines behind many chatbots. They read an input sequence (like a user's question) and generate an output sequence (the response). I'll show a simplified concept.Real models, like GPT or DialoGPT, are trained on massive dialogues and generate far more coherent and varied responses. The key is they understand context; they remember what was said earlier in the conversation.Long documents need summaries. There are two main ways: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization picks the most important existing sentences. It's like highlighting. Abstractive summarization writes new sentences to convey the core meaning, like a human would.For abstractive summarization, I often use the  feature from the  library with a model like . It can take a long article and produce a concise, well-written paragraph.Finally, we have machine translation. Modern neural translation models understand context much better than old word-for-word systems. They can handle idioms and technical terms. Python makes it straightforward to access state-of-the-art models.The real magic is that these models, such as the MarianMT models, have been trained on millions of sentence pairs. They don't just swap words; they rephrase ideas to sound natural in the target language.Each of these eight techniques is a tool. You start with preprocessing to clean your data. Then, you might extract entities to find key information. Sentiment analysis tells you how people feel. Topic modeling helps you organize large collections of text. Classification automates sorting. Sequence models enable conversation and generation. Summarization condenses information. Translation breaks down language barriers.
  
  
  I often combine them. For instance, I might translate foreign social media posts, analyze their sentiment, extract mentioned company names, and summarize the main topics—all in an automated pipeline. Python's ecosystem, with libraries like , , , and , makes this integration possible. The best approach is to start simple, get one technique working, and then gradually add more complexity as your needs grow.

When i started off the week I genuinely thought I already knew everything I needed, but man was I pleasantly surprised at how powerful that testing suite is. Today I'm going to go over a few new things I learned when implementing my tests suite, including:Assertion behind the scenesOne of the first things I noticed when switching from unittest to pytest was how much simpler assertions are. In unittest, you need to use specific methods like , , , etc:# unittest style
self.assertEqual(result, 5)
self.assertTrue(is_valid)
self.assertIn("error", message)
With pytest, you just use Python's built-in  statement:# pytest style
assert result == 5
assert is_valid
assert "error" in message
I was wondering how a 3rd party package could make assertion statements clearer than what's built in to Python, and while digging deeper I found that there's a whole process that goes on when the test fails.
  
  
  Assert Rewriting with AST
Pytest uses the built in assert function because it raises an AssertionException when the case does not pass. This built-in assertion check allows Pytest to work with built-in functionality and expand functionality from there.For example, once an AssertionException is raised pytest uses assertion rewriting to replace the default string. This is done at import time where pytest can grab the value of each variable and sub expressions. This new info is used to provide the logs with more details like:Provides a diff of what was given and what was expectedThe line the test failed atWhat was the failure (mismatch, missing item, etc)By doing this at import time, it's able to place all code in an Abstract Syntax Tree (yes, the same AST we're working with in this project), finds all the  statements, and rewrites them to capture intermediate values before the assertion runs. This is why when an assertion fails, pytest can show you exactly what each part of the expression evaluated to:def test_string_comparison():
    result = "hello world"
    assert result == "hello pytest"
=========================== FAILURES ===========================
_________________ test_string_comparison _______________________

    def test_string_comparison():
        result = "hello world"
>       assert result == "hello pytest"
E       AssertionError: assert 'hello world' == 'hello pytest'
E         
E         - hello pytest
E         + hello world

======================== 1 failed in 0.02s =====================
This works for complex expressions too:def test_list_membership():
    items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    target = "grape"
    assert target in items
E       AssertionError: assert 'grape' in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
Pytest captured both the value of  and  before the assertion ran, so it can show you exactly why it failed.Coming from Node, one thing I appreciated about jest is being able to use , , , and  in combination with  scopes to setup and tear down test data in a straightforward manner. I was relieved to see that pytest gives us these features with the ability of fixtures that allow us to specify the same level of setup, teardown, and scope that's in jest.
  
  
  Why Fixtures over beforeEach
While I was relieved to see familiar patterns, I quickly realized that fixtures are actually more powerful than Jest's approach in a few key ways: - Fixtures can depend on other fixtures. We injected pytest's built-in tmp_path fixture into our own custom fixture - that's composition in action. In Jest, you'd have to nest your beforeEach blocks or manually call setup functions to achieve something similar. - Fixtures let you specify how often they run: function (default, runs for each test), class, module, or session. If I have an expensive setup like connecting to a database, I can scope it to session and it only runs once for the entire suite.Reusability via conftest.py - Any fixture defined in a conftest.py file is automatically available to all tests in that directory and subdirectories. No imports needed. - This one was subtle but important. With Jest's beforeEach, the setup runs before every test in that scope whether you need it or not. With pytest, fixtures only run when a test actually requests them as a parameter. If I have 10 tests in a class but only 3 need the sample_code_file fixture, it only gets created 3 times. This keeps tests fast and avoids unnecessary setup.Part of testing the ASTAnalyzer was making sure that we had a file with data to parse throughout out tests. Initially I created a sample file in a tests/data document and tested against that, but then found that we can create one using a combination of our own fixture and one of pytest's built in fixtures:@pytest.fixture
def sample_code_file(tmp_path):
    """Factory fixture to create temporary Python files with specified content."""

    def _create_file(content, filename="test_file.py"):
        file_path = tmp_path / filename
        file_path.write_text(content)
        return str(file_path)

    return _create_file

def test_enter_opens_file(self, sample_code_file):
    """__enter__ opens the file and returns file object."""
    filepath = sample_code_file("x = 1")
    with Parser(filepath) as f:
        assert f is not None
        assert not f.closed

def test_context_manager_with_exception(self, sample_code_file):
    """File is closed even when exception occurs."""
    filepath = sample_code_file("content")
    file_ref = None
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        with Parser(filepath) as f:
            file_ref = f
            raise ValueError("test error")
    assert file_ref.closed
As we can see, we've created a  that takes in the content that we want to test against and automatically writes it to a file. This allows us to have a piece of reusable code that can be used to test all types of content inside of the fileOne of the harder things I found while setting up my initial tests was making sure that my printing and logging decorators were being tested. Initially I was using  to mimic this behavior like so:@logger(logging.DEBUG)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


def test_ast_log_defaults():
    with patch("ast_analyzer.decorators.logger.logger") as mock_logger:
        add(3, 5)

    mock_logger.debug.assert_called()
    call_args = str(mock_logger.debug.call_args)
    assert "add" in call_args
The test technically works, it checks that mock logger was called in the  function, but it doesn't actually check what the contents of that log are. With pytest we can use  to grab the output and save it to a file that we can then read from:@logger(logging.DEBUG)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_ast_log_defaults(caplog):
    with caplog.at_level(logging.DEBUG):
        add(3, 5)

    assert "DEBUG" in caplog.text
    assert "add" in caplog.text
With this new functionality, we can look for specific strings of text inside of the log. We also have control over the logging level that we display, so we can write tests for DEBUG and INFO to check that the text in both of those logs are appearing properly. This can also be done with capsys for checking print statements:def test_prints_timing_output(capsys):
    """Decorator should print timing information to stdout."""

    factorial(3)
    captured = capsys.readouterr()
    assert "factorial" in captured.out
    assert "->" in captured.out
In both formats we can see the ease of use that pytest gives us for accessing this textLast but not least, there's parametrization. Parametrization is a technique that's used in python to make code more modular and reusable. In our specific case, we use parametrization for testing by iterating through multiple parameters. This is a great way to reduce the amount of code in your test suite without losing any functionality. To demo this, I'll show a before and after of a series of tests made in the repo.When we create our custom , one thing we do on initialization is see how many children the Node has. In order to test that our  declaration for children is working, we set up the following tests:def test_str_shows_children_count_one_child(self):
    """__str__ displays the number of children."""
    tree = ast.parse("x = 1")
    node = ASTNode(tree)
    assert str(node) == f"AST Node | Children: 1"

def test_str_shows_children_count_mult_children(self):
    """__str__ displays the number of children."""
    tree = ast.parse("x = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3")
    node = ASTNode(tree)
    assert str(node) == f"AST Node | Children: 3"

As you can see, the code is simple enough where having it be exactly the same isnt too bad, but its repetitive which is something that we want to avoid. When playing around with this I thought of combining this into a collection and testing that way:def test_str_shows_children_count(self):

    tree = ast.parse("x = 1")

While this is definitely a lot cleaner and lean, one thing I didn't appreciate is that I'm stuffing two test cases into one. In the future if one of these were to fail (in a larger test) it would be a bit annoying trying to figure out which one of these was the culprit
  
  
  Introducing: Parametrization
Parametrization solves the above by creating a matrix of key values to test against and running them against 1 test. Unlike our second option above, using parametrization breaks the singular test out into the number of suites we specified above so that we can see which of the items failed a test@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "code,expected_count",
    [
        ("x = 1", 1),
        ("x = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3", 3),
    ],
)
def test_str_shows_children_count(self, code, expected_count):
    """__str__ displays the number of children."""
    tree = ast.parse(code)
    node = ASTNode(tree)
    assert str(node) == f"AST Node | Children: {expected_count}"

The way this works is pretty straightforward:We use the  and pass in two arguments

A string of variable names separated by commasA tuple of values that you want each variable to represent on iterationFor each tuple in our collection we passed, the test will iterate over and replace the variables with the values we providedEvery time the test is run, it reports it as a separate test, meaning that we can get more insight into which parameter will fail in case of an error.This feature of pytest works great when you want to test one specific thing against a number of start points. For our test, we just wanted to make sure that an ASTNode was created successfully based on the input, so it's a perfect candidate for parametrization. If I wanted to check the outputs or error handling of certain inputs, that is better handled as a separate test so that we can check on a number of items (type of exception if raised, state of ASTNode, log statements, etc).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Making Date-Based Content Reusable</title><link>https://dev.to/cobel1024/making-date-based-content-reusable-5126</link><author>Dora</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:55:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Content with specific dates can't be reused.Example: An exam with these dates:Grading due: Jan 18, 2024Appeal deadline: Jan 20, 2024Confirmation due: Jan 22, 2024Want to reuse this exam in July?

You know how pipelines, ETL, and warehouses work. Now comes the question every beginner asks:"What tools should I actually learn?"The data engineering landscape is overwhelming. New frameworks launch every month. Cloud providers release new services constantly. It's easy to get lost.In this article, I'll cut through the noise. After years of building data systems and training engineers across organizations, I've identified what actually matters — and what you can safely ignore as a beginner.Let's build your toolkit.Every data engineer needs proficiency in four areas: — How you write logic — Where data lives — How you schedule and manage pipelines — Where everything runsMaster these, and you can work anywhere.SQL is the language of data. Period.Every data engineer writes SQL daily. You'll use it to:Transform data in warehousesIf you learn only one thing from this article: Not just SELECT statements. Learn:CTEs (Common Table Expressions)DDL (creating and altering tables)
  
  
  Python: The Swiss Army Knife
Python is the default scripting language for data engineering.
  
  
  Other Languages Worth Knowing
For beginners: focus on . Add others as needed.You'll interact with different storage systems depending on the use case.
  
  
  Relational Databases (OLTP)
Used for transactional workloads: — Open source, widely used — Popular in web applications — Common in enterprise environments
  
  
  Cloud Data Warehouses (OLAP)
Used for analytical workloads:Ease of use, separation of storage/computeServerless, great for GCP usersUnified lakehouse platformAzure ecosystem integrationUsed for raw and unstructured data storage:
  
  
  Which Should You Learn First?
Start with  for relational concepts, then pick one cloud warehouse. I recommend  or  — both have free tiers and are beginner-friendly.Orchestration is how you schedule, monitor, and manage pipelines.Without orchestration, you'd be running scripts manually. That doesn't scale.Airflow uses DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to define workflows. If you learn one orchestration tool, make it Airflow.Modern, Python-native, easier than AirflowFor transformation orchestrationLearn  first. It's everywhere. Once you understand Airflow, picking up alternatives is straightforward.dbt has changed how data teams work.Write transformations in SQLVersion control your modelsDocument your transformationsdbt follows the ELT pattern — transformations happen inside the warehouse.If you're working with a modern data stack, dbt is almost certainly part of it.Almost all data engineering today happens in the cloud. You need to be comfortable with at least one major provider.S3, Redshift, Glue, Lambda, EMR, KinesisBigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Pub/SubSynapse, Data Lake, Data Factory, Event Hubs
  
  
  Which Cloud Should You Learn?
Check job postings in your target market. In my experience: — Most job listings, largest market share — Strong in startups and data-heavy companies — Dominant in enterprise, especially Microsoft shopsPick one and go deep. The concepts transfer across platforms.When data exceeds what a single machine can handle, you need distributed processing.Spark is the dominant big data framework.Processing billions of rowsComplex transformations at scaleMachine learning on large datasetsYou can write Spark jobs in Python (PySpark), Scala, or SQL.Honestly? Not as often as people think.Many teams reach for Spark too early. Modern warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery) handle most workloads without needing Spark.Learn the basics, but don't obsess over it until you're dealing with truly massive datasets.For real-time data processing:Message streaming, event backboneReal-time stream processing
  
  
  Should Beginners Learn Streaming?
Not immediately. Most entry-level roles focus on batch processing. Streaming is an intermediate to advanced skill.Understand the concepts, but prioritize batch pipelines first.
  
  
  DevOps and Infrastructure
Modern data engineers don't just write pipelines. They deploy and maintain them.Version control — absolutely essentialContainerization — run anywhereAutomated testing and deploymentYou don't need to become a DevOps engineer. But you should be able to:Understand CI/CD pipelinesYou'll hear this term often. It refers to a common combination of tools:Ingestion:    Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch
Storage:      Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks
Transform:    dbt
Orchestrate:  Airflow, Prefect, dbt Cloud
Visualize:    Looker, Tableau, Metabase
SQL-first transformationsManaged services over self-hosted
  
  
  What to Learn First: A Priority List
If I were starting over today, here's my order: — Snowflake or BigQuery — Understand orchestration — Modern transformation — AWS, GCP, or Azure — Containerization basics — When you need scaleDon't try to learn everything at once. Build depth, then breadth.

But the line between them keeps blurring.Increasingly, employers expect data analysts to understand machine learning fundamentals. Not to build production AI systems—that's still data science territory—but to know when ML applies, how it works conceptually, and how to collaborate with ML teams.This isn't about becoming a data scientist. It's about being a more effective analyst in a world where machine learning is everywhere.
  
  
  What Machine Learning Actually Is
Strip away the hype and machine learning is pattern recognition at scale.Traditional programming: you write rules. If purchase > $1000 and first_order = True, flag for review.Machine learning: you provide examples. Here are 10,000 transactions, some fraudulent, some legitimate. The algorithm finds patterns that distinguish them.The key insight: ML discovers rules from data instead of you specifying them. This works when patterns exist but are too complex for humans to articulate.Machine learning isn't always the answer. Often simpler approaches work better.Patterns too complex for explicit rules (image recognition, natural language)Problems where you have lots of labeled examplesSituations where small accuracy improvements justify significant investmentTasks with stable patterns that won't shift rapidlyInsufficient data (less than hundreds or thousands of examples)Problems solvable with simple rules or SQLSituations requiring full explainability for complianceRapidly changing patterns that need frequent retrainingA common mistake: reaching for ML when a GROUP BY and a threshold would suffice.
  
  
  The Three Types of Learning
Machine learning approaches fall into three categories. You have labeled examples—inputs paired with known outputs. Predict house prices from features. Classify emails as spam or not. The algorithm learns the relationship between inputs and outputs. No labels, just data. Find natural groupings in customers. Detect anomalies in transactions. Reduce dimensionality for visualization. The algorithm discovers structure without being told what to look for. An agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties. Less relevant for most analysts—used mainly in robotics, games, and recommendation systems.As an analyst, you'll encounter supervised and unsupervised learning most often.
  
  
  Supervised Learning: Classification vs Regression
Supervised learning solves two types of problems. The output is a category. Will this customer churn? Is this transaction fraudulent? Which product category does this belong to? The output is a continuous number. What price will this house sell for? How many units will we sell next quarter?The distinction matters because different algorithms and evaluation metrics apply to each.
  
  
  Common Algorithms You'll Encounter
You don't need to implement these from scratch. But recognizing them helps.Linear/Logistic Regression. Simple, interpretable baselines. Linear regression predicts continuous values; logistic regression predicts probabilities for classification. Split data based on feature thresholds. Easy to understand and visualize. Prone to overfitting. Many decision trees voting together. More accurate than single trees, less interpretable.Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM). Build trees sequentially, each correcting previous errors. Currently dominates tabular data competitions. Find optimal boundaries between classes. Works well in high dimensions. Layers of connected nodes learning complex patterns. Essential for images, text, and unstructured data.For tabular data—what analysts typically work with—tree-based methods often perform best.Understanding how models learn helps you spot problems. Typically 70-80% for training, the rest for testing. Never evaluate on training data—it's like grading your own homework. The algorithm adjusts internal parameters to minimize prediction errors on training data. Test on held-out data. Adjust hyperparameters. Repeat. Final performance check on data the model has never seen.The fundamental challenge: generalization. A model that memorizes training data fails on new examples. Good models learn patterns that transfer.
  
  
  Overfitting: The Central Challenge
Overfitting happens when a model learns training data too well—including noise and quirks that don't generalize.Excellent training performance, poor test performanceModel complexity exceeds what the data supportsDramatic performance drops on new dataRegularization (penalizing complexity)An overfit model looks good in development and fails in production. This is why proper evaluation matters.Different metrics measure different aspects of model performance.MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average prediction error in original unitsRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes large errors more heavilyR² (R-squared): Proportion of variance explainedAccuracy: Percentage of correct predictions (misleading with imbalanced classes)Precision: Of positive predictions, how many were correct?Recall: Of actual positives, how many were found?F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recallAUC-ROC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curveChoose metrics that align with business objectives. Accuracy on a 99% negative dataset can be 99% just by predicting everything as negative.For classification, the confusion matrix is essential.From this, you can calculate any classification metric.False positives and false negatives have different costs. A spam filter that misses spam is annoying. A fraud detector that blocks legitimate transactions costs revenue. Optimize for what matters.Features—the input variables—often matter more than algorithm choice. Knowing that "days since last purchase" predicts churn better than raw timestamps makes a difference.Log transforms for skewed distributionsBinning continuous variablesOne-hot encoding for categorical variablesInteraction features (combining variables)Time-based features (day of week, month, etc.)Data analysts often excel at feature engineering because they understand the data and business context. This is where your skills directly improve ML.Many real problems have imbalanced classes. Fraud is rare. Churn happens to a minority. Disease is uncommon.Standard algorithms struggle—they learn to predict the majority class.Undersample the majority classOversample the minority class (SMOTE)Adjust class weights during trainingUse appropriate metrics (not accuracy)Imbalance is the norm in business problems. Expect to handle it.A single train-test split might be lucky or unlucky. Cross-validation provides more robust estimates.Split data into K equal partsTrain on K-1 parts, validate on the remaining partRepeat K times, rotating which part is held outThis gives a more reliable estimate of model performance and helps detect overfitting.Black box predictions often aren't enough. Stakeholders ask why the model made a decision. Linear regression, decision trees, and logistic regression have transparent logic.Interpretation techniques for complex models:Feature importance (which variables matter most)SHAP values (how each feature affects each prediction)Partial dependence plots (how one feature affects predictions)LIME (local explanations for individual predictions)When interpretability matters—for compliance, debugging, or stakeholder buy-in—consider it from the start.
  
  
  Working with Data Scientists
As an analyst, you might not build production ML systems. But you'll likely collaborate with those who do.Domain knowledge about the data and businessFeature ideas based on your experienceData cleaning and preparationEvaluation from a business perspectiveAlgorithm selection and tuningEffective collaboration requires shared language. Understanding ML basics lets you participate meaningfully in discussions.

  Frequently Asked Questions
Do I need to code to understand machine learning?
Basic Python helps significantly. You can understand concepts without code, but hands-on practice builds intuition faster.What's the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning?
AI is the broadest term (systems that seem intelligent). ML is a subset (learning from data). Deep learning is a subset of ML (neural networks with many layers).
Conceptual understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics helps but isn't essential for practical use. Libraries handle the math.Should data analysts learn ML?
Increasingly yes. You don't need to become a data scientist, but understanding when and how ML applies makes you more valuable.What's the easiest algorithm to start with?
Linear/logistic regression. Simple, interpretable, and the foundation for understanding more complex methods.How do I know if ML will help my problem?
Ask: Do I have enough labeled examples? Is the pattern learnable? Is the improvement worth the complexity? Often, simpler approaches suffice.What tools should I learn?
Start with scikit-learn for classical ML. Add pandas for data prep, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.How long does it take to learn ML basics?
A few weeks of focused study for conceptual understanding. Months to years for practical proficiency.Is AutoML replacing the need to understand ML?
AutoML automates algorithm selection and tuning but doesn't replace understanding. You still need to frame problems, prepare data, and interpret results.What's the biggest mistake beginners make?
Jumping to complex algorithms before understanding the data. Exploratory analysis and feature engineering usually matter more than algorithm choice.Machine learning isn't magic. It's pattern recognition powered by data and computation.As a data analyst, you don't need to become an ML expert. But understanding the basics—when it applies, how it works, and how to evaluate it—makes you more effective in a world where ML is increasingly ubiquitous.Start with the fundamentals. Build intuition through practice. The advanced topics will make more sense once you have a solid foundation.This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🔥 Trending Now: Today&apos;s Top Updates &amp; Viral Links - 2026-01-28</title><link>https://dev.to/tarun_walia_ad82c14a97e0c/trending-now-todays-top-updates-viral-links-2026-01-28-5804</link><author>tarun walia</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:45:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is the list of latest trending updates fetched on 2026-01-28.

Whether you're setting up a data science environment with Jupyter and Pandas, building production applications, or managing machine learning projects, the decision between Anaconda, Miniconda, and Mamba affects everything from installation speed and disk space usage to dependency resolution performance and environment reproducibility. Understanding their differences, strengths, and ideal use cases will help you make an informed choice that aligns with your specific needs and workflow requirements.The Python ecosystem offers multiple package management solutions, each optimized for different use cases. While traditional tools like venv and newer alternatives like uv have their place, conda-based solutions excel at managing complex scientific computing dependencies that include both Python packages and system libraries. This unique capability makes them indispensable for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing workflows where packages often require compiled binaries, system libraries, and non-Python dependencies.
  
  
  Understanding the Conda Ecosystem
The conda ecosystem consists of three main components: the package manager (conda), different distributions (Anaconda, Miniconda), and alternative implementations (Mamba). Each serves distinct purposes in the Python data science and development workflow. is both a package manager and an environment manager that handles Python packages along with their binary dependencies, system libraries, and even non-Python software. This makes it particularly valuable for scientific computing where packages like NumPy, SciPy, and machine learning frameworks have complex native dependencies. is the full-featured distribution that includes conda plus hundreds of pre-installed packages. It's designed for users who want everything ready out of the box, including popular data science libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and the Anaconda Navigator GUI. provides just the essentials: conda, Python, and a minimal set of dependencies. It's the lightweight alternative that lets you build custom environments from scratch, installing only what you need. represents the evolution of conda's dependency resolution engine. Originally a standalone tool, its core technology (libmamba) has been integrated into modern conda versions, offering significantly faster dependency resolution and environment creation.
  
  
  Anaconda: The Complete Solution
Anaconda is the heavyweight champion of Python distributions, weighing in at approximately  with over 600 pre-installed packages. This comprehensive installation includes everything from core data science libraries to development tools and visualization packages.Anaconda shines in scenarios where convenience and completeness matter more than disk space or installation speed. It's ideal for: entering data science who want immediate access to tools without learning package installation where consistency across student machines is important when you need to experiment with various libraries without setup overhead users who prefer Anaconda Navigator over command-line interfaces requiring commercial support and compliance featuresThe pre-installed packages include essential data science tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, and many others. This means you can start analyzing data or building machine learning models immediately after installation.
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


bash Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

 ~/.bashrc
The installation process is straightforward, and Anaconda Navigator provides a graphical interface for managing environments, packages, and launching applications like Jupyter Notebook or Spyder IDE.
  
  
  Miniconda: The Minimalist Approach
Miniconda takes the opposite philosophy: start minimal and add only what you need. At approximately , it includes just conda, Python, and essential dependencies—about  total.Miniconda is the preferred choice for: where smaller footprint and faster installation matter where image size directly impacts deployment speed who know exactly which packages they need where minimal environments reduce build times on systems with limited storageSecurity-conscious environments where fewer packages mean smaller attack surfaceThe minimalist approach gives you complete control over your environment. You explicitly install each package, which leads to more reproducible environments and better understanding of dependencies. This aligns well with modern Python design patterns for clean architecture where explicit dependencies are preferred.
  
  
  Miniconda Installation and Setup

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

 ~/.bashrc


conda create  myproject 3.11
conda activate myproject


conda pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
This workflow requires more steps but results in leaner, more maintainable environments. Each package is intentionally added, making it easier to track dependencies and reproduce environments across different systems.
  
  
  Mamba: The Performance Revolution
Mamba represents a significant leap forward in dependency resolution performance. Originally developed as a standalone conda alternative, its core technology has been integrated into conda itself, but standalone Mamba tools remain valuable for specific use cases.Mamba's libsolv-based solver delivers 50-80% faster dependency resolution compared to conda's legacy solver. In practical terms, this means:: 3 seconds vs 17 seconds for conda (in benchmark tests)Complex dependency resolution: Handles conflicts that would cause conda to fail: Comparable download times but faster resolution phase: More informative feedback when resolution failsThe performance gains are most noticeable when working with large environments or complex dependency trees common in machine learning and data science projects.As of  (November 2023), libmamba became conda's default solver. This means modern conda installations automatically benefit from Mamba's performance improvements without requiring separate Mamba installation.However, standalone  and  tools still offer value:: Single-binary, no installation required, perfect for containers: Full-featured alternative with additional commands like : Mamba tools often start faster than conda
conda mamba  base  conda-forge


mamba create  myenv 3.11 pandas numpy
mamba activate myenv
mamba scikit-learn


curl  https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba/linux-64/latest |  bin/micromamba
./bin/micromamba create  myenv 3.11
The command syntax is nearly identical to conda, making migration seamless. You can literally replace "conda" with "mamba" in most workflows.
  
  
  For Data Science Beginners
 if you're just starting with data science. The pre-installed packages and GUI tools (Anaconda Navigator) provide a smooth learning curve. You can focus on learning Python and data analysis rather than package management.
  
  
  For Production Development
 for production environments. The smaller footprint, explicit dependencies, and faster installation make it ideal for Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, and server deployments. This approach aligns with best practices for unit testing in Python where reproducible environments are critical. When you're ready to package your Python applications for distribution, tools like PyInstaller can help create standalone executables from your conda-managed environments.
  
  
  For Performance-Critical Workflows
Use modern conda (23.10.0+) which includes libmamba, or  if you need additional features. The faster dependency resolution significantly improves workflow efficiency, especially when frequently creating or modifying environments.
  
  
  For Containerized Applications
 for Docker containers. It's a single binary with no installation step, making it perfect for minimal container images. This is particularly useful when building containers for LLM applications with structured output where fast startup and small image size matter.Regardless of which tool you choose, follow these best practices.
For a comprehensive reference of conda commands, see our Conda Cheatsheet:
conda create  myproject 3.11


conda  environment.yml
conda create  environment.yml


conda config  auto_activate_base 
conda config  channels conda-forge
conda config  channel_priority strict
While you can use pip within conda environments, follow this order:Install conda packages first (they handle binary dependencies better)Use pip only for packages unavailable in condaAvoid mixing conda and pip for the same packageThis prevents dependency conflicts and ensures binary compatibility.Use  channel (more packages, better maintained)Enable  in modern conda (default in 23.10.0+)Consider  for CI/CD pipelinesCache packages locally for offline installations is worth mentioning as a conda-forge based distribution that comes with Mamba pre-installed. It's open-source focused, uses only conda-forge channel by default, and provides the best of both worlds: minimal installation with fast dependency resolution.Miniforge is ideal if you:Prefer open-source packages exclusivelyWant Mamba included from the startNeed a middle ground between Anaconda and MinicondaThe choice between Anaconda, Miniconda, and Mamba depends on your specific needs:: Best for beginners and quick starts with comprehensive pre-installed tools: Ideal for production, containers, and custom environments: Essential for performance-critical workflows with complex dependenciesModern conda (23.10.0+) includes Mamba's performance improvements by default, so you get the best of both worlds. For most users, Miniconda with modern conda provides the optimal balance of flexibility, performance, and control.Remember that these tools complement rather than replace each other. You might use Anaconda for initial exploration, Miniconda for production, and Mamba for environments requiring frequent updates. The key is understanding when each tool provides the most value for your specific workflow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🔥 Trending Now: Today&apos;s Top Updates &amp; Viral Links - 2026-01-28</title><link>https://dev.to/tarun_walia_ad82c14a97e0c/trending-now-todays-top-updates-viral-links-2026-01-28-5f0f</link><author>tarun walia</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:44:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is the list of latest trending updates fetched on 2026-01-28.

Tachyon,
the new “high-frequency statistical sampling profiler” coming in
Python 3.15, to see if we can
speed up the Pillow imaging library. I started with a simple script to open an image:Which generates this flame graph:The whole thing took 40 milliseconds, with half in ’s . If you visit
the interactive HTML page we can see  calls
, which in turn imports , , 
and  (hover over the  boxes to see them).Do we really need to import all those plugins when we’re only interested in PNG?Okay, let’s try another kind of image:Hmm, 60 milliseconds with 80% in  and most of that in . The
HTML page shows it imports , ,
, ,  and . We also
have  importing ,  and .Again, why import  plugins when we only care about WebP?Loading all the plugins? That’s enough profiling, let’s look at the code.When
ing
or
ing
an image, if Pillow isn’t yet initialised, we call a

function. This loads five drivers for five formats by importing their plugins: BMP, GIF,
JPEG, PPM and PNG.During import, each plugin
registers
its file extensions, MIME types and some methods used for opening and saving.Then we check each of these plugins in turn to see if one will accept the image. Most of
Pillow’s plugins detect an image by opening the file and checking if the first few bytes
match a magic prefix. For example:GIF
starts with  or .JPEG
starts with , where  means “Start of Image”, and  is
the start of the next marker
(reference).If none of these five match, we call
,
which imports the remaining 42 plugins. We then check each of these for a match.This has been the case since at least
PIL 1.1.1
released in 2000 (this is the oldest version I have to check). There were 33 builtin
plugins then and 47 now.This is all a bit wasteful if we only need one or two image formats during a program’s
lifetime, especially for things like CLIs. Longer running programs may need a few more,
but unlikely all 47.A benefit of the plugin system is third parties can
create their own plugins,
but we can be more efficient with our builtins.I opened a PR to add a mapping of
file extensions to plugins. Before calling  or , we can instead do a
cheap lookup, which may save us importing, registering, and checking all those plugins.Of course, we may have an image without an extension, or with the “wrong” extension, but
that’s fine; I expect it’s rare and anyway we’ll fall back to the original 
->  flow.After merging the PR, here’s a new flame graph for opening PNG
(HTML page):The flame graphs are scaled to the same width, but there’s far fewer boxes meaning
there’s much less work now. We’re down from 40 and 60 milliseconds to 20 and 20
milliseconds.The PR has a bunch of benchmarks which show opening a PNG (that previously loaded five
plugins) is now 2.6 times faster. Opening a WebP (that previously loaded all 47
plugins), is now 14 times faster. Similarly, Saving PNG is improved by 2.2 times and
WebP by 7.9 times. Success! This will be in Pillow 12.2.0.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EuroPython: Humans of EuroPython: Rodrigo Girão Serrão</title><link>https://blog.europython.eu/humans-of-ep-rodrigo/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:07:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[EuroPython depends entirely on the dedication of volunteers who invest tremendous effort into bringing it to life.

You define them, pass arguments, get results. Then one day you encounter  and , and suddenly function calls look confusing and unpredictable.This article is designed as one complete learning source. We will start from absolute basics and slowly move toward advanced, production‑ready patterns used in real Python libraries.By the end of this post, a beginner will understand not just  and  are, but  they exist and  professionals design APIs using them.We will build everything step by step using one evolving example:  🥪A function is a reusable block of code that:accepts input (arguments)optionally returns output
 →  (defined in function) →  (passed during call)This distinction matters once arguments become flexible.
  
  
  2. Positional Arguments (Order Matters)
Python assigns values :If you swap them, Python won’t complain — but your logic will break.
  
  
  3. Keyword Arguments (Name Matters)

  
  
  Critical Rule (Very Important)
Python always assigns positional arguments first, from left to right, before it processes keyword arguments.This single rule explains most  confusion.
  
  
  4. Why Fixed Arguments Don’t Scale
Imagine a real sandwich order:You  keep adding parameters forever:This becomes unreadable and fragile.Python solves this with .

You can see the repo here: cdk-go-simple-restapi. This year, I want to take it a step further by using AWS CDK to create and manage an AWS EKS cluster.I’ll be writing a short series of posts around this topic, starting with the basics. In this first post we’ll focus on building a minimal EKS cluster using AWS CDK as the foundation for the next parts of the series.Amazon EKS already provides multiple ways to create and manage clusters, from the AWS Console to CloudFormation and Terraform. However, when infrastructure starts to grow in complexity, the way it’s defined and maintained becomes just as important as the resources themselves.CDK allows you to define infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Instead of managing large YAML or JSON templates, you work with code—loops, conditions, and abstractions included. This makes infrastructure easier to reason about, review, and evolve over time. According to the documentation, AWS CDK supports multiple languages such as Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C#For EKS specifically, the kit provides higher-level constructs that abstract away a lot of the boilerplate required to get a cluster running. Networking, IAM roles, and node groups can be defined in a few lines of code while still allowing you to customize the parts that matter.
  
  
  How AWS CDK Works with Amazon EKS
The diagram above shows us how CDK interacts with AWS services when creating an Amazon EKS cluster.Everything starts from your CDK application (stack), where infrastructure is defined using a programming language such as Go, TypeScript, or Python. At this stage, no AWS resources are created yet. When you run , AWS CDK translates your code into a standard AWS CloudFormation template.This CloudFormation template is then deployed using . At this point, AWS CloudFormation becomes responsible for provisioning the infrastructure. It creates all required AWS resources, including the VPC, IAM roles, the EKS control plane, and the managed node group. AWS CDK itself does not bypass CloudFormation, it simply acts as a higher-level abstraction on top of it.Once CloudFormation finishes, the Amazon EKS cluster is fully provisioned and exposes a Kubernetes control plane backed by AWS-managed infrastructure. From this point forward, the cluster behaves like a standard Kubernetes cluster.Optionally, the CDK can also interact with the Kubernetes API to manage workloads, such as applying Kubernetes manifests or deploying Helm charts. This step usually happens after the cluster is ready and is covered in later parts of this series.In this series, all AWS CDK examples will be written in Python.
While AWS CDK supports multiple languages such as TypeScript and Go, the underlying concepts and constructs remain the same regardless of the language used.AWS account and configured AWS CLIAn active AWS account with permissions to create EKS, VPC, IAM, and CloudFormation resources. Installed and configured with valid credentials ().Used for writing the AWS CDK application in this series.Installed globally via npm:Used to interact with the EKS cluster once it is created.This post focuses on creating the EKS cluster. No Kubernetes workloads are deployed yet.Make sure your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions before running cdk deploy, as EKS provisioning may take several minutes.We’ll start by creating a new AWS CDK project using Python. AWS CDK provides a project template that sets up the basic structure, dependencies, and configuration needed to get started.First, create a new directory and initialize a CDK app:cdk-eks
cdk-eks
cdk init app  python
This command generates a basic project structure for a Python-based CDK application. The output after you run Applying project template app python

This is where the stack is instantiated.Contains the definition of the CDK stack where we’ll define the EKS cluster.Python dependencies for the CDK app.CDK configuration file, including the command used to run the app.A placeholder for unit tests, which we’ll use in a later post.Before writing any code, activate the Python virtual environment and install the dependencies. BTW, you need add this one to your :  aws-cdk.lambda-layer-kubectl-v34. .venv/bin/activate
pip  requirements.txt
Keeping dependencies isolated using a virtual environment helps avoid version conflicts and keeps the project reproducible.If this is your first time using AWS CDK in the selected AWS account and region, you’ll need to bootstrap the environment:This command creates the necessary resources in your AWS account that CDK requires to deploy stacks.At this point, the project is ready, and we can start defining the EKS cluster using AWS CDK.In this section, we’ll define a minimal EKS cluster using AWS CDK. The goal is not to build a production-ready cluster yet, but to create a foundation that we can extend in later posts.All changes will be made inside the CDK stack file Import Required ModulesOpen  and start by importing the required CDK modules: for creating the EKS cluster and its node groupsEKS requires a VPC. For simplicity, we’ll let CDK create one for us:This creates a basic VPC across two Availability Zones, which is sufficient for a minimal cluster.Next, we define the EKS cluster itself:Kubernetes version is explicitly set to avoid unexpected upgrades. disables the default node group so we can define our own. Add a Managed Node GroupNow we add a managed node group to run workloads:A managed EC2-based node groupAutoscaling between 1 and 3 nodesInstance type for testingBy default, creating an EKS cluster with AWS CDK does not automatically grant Kubernetes access to the IAM identity used to deploy the stack. While the control plane and node group roles are configured, additional IAM-to-Kubernetes RBAC mapping is required to access the cluster using kubectl.At this point, our CDK stack defines:A managed node group for worker nodesAll of this is defined as code and will be provisioned via CloudFormation.Before deploying, it’s a good idea to check what CDK will generate:cdk synth 2>&1 |

This command outputs the CloudFormation template that will be used to create the EKS cluster.With the stack definition in place, we can now deploy the EKS cluster using AWS CDK. This step will trigger AWS CloudFormation to provision all required resources.Run the following command from the project root:During deployment, CDK will:Package and upload assets (if any)Create or update the CloudFormation stackProvision AWS resources such as the VPC, IAM roles, EKS control plane, and managed node groupYou’ll be prompted to confirm the deployment, as the stack creates IAM roles and other security-related resources. Review the changes and approve the deployment when prompted.After the deployment completes, the next step is to verify that the EKS cluster has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.At this point, you should see a CloudFormation stack created by AWS CDK in the AWS Console.
This stack represents all resources defined in the CDK application, including the VPC, IAM roles, EKS control plane, and the managed node group.The stack status should be , indicating that all resources were provisioned without errors. This also reinforces that AWS CDK relies on CloudFormation as the underlying provisioning engine.Next, navigate to the Amazon EKS console. You should see the newly created cluster listed and marked as Active. Accessing the Cluster with kubectlTo interact with the cluster, update your kubeconfig:aws eks update-kubeconfig  <cluster-name>  <region>
Once configured, verify that the nodes are registered:This command deletes the CloudFormation stack and all resources created by AWS CDK, including the EKS cluster, node groups, and networking components.
Since EKS is not covered by the AWS free tier, it’s recommended to clean up resources when they are no longer needed.At this point, we have a fully functional Amazon EKS cluster created and managed using AWS CDK. The cluster is accessible via kubectl, the node group is running, and IAM access has been configured correctly. This gives us a foundation, but so far, the cluster is still empty.In the next post, we’ll move beyond infrastructure and start running actual workloads on this cluster. Instead of applying raw Kubernetes YAML files manually, we’ll use AWS CDK to deploy workloads in a more structured and repeatable way.Aight, thanks for taking the time read this post.

from tkinter import messagebox, filedialog
import random
import operator
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *

from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
from pathlib import Path
ttkbootstrap → modern dark themerandom + operator → puzzle mathreportlab → PDF generationCreating the Main App ClassWe wrap everything in a class called MazeMath.class MazeMath:
    APP_NAME = "MazeMath"
    APP_VERSION = "2.1"

    OPERATORS = {
        "+": operator.add,
        "-": operator.sub,
        "*": operator.mul,
        "/": operator.floordiv
    }
APP_NAME and APP_VERSION are just labelsOPERATORS maps math symbols to Python functionsInside , we set up the main window and variables:def __init__(self):
    self.root = tk.Tk()
    tb.Style(theme="darkly")

    self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
    self.root.geometry("1100x680")

    self.difficulty_var = tk.StringVar(value="Easy")
    self.num_puzzles_var = tk.IntVar(value=1)

    self.grid_numbers = []
    self.grid_ops = []
    self.solution_path = []
    self.target_number = None

    self.rows = self.cols = 0

    self._build_ui()
Building the User InterfaceNow we create buttons, dropdowns, and panels:def _build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME,
             font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=10)

    opts = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Options", padding=10)
    opts.pack(fill="x", padx=10)

    tb.Combobox(opts,
        values=["Easy","Medium","Hard"],
        textvariable=self.difficulty_var,
        width=10).pack(side="left", padx=5)

    tb.Spinbox(opts, from_=1, to=20,
        textvariable=self.num_puzzles_var,
        width=5).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Then we add control buttons:tb.Button(ctrl, text="Generate",
          command=self.generate_single_puzzle).pack(side="left")

tb.Button(ctrl, text="PDF",
          command=self.generate_multiple_combined_pdf).pack(side="left")

tb.Button(ctrl, text="JPG",
          command=self.generate_multiple_jpgs).pack(side="left")
A grid area for the puzzleA text box for the solution stepsWe use Depth-First Search to ensure every puzzle is solvable.def generate_maze(self, rows, cols):
    visited = [[False]*cols for _ in range(rows)]
    path = []

    def dfs(r, c):
        visited[r][c] = True
        path.append((r,c))

        dirs = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]
        random.shuffle(dirs)

        for dr, dc in dirs:
            nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr][nc]:
                dfs(nr, nc)

    dfs(0,0)
    return path
This gives us a guaranteed path from start to finish.Now we place numbers and operators along that path:def create_puzzle_data(self):
    diff = self.difficulty_var.get()

    if diff == "Easy":
        self.rows = self.cols = 3
    elif diff == "Medium":
        self.rows = self.cols = 4
    else:
        self.rows = self.cols = 5
path = self.generate_maze(self.rows, self.cols)

current = random.randint(1,9)
steps = [f"Start: {current}"]
For every next cell, we safely apply math:for r,c in path[1:]:
    op = random.choice(list(self.OPERATORS.keys()))
    num = random.randint(1,9)

    if op == "/" and current % num != 0:
        continue

    next_val = self.OPERATORS[op](current, num)
    steps.append(f"{current} {op} {num} = {next_val}")
    current = next_val
We draw labels for each cell:for r in range(self.rows):
    for c in range(self.cols):
        text = f"{op}{num}"
        bg = "#4caf50" if (r,c) in self.solution_path else "#222"

        tb.Label(self.grid_frame,
            text=text,
            background=bg).grid(row=r,column=c)
Green cells show the solution path.Showing Step-by-Step Solutions
def show_solution(self):
    self.solution_text.delete("1.0", tk.END)
    self.solution_text.insert(tk.END, "\n".join(steps))
Start: 5
5 + 3 = 8
...c = canvas.Canvas("puzzle.pdf", pagesize=A4)
c.drawString(50, 800, "MazeMath Puzzle")
Each puzzle becomes a printable worksheet.img = Image.new("RGB", (900, 800), (34,34,34))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    MazeMath().run()

The bronze layer simply landed the raw CSV files. The silver layer standardized measurement names. The gold layer aggregated for analysis. Everything worked beautifully.This post demonstrates what happens when vendor CSV files exhibit the full spectrum of real-world data quality issues. We'll watch the bronze layer transform from "just land the data" into an increasingly complex series of transformations, vendor-specific logic, and fragile workarounds. By the end, we'll be asking uncomfortable questions about what "bronze" actually means.
  
  
  Problem 1: Different Column Names for the Same Measurements
Vendor A and Vendor B measure the same soil properties. Both provide pH, copper concentration, and zinc concentration. Their CSV files look like this:sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm
sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,acidity,cu_total,zn_total
Same measurements. Different names. Vendor B calls pH "acidity." They use chemical symbols with  suffixes instead of element names with  suffixes.This is not a data quality problem. This is a legitimate difference in how two professional laboratories name their measurements. (Although pedantically you might wonder about a chemistry lab that thinks pH and acidity are the same thing.) Both schemas are internally consistent and well-documented. The challenge is ours: we need both vendors' data in the same bronze table.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 1 (Add Vendor-Specific Column Mapping)
We create a standardization function for each vendor:The bronze ingestion now includes a vendor detection step:This works. We can now query both vendors' data using consistent column names. The bronze layer contains standardized schemas.But we just added vendor-specific business logic to what was supposed to be a raw data landing zone.
  
  
  Problem 2: Schema Instability Within the Same Vendor
The vendor-specific mapping holds up until Vendor A sends a new file. Our ingestion pipeline fails with a schema mismatch error. Examining the file reveals that Vendor A now includes additional analytes:Vendor A - Basic package (what we had):sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm
Vendor A - Metals package (what we just received):sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm,lead_ppm,iron_ppm,manganese_ppm
The schema changes based on which analysis package the customer ordered. Sometimes they order basic soil testing. Sometimes they add heavy metals analysis. The vendor includes only the columns relevant to what was tested.This is also not a data quality problem. Including only requested measurements is reasonable and reduces file size. But it breaks our bronze table schema.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 2 (Create Superset Schema)
The solution requires accommodating all possible variations. We create a superset schema containing all possible columns from all analysis packages. When ingesting files with fewer columns, we add NULL values for missing measurements:Now our bronze ingestion tracks package types:Our bronze table is sparse (most columns are NULL for most rows)We must maintain a master list of all possible columns for each vendorAdding new analytes requires code changesWe can't distinguish between "wasn't measured" and "measurement failed"The bronze layer is accumulating knowledge about vendor schemas and business rules.
  
  
  Problem 3: Typos in Column Headers
Our superset schema handles varying column sets, but the next issue reveals a different category of problem. A file from Vendor A fails to parse correctly. Examining the raw CSV, we find:sample_barcod,lab_id,date_recieved,date_proccessed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm
Three typos:  (missing 'e'),  (i before e),  (double c). The vendor's export system mangles column names. Occasionally.These files are otherwise valid. The data values are correct. Only the header row has issues. Rejecting these files would delay processing by days while we contact the vendor.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 3 (Add Fuzzy Column Matching)
Rejecting files creates unacceptable delays, so we implement fuzzy matching to handle common typos:Our bronze ingestion grows:This works. But we're now making quality decisions about what constitutes an acceptable typo. We're interpreting intent. The bronze layer is no longer just landing raw data.
  
  
  Problem 4: Excel Nightmares
Vendor B sends a file that completely breaks our parser. Opening it in a text editor reveals the structure:Contact:,lab@testing.com,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
Generated:,2024-10-15,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
Lab Name:,Premium Soil Testing,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
Sampl_Barcode,lab_id,DATE_RECEIVED,Date_Proccessed,acidity,cu_totl,ZN_TOTL,pb_total,fe_total,Mn_Totl,b_total,mo_totl,ec_ms_cm,Organic_Carbon_Pct,"","","","",""
PYB2475-266277,AT6480 68463,2024-05-12,2024-05-19,6.46,6.63,29.5,4.22,103.,3.56,0.759,0.186,1.44,0.30,"","","","",""
Three metadata rows precede the actual header. Additionally, the file has empty column name padding (those trailing empty strings). The file exhibits the telltale signs of an Excel export where someone navigated beyond the data range and accidentally pressed enter before saving.The actual data is fine. The measurements are valid. We just need to skip the metadata rows and ignore the empty columns.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 4 (Add Header Detection and Column Filtering)
We implement header detection to skip metadata:We filter out empty columns:And implement re-reading from the correct header position:The bronze ingestion continues to grow:The bronze layer now includes heuristics for detecting valid data. We're making educated guesses about file structure.
  
  
  Problem 5: Database-Hostile Column Names
Vendor B's files sometimes include special characters in column names:#sample_id,lab_id,organic_matter%,cu-total,zn-total
The  prefix,  suffix, and hyphens require backtick escaping in SQL queries:Every analyst who touches this data must remember the escaping rules. Queries become brittle and harder to read.
  
  
  Bronze Layer: Approach 5 (Add Character Sanitization)
We sanitize column names to be database-friendly:The complete bronze ingestion:Eight transformation steps. Vendor-specific logic branches. Fuzzy matching heuristics. Schema knowledge. Quality decisions.This was supposed to be "just land the raw data."
  
  
  The Uncomfortable Questions
We started with a simple bronze layer that read CSV files and wrote them to a table. We now have a complex ingestion pipeline that: Vendor-specific column mapping encodes knowledge about what measurements mean across different schemas Fuzzy matching determines which typos are acceptable and how to fix them Header detection guesses where real data begins Character sanitization changes the raw column names we receivedIs this still a "bronze layer"? The Medallion Architecture describes bronze as raw data with minimal transformation. We're well beyond minimal.What happens when Vendor C arrives? We add more column mappings to the function, another branch in the if/elif chain, and hope their quirks don't conflict with the assumptions we've baked into our existing logic. And how do we decide what the "default" name for the column should be?How do we test this? We need sample files for every vendor, every analysis package, every combination of issues. The test matrix grows exponentially.We haven't addressed date format differences, unit conversions, vendor-specific codes, or the dozens of other variations we'll encounter as more vendors join the system.The bronze layer has gotten away from us.
  
  
  How Would You Manage This Complexity?
Before we explore solutions in the next post, consider how you would handle this problem in your own systems:Would you continue adding transformation logic to the bronze layer until it handles every edge case?Would you reject files that don't conform to expected formats and force vendors to fix their exports?Would you build a configuration system where new vendor quirks can be added without code changes?Would you accept some data quality issues and handle them downstream in the silver layer?Each approach has tradeoffs. Adding more transformations makes the bronze layer complex and fragile. Rejecting files delays processing and frustrates vendors and users of the data alike. Configuration systems add their own complexity. Pushing problems downstream just moves the pain to a different layer.What if the fundamental problem is that we're treating column names as schema when they should be treated as data?In the next post, we'll explore this alternative. Instead of fighting schema chaos with increasingly complex transformations, we'll embrace it. We'll examine how a single transformation applied to all vendors can replace vendor-specific logic, superset schemas, fuzzy matching, and header detection with something simpler and more robust.The solution involves questioning what "raw" actually means.

Python has also introduced more intuitive methods in recent versions that make these tasks much simpler.In this guide, we’ll dive into every major technique for deleting characters in Python, covering both string and list operations with practical code examples and modern best practices.
  
  
  Basic Techniques for String Deletion
In Python, strings are , meaning you cannot modify the original string directly. Instead, these methods return a  string with the characters removed.
  
  
  1. : Delete All Occurrences
To remove a specific character or substring everywhere it appears, use the  method by replacing it with an empty string .You can also limit the number of deletions by providing a third argument:  will only remove the first two hyphens.
  
  
  2. : Remove Leading and Trailing Characters
To clean up unwanted characters (like spaces or newlines) only at the  or  of a string, use the  family of methods:: Removes from both ends.: Removes from the left (start) only.: Removes from the right (end) only.
By default, these remove whitespace, but you can specify a set of characters like .
  
  
  3.  and  (Python 3.9+)
Added in Python 3.9, these are the best practices for removing a specific word only if it appears at the very beginning or end of a string.Unlike , which treats the input as a set of individual characters to prune,  treats it as a single exact string, making it much safer for filenames and IDs.
  
  
  Advanced Pattern Deletion

  
  
  1. : Delete Multiple Different Characters at Once
If you need to delete a whole set of symbols (e.g., vowels or punctuation), chaining  multiple times is inefficient. Using  with  is much faster.
  
  
  2. : Regex-Based Deletion
For pattern-based deletion—like "remove all numbers" or "remove everything except letters"—the  (regular expression) module is your best friend.
  
  
  Deleting Specific Elements from a List
When dealing with a  of strings, the logic changes from "modifying a string" to "filtering a collection.": Deletes the first occurrence of a specific .: Deletes the element at a specific  and returns it.

  
  
  2. List Comprehension: Bulk Filtering
The most Pythonic way to remove all elements that meet a certain condition is to use a . Instead of "deleting," you "keep" the ones you want.The right way to "delete" in Python depends on the scope. For exact matches in strings,  or  are your best bets. For complex patterns, use . When cleaning up lists,  is almost always the most efficient and readable choice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💡 Discovery: docs(ralph): Auto-publish discovery blog post</title><link>https://dev.to/igorganapolsky/discovery-docsralph-auto-publish-discovery-blog-post-2e0k</link><author>Igor Ganapolsky</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:03:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to add autonomous AI coding to your project?

Product prices across thousands of stores.Real estate listings in every market. Job postings across industries. Public records from government agencies.For data analysts, this represents opportunity. Web scraping—extracting data programmatically from websites—opens doors that APIs and official datasets keep closed.But scraping walks a fine line. What's technically possible isn't always legal. What's legal isn't always ethical. Understanding these boundaries is essential before you write your first line of scraping code.
  
  
  Why Scrape When APIs Exist
A fair question. Why scrape when many platforms offer APIs? APIs provide what companies want to share. Scraping accesses what's publicly visible—often far more comprehensive. APIs frequently charge for access, especially at scale. Scraping public pages typically costs only computing resources. API terms change. Rate limits tighten. Access gets revoked. Scraped data from public pages can't be retroactively restricted in the same way. APIs return structured responses. Scraped data reflects what users actually see, including formatting, promotions, and dynamic content.That said, APIs are easier, more reliable, and less legally ambiguous when they meet your needs.Web scraping legality isn't black and white. It depends on what you're scraping, how, and why.Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). This US law prohibits "unauthorized access" to computer systems. The hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn case (2022) clarified that scraping publicly accessible data generally doesn't violate the CFAA. Most websites prohibit scraping in their terms. Violating terms isn't automatically illegal, but it can create civil liability. Scraped content may be copyrighted. Extracting facts is generally permissible; copying creative expression is not. GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws regulate personal data collection. Scraping personal information creates compliance obligations. This file indicates which parts of a site bots should avoid. It's not legally binding but ignoring it weakens legal defenses.This isn't legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific situations.Legal doesn't mean ethical. Even permitted scraping can be problematic. Aggressive scraping can overload servers, affecting real users. You're using someone else's infrastructure. Scraping a competitor's pricing to systematically undercut them raises ethical questions, even if technically legal. Just because someone posted information publicly doesn't mean they consented to bulk collection.Business model disruption. Some websites rely on advertising revenue from visitors. Scraping without visiting the page circumvents their revenue model.The ethical test: would the website operator consider your actions reasonable? If not, proceed with caution.The robots.txt file lives at a site's root (e.g., example.com/robots.txt) and specifies scraping rules.User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
Crawl-delay: 10

User-agent: BadBot
Disallow: /
This file asks all bots to avoid /private/, wait 10 seconds between requests, and blocks "BadBot" entirely.Respecting robots.txt is industry standard. Ignoring it signals bad faith and weakens legal defenses if disputes arise.
  
  
  Rate Limiting and Politeness
Hammering a server with requests is both rude and counterproductive. Servers detect aggressive bots and block them. Space requests seconds apart. Mimic human browsing patterns. If robots.txt specifies a delay, honor it. Don't parallelize requests to the same server aggressively.Scrape during off-peak hours. Early morning or late night typically has lighter server load.Python dominates web scraping. Here's your toolkit. For fetching page content. Simple, reliable, efficient. For parsing HTML and extracting data. Intuitive and forgiving of malformed HTML. For JavaScript-rendered content. Runs a real browser. Slower but handles dynamic content. Full framework for large-scale scraping. Handles concurrency, pipelines, and output formats. Modern alternative to Selenium. Faster, more reliable for dynamic content.Most scraping effort goes into parsing. HTML is messy, inconsistent, and designed for browsers, not data extraction. Look for consistent structures—classes, IDs, data attributes—that identify the data you need. Often cleaner than navigating the DOM manually. Pages vary. Code defensively. Browser developer tools show the actual HTML structure. Use them constantly.Modern websites load content with JavaScript. A simple HTTP request gets you an empty shell. Often, dynamic content comes from API calls you can access directly—cleaner than scraping.Use Selenium or Playwright. These run real browsers and execute JavaScript. Run browsers without visible UI for automation.
  
  
  Handling Anti-Scraping Measures
Websites actively resist scraping. Common measures and countermeasures: Websites block requests with obvious bot user-agents. After too many requests, your IP gets blocked. Rotating proxies can help—but this enters ethically gray territory. Designed to distinguish humans from bots. CAPTCHA solving services exist but are expensive and ethically questionable. Hidden links that only bots follow. Following them flags you as a scraper.Aggressive anti-circumvention measures may cross ethical and legal lines. Consider whether the site is clearly saying "no."
  
  
  Data Storage and Processing
Scraped data needs somewhere to go. Easy to produce, universally readable. Preserves nested data better than CSV. SQLite for local work, PostgreSQL for larger projects. Stripping whitespace, normalizing formats, and validating data during scraping saves pain later.Production scrapers need error handling and recovery. Networks fail. Set reasonable timeouts and retry. When something breaks at 3 AM, logs are essential. Keep the original pages. Re-parsing is easier than re-scraping. For large jobs, save progress incrementally. Crashes shouldn't mean starting over.Let's scrape a book catalog (using a site designed for practice).Simple, effective, and polite.
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions

Generally yes for publicly accessible data, but it depends on jurisdiction, terms of service, data type, and purpose. When in doubt, consult a lawyer.Can I scrape any website?
Technically yes, but not all scraping is legal or ethical. Check terms of service, robots.txt, and consider whether you're causing harm.How do I avoid getting blocked?
Use delays between requests, rotate user-agents, respect robots.txt, and don't scrape faster than a human could browse.Should I use an API instead of scraping?
If an API meets your needs, yes. APIs are more reliable, explicitly permitted, and easier to work with.What about scraping social media?
Social media platforms have strict terms and aggressive anti-scraping measures. Scraping them carries higher legal risk.Is it okay to scrape personal information?
Be very careful. Data protection laws like GDPR apply. Even public personal data may require consent for collection.What tools should I start with?
Requests and BeautifulSoup for static pages. Add Selenium when you need JavaScript rendering.How do I handle pagination?
Identify the URL pattern for pages and loop through them. Or find and follow "Next" links programmatically.
Possibly, but this amplifies legal concerns. Commercialization changes risk calculations.What if the site changes its structure?
Your scraper breaks. This is normal. Monitor for failures and update selectors when layouts change.Web scraping is a powerful tool for data analysts. It opens access to data that would otherwise be inaccessible or prohibitively expensive.But power comes with responsibility. Scrape legally. Scrape ethically. Respect the websites and people behind them.When done right, scraping extends your analytical capabilities far beyond the limits of official data sources.This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🎬 行為辨識</title><link>https://dev.to/stklen/xing-wei-bian-shi-34dj</link><author>TK Lin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI 能辨識這是 Jelly 還是 Ariel 後，下一步是什麼？：讓 AI 不只認出動物，還能理解牠們在做什麼。：簡單、快速：無法判斷連續動作（如「正在走」vs「停下來」）輸入影片 → 行為辨識 → 自動加標籤

        ).pack()
        opts = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Options", padding=10)
        opts.pack(fill="x", padx=10)

        tb.Label(opts, text="Difficulty:").pack(side="left")
        tb.Combobox(
            opts,
            values=["Easy","Medium","Hard"],
            textvariable=self.difficulty_var,
            width=10
        ).pack(side="left", padx=5)
        tb.Label(opts, text="Number of Puzzles:").pack(side="left", padx=10)
        tb.Spinbox(opts, from_=1, to=20,
                   textvariable=self.num_puzzles_var,
                   width=5).pack(side="left")
✅ Step 6 — Control Buttons        ctrl = tb.Frame(self.root)
        ctrl.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=10)

        tb.Button(ctrl, text="Generate Puzzle",
                  bootstyle="success",
                  command=self.generate_single_puzzle).pack(side="left")
You can add export buttons the same way:        tb.Button(ctrl, text="Combined PDF",
                  bootstyle="warning",
                  command=self.generate_multiple_combined_pdf).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Each button simply calls a method.✅ Step 7 — Grid + Solution Panels        self.grid_frame = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Puzzle Grid", padding=10)
        self.grid_frame.pack(fill="x", padx=10)
        sol = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Solution", padding=10)
        sol.pack(fill="both", expand=True, padx=10)

        self.solution_text = tk.Text(sol, height=10, font=("Consolas", 12))
        self.solution_text.pack(fill="both", expand=True)
✅ Step 8 — Generate Puzzle DataDifficulty controls how many numbers:    def create_puzzle_data(self):
        d = self.difficulty_var.get()

        if d == "Easy":
            n, rows, cols = 4, 2, 2
        elif d == "Medium":
            n, rows, cols = 6, 2, 3
        else:
            n, rows, cols = 9, 3, 3
        numbers = [random.randint(1,15) for _ in range(n)]
        expr, target, steps = self.recursive_solution(numbers)
        return numbers, target, steps, rows, cols
✅ Step 9 — Recursive SolverThis repeatedly tries random combinations:    def recursive_solution(self, numbers):
        for _ in range(5000):
            nums = numbers[:]
            random.shuffle(nums)
            expr, val, steps = self.build_expr(nums)
            if val is not None and val > 0:
                return expr, val, steps

        return str(numbers[0]), numbers[0], []
    def build_expr(self, nums):
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return str(nums[0]), nums[0], []
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            left = nums[:i]
            right = nums[i:]
            for op in self.OPERATORS:
                try:
                    val = self.OPERATORS[op](left_val, right_val)
                    steps = left_steps + right_steps + [
                        f"{left_val} {op} {right_val} = {val}"
                    ]
                    return expr, val, steps
                except:
                    continue
This is the core logic engine.    def display_grid(self):
        for w in self.grid_frame.winfo_children():
            w.destroy()
Create labels for each number:        for r in range(self.rows):

CsvPath Framework, by contrast, is a data-file feeds management infrastructure that covers data validation as just one aspect of the full data preboarding lifecycle. Moreover, CsvPath Framework does not deal with relational databases (other than as an option for storing its own metadata). Validatar et. al., are first and foremost relational database quality management tools, and only secondarily deal with data files. So it's a mismatch, to some degree, but useful and entertaining nonetheless.Here's the problem description at the top of the Validatar example: This Standard Test is designed to demonstrate the concept of how to create a uniqueness template test for all CSV files in multiple folders.
The Standard Test here compares the Row Count per  value in the  to make sure all 's only have 1 row. The test only keeps failures and stops after 100 failure records.Spoiler alert: in FlightPath this is a trivial example (as I  it is  to be)Validatar starts by having you create a test template. Before you can do that, though, you need a project. Here are the instructions for that step: Make sure your Data Source is Mapped correctlyThe first bullet sounds simple. I'm not sure what the second bullet means because I'm not a Validatar expert and that one isn't explained on that page.Moving on, let's create that template. Most of this exercise is forms based. The setup is shown in the image below. Their ask is that you notice:Note that the column specified to group by is account_idNote that it is comparing the ROW_COUNT to a fixed value of 1Note that the Result Configuration is set so that only Failures are kept and to abort after 100 failures are foundGood requirements for us to use on the CsvPath side. At this point we have our test. Now we need to create a template from it so that we can apply it to each CSV file. This is how we get to a single action we can apply to multiple files in a uniform way. I'm going to just add the bullets because the screenshot is in the link above, which is of course a more complete description. We do: Update the Folder input to Update the File input to Update the Column input to {{#replace table.name "_data.csv" "_id"}}Update the Metadata Links to {{schema.name}}.{{table..name}}Change the Generate column list using to Dynamic Template ConfigurationUpdate the Dynamic ScriptThe dynamic script is pretty simple:    [
    {"name":"{{#replace table.name "_data.csv" "_id"}}","sequence":1,"type":"Numeric","role":"Key"},
        {"name":"ROW_COUNT","sequence":2,"type":"Numeric","role":"Value"}
    ]
Now, we're going to use some metadata to filter down to the files we care about. Switch to the Metadata Selection TabChange to the  optionAdd a Filter on the Table Name Field that contains "_data.csv"At this point, check that the filter finds your files and run the example. You should be good to go. My feeling is that all works better for database tables than for CSV files, just as you would expect from Validatar.Once more, this time with feeling! Let's see how CsvPath Framework and FlightPath Data can make the same magic happen. And, hopefully you'll agree that it's much simpler and more powerful for its use case.Create a uniqueness test for all csv files in multiple foldersThe column specified to group by is account_idThe core of these requirements is the validation statement. Using CsvPath Validation Language this is next to trivial:$[*][ 
    @duplicate_accounts.nocontrib == 100 -> stop()
    has_dups(#account_id) -> counter.duplicate_accounts(1) 
]
(The  sign means a variable and the  sign indicates a header name)This csvpath says: for each line in a file check if the counter is . If it is, stop processing that file. Otherwise, increase the counter if the  is a duplicate.The statement will collect only error lines because:The counter is a side-effect with no contribution to matchingThe check if  equals  is marked to not contribute to matching. (Using the  qualifier)The function that does the heavy lifting is . If that returns  (i.e. the value of ) we match the line and capture it.All pretty readable. Now what do we do with it?All of what we need to do is almost as simple in Python using only CsvPath Framework. Almost! But using FlightPath Data it is even simpler.In FlightPath, create a new file called . Paste in our statement. Right-click on  and select . In the load dialog give the named-paths group the name  and click . You should see your csvpath show up in the middle window on the right under the  folder. When you load a csvpath statement it always goes into a  file. And when you click on that file its background is pale green to let you know you cannot edit it. (You can, of course, over-write it anytime without losing prior versions, but that is another topic for a different post.)Next stage your data. In the example, each file is in its own folder and its folder is one of many in the same directory. We'll just add the parent folder and let FlightPath find the files for us. To do that right click the parent directory and select . In the stage data dialog uncheck the  checkbox because we're going to have every physical file be one version of the same named-file. Think of a named-file as a category that has one file assigned to it at a time, in sequence. We say named-files have versions.In the named-file name box type . That's our category. You will see your data in the top-right window as a directory named . I used a template of :6/:filename in order to keep the month folders, but that is completely optional.Finally, right click the  folder, or the  folder below it, and select . In the run dialog, for named-paths select . For named-file type in . That named-file name is a reference that indicates every version of the  named-file. Again remember, the named-file is like a category that registers a file at a time. We registered a bunch of files and now we're applying our CsvPath Validation Language statement to each of them in turn.And here's the Run dialog: When you click  you will see your results in the lower right-hand window. Your run is date stamped within the  results. In your date-stamped run you can see the  where your duplicate lines landed. In this image I dropped each run into its own folder using a template; you can see the  and . That is completely optional, of course.There is, of course, much more you can do with CsvPath Framework. Likewise, Validatar has a ton more functionality than what we showed. But now you've had a taste of both. What I'd hope you come away with is that CsvPath Framework is the better tool for CSV, JSONL, and Excel file validation. The ease of using FlightPath Data for this validation example makes the case well. Obviously, for relational database validation, Validatar is your horse.And of course I also want to point out again that CsvPath Framework is a complete data preboarding solution, not just a validation engine. Preboarding inbound data files is a big deal. If you need that (and who doesn't?) you owe it to yourself to take a look at CsvPath Framework.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Efficiently Transforming CSV Data to Styled Excel Worksheets with Python</title><link>https://dev.to/allen_yang_f905170c5a197b/efficiently-transforming-csv-data-to-styled-excel-worksheets-with-python-38e5</link><author>Allen Yang</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Raw data, often residing in CSV files, is the lifeblood of many organizations. However, presenting this data directly can be challenging. CSVs are excellent for data storage and interchange due to their simplicity, but they lack the visual structure and formatting capabilities required for effective analysis and professional reporting. This is where Excel steps in. With its robust formatting options, charting tools, and user-friendly interface, Excel transforms raw data into understandable and actionable insights.The manual process of converting CSVs to Excel and then meticulously applying styles can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with large datasets or recurring tasks. This article will guide you through automating this process using Python, enabling you to convert your CSV data into professional, styled Excel spreadsheets efficiently. We'll explore how to not only transfer data but also to enhance its readability and impact through various formatting techniques, leveraging a powerful Python library designed for comprehensive Excel manipulation.
  
  
  Preparing Your Python Environment for Excel Automation
To effectively interact with and style Excel files in Python, a dedicated library is essential. While several options exist, some offer more extensive control over Excel's features, particularly when it comes to intricate styling and advanced functionalities. For this tutorial, we will be using a robust library that provides deep integration with Excel's object model, allowing for precise control over formatting and data presentation.To get started, you'll need to install the library. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:This command will download and install Spire.XLS for Python, an API designed to create, read, edit, and convert Excel files. Its comprehensive feature set, including support for a wide range of Excel versions and extensive styling capabilities, makes it an excellent choice for automating complex Excel tasks, from basic data transfer to advanced report generation.
  
  
  Fundamental CSV to Excel Conversion
Before diving into styling, let's establish the basic process of converting a CSV file into an Excel workbook. This fundamental step involves reading the CSV content and then saving it as an  file.Here’s a simple Python script to perform this basic conversion:Below is a preview of the output Excel file:In this code,  creates an empty Excel file.  then reads your CSV data directly into the first sheet. Finally, sheet.AllocatedRange.AutoFitColumns() adjusts the column widths to fit their content, and  saves the result. This script provides a functional Excel file, but it lacks any visual enhancements.
  
  
  Implementing Essential Excel Styling for Clarity
While the basic conversion is functional, raw data in Excel can still be hard to read. Implementing essential styling, such as formatting headers, adjusting column widths, and applying proper number and date formats, dramatically improves clarity and professionalism.
  
  
  Formatting Headers and Auto-fitting Columns
Headers are crucial for understanding data. Making them stand out with bold formatting and ensuring columns are wide enough to display all content are fundamental steps in creating a readable spreadsheet.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with styled headers:In this example, we create a new style (), set its font to bold, assign a light gray background, and center the text. This style is then applied to the first row, which typically contains the headers. sheet.AllocatedRange.AutoFitColumns() is called again to ensure all content, including potential longer header texts, is fully visible.
  
  
  Applying Number and Date Formatting
Raw data often treats numbers and dates as plain text, leading to formatting inconsistencies or incorrect calculations in Excel. Explicitly setting number and date formats ensures data integrity and improves readability.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with formatted numbers and dates:Here, we select specific column ranges ( for Amount,  for Date) and apply custom number formats using . This ensures that monetary values are displayed with currency symbols and two decimal places, and dates are presented in a consistent  format. These small details significantly enhance the professional appearance and utility of your data.
  
  
  Advanced Styling Techniques for Professional Data Presentation
Beyond basic formatting, advanced styling techniques like borders, background colors, and conditional formatting can further elevate your Excel reports, making them more visually appealing and easier to interpret.
  
  
  Adding Borders and Background Colors
Visual separation and grouping of data can be achieved effectively using borders and alternating row colors. This helps guide the reader's eye and distinguishes different data elements.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with advanced styling applied:In this script, data_range.BorderAround() adds a thin black border around the entire dataset, while data_range.BorderInside() adds lighter gray borders between cells. For alternating rows, a loop iterates through the data rows, applying a  background color to even-numbered rows, creating a visually distinct pattern that improves navigability.
  
  
  Implementing Simple Conditional Formatting
Conditional formatting highlights data based on specific rules, drawing immediate attention to critical information.Below is a preview of the output Excel file with conditional formatting applied:In this final enhancement, we target the  column and add a conditional formatting rule. cf.FormatType = ConditionValueType.Number specifies that the rule is based on the cell's value. cf.Operator = ComparisonOperatorType.Greater sets the condition, and  defines the threshold. Cells meeting this condition will have their background color changed to , instantly drawing attention to higher amounts.
  
  
  Streamlining Data Presentation Workflows
This tutorial has guided you through a practical journey of transforming raw CSV data into professionally styled Excel spreadsheets using Python. We started with a fundamental CSV-to-Excel conversion, then progressively enhanced the output with crucial styling elements: bold headers, auto-fitted columns, precise number and date formatting, and advanced visual cues like borders, alternating row colors, and conditional formatting.The power of Python, especially when combined with a comprehensive library like Spire.XLS for Python, lies in its ability to automate these intricate tasks. By scripting these processes, you eliminate manual effort, reduce the risk of human error, and ensure consistent, high-quality data presentation across all your reports. This automation not only saves valuable time but also elevates the professionalism and clarity of your data analysis and reporting workflows.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🌀 Beginner-Friendly Guide &apos;Minimum Cost Path with Teleportations&apos; - LeetCode 3651 (C++, Python, JavaScript)</title><link>https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-minimum-cost-path-with-teleportations-leetcode-3651-c-python-pk8</link><author>Om Shree</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:08:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Navigating a grid is a classic coding challenge, but adding teleportation changes the game entirely. This problem asks us to find the most efficient route when we can either pay to move or jump for free under specific conditions. By mastering this, you will learn how to layer dynamic programming to handle multiple "states" of a problem.A 2D grid of size  where each cell contains a cost.An integer , representing the maximum number of times you can teleport.Two movement rules: standard moves (right or down) which cost the value of the destination cell, and teleportation (to any cell with a value less than or equal to your current cell) which costs zero.Calculate the minimum total cost to travel from the top-left cell  to the bottom-right cell .The core of this problem lies in balancing standard movement and the limited resource of  teleports. Without teleports, this is a standard pathfinding problem. The cost to reach a cell is the cell's value plus the minimum cost of reaching the cell above it or to its left. Teleporting is powerful because it costs . However, you can only teleport to a cell  if . This means if we have used  teleports to reach a cell with value , we can start a new path from any cell with value  with a cost of  for that jump. We solve the problem in "rounds" based on the number of teleports used. For each round from  to , we update our minimum costs. We maintain a suffix minimum array () that stores the cheapest way to reach any cell that has a value of at least . This allows us to quickly check if teleporting to a cell with value  is cheaper than walking to it.
  
  
  Walkthrough: Understanding the Examples
grid = [[1,3,3],[2,5,4],[4,3,5]], k = 2 We begin at . Initial cost is . Move to . Cost becomes . Move to . Cost becomes . The value at  is . We can teleport to  because its value is also  (and ). The teleportation cost is . Total cost remains . Since  is the destination, the answer is . Adding a variable like  (number of teleports) often means we need to repeat our logic  times or add a dimension to our DP table. Using an auxiliary array to track the minimum value across a range (like all values ) is a common trick to optimize search time from  to . We only ever need the results from the "previous teleport count" to calculate the "current teleport count," allowing us to save memory.This problem is a fantastic representation of how real-world logistics systems work. Think of a delivery drone. It can drive along streets (standard moves with cost), but it might also have the battery to fly (teleport) between high-altitude landing pads. Systems like Google Maps or airline routing use similar multi-state optimizations to find the cheapest or fastest paths.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beyond Just a Photo: Building a Pixel-Perfect Calorie Estimator with SAM and GPT-4o</title><link>https://dev.to/beck_moulton/beyond-just-a-photo-building-a-pixel-perfect-calorie-estimator-with-sam-and-gpt-4o-1foj</link><author>Beck_Moulton</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've all been there: staring at a delicious plate of pasta, trying to manually log every gram into a fitness app. It’s tedious, prone to "optimistic" human error, and frankly, ruins the meal. But what if we could turn those pixels directly into nutritional data? In this tutorial, we are building a Multimodal Dietary Analysis Engine. By combining the surgical precision of Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the reasoning power of , we can transform a simple smartphone photo into a detailed nutritional breakdown. We will leverage  and  to isolate food items and use reference-based scaling to estimate volume and calories with surprising accuracy.While building this prototype, I drew heavy inspiration from the production-grade AI patterns found on the WellAlly Blog, which is a goldmine for anyone building robust, AI-driven health tech solutions.To achieve high accuracy, we don't just "show" an image to an LLM. We process it. First, SAM identifies the exact boundaries of the food. Then, we feed the segmented mask and the original context to GPT-4o to perform the cross-referencing.graph TD

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following stack ready:: For running the SAM weights.: Meta's pre-trained vision model.: Our multimodal "brain.": To wrap everything into a production-ready microservice.: For image manipulation.
  
  
  Step-by-Step Implementation

  
  
  1. Isolating the Food with SAM
First, we need to distinguish the food from the plate. Traditional bounding boxes are too messy; we need pixel-level masks to estimate surface area effectively.
  
  
  2. Crafting the Multimodal Prompt for GPT-4o
GPT-4o is excellent at visual reasoning, but it needs context. We provide it with the original image and instructions to use common items (like a credit card or a fork) as a scale reference.Now, let's wrap this into an endpoint that our mobile app can consume.
  
  
  The "Official" Way: Advanced Patterns
While the code above works for a hobby project, production-grade health apps require robust error handling, Pydantic data validation, and real-time feedback loops. For example, how do you handle low-light conditions or overlapping food items?If you're looking for more production-ready examples and advanced architectural patterns regarding AI in health tech, I highly recommend checking out the . They cover deep-dives into LLM observability and multimodal data processing that were instrumental in refining this dietary engine.By combining 's spatial awareness with 's cognitive understanding, we've moved past simple "image labeling." We've built an engine that understands volume, context, and nutrition at a pixel level.  Try adding a "Reference Object Detection" step using YOLOv8 to help GPT-4o with scale.

A user reports that  should have been . Your tests executed that line but never verified the boundary mattered.Code coverage counts executed lines. Mutation testing injects small bugs and checks whether your tests detect them. If tests still pass after changing  to , you found a gap.
  
  
  Why Mutation Testing Has Been Impractical
Traditional tools (mutmut, cosmic-ray) rewrite source files, reload modules, and run the full test suite per mutation. A codebase with 100 mutations and a 10-second test suite takes 17+ minutes. That runtime kills feedback loops.
  
  
  pytest-gremlins Architecture
: All mutations are embedded during a single instrumentation pass. Switching between mutations requires only an environment variable change, eliminating per-mutation file I/O and module reloads.Coverage-Guided Test Selection: The plugin tracks which tests cover each line. When testing a mutation on line 42, it runs only the 3 tests that touch line 42 instead of all 200 tests.: Results are keyed by content hash of source and test files. Unchanged code skips mutation testing entirely on subsequent runs.
  
  
  Benchmark: pytest-gremlins vs mutmut
Measured on Python 3.12 in Docker:pytest-gremlins (sequential)pytest-gremlins (parallel)pytest-gremlins (parallel + cache)Sequential mode is slower because pytest-gremlins runs additional mutation operators.

Since we know there are three items in our dictionary, we could unpack it:And of course, as strange as it may seem, we get the keys in our dictionary when we unpack it:So what would happen if we turned our dictionary into a list by passing it to the list constructor?Well,  will loop over whatever iterable was given to it and make a new list out of it.
And when we loop over a dictionary, what do we get?And of course, if we ask whether something is  a dictionary, we are asking about the keys:Iterating over a dictionary object in Python will give you keys, no matter what Python feature you're using to do that iteration.

How many units will we sell next quarter? What will demand look like during the holiday season? When should we increase inventory?These questions require time series forecasting—analyzing historical patterns to predict future values.The good news: Python makes time series analysis accessible. You don't need a PhD in statistics. You need the right approach and the right tools.
  
  
  What Makes Time Series Special
Time series data isn't like other data. The order matters. Yesterday's value influences today's. Last year's pattern might repeat this year.This temporal dependence violates assumptions that most statistical techniques rely on. You can't just throw time series data at a standard regression and expect good results.Understanding the unique properties of time series is essential before diving into techniques.Every time series can be decomposed into fundamental components. The long-term direction. Is the series generally increasing, decreasing, or stable? Sales might trend upward as a company grows. Regular, predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals. Retail sales spike in December. Ice cream sales peak in summer. Longer-term fluctuations that aren't as regular as seasonality. Economic cycles affect many time series. What's left after removing trend and seasonality. Sometimes called noise, though it may contain meaningful variation.Decomposition helps you understand what's driving your data before you try to forecast it.
  
  
  Setting Up Your Environment
Python's ecosystem for time series is mature and powerful. Here's what you need:Pandas handles time-indexed data naturally. Statsmodels provides classical time series methods. Scikit-learn offers evaluation metrics.For more advanced work, consider Prophet (from Meta), pmdarima (auto-ARIMA), and sktime (unified time series interface).
  
  
  Loading and Preparing Time Series Data
Time series data needs proper datetime indexing. Without it, Python treats your data as arbitrary rows.The frequency specification matters. Many time series methods assume regular intervals. Gaps or irregular timestamps cause problems.Before modeling, understand your data visually.Look for obvious patterns. Is there a trend?Seasonal spikes? Outliers? Structural breaks where behavior changed?This visual inspection guides your modeling choices.
  
  
  Stationarity: Why It Matters
Many forecasting methods require stationarity—the statistical properties of the series don't change over time.A stationary series has constant mean, constant variance, and consistent autocorrelation structure. Most real-world time series aren't stationary.The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test helps check stationarity:If your series isn't stationary, you'll need to transform it—usually through differencing.
  
  
  Making a Series Stationary
Differencing removes trend by computing changes between consecutive values.First differencing removes linear trends. Seasonal differencing removes repeating patterns. Sometimes you need both.After differencing, check stationarity again. Multiple rounds might be needed.
  
  
  Classical Forecasting: ARIMA
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) remains a workhorse for time series forecasting.The three parameters (p, d, q) define the model:: Autoregressive order (how many past values influence the current value): Degree of differencing (how many times to difference for stationarity): Moving average order (how many past errors influence the current value)
Choosing the right parameters requires experimentation. You can use ACF and PACF plots for guidance, or rely on automated selection.
  
  
  Auto-ARIMA: Parameter Selection Made Easy
Manually tuning ARIMA parameters is tedious. The pmdarima library automates this:Auto-ARIMA searches through parameter combinations and selects the best model based on information criteria.When seasonality is present, SARIMA extends ARIMA with additional seasonal parameters.The seasonal order (P, D, Q, m) mirrors the non-seasonal parameters but operates at the seasonal frequency m.
  
  
  Prophet: Accessible Forecasting
Meta's Prophet is designed for business time series. It handles seasonality, holidays, and missing data gracefully.Prophet is less flexible than ARIMA but requires less expertise. It's excellent for quick, reasonable forecasts.
  
  
  Train-Test Splitting for Time Series
Standard random train-test splits don't work for time series. You can't use future data to predict the past.Always split chronologically:The test set must come after the training set. Otherwise, your evaluation is meaningless.Common metrics for time series forecast evaluation:MAPE is intuitive but undefined when actuals are zero. MAE and RMSE are more robust but less interpretable.
  
  
  Cross-Validation for Time Series
Time series cross-validation uses rolling or expanding windows:Each fold trains on historical data and tests on a subsequent period. This gives a realistic estimate of forecast accuracy. Fitting models to non-stationary data produces unreliable forecasts. Complex models with many parameters fit training data perfectly but generalize poorly. Failing to account for obvious seasonal patterns leads to systematic errors. Using future information during training—easy to do accidentally with calculated features.Over-reliance on point forecasts. Always consider prediction intervals, not just the central forecast.
  
  
  When Simple Beats Complex
Surprisingly often, simple methods outperform sophisticated ones.Naive forecasts (tomorrow equals today) and seasonal naive forecasts (next January equals last January) are strong baselines. If your fancy model can't beat them, it's not adding value.Exponential smoothing methods are simpler than ARIMA and often perform comparably.Always start simple. Add complexity only when it demonstrably improves forecasts.
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions
What's the minimum amount of data needed for time series forecasting?
It depends on seasonality. To detect yearly patterns, you need multiple years of data. For weekly patterns, months might suffice. Generally, more data is better.How far ahead can I forecast reliably?
Forecast accuracy degrades with horizon length. Short-term forecasts (days to weeks) are typically much more accurate than long-term ones (quarters to years).Should I use ARIMA or Prophet?
Prophet is easier and handles holidays well. ARIMA offers more control and performs better when properly tuned. Try both and compare on your data.How do I handle missing values?
Interpolation works for small gaps. For larger gaps, consider whether the missing pattern itself contains information. Some methods like Prophet handle missing values automatically.Can I use machine learning for time series?
Yes. LSTMs, Gradient Boosting, and other ML methods work for time series but require careful feature engineering and cross-validation.What if my series has multiple seasonal patterns?
Prophet handles multiple seasonalities well. SARIMA requires choosing the dominant pattern. For complex seasonality, consider Fourier terms as features.How do I forecast multiple related time series?
Hierarchical forecasting and vector autoregression (VAR) handle multiple series. Prophet and other methods can be applied to each series independently.What about external factors that affect my series?
ARIMAX and Prophet with regressors allow you to include external variables. Be careful about needing to forecast the regressors themselves.How do I communicate uncertainty to stakeholders?
Always present prediction intervals alongside point forecasts. Explain that forecasts become more uncertain further into the future.What resources should I use to learn more?
"Forecasting: Principles and Practice" by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos is freely available online and excellent.Time series forecasting doesn't require advanced mathematics. It requires understanding the patterns in your data and choosing appropriate methods.Start with visualization and decomposition. Check stationarity.Try simple methods first. Compare against baselines. Always include uncertainty in your forecasts.With Python's powerful libraries, reliable forecasts are within reach for any data analyst willing to learn the fundamentals.This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Giampaolo Rodola: From Python 3.3 to today: ending 15 years of subprocess polling</title><link>https://gmpy.dev/blog/2026/event-driven-process-waiting</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the less fun aspects of process management on POSIX systems is waiting
for a process to terminate. The standard library's  module has
relied on a busy-loop polling approach since the  parameter was added
to
Popen.wait()
in Python 3.3, around 15 years ago (see
source).
And psutil's
Process.wait()
method uses exactly the same technique (see
source).The logic is straightforward: check whether the process has exited using
non-blocking , sleep briefly, check again, sleep a bit
longer, and so on.In this blog post I'll show how I finally addressed this long-standing
inefficiency, first in psutil, and most excitingly, directly in CPython's
standard library subprocess module.The problem with busy-pollingCPU wake-ups: even with exponential backoff (starting at 0.1ms, capping at
  40ms), the system constantly wakes up to check process status, wasting CPU
  cycles and draining batteries.Latency: there's always a gap between when a process actually terminates and
  when you detect it.Scalability: monitoring many processes simultaneously magnifies all of the
  above.All POSIX systems provide at least one mechanism to be notified when a file
descriptor becomes ready. These are
select(),
poll(),
epoll() (Linux) and
kqueue() (BSD / macOS)
system calls. Until recently, I believed they could only be used with file
descriptors referencing sockets, pipes, etc., but it turns out they can also be
used to wait for events on process PIDs!In 2019, Linux 5.3 introduced a new syscall,
,
which was added to the  module in Python 3.9. It returns a file descriptor
referencing a process PID. The interesting thing is that  can be
used in conjunction with ,  or  to effectively wait
until the process exits. E.g. by using :This approach has zero busy-looping. The kernel wakes us up exactly when the
process terminates or when the timeout expires if the PID is still alive.I chose  over  because  has a historical file
descriptor limit (), which typically caps it at 1024 file
descriptors per-process (reminded me of
BPO-1685000).I chose  over  because it does not require creating an
additional file descriptor. It also needs only a single syscall, which should
make it a bit more efficient when monitoring a single FD rather than many.BSD-derived systems (including macOS) provide the  syscall. It's
conceptually similar to ,  and , but more powerful
(e.g. it can also handle regular files).  can be passed a PID
directly, and it will return once the PID disappears or the timeout expires:Windows does not busy-loop, both in psutil and subprocess module, thanks to
. This means Windows has effectively had event-driven
process waiting from the start. So nothing to do on that front.Both  and  can fail for different reasons. For example,
with  if the process runs out of file descriptors (usually 1024), or
with  /  if the syscall was explicitly blocked at the system
level by the sysadmin (e.g. via SECCOMP). In all cases, psutil silently falls
back to the traditional busy-loop polling approach rather than raising an
exception.This fast-path-with-fallback approach is similar in spirit to
BPO-33671, where I sped up
 by using zero-copy system calls back in 2018. In there,
more efficient  is attempted first, and if it fails (e.g. on
network filesystems) we fall back to the traditional  / 
approach to copy regular files.As a simple experiment, here's a simple program which waits on itself for 10
seconds without terminating:We can measure the CPU context switching using . Before the
patch (the busy-loop):$/usr/bin/time-vpython3test.py>grepcontext
Voluntarycontextswitches:Involuntarycontextswitches:After the patch (the event-driven approach):$/usr/bin/time-vpython3test.py>grepcontext
Voluntarycontextswitches:Involuntarycontextswitches:This shows that instead of spinning in userspace, the process blocks in
 / , and is woken up only when the kernel notifies it,
resulting in just a few CPU context switches.It's also interesting to note that waiting via  (or ) puts
the process into the exact same sleeping state as a plain  call.
From the kernel's perspective, both are interruptible sleeps: the process is
de-scheduled, consumes zero CPU, and sits quietly in kernel space.The  state shown below by  means that the process "sleeps in
foreground".After landing the psutil implementation
(psutil/PR-2706), I took the
extra step and submitted a matching pull request for CPython 
module: cpython/PR-144047.I'm especially proud of this one: this is the  in psutil's 17+
year history that a feature developed in psutil made its way upstream into the
Python standard library. The first was back in 2011, when 
inspired
shutil.disk_usage() (see
python-ideas ML proposal). 15 years ago, Python 3.3 added the  parameter to
 (see
commit). That's
probably where I took inspiration when I first added the  parameter to
psutil's  around the same time (see
commit). Now, 15 years
later, I'm contributing back a similar improvement for that very same 
parameter. .psutil/#2712: proposal to
  extend this to multiple PIDs ().psutil/#2703: proposal for

Not because the data is missing.
But because the decision keeps getting delayed, softened, or deferred.A week becomes a sprint.
A sprint becomes a phase.
A phase becomes “we’ll deal with it later.”On paper, the project is still moving.
In reality, momentum is leaking out through indecision.This is what I mean by decision latency.It’s the time between when a decision becomes necessary and when someone is willing to own it. That gap is where most project risk is created.What makes it dangerous is that it usually looks reasonable.“We just need one more data point.”
“Let’s see how it trends.”
“We’ll take that offline.”
“We’ll re-baseline next cycle.”Each of those sounds sensible in isolation. Together, they quietly stall the project.Dashboards, frameworks, and AI can improve visibility and analysis, but they don’t reduce decision latency. In some cases, they make it worse by giving people more reasons to wait.More data.
More scenarios.I’ve written before about why AI struggles with real project work. This is a big part of it. AI can tell you what usually happens next. It can’t tell you which trade-off you’re prepared to live with when the information is incomplete and the pressure is real.That choice isn’t analytical.
It’s accountable.Decision latency also hides behind good governance.Steering committees meet. Papers are circulated. Risks are noted. Actions are captured. And still, the core decision gets deferred because no one wants to be the one who makes it too early.The longer that goes on, the fewer options remain. By the time the decision is forced, the project has already paid the price.Experienced project managers learn to recognise this early. They stop asking, “Do we have enough information?” and start asking a harder question:“What happens if we don’t decide now?”That’s usually when the real risk becomes visible.Projects don’t need perfect information.
They need timely decisions with clear ownership.Everything else is support.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I scraped Reddit to find $10k leads without getting banned 🕵️‍♂️</title><link>https://dev.to/hypertools/how-i-scraped-reddit-to-find-10k-leads-without-getting-banned-35o6</link><author>Roberto | Hyper-Tools</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:06:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most people look for sales leads on LinkedIn.

It’s the sentence that makes Senior Engineers sigh and rub their temples.
​"But it works on my machine!"
​You wrote the code. You tested it on your laptop. It worked perfectly. Then you pushed it to the server, and it crashed. Why?
Maybe you have Python 3.10, and the server has Python 3.8.
Maybe you are on a Mac, and the server is Linux.
Maybe you installed a library three months ago and forgot to put it in your requirements.txt.
​This is called Environment Drift, and it is a nightmare.
​The solution is Docker.
​The Shipping Container Analogy
​Before 1950, shipping goods was a disaster. You had barrels of whiskey, sacks of flour, and loose furniture. Loading them onto a ship took forever because every item was a different shape.
​Then, the standardized Shipping Container was invented.
It didn't matter what was inside (cars, grain, TVs). The container was always the exact same size. The crane didn't need to know what was inside; it just needed to lift the box.
​Docker does this for code.
It creates a digital "Container" that holds everything your app needs:
​The Operating System (e.g., a tiny version of Linux).
​The Code.
​The Environment Variables.
​When you ship your app, you don't ship just the code. You ship the whole box. If it runs on your laptop, it is mathematically guaranteed to run on the server, because the environment inside the box never changes.
​The 3 Concepts You Need to Know
​Forget the complex commands for a second. Understand these three words:
​Dockerfile (The Recipe): A text file that tells Docker how to build your box. ("Start with Linux, install Python, copy my files, run this command").
​Image (The Blueprint): When you run the recipe, you get an Image. This is a frozen snapshot of your app. It cannot be changed.
​Container (The House): When you actually run the Image, it becomes a Container. This is the live, running application.
​Let's say you have a simple Python script.
You tell your friend, "Install Python, then run pip install requests, then run python main.py."
(This fails if they have the wrong Python version).
​With Docker:RUN pip install -r requirements.txtCMD ["python", "main.py"]Now, your friend just types:
docker build -t my-app .
​It works instantly. No installing Python. No version conflicts. It just works.
​Docker isn't just for DevOps engineers. It is for anyone who values their sanity.
It forces you to document your dependencies explicitly. It allows you to onboard new developers in minutes, not days.
​If you want to be a professional software engineer, stop relying on your local setup. Containerize everything.

You'll be given a certificate in TEXT format and asked to identify what's wrong with it. This exercise prepares you for exactly that scenario.
  
  
  🎯 For Security Engineers: Why This Exercise Matters
You need to understand WHAT makes a TLS certificate valid and WHY - not just IF it's valid.Off-the-shelf tools like sslyze, testssl.sh, and OpenSSL will give you a simple answer:sslyze google.com:443
✓ Certificate is valid
But they won't teach you: SHA-1 signatures are catastrophically broken (Google SHAttered attack, 2017) CA:TRUE on an end-entity certificate enables complete PKI compromise (DigiNotar breach, 2011) browsers ignore the Common Name field (RFC 6125 deprecation) the 398-day validity limit exists (CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC22) wildcard matching actually works ( rules) to detect self-signed certificates (SKI/AKI comparison logic) Key Usage flags matter (Digital Signature vs Key Encipherment vs Certificate Sign)This exercise forces you to implement the validation logic yourself.By the end, you won't just run security scanners - you'll understand X.509 certificate structure at a fundamental level. This understanding separates those who run tools from those who understand PKI fundamentals.
  
  
  What Do Off-the-Shelf Tools Actually Tell You?
Here's what happens when you check an expired certificate with popular tools:openssl verify expired_cert.pem
error 10 at 0 depth lookup: certificate has expired
❌ Cryptic error code ("error 10")❌ Doesn't show which date field or the actual dates❌ No explanation of why it matterssslyze  expired.com:443
  Certificate Validation:

     Why this matters: Expired certificates cannot be trusted.
     The private key may have been compromised after expiration.
     Browsers reject these to prevent MITM attacks.

The hash algorithm must be strong.This check validates the  (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512), NOT the signature algorithm (RSA vs ECDSA).✅ Allowed hash algorithms:✅ Allowed signature algorithms (with approved hash):, , , , MD5 (broken 2004): SHA-1 (broken 2017): , Outdated signature algorithms:DSA (deprecated by NIST 2019): , Note: DSA deprecated even with strong hash algorithmsFocus on the HASH algorithm, not the signature type:
- "sha256WithRSAEncryption" → SHA-256 ✅
- "ecdsa-with-SHA256" → SHA-256 ✅
- "sha1WithRSAEncryption" → SHA-1 ❌
- "ecdsa-with-SHA1" → SHA-1 ❌
Why this matters - Collision attacks:MD5 collision (2008):
1. Attacker creates GOOD cert request
2. Also creates EVIL cert with same MD5 hash
3. CA signs GOOD cert
4. Attacker swaps in EVIL cert (same signature!)
5. Browser trusts EVIL cert ❌
Flame malware (2012): Used MD5 collision to forge Microsoft certificateSHAttered (2017): Demonstrated practical SHA-1 collision CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "CAs MUST NOT issue certificates using MD5 or SHA-1" (since January 2016)What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM"
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 4: Public Key Strength
What you'll see in a good certificate:Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
    Public-Key: (2048 bit)
Public Key Algorithm: id-ecPublicKey
    Public-Key: (256 bit)
    ASN1 OID: prime256v1
    NIST CURVE: P-256
Plain English explanation:
The public key must be strong enough to resist brute-force attacks.RSA: ≥2048 bits (3072 or 4096 recommended)ECDSA: ≥P-256 (P-384 or P-521 recommended)RSA-1024 (crackable with $1M+ budget)RSA-512 (crackable in hours)RSA-1024 security level:
- 1999: "Safe for 20+ years"
- 2010: Factored by academics
- 2015: NSA likely can crack
- 2025: Definitely broken ❌
 CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "Recommended key strengths are at least 2048-bit RSA or Elliptic Curve using NIST P-256"What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_WEAK_KEY"
  
  
  🔹 PHASE 2: IDENTITY VALIDATION

  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 5: Subject Distinguished Name (DN)
What you'll see in a good certificate:Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com
Plain English explanation:
Subject DN = Who owns this certificate
  
  
  🎯 The Core Rule (RFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.6)
Check 5 validates the Subject DN field with a  based on whether Subject has content:SANs Critical Requirement⚠️  - SANs can be critical OR non-critical❌  if SANs not critical Check 5 only cares about the SANs critical flag when Subject is empty. When Subject has components, the SANs critical flag is irrelevant to Check 5.
  
  
  ✅ Case 1: Subject Present, SANs Non-Critical (99% of real certificates)
Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ✅  Subject has DN components (C=US, O=Example Inc, CN=...), so Check 5 passes immediately. The SANs critical flag is  by Check 5. ssllabs.com, google.com, amazon.com - nearly all production certificates follow this pattern.
  
  
  ✅ Case 2: Subject Present, SANs Critical (also valid)
Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ✅  Subject has DN components, so Check 5 passes. SANs being marked critical is  when Subject is present. Some CAs mark SANs as critical even when Subject is present - this is valid and doesn't affect Check 5.
  
  
  ✅ Case 3: Empty Subject, SANs Critical (rare but valid)
Subject: (empty)

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ✅  Subject is empty, BUT SANs is marked critical, which satisfies RFC 5280's requirement. Certificates issued by modern CAs that choose to omit the Subject DN entirely and rely solely on SANs for identity.
  
  
  ❌ Case 4: Empty Subject, SANs Non-Critical (INVALID)
Subject: (empty)

X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
 ❌  Subject is empty AND SANs is not marked critical - violates RFC 5280. Without a Subject DN and without the critical flag, older validators might ignore the SANs extension completely, causing validation to fail in unpredictable ways.
  
  
  🔍 How to Check if SANs is Critical
The "critical" keyword appears on the same line as the extension name:X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical  ← Has "critical" keyword
    DNS:www.example.com
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:  ← No "critical" keyword
    DNS:www.example.com
 "SANs must always be critical"❌ False - SANs only MUST be critical when Subject is empty "Subject can never be empty"❌ False - RFC 5280 allows empty Subject if SANs is marked critical "If Subject exists, SANs cannot be critical"❌ False - SANs can be critical even when Subject exists (it's just not required) "SANs critical flag requirement is conditional on Subject being empty"✅ True - this is the actual RFC 5280 rule
  
  
  📊 Decision Tree for Check 5
START
  │
  ├─ Does Subject have DN components? (C=, O=, CN=, etc.)
  │   │
  │   ├─ YES → ✅ Check 5 PASS

  │       │   └─ NO  → ❌ Check 5 FAIL

  
  
  🔬 What Counts as "Empty" Subject?
These are considered empty:Subject:                    ← Nothing after colon
Subject: (empty)            ← Explicit empty marker
Subject: CN=                ← Key without value
Subject: =value             ← Value without key
Subject: CN= , O=           ← All values empty
Subject: CN=www.example.com           ← Has valid component
Subject: C=US, O=Example              ← Has valid components
Subject: CN=www.example.com, O=       ← At least one valid component
 A Subject with at least one valid  pair (where both key and value are non-empty) is considered "present" for Check 5 purposes.Old certificates (pre-2000): Used only Subject DN for identityCommon Name (CN) field contained the hostnameModern certificates (2000+): Use SANs for identitySANs contains all valid hostnamesSubject DN became optionalCN field deprecated for hostname validation (RFC 6125) Allows empty Subject IF:SANs is marked critical (forces validators to check it)Ensures backward compatibility with older validatorsIf Subject is empty and SANs is NOT critical:Legacy validators might skip SANs (non-critical extensions can be ignored)Certificate would have no identity informationValidation would fail unpredictablyBy requiring SANs to be critical when Subject is empty:Forces all validators (old and new) to check SANsGuarantees certificate identity can be validatedMaintains backward compatibilityRFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.6:"If the subject field contains an empty sequence, then the issuing CA MUST include a subjectAltName extension that is marked as critical." This is a one-way requirement. It does NOT say "if Subject is present, SANs cannot be critical." Both critical and non-critical SANs are valid when Subject exists.
  
  
  ❓ What Happens if Check 5 Fails?
Scenario 1: Both Subject and SANs emptyCertificate has no identity informationCannot determine who owns the certificate Reject certificate immediatelyScenario 2: Subject empty, SANs not criticalViolates RFC 5280 Section 4.1.2.6Legacy validators might ignore SANs Reject certificate (non-compliant)Scenario 3: Subject presentCheck 5 automatically passesIdentity validation continues with Check 6 (SANs present) and Check 7 (hostname match)
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 6: Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:www.example.com
    DNS:example.com
    DNS:api.example.com
Plain English explanation:
SANs = List of ALL valid hostnames for this certificateCertificate for: www.example.com
User visits: api.example.com

WITHOUT SANs listing api.example.com:
→ ❌ Hostname mismatch! Reject!

WITH SANs listing api.example.com:
→ ✅ Valid! Allow connection!
DNS:*.example.com
→ Matches: www.example.com, api.example.com
→ Does NOT match: example.com (no subdomain!)
→ Does NOT match: foo.bar.example.com (only 1 level!)
 CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "This extension MUST be present"What happens if it fails:
Cannot validate hostname → Reject
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 7: Hostname Matches SAN
User visiting: www.example.com
SANs: DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
→ ✅ MATCH!
Plain English explanation:
The hostname in the browser address bar MUST match one of the SANs in the certificate.⭐ CRITICAL: CHECK 7 USES DNS WILDCARD PATTERN MATCHING ⭐This check performs DNS wildcard pattern matching where  is a wildcard character. DNS wildcards follow RFC 6125 rules, NOT shell/filesystem wildcard rules!🔑 Understanding DNS Labels (The Foundation of Wildcard Matching)Before understanding wildcard matching, you must understand :A label is one "part" of a domain name separated by dotsThink of labels as "levels" in the domain hierarchyExample: Breaking down  into labels:www.example.com
 │    │      │
 │    │      └─── Label 3: "com" (TLD/root)
 │    └────────── Label 2: "example" (base domain)
 └─────────────── Label 1: "www" (subdomain - LEFTMOST)

Total: 3 labels
mail.example.com        → 3 labels: ["mail", "example", "com"]
api.example.com         → 3 labels: ["api", "example", "com"]
wrong.host.badssl.com   → 4 labels: ["wrong", "host", "badssl", "com"]
sub.domain.example.com  → 4 labels: ["sub", "domain", "example", "com"]
example.com             → 2 labels: ["example", "com"]
🎯 The Core Rule of DNS Wildcard Matching:The wildcard  replaces EXACTLY ONE label - no more, no less!This is fundamentally different from shell wildcards which can match multiple levels.⭐ CRITICAL DNS Wildcard Rules (RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3):Wildcard replaces exactly ONE label = [exactly-one-label].example.comNOT:  = Wildcard only in leftmost positionPattern and hostname must have same number of labelsThis is the key rule most implementations miss!Case-insensitive comparison matches Exact non-wildcard labels must match exactlyIn , both "example" and "com" must match exactly📊 DNS Wildcard Matching Examples (Understanding Label Counts):Pattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",     "example", "com"]  → 3 labels
Hostname: ["www",   "example", "com"]  → 3 labels

Label count: 3 = 3 ✅ MATCH!
- Label 1: "*" matches "www" ✅
- Label 2: "example" = "example" ✅
- Label 3: "com" = "com" ✅
Result: ✅ PASS
Example 2: Correct Match (Different Subdomain)Pattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: api.example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",    "example", "com"]  → 3 labels
Hostname: ["api",  "example", "com"]  → 3 labels

Label count: 3 = 3 ✅ MATCH!
- Label 1: "*" matches "api" ✅
- Label 2: "example" = "example" ✅
- Label 3: "com" = "com" ✅
Result: ✅ PASS
Example 3: NO MATCH - Too Many LabelsPattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: wrong.host.badssl.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",      "example", "com"]        → 3 labels
Hostname: ["wrong",  "host", "badssl", "com"] → 4 labels

Label count: 3 ≠ 4 ❌ NO MATCH!
Why: Wildcard replaces ONE label, but hostname has TWO extra labels
The wildcard can't "absorb" multiple labels!
Result: ❌ FAIL
Example 4: NO MATCH - Too Few LabelsPattern:  *.example.com
Hostname: example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",       "example", "com"]  → 3 labels
Hostname: ["example", "com"]             → 2 labels

Label count: 3 ≠ 2 ❌ NO MATCH!
Why: Wildcard needs a label to replace, but hostname has no subdomain
Result: ❌ FAIL
Example 5: NO MATCH - Wrong Base DomainPattern:  *.api.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com

Breaking into labels:
Pattern:  ["*",   "api", "example", "com"]  → 4 labels
Hostname: ["www", "example", "com"]         → 3 labels

Label count: 4 ≠ 3 ❌ NO MATCH!
Even if we ignore count: "api" ≠ nothing, "example" ≠ "example" position mismatch
Result: ❌ FAIL
🎓 Conceptual Approach to DNS Wildcard Matching:Step 1: Split into labelsSplit the pattern on dots:  → Split the hostname on dots:  → ["www", "example", "com"]Step 2: Check label countCount labels in pattern: 3Count labels in hostname: 3If counts don't match → NO MATCH, stop here!This step is CRITICAL and catches most invalid matchesStep 3: Compare each label positionGo through each position (left to right)If pattern label is  → any hostname label matches (continue)If pattern label is not  → must match exactly (case-insensitive)If any non-wildcard label doesn't match → NO MATCHStep 4: If all positions match → MATCH!🚨 Common Implementation Mistakes to Avoid:❌ WRONG: Using shell/filesystem wildcardsShell wildcards (like fnmatch, glob, Path.match):
- * matches EVERYTHING including dots
- Would match "*.example.com" to "wrong.host.example.com" ❌
- This is a SECURITY BUG!
❌ WRONG: Using regex wildcards without constraintsRegex .* matches EVERYTHING including dots
- Would match "*.example.com" to "a.b.c.d.example.com" ❌
- Must constrain * to match ONE label only
❌ WRONG: Forgetting to check label countWithout label count check:
- Might incorrectly match multi-level subdomains
- Major security vulnerability!
✅ CORRECT: DNS wildcard matching (RFC 6125)RFC 6125 rules:
- Wildcard replaces exactly ONE label
- Must check label count FIRST
- Compare each label position
More wildcard matching examples:SAN: DNS:*.example.com

✅ Matches: www.example.com (one level - 3 labels match 3 labels)
✅ Matches: api.example.com (one level - 3 labels match 3 labels)
✅ Matches: mail.example.com (one level - 3 labels match 3 labels)
❌ NO match: example.com (wildcard needs subdomain - 2 labels ≠ 3 labels)
❌ NO match: foo.bar.example.com (wildcard only covers 1 level - 4 labels ≠ 3 labels)
❌ NO match: wrong.host.badssl.com (different base domain - 4 labels ≠ 3 labels)
⚠️ CRITICAL: TLD Wildcards Are FORBIDDEN by RFC 6125 ⚠️These wildcards are INVALID and MUST be rejected:❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.com (TLD wildcard)
❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.org (TLD wildcard)
❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.net (TLD wildcard)
❌ FORBIDDEN: DNS:*.co.uk (public suffix wildcard)

Why forbidden?
- One certificate would cover ALL domains under that TLD
- Massive security risk
- Would allow attacker to impersonate any .com domain
- RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3 explicitly prohibits this
Example of the attack TLD wildcards prevent:If *.com was allowed:
1. Attacker gets certificate with SAN: DNS:*.com
2. Certificate would match: google.com, amazon.com, facebook.com, ANY .com domain!
3. ❌ Complete breakdown of trust model!

RFC 6125 prevents this by FORBIDDING wildcards on public suffixes.
⚠️ IMPORTANT: How TLD Wildcards Are Handled (NOT Automatic Fail!)TLD wildcard SANs should be SKIPPED/IGNORED, not cause automatic failure.If certificate has: DNS:*.com, DNS:www.example.com, DNS:example.com
And hostname is: www.example.com

Validation process:
1. Check DNS:*.com
   → Is TLD wildcard? YES
   → Action: SKIP this SAN (don't attempt to match)
   → Continue to next SAN

2. Check DNS:www.example.com
   → Is TLD wildcard? NO
   → Is valid? YES
   → Does hostname match? YES (exact match)
   → Result: ✅ PASS CHECK 7

CHECK 7 PASSES because a valid SAN matched the hostname!
 Treat TLD wildcard SANs like malformed data - ignore them and continue checking other SANs.❌ ONLY TLD wildcard SANs (no valid SANs to check)❌ Has valid SANs, but none match the hostname✅ At least one valid (non-TLD-wildcard) SAN matches the hostnameExample 1: Only TLD wildcard (FAILS)SANs:     DNS:*.com
Hostname: www.example.com
Result:   ❌ FAIL CHECK 7
Reason:   No valid SAN to match against (only TLD wildcard)
Example 2: TLD wildcard + matching valid SAN (PASSES)SANs:     DNS:*.com, DNS:www.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com
Result:   ✅ PASS CHECK 7
Reason:   Valid SAN (www.example.com) matches hostname
Example 3: TLD wildcard + non-matching valid SAN (FAILS)SANs:     DNS:*.com, DNS:api.example.com
Hostname: www.example.com
Result:   ❌ FAIL CHECK 7
Reason:   No valid SAN matches hostname (api ≠ www)
🔗 How to Detect TLD Wildcards Programmatically:To properly validate and reject TLD wildcards, you can retrieve the official list of valid TLDs from IANA:IANA TLD List (Updated Daily):https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt

TLD list includes both generic TLDs (.com, .org) and country-code TLDs (.uk, .jp)Some TLDs have second-level registrations (.co.uk, .com.au) - also forbiddenFor production code, cache the TLD list and update periodicallyIANA updates this list when new TLDs are addedFigure out how to use this list to detect TLD wildcards in your validator!Certificate SANs: DNS:example.com
User visits: www.example.com
→ ❌ NO MATCH! (www. is a subdomain!)

Certificate SANs: DNS:*.example.com  
User visits: example.com
→ ❌ NO MATCH! (wildcard requires subdomain!)

Certificate SANs: DNS:*.example.com
User visits: foo.bar.example.com
→ ❌ NO MATCH! (wildcard only covers 1 level!)

Certificate SANs: DNS:*.com
User visits: example.com
→ ❌ INVALID! (TLD wildcards FORBIDDEN by RFC 6125!)
Why wildcard matching is used here:SANs contain  for hostnamesOne certificate can cover multiple subdomains is a  that matches many hostnamesBut TLD wildcards would be too dangerous and are forbiddenTest Cases in Challenge That REQUIRE Wildcard Matching:Your validator MUST correctly handle these test certificates to pass CHECK 7:Test 003: Basic Wildcard (MUST PASS)SANs:     DNS:*.example.com, DNS:example.com

 Implement wildcard matching that:✅ Matches single-level subdomains ( matches )❌ Rejects multi-level subdomains ( does NOT match )❌ Rejects base domain ( does NOT match )❌ Rejects TLD wildcards ( is INVALID per RFC 6125)✅ Case-insensitive matching✅ Wildcard only in leftmost label Don't use  - it's for file paths, not hostnames! You need RFC 6125 compliant matching.RFC 6125 Section 6.4.3 - Server Identity Validation (Wildcard Certificates)CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 3.2.2.6 - Wildcard Domain ValidationWhat happens if it fails:

  ✅ CHECK 8: Basic Constraints (CA:FALSE)
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
    CA:FALSE
Plain English explanation:
This certificate is for a SERVER, NOT a Certificate Authority. = Can sign other certificates (CAs only) = Cannot sign certificates (servers, users)Why this matters - CA impersonation attack:Without CA:FALSE enforcement:
1. Attacker gets valid cert for evil.com
2. Cert has CA:TRUE (mistake!)
3. Attacker signs fake google.com cert
4. Browser trusts it (signed by "valid" CA)
5. ❌ Game over!

With CA:FALSE enforcement:
1. Browser checks: CA:FALSE ✅
2. Cert cannot sign anything
3. Attack prevented ✅
X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical  ← MUST say "critical"!
    CA:FALSE
 CA/Browser Forum Certificate Contents - "If present, the cA field MUST be set false"What happens if it fails:

  ⚠️ CHECK 9: Key Usage Flags (RSA vs ECDSA Requirements)
 ⚠️ OPTIONAL (Universal in practice - 99%+ have it)What you'll see in good certificates:Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
X509v3 Key Usage: critical
    Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
Public Key Algorithm: id-ecPublicKey  
X509v3 Key Usage: critical
    Digital Signature
Plain English explanation:
Key Usage = What cryptographic operations this public key can perform
  
  
  🔑 Algorithm-Specific Requirements
The requirements differ based on the certificate's signature algorithm:✅  be marked as critical✅  be marked as critical (ECDSA keys cannot encrypt)
  
  
  RSA Key Exchange (TLS 1.2 and earlier)
In traditional RSA key exchange, the server's RSA certificate is used for TWO different operations: Signs the ServerKeyExchange message (DHE) or verifies certificate authenticity Decrypts the pre-master secret that the client encrypts with the server's public RSA keyClient → Server: ClientHello
Server → Client: ServerHello, Certificate (RSA public key)

Client: Generates random pre-master secret
Client: Encrypts pre-master secret with server's RSA public key
Client → Server: Encrypted pre-master secret

Server: Decrypts with private RSA key    ← Needs Key Encipherment!
Both: Derive session keys from pre-master secret
Why RSA needs both flags: The RSA key is used for both signing AND encrypting during the TLS handshake.
  
  
  ECDSA with ECDHE (Modern TLS)
In modern TLS with ECDSA, the certificate is used for  Signs the ServerKeyExchange message containing ECDHE parameters NOT needed - ECDSA keys can only sign, not encryptClient → Server: ClientHello
Server → Client: ServerHello, Certificate (ECDSA public key)

Server: Generates ephemeral ECDHE key pair
Server: Signs ECDHE parameters with ECDSA private key
Server → Client: Signed ECDHE parameters

Client: Verifies signature    ← Only needs Digital Signature!
Client: Generates own ECDHE key pair
Client → Server: Client's ECDHE public key

Both: Compute shared secret via ECDHE (no encryption!)
Both: Derive session keys from shared secret
Why ECDSA only needs Digital Signature:ECDSA keys can only sign, not encryptKey exchange uses ECDHE (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman)The pre-master secret is derived via DH key agreement, not encryptedProvides Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
  
  
  ❌ Banned Flags for TLS Server Certificates
These flags should  appear in TLS server certificates:Reserved for CA certificatesEnd-entity cert could sign other certificates! (DigiNotar attack)Could issue fake revocation lists (Non-Repudiation)For legally-binding signaturesUnusual for TLS, adds legal liability If a TLS server certificate has , it can create valid-looking certificates for ANY domain → Complete PKI compromise!

  📖 Why OPTIONAL per Specification
CA/Browser Forum language: "If present, bit positions for keyCertSign and cRLSign MUST NOT be set" "If present" - the extension itself is technically optional 99%+ of real-world TLS certificates include Key Usage (it's universal in practice)IF Key Usage extension is present:
  1. ✅ Must be marked critical
  2. ❌ MUST NOT have Certificate Sign or CRL Sign
  3. ✅ Must have algorithm-appropriate flags:
     - RSA: Digital Signature + Key Encipherment
     - ECDSA: Digital Signature only

IF Key Usage extension is absent:
  → Accept (extension is optional per CA/B Forum)

  
  
  🔒 Why Modern TLS Prefers ECDSA + ECDHE
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): Even if private key stolen later, past sessions remain secure ECDSA P-256 (256-bit) ≈ RSA 3072-bit security ECDSA signing/verification is faster Only needs Digital Signature flag Industry moving from RSA to ECDSA + ECDHE for these security and performance benefits. RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.3 (Key Usage), CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 7.1.2.3What happens if it fails:Missing required flags → Cannot establish TLS connection (cipher suite mismatch)Has Certificate Sign or CRL Sign → REJECT IMMEDIATELY (security catastrophe!)Not marked critical → Reject (violates RFC 5280)Extension absent → Accept (optional per CA/B Forum)
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 10: Extended Key Usage (EKU)
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Web Server Authentication
Plain English explanation:
EKU = What PURPOSE this certificate servesFor TLS server certificates, MUST include:TLS Web Server Authentication (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) ✅CAN also include (for specific use cases):TLS Web Client Authentication (for mTLS - mutual TLS)Other purposes (as long as Server Auth is present)Why this matters - Wrong purpose attack:Purpose Used INSTEAD of Server AuthTLS Web Client Authentication (alone)E-mail Protection (alone)✅ CORRECT - Server Auth WITH other purposes:X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Web Server Authentication
    TLS Web Client Authentication
→ ✅ HAS Server Auth (Client Auth is bonus for mTLS)
❌ WRONG - Client Auth INSTEAD OF Server Auth:X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Web Client Authentication
→ ❌ MISSING Server Auth!

Test 028: Code Signing INSTEAD OF Server Auth → ❌ FAIL
Test 059: Client Auth INSTEAD OF Server Auth → ❌ FAIL
Test 029: Server Auth WITH Client Auth → ✅ PASS
Bitwarden: Server Auth WITH Client Auth → ✅ PASS CA/Browser Forum Certificate Contents - "Either the value id-kp-serverAuth or id-kp-clientAuth or both values MUST be present"What happens if it fails:
Certificate has wrong purpose → Browser rejects
  
  
  🔹 PHASE 4: REVOCATION INFRASTRUCTURE
⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE - Ballot SC63 (Effective March 15, 2024):
The CA/Browser Forum made significant changes to revocation requirements:✅ CRL (Check 11): NOW REQUIRED (was recommended)⚠️ OCSP (Check 13): NOW OPTIONAL (was required)This reversal addresses privacy concerns (OCSP exposes browsing behavior), security issues (plain HTTP), and operational complexity. Short-lived certificates (≤7 days) are exempt from both requirements. CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63 - "Make OCSP optional, require CRLs, and incentivize automation"
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 11: CRL Distribution Points (Certificate Revocation List)
 ✅ REQUIRED (Changed March 15, 2024 via Ballot SC63)What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 CRL Distribution Points:
    URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/ca.crl
    URI:http://crl4.digicert.com/ca.crl
Plain English explanation:
CRL = Certificate Revocation List = List of canceled certificate serial numbers✅ CRL Distribution Points extension MUST be present✅ At least  is required⚠️  for redundancy (but not required)Why multiple URLs are recommended (but not required)? Redundancy!If one CRL server is down, browser can try the backupBest practice: 2+ URLs for high availabilityReality: 70% have 2 URLs, 30% have 1 URL (both valid) Avoid circular dependency:If CRL URL was HTTPS:
1. Need to validate cert for crl.example.com
2. To validate, need to download CRL
3. To download CRL, need to validate cert
4. Infinite loop! 🔄
Without CRL:
1. Private key stolen
2. CA revokes cert
3. Client can't check (no URL)
4. ❌ Accepts revoked cert!

With CRL:
1. Private key stolen
2. CA revokes cert (adds to CRL)
3. Client downloads CRL
4. Finds cert serial in revoked list
5. ✅ Rejects connection!
CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63 (Adopted August 17, 2023, Effective March 15, 2024):: OCSP required, CRL recommended: CRL required, OCSP optional Privacy concerns with OCSP (reveals browsing behavior), operational complexity, and browser failures with OCSP led to this reversal
In 2023, Let's Encrypt announced plans to end OCSP support in favor of CRLs due to:Privacy: OCSP requests expose user browsing behaviorSecurity: OCSP requests sent over plain HTTP can be interceptedComplexity: OCSP requires high-availability serversBrowser behavior: Many browsers ignore OCSP failures anyway Short-lived certificates (≤7 days validity) do NOT require CRL or OCSP.CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63: "Make OCSP optional, require CRLs, and incentivize automation"CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 7.1.2.7.1: "The cRLDistributionPoints extension MUST be present"Wikipedia: "Certificate authorities were previously required by the CA/Browser Forum to provide OCSP service, but this requirement was removed in July 2023"What happens if it fails:
✅ REQUIRED check - certificate will be rejected
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 12: Authority Information Access (AIA)
What you'll see in a good certificate:Option 1: Both OCSP and CA Issuers (most common)Authority Information Access:
    OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
    CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/ca.crt
Option 2: CA Issuers only (Bitwarden, Let's Encrypt pattern)Authority Information Access:
    CA Issuers - URI:http://r12.i.lencr.org/
Plain English explanation:
AIA = Authority Information Access = Where to find more information about the certificate✅ AIA extension MUST be present✅ Must contain at least one access methodWhat can be IN the AIA extension: (recommended): Where to download the issuing CA certificate (optional per SC63): Real-time revocation checking Validates that AIA extension exists Separately validates OCSP URL (which is optional) Have both OCSP + CA Issuers Have only CA Issuers (valid! - Bitwarden, Let's Encrypt) Have only OCSP (valid but not recommended)Why CA Issuers URL matters:Browser has: Server cert
Browser needs: Intermediate cert to validate chain
Problem: Where to get intermediate cert?
→ Connection might fail ❌
Browser has: Server cert
Browser downloads: Intermediate from CA Issuers URL
Browser builds: Complete chain to root
→ Validation succeeds ✅
 CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements Section 7.1.2.7.2: "With the exception of stapling, this extension MUST be present"What the extension can contain:CA Issuers (recommended for chain building)OCSP (optional per SC63 - validated separately in Check 13)What happens if it fails:
Missing AIA extension → Reject (required by CA/B Forum)
  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 13: OCSP URL (Real-Time Revocation Checking)
 ⚠️ OPTIONAL (Changed March 15, 2024 via Ballot SC63)What you'll see in a good certificate:OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
Plain English explanation:
OCSP = Online Certificate Status Protocol = Ask CA "Is this cert still valid?" = Download entire list (slow, big) = Ask about ONE cert (fast, small)CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63 (Adopted August 17, 2023, Effective March 15, 2024):: OCSP required, CRL recommended: CRL required, OCSP optional: OCSP requests expose which sites users visit: OCSP sent over plain HTTP (can be intercepted): Many browsers ignore OCSP failures (fail-open): Requires high-availability infrastructure
Let's Encrypt announced in 2023 they're ending OCSP support in favor of CRLs due to these privacy and operational concerns.Why this matters - Real-time revocation (when present):Timeline with OCSP:

9:00 AM: Private key stolen
9:30 AM: CA revokes cert, OCSP updated
9:31 AM: Client connects
  → OCSP query: "Valid?"
  → OCSP: "Revoked!"
  → ✅ Rejected in 1 minute!

Without OCSP:
Must wait for CRL update (hours/days)

While OCSP is now optional, most CAs still provide it for backward compatibility. However, you may encounter modern certificates without OCSP URLs - this is compliant as long as CRL is present.CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC63Wikipedia: "Certificate authorities were previously required by the CA/Browser Forum to provide OCSP service, but this requirement was removed in July 2023"smallstep.com/blog/ocsp-vs-crl-explainedWhat happens if it fails:
No longer a hard failure - certificate can be valid with CRL alone
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 14: Certificate Transparency (Public Audit Trail)
What you'll see in a good certificate:CT Precertificate SCTs:
    Signed Certificate Timestamp (Log 1)
    Signed Certificate Timestamp (Log 2)
Plain English explanation:
CT = Public log of ALL certificates issuedSCT = Signed Certificate Timestamp = Proof cert was logged Redundancy and independenceWhy this matters - Prevents secret certificates:DigiNotar hack (2011):
1. Hackers compromise DigiNotar CA
2. Issue FAKE google.com certificate
3. Use it for espionage (no one knows!)
4. Months pass before discovery
5. ❌ Massive damage done

With Certificate Transparency:
1. CA issues certificate
2. MUST log to public CT log
3. Google monitors logs
4. Sees unauthorized google.com cert
5. ✅ Revokes within hours!
Certificate with 0 SCTs: ❌ Reject (Chrome, Safari)
Certificate with 1 SCT: ❌ Reject (not redundant)
Certificate with 2+ SCTs: ✅ Accept
 Required since April 2018 Required (Apple platforms enforce for all TLS) Required since version 135 (February 2025) Follows Chrome policySigned Certificate Timestamp:
    Version: v1 (0x0)
    Log ID: A4:B9:09:90... (CT log identifier)
    Timestamp: Jan 15 2026 10:23:45 GMT
    Signature: (CA's signature proving it was logged)
RFC 6962: Certificate TransparencyMozilla Firefox 135+ requirement (February 2025)What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED"
  
  
  🔹 PHASE 5: CHAIN VALIDATION

  
  
  ✅ CHECK 15: Not Self-Signed
What you'll see in a good certificate:Issuer:  C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, CN=DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1
Subject: C=US, ST=California, O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com
→ Issuer ≠ Subject ✅
Plain English explanation:
Self-signed certificate = Issuer and Subject are the SAME⭐ CRITICAL: CHECK 15 DOES NOT USE WILDCARD MATCHING ⭐This check performs , NOT pattern matching!The  character (if present in a DN) is treated as a , not a wildcard!For publicly-trusted certificates:Issuer MUST be a trusted CAIssuer MUST NOT equal SubjectSelf-signed certificates are only valid for:Root CA certificates (in browser trust stores)Self-signed cert for www.example.com:
Issuer:  CN=www.example.com  ← Claims to sign itself!
Subject: CN=www.example.com

Anyone can create this!
→ ❌ No trust anchor!
→ ❌ Not publicly trusted!
⚠️ NO WILDCARD MATCHING - Distinguished Names are Exact Identifiers!Unlike CHECK 7 (which uses wildcard matching for hostnames), CHECK 15 compares DNs for .Example - These are NOT considered self-signed:Issuer:  CN = *.example.com, O = Example CA
Subject: CN = www.example.com, O = Example Corp
→ NOT self-signed ✅ (CNs differ: "*.example.com" ≠ "www.example.com")
The  is just a literal character in the CN field, NOT a wildcard pattern!Example - These ARE self-signed:Issuer:  CN = *.example.com, O = Example Inc
Subject: CN = *.example.com, O = Example Inc
→ Self-signed ❌ (exact DN match including the "*")
Why NO wildcard matching for CHECK 15:Distinguished Names are , not patterns identifies a specific CA, it's not a patternWildcard matching would create false positives (different entities matching) matches Only:  = ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION WARNING: Field Order Matters!DO NOT use simple string comparison! The Issuer and Subject fields can contain the same values in  but still represent the same Distinguished Name.Example of a self-signed certificate with different field order:Issuer:  C=US, O=Example Corp, OU=Engineering, CN=Test CA
Subject: CN=Test CA, OU=Engineering, O=Example Corp, C=US
 Figure out how to compare DNs correctly regardless of field order. Think about how to normalize or parse the DN components before comparing.Test cases to verify your implementation:# Test 1: Obvious self-signed (same order)
Issuer:  CN=Test CA, O=Example
Subject: CN=Test CA, O=Example
Expected: self-signed ✅

# Test 2: Self-signed (different order) - THE TRICKY ONE!
Issuer:  C=US, O=Example, CN=Test CA
Subject: CN=Test CA, O=Example, C=US
Expected: self-signed ✅ (must handle this!)

# Test 3: Not self-signed (different CN)
Issuer:  C=US, O=DigiCert, CN=DigiCert CA
Subject: C=US, O=Example, CN=www.example.com
Expected: not self-signed ✅

# Test 4: Not self-signed (different order AND different values)
Issuer:  CN=CA Root, O=TrustCorp
Subject: O=Example Inc, CN=www.example.com
Expected: not self-signed ✅

# Test 5: Wildcard in DN - NOT self-signed (no wildcard matching!)
Issuer:  CN=*.example.com, O=Example CA
Subject: CN=www.example.com, O=Example CA
Expected: not self-signed ✅ ("*.example.com" ≠ "www.example.com" - exact comparison!)

# Test 6: Wildcard in DN - IS self-signed (exact match with wildcard)
Issuer:  CN=*.example.com, O=Example CA
Subject: CN=*.example.com, O=Example CA
Expected: self-signed ❌ (exact DN match including the "*")
Why this matters in practice:Different certificate authorities and tools format DNs differently: Often uses  order Often uses  order (reverse!) May omit optional fields Custom ordering conventionsYour validator must handle all of these correctly! CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements - "CAs MUST NOT issue Subscriber Certificates directly from Root CAs"What happens if it fails:
Browser shows: "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 16: Valid Serial Number
What you'll see in a good certificate:Serial Number:
    0a:f7:e7:ca:cf:45:d8:a9:72:ab:47:c5:f8:49:11:da
Plain English explanation:
Every certificate MUST have a unique serial number with sufficient randomness.CA/Browser Forum requirements:✅ At least 64 bits of entropy (8 bytes of randomness)❌  (0x01, 0x02, 0x03...)❌  (timestamp-based)Why this matters - Serial number attacks:EJBCA CA software had a bugGenerated serial numbers with only 63 bits entropy (not 64!)Required revoking over Affected Actalis: 230,000 active certificates EJBCA generated serial numbers with only 63 bits of entropy instead of 64 bits because it incorrectly handled negative values in signed integers.Real-world examples from test suite:Test 040 - Sequential serial (FAIL):Serial Number: 1234 (0x4d2)
→ ❌ Only 11 bits! Predictable!
Test 069 - Weak entropy (FAIL):Serial Number: 4660 (0x1234)
→ ❌ Only 16 bits! Weak PRNG!
Serial Number:
    0a:f7:e7:ca:cf:45:d8:a9:72:ab:47:c5:f8:49:11:da
→ ✅ 128 bits! Excellent entropy!
What happens if it fails:
Weak serial number → Potential collision → CA may need to revoke certificate
  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 17: Subject Key Identifier (SKI) Present
 ⚠️ RECOMMENDED (Not required for end-entity certificates)What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:
    B7:3E:8E:1A:93:0E:2B:86:93:6A:BC:23:5C:55:01:F4:23:6C:45:87
Plain English explanation:
SKI = Hash of the public key = Unique identifier for this certificate's key✅ REQUIRED for CA certificates⚠️ RECOMMENDED (not required) for end-entity certificatesWhy recommended but not required:RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.2:
"For CA certificates, subject key identifiers SHOULD be derived..."
[No MUST requirement for subscriber/end-entity certificates]
99%+ of modern certificates include SKILet's Encrypt community discussion (July 2024) asked if they could remove itThis proves it's technically optionalWhy it's useful (when present):Building certificate chain:
1. Find cert with SKI matching parent's AKI
2. Continue until reaching root
→ Faster chain building
SKI = SHA-1 hash of the public key
→ Uniquely identifies this key
OpenSSL GitHub Issue #13603: "SKID with the exception of non-CA certs"Let's Encrypt community discussion (July 2024)What happens if it fails:
If absent → May still accept (recommended but not required)
If present → Must be properly formatted
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 18: Authority Key Identifier (AKI) Present
What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
    13:92:C7:15:88:71:4D:F8:F4:32:45:E6:67:8B:A2:1C:65:43:B1:2D
Plain English explanation:
AKI = Hash of the ISSUING CA's public key = Links child cert to parent certSection 4.2.1.1:
"The keyIdentifier field of the authorityKeyIdentifier extension 
MUST be included in all certificates generated by conforming CAs"
 Self-signed certificates MAY omit AKI (since AKI would equal SKI)Why this matters - Chain building:Certificate chain validation:
1. Server cert has AKI: 13:92:C7:...
2. Find intermediate cert with SKI: 13:92:C7:...
3. Match! This is the parent ✅
4. Repeat until reaching root
1. Server cert (no AKI)
2. Which intermediate signed it?
3. Try all intermediates? Slow!
4. Might fail to build chain ❌
Server cert AKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
   ↓ MUST MATCH
Intermediate SKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
 RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.1 - "MUST be included in all certificates generated by conforming CAs to facilitate certification path construction"What happens if it fails:
Missing AKI → Cannot build certificate chain → Reject
  
  
  ⚠️ CHECK 19: SKI ≠ AKI (Not Self-Signed Detector)
 ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Only applies if both SKI and AKI are present)What you'll see in a good certificate:X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:
    B7:3E:8E:1A:93:0E:2B:86:93:6A:BC:23:5C:55:01:F4:23:6C:45:87

X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
    13:92:C7:15:88:71:4D:F8:F4:32:45:E6:67:8B:A2:1C:65:43:B1:2D

→ B7:3E... ≠ 13:92... ✅ Different! Not self-signed!
Plain English explanation:
If SKI (this cert's key) equals AKI (issuer's key), then certificate is self-signed.For publicly-trusted certificates:SKI and AKI MUST be differentSKI = AKI means self-signed (not allowed)
Since Check 17 (SKI) is RECOMMENDED (not required), this check only applies when BOTH SKI and AKI are present.Self-signed certificate:
  SKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
  AKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
  → Same! Self-signed! ❌

Valid certificate:
  SKI: B7:3E:8E:1A:93:0E...
  AKI: 13:92:C7:15:88:71...
  → Different! Has parent CA ✅
 If both SKI and AKI are present, compare them. If they're equal, it's self-signed (FAIL). If different, it has a separate issuer (PASS). If either is missing, rely on CHECK 15. RFC 5280 logic for self-signed certificatesWhat happens if it fails:
If SKI == AKI → Self-signed certificate → Reject (covered by Check 15)
  
  
  ✅ CHECK 20: Certificate Validity Period ≤ 398 Days
What you'll see in a good certificate:Validity
    Not Before: Dec  1 00:00:00 2025 GMT
    Not After : Feb 28 23:59:59 2026 GMT
→ Duration: 89 days ✅ (under 398 days)
Plain English explanation:
Certificates issued after September 1, 2020 CANNOT be valid for more than 398 days (~13 months).Pre-2015: Up to 5 years allowed2015-2018: Max 39 months (825 days)2018-2020: Max 27 months (825 days)
Sept 2020-Present: Max 398 days (CA/B Forum Ballot SC-081)Longer validity = More risk:

5-year certificate (2015):
- Year 1: RSA-2048 is "safe"
- Year 3: New attacks discovered
- Year 5: RSA-2048 possibly broken
- Problem: Cert still valid! ❌

90-day certificate (2025):
- Renewed every 90 days
- Can upgrade to stronger algorithms
- Can fix validation errors quickly
- Limited exposure window ✅
Today to March 15, 2026: Max 398 days
March 15, 2026: Max 200 days
March 15, 2027: Max 100 days
March 15, 2029: Max 47 days
 Parse the Not Before and Not After dates, calculate the difference in days, and check if it exceeds 398 days.CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC22 (effective September 1, 2020)CA/Browser Forum Ballot SC-081 (approved April 2025, reducing to 47 days by 2029)What happens if it fails:
Certificate validity too long → Browsers reject as non-compliant

This guide is aimed at intermediate developers looking to expand their data engineering skills. We'll cover the essentials of building robust, efficient data pipelines using Python, exploring various techniques for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).Data pipelines are crucial components in the data engineering ecosystem, enabling the automated movement and transformation of data from various sources to destinations for analysis and storage. Crafting custom data pipelines allows for tailored data processing that fits specific project requirements.Basic understanding of Python programming.Familiarity with SQL and database concepts.Knowledge of data structures and basic algorithms.
  
  
  Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
First, ensure your Python environment is ready. Using virtual environments is recommended for project-specific dependencies.Extracting data is the first phase in the ETL process. Here, we'll use Python's  library to fetch data from an API.Once data is extracted, transforming it to fit our needs is next. This might involve cleaning, aggregating, or reshaping data.The final step in the pipeline is loading the transformed data into a destination, like a database.: Build your pipeline in smaller, reusable components.Error handling and logging: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to catch and resolve issues promptly.: Use batch processing and proper data structures to enhance performance.Building custom data pipelines is a valuable skill for any data engineer. This tutorial has introduced the basics of setting up a data pipeline, from extraction to loading. By following best practices and continuously learning, you can create efficient, reliable pipelines for any data-intensive project.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Words to Meaning: Core NLP Concepts Every Beginner Must Know</title><link>https://dev.to/zeroshotanu/from-words-to-meaning-core-nlp-concepts-every-beginner-must-know-3hl3</link><author>Ananya S</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:48:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the previous post, we covered the basics of NLP such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop words.In this continuation, we will understand how machines extract meaning from text and represent language numerically.1. Named Entity Recognition (NER)Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an NLP technique used to identify and classify real-world entities in text.Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and lives in the USA.

Helps extract structured information from unstructured textUsed in resume parsing and document processingWidely applied in medical and legal NLP systemsImproves search engines and chatbotsBag of Words is one of the simplest techniques to convert text into numbers.Only word frequency mattersSentence 1: I love NLP  
Sentence 2: I love AI
Sentence 1 → [1, 1, 1, 0]Sentence 2 → [1, 1, 0, 1]Works well for small datasetsUseful as a baseline modelNo understanding of contextTreats all words as equally important3. TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)TF-IDF improves Bag of Words by assigning importance scores to words.TF(t,d)= Total number of terms in document d/Number of times term t appears in document d

IDF(t)=log( Number of documents containing term t/Total number of documents)
Words that occur frequently in a document are important.Words that occur in many documents are less important.: frequency of a word in a documentInverse Document Frequency (IDF): rarity of the word across documentsWhy TF-IDF is better than BoW:Reduces importance of common words like the and isHighlights meaningful wordsDocument similarity tasksDoes not capture semantic meaningSynonyms are treated as different wordsWord2Vec represents words as dense numerical vectors that capture meaning and context.Words used in similar contexts have similar meanings. The vectors used to represent King, Queen, Man and Woman when undergo arithmetic operations, give results as below.King − Man + Woman ≈ QueenParis − France + Italy ≈ RomeWord2Vec has 2 components:1. CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)Predicts a word using surrounding context.Sentence: "Raj went to school yesterday"
Window size: 1

Input: [Raj, to] → Output: went
Input: [went, school] → Output: to
Input: [to, yesterday] → Output: school

The context words are converted to one-hot vectors.These vectors are summed or averagedThey are passed through the hidden layer.The model predicts the target wordWeights are updated using backpropagationPredicts surrounding words using a target word.
 For same sentence,Target word: went
Context words: Raj, to

Training pairs:
Input: went → Output: Raj
Input: went → Output: to

Target = to
Context words: went, school

Training pairs:
Input: to → Output: went
Input: to → Output: school

Target = school
Context words: to, yesterday

Training pairs:
Input: school → Output: to
Input: school → Output: yesterday

The target word is converted to a one-hot vectorPassed through the hidden layerThe model predicts each context wordWeights are updated using backpropagation👉 The hidden layer weights become the word embeddingsCaptures semantic relationshipsProduces dense and meaningful embeddingsUseful for clustering and similarity tasksSame word has the same vector in all contextsExample: 
bank (river) and bank (money)This limitation is addressed by contextual models like BERT.When to Use Each Technique?Building simple text classifiersCreating baseline NLP modelsWorking on search systemsPerforming document similaritySemantic similarity is importantBuilding recommendation systemsThese techniques show the evolution of NLP from counting words to weighting word importance to understanding semantic meaning.

Today we will create a QR Code Generator from scratch with Python!We will use KivyMD a library that makes python app looks like a modern Android or iOS app using Material Design.QR codes are Quick response code are one of the easiest and fastest way to share any information  with other people, we see Qr codes in most of around us  we see in restaurants, railway tickets, doing payments.It is standard python apps can look a bit “old school”. KivyMD gives us beautiful text fields, buttons, and layouts with very little code.Before we start, we need to install two main tools: for user interface. to create the actual QR patterns.
  
  
  Step 1: Install the Requirements
Run this code in terminal or command promptpip install kivymd qrcode pillow
  
  
  Step 2: Import the Libraries
Create a new file named QRGeneratorApp.py and start by importing the necessary tools.from kivymd.app import MDApp
from kivy.lang import Builder
from kivy.core.image import Image as CoreImage
import qrcodefrom io 
import BytesIOimport os

## Step 3: Design the UI (The KV String)We use the KV Language to design the app. This is a declarative way to build the interface. We need a text field for input, two buttons (Generate and Download), and an image area to show the result.KV = '''
MDScreen:
    md_bg_color: app.theme_cls.bg_light

    MDBoxLayout:
        orientation: 'vertical'
        spacing: "20dp"
        padding: "20dp"
        adaptive_height: True
        pos_hint: {"center_x": .5, "center_y": .5}

        MDLabel:
            text: "QR Code Generator"
            halign: "center"
            font_style: "H4"
            bold: True
            theme_text_color: "Primary"

        MDTextField:
            id: user_input
            hint_text: "Enter URL or Text"
            mode: "outlined"
            size_hint_x: .8
            pos_hint: {"center_x": .5}

        MDBoxLayout:
            orientation: 'horizontal'
            spacing: "10dp"
            adaptive_size: True
            pos_hint: {"center_x": .5}

            MDRaisedButton:
                text: "GENERATE"
                on_release: app.generate_qr(user_input.text)

            MDRaisedButton:
                id: download_btn
                text: "DOWNLOAD"
                md_bg_color: .2, .7, .2, 1 
                disabled: True 
                on_release: app.download_qr()

        Image:
            id: qr_display
            size_hint: None, None
            size: "250dp", "250dp"
            pos_hint: {"center_x": .5}
'''


Step 4: Create the App LogicTo reuse the button clicks, we'll have to make a class in Python that will allow the stoner to perform certain tasks through buttons and will interact with the illustration operation we are erecting, which utilizes the Kivy Framework to give a means for druggies to produce QR canons from their entries. Once a stoner clicks the Generate button, Kivy will take the textbook that was written in the Text Input contrivance and produce QR law( s). Kivy will also give the druggies with QR canons via the illustration operation's GUI.The button labeled Download will not change color until at least one QR code has been generated through the click of the Generate button. Once QR code(s) have been created by clicking the Generate button one or more times the Download button will allow users to save the QR code generated(s) in PNG format to their current working folder.class QRGeneratorApp(MDApp):
    current_qr_img = None  # To store the image in memory

    def build(self):
        self.theme_cls.primary_palette = "DeepPurple"
        return Builder.load_string(KV)

    def generate_qr(self, data):
        if not data.strip():
            return

        # 1. Create the QR object
        qr = qrcode.QRCode(version=1, box_size=10, border=2)
        qr.add_data(data)
        qr.make(fit=True)

        # 2. Store as PIL image
        self.current_qr_img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")

        # 3. Convert to Kivy Texture for the UI
        buffer = BytesIO()
        self.current_qr_img.save(buffer, format='PNG')
        buffer.seek(0)
        core_img = CoreImage(buffer, ext='png')
        self.root.ids.qr_display.texture = core_img.texture

        # 4. Enable Download Button
        self.root.ids.download_btn.disabled = False

    def download_qr(self):
        if self.current_qr_img:
            file_name = "my_qr_code.png"
            self.current_qr_img.save(file_name)
            print(f"Saved successfully as {file_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    QRGeneratorApp().run()



Just type in a web address like https// google.com, hit Generate, and your QR law pops up! also, click Download to save it and use it still you want. Easy peasy!
Here is the full script. Save this as QRGeneratorApp.py and run it!from kivymd.app import MDApp

Telegram: @Pvafarmusapvafarmusa@gmail.comBenefits Of Buying A Youtube Channel
Have you ever wondered why some influencers seem to “pop up” out of nowhere with massive followings? Often, the secret is acquiring a pre-existing channel. This shortcut transforms your digital journey from a slow crawl into a high-speed race. Let’s look at the specific advantages:Instant Audience 
The hardest part of YouTube is getting those first 1,000 subscribers. When you buy a channel, that community is already there. You start with a “warm” audience rather than a cold start.Enhanced Credibility 
Social proof is everything. A channel with thousands of subscribers looks like an authority. New viewers are far more likely to click “Subscribe” if they see that others have already done so.Monetization Opportunities 
Getting approved for the YouTube Partner Program requires 4,000 watch hours and 1,000 subscribers. Purchasing an established channel can put you on the fast track to earning ad revenue from day one.Algorithm Advantage 
The YouTube algorithm likes history. An older, active channel is often treated better by the recommendation engine than a brand-new account with no data.Content Testing 
With an existing audience, you get immediate data. You can A/B test different video styles and get feedback in hours instead of weeks, allowing you to pivot your strategy with precision.Networking and Collaborations 
Big creators rarely collaborate with “zero-sub” channels. An established subscriber count acts as your resume, opening doors to partnerships and sponsorships that would otherwise be closed.Time and Effort Savings 
Time is your most valuable asset. By skipping the grind of the first 12 months of channel growth, you can dedicate your energy to high-quality production and business scaling.Is Buying a YouTube Channel Legal?
Legally speaking, there are no laws prohibiting the sale of a social media account. However, it is important to be transparent: this practice often goes against YouTube’s specific Terms of Service regarding account transfers. If the platform detects a suspicious change in ownership, there is a risk of the channel being flagged.Buy Youtube Channel

An established channel has “weight” in search results. Your new uploads are more likely to appear in the “Suggested Videos” section because the channel already has a relationship with the algorithm.Instant Audience Base
You are stepping onto a stage that already has an audience in the seats. This immediate feedback loop is vital for staying motivated as a creator.Increased Interaction
A channel with a history of likes and comments encourages new viewers to join the conversation. Engagement breeds more engagement.Enhanced Brand Image
A “Verified” look or a high subscriber count tells the world you are a serious professional. This makes it much easier to attract high-paying sponsors.Evaluating Channel Quality
Before you buy, it’s important to know what makes a channel “good.” At Pvafarmusa, we encourage our clients to look at these metrics:Channel Age
Older accounts are generally more “trusted” by YouTube and are less likely to face sudden shadowbans.Engagement Rate
A channel with 10,000 subscribers is great, but a channel where those subscribers actually comment and like is even better.Subscriber Authenticity
We focus on organic-looking growth patterns to ensure the channel remains healthy in the eyes of the platform.Niche Relevance
Try to buy a channel that matches your intended content. This ensures the existing audience stays interested in what you post.Content Quality
We look at the history of the channel to ensure it hasn’t been used for spam, which protects your future reputation.Channel Reputation
We verify that the channels are free of active strikes or copyright warnings.Security Measures And Safety
Your safety is our priority. We implement several layers of protection to ensure a smooth transfer.Encryption And Secure Transactions

We constantly update our methods to stay in line with the latest security protocols from Google and YouTube.Legal Considerations
While it is a standard business practice to buy and sell digital assets, you should always be aware of the “rules of the road.”Legal Ownership And Rights
We ensure that the “chain of custody” for the channel is clear, giving you full control over the asset once the transaction is complete.Platform Terms And Conditions
While buying a channel is a shortcut, it’s important to play by YouTube’s community guidelines moving forward to keep the account in good standing.Protection Against Fraud
By using an established provider like us, you avoid the “wild west” of private forums where scams are common.Tax Implications
Depending on your country, a YouTube channel can be considered a business asset. We recommend keeping records of your purchase for your accounting.Privacy And Data Security
We ensure that all previous owner data is wiped and that you have a “clean slate” to start your brand.Contractual Obligations
Our terms of service act as a clear agreement, protecting both the buyer and the seller during the hand-over.Customizing Your New Channel
Once you have the keys, it’s time to make it yours. Customization is where the transformation happens.Creating A Captivating Channel Name
Choose a name that is easy to spell and fits your brand’s personality.Designing An Eye-catching Channel Banner
Use a high-resolution banner to tell viewers exactly what your channel is about at a glance.Crafting A Compelling Channel Description
Use your “About” section to include keywords that help you show up in Google and YouTube searches.Selecting The Perfect Profile Picture
A high-quality logo or a friendly headshot helps viewers build a personal connection with you.Organizing Your Content With Playlists
Playlists keep viewers on your channel longer, which the algorithm loves.Personalizing Video Thumbnails
Consistency is key. Develop a “style” for your thumbnails so fans recognize your videos instantly.Engaging Your Audience With Community Posts
Use the Community Tab to run polls and talk to your subscribers between video uploads.Setting Up Custom Url
A clean URL (youtube.com/c/YourBrand) is essential for marketing and business cards.Optimizing Channel Keywords
Hidden tags in your channel settings help YouTube categorize your content and show it to the right people.Strategies For Instant Engagement
Buying the channel is the foundation; engagement is the house you build on top of it.Craft Catchy Thumbnails
The thumbnail is your “hook.” If they don’t click, they don’t watch.Engage With Comments
The more you talk to your fans, the more loyal they become. Spend 30 minutes a day replying to your audience.Optimize Video Titles And Descriptions
Think like a search engine. What would a user type to find your video?Leverage Playlists
Encourage “binge-watching” by grouping your best videos together.Host Live Sessions
Live streaming builds a level of trust and “realness” that pre-recorded videos can’t match.Managing Audience Expectations
When you take over a channel, the audience might be surprised. Communication is the best way to keep them.Understanding Your Audience
Look at the “Analytics” tab to see the age, gender, and location of your viewers.Communicating Effectively
Make an “Introduction” video. Tell the audience who you are and what the new vision for the channel is.Delivering Consistent Content
If you promise a video every Tuesday, deliver a video every Tuesday. Reliability builds trust.Incorporating Audience Feedback
Ask your viewers what they want to see. When they feel heard, they stay.Adjusting Based On Analytics
If a certain type of video is getting more “Watch Time,” make more of that content!Monetization Opportunities
A YouTube channel is a business. Here are the ways your new purchase can pay for itself:Ad Revenue
Once you are in the Partner Program, YouTube pays you a share of the revenue from every ad shown.Sponsorship Deals
Companies will pay you to mention their products. This is often more lucrative than ad revenue.Merchandise Sales
Sell t-shirts, mugs, or digital products directly to your loyal fanbase.Memberships And Donations
Fans can pay a monthly fee for “exclusive” badges or shoutouts during your videos.Case Studies Of Success
Real people are using this strategy every day to change their lives.John’s Journey From Zero To Hero
John bought a tech channel and pivoted it to AI reviews. Because the channel already had “authority,” his first video got 50,000 views.Susan’s Strategy: Turning A Passion Into Profit
Susan bought a cooking channel. She used the existing 5,000 subscribers to launch her own cookbook, making her investment back in one week.Mike’s Marketing Mastery
Mike used a purchased channel to drive traffic to his Shopify store, seeing a 300% increase in sales compared to paid Facebook ads.The Impact On Brand Visibility
Corporations use our channels to launch new products, ensuring they don’t look like a “small” company when they enter the market.Future Trends In Youtube Growth

 Data Collection and Merging
 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 Exploratory Data AnalysisAverage Rating by Wine TypeTop Countries by Average RatingBest Value for Money WinesWine is more than just a beverage — it is a global market with diverse varieties, prices, and qualities. For millions of consumers, choosing the right wine can be overwhelming: should they pay more for a reputed brand, or are there hidden gems that offer great quality at an affordable price?In the digital age, online wine marketplaces like Vivino provide access to extensive wine data, including ratings, reviews, prices, and origins. Leveraging this data with data science techniques can help both businesses and consumers make smarter decisions.In this project, we aim to explore the wine market using a dataset of over 12,000 wines across red, white, and rose varieties. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between price and quality, identify value-for-money wines, and analyze how features like wine type, country, and vintage influence ratings.Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, this project demonstrates how data science can transform raw wine data into actionable insights for businesses, helping them recommend wines effectively and optimize pricing strategies.To get a complete view of the wine market, we combined three separate datasets for red, white, and rose wines into a single, unified dataset. Each entry includes essential information about the wine, such as its name, country of origin, region, winery, rating, number of reviews, price, vintage year, and type, providing a rich foundation for analysis and insights.Before diving into the analysis, we carefully prepared the dataset to ensure its quality. Numeric columns like Rating, Price, and Year were correctly formatted, while categorical columns such as Type and Country were standardized. Missing or invalid values were addressed, duplicates were removed, and outliers—especially in the Price column, where a few luxury wines created a skewed distribution—were carefully handled to ensure a clean and reliable dataset for exploration.This tells us how wines are rated overall.The analysis shows that most wines receive relatively high ratings, with a median of 3.9, indicating overall good quality. Very few wines are poorly rated, as reflected by the minimum rating of 2.5. Overall, ratings are concentrated between 3.7 and 4.1, demonstrating a consistent level of high quality with low variability across the dataset.Since price is right-skewed, it’s better to plot log scale as well.The majority of wines are affordable, with a median price of approximately $16. A small number of very expensive wines create a right-skewed distribution, stretching the upper end of the price range while most wines remain in the accessible price segment.Are expensive wines really higher rated?
Do cheap wines also have high ratings?Optional: Add correlation coefficient:Examining the relationship between price and rating revealed a moderate correlation of 0.44, suggesting that while higher-priced wines tend to have slightly higher ratings, price alone does not guarantee quality.
  
  
  Average Rating by Wine Type
By comparing red, white, and rose wines, we can identify which type tends to receive higher ratings. The analysis shows that red wines have slightly higher average ratings than both white and rose varieties, suggesting a small but consistent preference for reds among consumers.
  
  
  Top Countries by Average Rating
The graph shows: Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia at the top, it means wines from these countries have the highest average ratings in our dataset.
Before trusting this result, we must check how many wines come from these countries : -If a country has only < 20  wines → average is unreliable
-If it has 200 wines → very reliable
This is called sample size bias.Although Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia show high average ratings, their limited sample sizes suggest that these results should be interpreted with caution.Although Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia display the highest average ratings, each country is represented by fewer than 20 wines in the dataset. As a result, these averages are likely influenced by small sample bias and should be interpreted with caution. To ensure reliable conclusions, we focused our analysis on countries with a sufficient number of observationsThis graph illustrates the evolution of the average wine rating over time by showing how ratings vary across different vintage years. It helps to evaluate whether the vintage has a significant influence on perceived quality. If an upward trend is observed, it suggests that newer wines tend to receive higher ratings, possibly due to improvements in production techniques or changing consumer preferences. Conversely, fluctuations or stable patterns indicate that vintage alone is not sufficient to determine quality. Overall, this analysis highlights the role of the production year as a secondary factor in wine evaluation, complementing other important variables such as price and origin.
  
  
  Best Value for Money Wines
This part identifies the best value-for-money wines in the dataset by selecting bottles that combine high quality with affordable prices.More specifically, it filters the data to keep only wines that have a rating of at least 4.3 (highly appreciated by users) and a price of 20 or less (considered relatively inexpensive). It then sorts these wines by rating in descending order and displays the top 10 highest-rated affordable wines.This analysis highlights wines that offer an excellent quality–price ratio, which can be used to support recommendations, help users discover hidden gems, and guide business strategies focused on promoting high-value products.The analysis reveals that most wines have ratings concentrated around 4, indicating generally good quality. Wine prices show a right-skewed distribution, with the majority being affordable and a few luxury wines driving up the high end. While there is a moderate correlation between price and rating, a higher price does not always guarantee better quality. Red wines tend to slightly outperform white and rose varieties, and certain countries consistently produce higher-rated wines. Vintage year appears to have only a minor effect on ratings. Finally, several value-for-money wines stand out, providing actionable insights for recommendations and business strategy.For our predictive modeling, the target variable is the wine Rating, which represents the score given by users. The features used to predict this rating include Price, Vintage Year, Country of Origin, and Type of wine (red, white, or rose). These variables capture both the economic and qualitative aspects of the wine, allowing the model to learn patterns that influence user preferences and perceived quality.To prepare the data for modeling, we first split it into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio, ensuring the model can be evaluated on unseen data. The numerical features (Price and Year) were standardized using a scaler, while categorical features (Country and Type) were encoded with one-hot encoding to convert them into a machine-readable format. These preprocessing steps were combined into a ColumnTransformer pipeline, which ensures that all data is properly transformed before being fed into the predictive model.The Random Forest model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.161, indicating that on average, the predicted wine ratings deviate by approximately 0.16 points from the actual ratings on the rating scale. The R² score of 0.511 shows that the model explains about 51% of the variance in wine ratings. This suggests that while the model captures a significant portion of the factors influencing ratings—particularly price and vintage year—there remains some variability that is not accounted for, likely due to other qualitative factors such as taste preferences, winery reputation, or unobserved characteristics. Overall, the model provides a reasonable predictive performance for guiding value-based wine recommendations and pricing strategies.Accurate Rating Predictions: The model can estimate a wine’s rating based on its price, country, type, and vintage year. This is useful for recommending wines that users are likely to enjoy, even when a wine has few existing reviews.Price-Quality Relationship: While price does influence the rating to some extent, the model demonstrates that other factors—such as country, type, and year—also play a significant role in predicting quality.Business Impact: Vivino can leverage this model to highlight “value-for-money” wines, identify underrated wines, and optimize strategic pricing to better guide consumers.To make this report even more insightful, we can examine which variables have the greatest influence on wine ratings. By analyzing feature importance from the trained Random Forest model, we can identify the key drivers behind the predictions and better understand how factors like price, country, type, and vintage year contribute to perceived wine quality.A horizontal bar plot with:Y-axis → feature names (Price, Year, Country_…, etc.)X-axis → importance values (ranging from 0 to 1)The Price feature should visually dominate the chart.This produces a clear and easily readable graph, eliminating the need for a table.Price is the dominant factor, accounting for approximately 78% of the variation in wine ratings. As expected, higher-priced wines tend to receive slightly higher ratings, though this is not always guaranteed. Vintage year is the second most important factor, contributing around 7.6% to the rating prediction. Both older and more recent vintages can subtly influence perceived quality. In contrast, the impact of country of origin and wine type (red or white) is relatively minor, each contributing roughly 1% individually. This confirms that price and year are the primary drivers of wine ratings, while categorical features such as country and type can still help fine-tune recommendations. From a business perspective, Vivino can leverage these insights to highlight wines that offer the best value for money, enabling the platform to recommend wines based on perceived quality rather than relying solely on raw ratings.This project successfully explored the relationship between wine price, quality, and origin using data science techniques. By combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, we were able to identify the key factors that influence wine ratings.The Random Forest model demonstrated that price and vintage year are the strongest predictors of wine quality, while country of origin and type play a smaller but meaningful role. The model’s performance, with an MAE of 0.16 and R² of 0.51, shows it can reasonably predict wine ratings, providing valuable guidance for wine recommendations.From a business perspective, these insights empower Vivino to highlight value-for-money wines, identify underrated wines, and optimize pricing strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.Overall, this project illustrates how leveraging large wine datasets and machine learning can transform raw data into actionable insights, supporting smarter decisions for both businesses and consumers. Future work could incorporate additional features, such as tasting notes, winery reputation, or user reviews, to further improve the predictive performance and recommendation quality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧠 Ensemble_Strategy</title><link>https://dev.to/stklen/ensemblestrategy-4mde</link><author>TK Lin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Washin Village AI Director Tech Notes #4Just like human teamwork,  makes multiple AI models work together, combining their judgments for more accurate results.: Two heads are better than one.

It’s powerful, but it can also feel a bit opaque; tasks run in processes or threads, async support isn’t native, and integrating it tightly with custom frameworks can get tricky.On top of that, using Celery usually means you have to:Run a separate worker service just to execute tasks.Start a separate Flower service if you want to monitor them.No separate worker service needed: tasks are executed directly by the scheduler/worker integration, reducing setup complexity.Async-native: built around Python’s asyncio for truly non-blocking, I/O-heavy tasks.Pluggable result backends: currently supports In-Memory and Redis, but swapping or adding new backends is straightforward.Built-in UI / framework integration: monitor tasks, view results, and integrate directly with your framework without starting a separate service.Transparent lifecycle: every task’s state is explicit — perfect for debugging and learning.For developers exploring async workloads or wanting a simple, understandable task system, Flowrra could be a more natural fit than Celery.Building Flowrra wasn’t just about writing code; it was a deep dive into distributed systems and Python concurrency: Understanding how tasks are scheduled, executed, and their results stored. Learning the subtle complexities of retries, state management, and task lifecycles. Every line of code taught me something I could never fully grasp just by reading docs or tutorials.Flowrra is still early-stage. Next steps include:Expanding backend optionsEnhancing the built-in UI for better monitoringTesting distributed task execution scalabilityTesting multiple scheduler instances' scalabilityIt’s exciting to see something that started as a curiosity turn into a working system.Flowrra is fully open-source.

Writing Python instead of SQL. Clean code. No more complex INSERT statements.But how do I actually use it in my Scrapy spiders?I tried adding ORM to my pipeline. It crashed. Session errors. Connection problems. Duplicate key errors. I had no idea how to integrate ORM properly with Scrapy.After hours of trial and error, I figured it out. Now my spiders save data with clean Python code, handle relationships automatically, and update existing records seamlessly.Let me show you how to use ORM with Scrapy the right way.In this guide, we'll create:Scrapes products from an e-commerce siteScrapes reviews for each productSaves everything to database using ORMHandles product-review relationships automaticallyUpdates existing products (no duplicates)All with clean Python code (no SQL!)No messy SQL. Just Python objects.
  
  
  Step 1: Install Dependencies
pip scrapy sqlalchemy

  
  
  Step 2: Create Scrapy Project
scrapy startproject ecommerce
ecommerce

  
  
  Step 3: Project Structure
ecommerce/
├── scrapy.cfg
├── ecommerce/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── models.py          # NEW: ORM models
│   ├── pipelines.py       # ORM pipeline
│   ├── items.py
│   └── spiders/
│       └── products.py

  
  
  Step 1: Define ORM Models
Create  with our database models:Defines Product table (stores product info)Defines Review table (stores reviews)Creates relationship (one product has many reviews)Provides helper functions for setup
  
  
  Step 2: Define Scrapy Items

  
  
  Step 3: Create ORM Pipeline
Creates database connection on spider startHandles both products and reviewsUpdates existing products (no duplicates!)Links reviews to products automaticallyLogs statistics when spider closesHandles errors gracefully
  
  
  Step 5: Configure Settings
Spider scrapes product pagesFor each product, yields ProductItemPipeline saves product to database (or updates if exists)Spider scrapes reviews for that productYields ReviewItem for each reviewPipeline saves reviews (linked to product automatically!) All handled by ORM.After scraping, query your data:Access reviews: Access product: Relationships handled automatically!
  
  
  Advanced: Batch Processing
For better performance, save items in batches:Batch processing benefits:More efficient (fewer database operations)Better for large scraping jobs
  
  
  Using PostgreSQL Instead of SQLite
For production, use PostgreSQL:
  
  
  Step 1: Install PostgreSQL Driver
pip psycopg2-binary

  
  
  Step 3: Create PostgreSQL Database

psql  postgres

CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db
CREATE USER scrapy_user WITH PASSWORD 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ecommerce_db TO scrapy_user
  
  
  Step 4: Update settings.py

  
  
  Step 5: Pass URL to Pipeline
That's it! Now using PostgreSQL with ORM.
  
  
  Handling Multiple Spiders
For distributed crawling, use connection pooling:Multiple spiders share connection poolHandles concurrent access properly
  
  
  Common Issues and Solutions

  
  
  Issue 1: "Table already exists"
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: table products already exists

Use  only once, or check if tables exist:
Always create new session for each spider:
  
  
  Issue 3: Duplicate Key Errors
UNIQUE constraint failed: products.url

Check if product exists before inserting:
  
  
  Issue 4: Relationship Not Working
 returns empty list even though reviews exist.
Make sure product_id is set correctly:
  
  
  1. Always Use Transactions

  
  
  2. Close Sessions Properly

I spent weeks diving into image inpainting technology, and here's what I learned about removing watermarks, objects, and imperfections from images.The Problem with Traditional Approaches
If you've ever used Photoshop's Clone Stamp or Healing Brush, you know the pain:Carefully paint over targetCry
Even Content-Aware Fill, while better, often produces weird artifacts — duplicating elements that shouldn't be there or creating unnatural patterns.Enter AI Inpainting
Modern inpainting uses neural networks trained on millions of images to understand:Context — What should logically be in the masked area
Texture — How to match surrounding patterns
Semantics — Whether it's filling sky, grass, fabric, or skin
The key insight: instead of copying pixels from nearby areas (clone stamp), AI generates new pixels that make contextual sense.The Technical Architecture
Most state-of-the-art inpainting models follow this pattern:Input Image + Binary Mask
        ↓
   Encoder (extract features)
        ↓
   Attention Layers (understand context)
        ↓
   Decoder (generate pixels)
        ↓
Popular approaches include:LaMa (Large Mask Inpainting) — Great for big areas
Stable Diffusion Inpainting — Uses diffusion models
MAT (Mask-Aware Transformer) — Transformer-based
What I Built (and What I Learned)
I've been working on an image processing tool that uses AI inpainting for watermark removal. Here's what surprised me:Mask Quality Matters More Than Model Size
A precise mask with a smaller model beats a sloppy mask with SOTA models. The mask tells the AI exactly what to regenerate.AI-Generated Images Are Easier to Fix
Ironic, right? Images from Midjourney, DALL-E, Gemini, and other AI tools have consistent synthetic textures that inpainting models understand well.Processing Time is Constant-ish
Unlike traditional methods where complex watermarks take longer, AI processing is roughly the same regardless of content complexity. Most images process in 2-3 seconds.Upload image
Brush over watermark (creates binary mask)
AI generates replacement pixels
Download resultStock photo watermarks
AI-generated image logos (Gemini, Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
Corner badges
Code Snippet: Basic Inpainting Pipeline
If you want to experiment yourself, here's a minimal Python example using a pre-trained model:from transformers import pipelineinpainter = pipeline("image-to-image", model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting")
def remove_watermark(image, mask):
    image: PIL Image with watermark
    mask: Binary PIL Image (white = area to inpaint)
    """
        prompt="clean background, no text",
        mask_image=mask,
    )
For production use, you'd want:GPU acceleration
Proper image preprocessing
Edge blending post-processing
Batch processing support
Testing on 100 random watermarked images:Method  Avg Time    Quality (1-10)
Manual (Photoshop)  8 min   9
Content-Aware Fill  3 sec   6
AI Inpainting   2.5 sec 8.5
AI inpainting hits the sweet spot: near-manual quality at near-instant speed.Limitations to Know
AI inpainting isn't magic. It struggles with:Large masked areas (>40% of image) — Not enough context to work with
Faces and text — Can hallucinate weird results
Precise reconstruction — If you need exact details, manual is still better
What's Next
The field is moving fast. Recent developments:Segment Anything + Inpainting — Auto-detect watermarks, no manual masking
Video inpainting — Remove watermarks from video frames consistently
Real-time processing — Mobile-friendly speeds
I'm particularly excited about automatic watermark detection. Imagine: upload image → AI finds watermarks → removes them → done.Try It Out
If you want to see AI inpainting in action without setting up your own pipeline:Free credits on signup. No GPU required on your end.Have you worked with inpainting models?

Buy LinkedIn Account: A Professional Network Access Review
You need a professional LinkedIn profile for just about anything in business. A share of individuals and companies may take a shortcut. That’s why they prefer to buy LinkedIn accounts for networking or marketing purposes. This approach implies substantial trade-offs between speed and security. The market for such accounts is murky and largely unregulated. Potential buyers have a landscape to cross that is strewn with opportunity and risk.
This analysis is particularly relevant to the market of buying LinkedIn accounts. We examine the reasons and risks involved with this request. We also provide an objective review of service providers. We seek to provide a complete picture for informed decision-making. Knowledge about this practice is vital. Publications like this help keep practitioners out of trouble while also steering them clear of hit-or-miss stumblings into unexamined terrain. The information contained is the result of market research.
Looking forward to hiring LinkedIn Profiles
Why buy LinkedIn account services now? The reasons behind buying LinkedIn account services are even more specific. Lead gen or sales outreach cos are typically the driver of this demand. They need points of exposure. Older accounts get around the new account restrictions on LinkedIn. ¡¨ These limitations mean that I’m restricted in the number of invitations and messages I can send. The demand gives rise to a supply of different types of accounts. The seller could be an individual or an impersonal digital marketing entity.
New accounts have instant activity constraints. This slows down the work of business development. An old account looks more credible. It includes the form, more connections, and some historical activities. This perceived actuality contributes to the acceptance of messages. Large-scale marketers also buy accounts to enhance their efficiency at the top of the market. They control numerous profiles and large campaigns. This approach is designed to pump volume for outreach and lead gen.
Comparison of US Service Providers
Many US websites provide the service. Their products differ in age, connections, performance characteristics, and features. The following table provides an overall glimpse of the frequent specifications in the best platforms. Discreet online storefronts frequently facilitate services from these providers. They also organize accounts by age and network strength. The buyers may choose such profiles for the ad campaignsö according to their campaign needs.
Provider Feature    Account Age (Months)    Connection Range    Common Inclusions
Basic Account   1-6 0-50    Profile setup, basic info
Established Account 7-24    51-500  Some endorsements, past posts
Premium Account 25+ 501+    Recommendations, full activity history
There’s a wide variation in service levels from providers. A few even lock down their accounts for a specific time period. Others don’t provide any guarantee once the sale is made. Payment methods also vary. They often accept PayPal, cryptocurrency, and credit cards. The crypto adds an anonymous layer for both the buyer and seller. This complicates the transaction process even further.
Primary Motivations for Account Acquisition
Businesses give several reasons for buying pre-made accounts. The number one reason given is faster deployment. It would take a lot of time to organically build your network. Account on sale supplies you with instantaneous access to a network. This is especially important for near-term marketing. So the salespeople need weapons at hand to go for a more comprehensive program. They cannot wait months for an account to grow ripe.
B2B salespeople target these accounts for cold outreach. If you have an aged profile, the acceptance rate will be higher. By doing this, it raises the chance of lead conversion. They are also employed by some social media management agencies. From a single platform, they handle various client profiles. This makes social selling strategies scalable. It even differentiates the personal and professional relationship-building tasks.
Overcoming Initial Platform Barriers
LinkedIn has algorithms that are tasked with keeping a close eye on new account behavior. No need to rush, as a sudden spike of requests may cause throttling. The older the account, the higher the trust it has. They let you get more aggressive in your networking. This is relevant for anyone in sales. Their KPIs are built around reaching out in high volume. New users will have daily invitation and message limits.
Established accounts have fewer restrictions. This allows for proactive, rather than reactive, engagement strategies. Companies market leverage this to do concurrent campaigns. They manage a bunch of accounts directed toward various industries. It’s a strategy that allows them to spread out the way they are generating leads. This also decreases the chance of a single account getting banned. These use cases are scrutinized by the Pvaseshop team daily.Significant Risks and Potential Consequences
You cannot buy an account according to LinkedIn’s User Agreement. This also applies to section 8.2 Selling or transferring access is strictly forbidden. The service uses advanced detection mechanisms. These compare behavior, login locations and device fingerprints. Permanent suspension due to erratic activity is also a typical result. If you lose an account, you’ve lost all that effort and connection.
That is not a compliment; that means I wouldn’t trust us with their data, and I certainly would never trust your data. The owner of the original account may still have recovery data on file. After you have put time into the account, they might try to take it back. The history of the account might even involve unknown transgressions. This presents a risk to the new owner. The original owner may have been a spammer. It could permanently sully the Profile’s reputation.
Security and Legal Implications
There are risks of using a paid account. You have no record of the past activities of this Profile. Someone could have used it for spam or scams. It tarnishes your professional reputation by association. Others also have negative implications under the realm of false pretense. Using a fictitious identity on an account for business purposes could hold legal liabilities.
It May Violate Truthful Advertising Laws And Commercial Practices. The PVASEOSHOP blog offers detailed posts about digital compliance. We recommend these resources before you decide. Misrepresentation can open them up to legal action from clients or business partners. It’s not conducive to trust in professional relationships. The long-term brand damage may be anything but worth it.
Financial and Operational Risks
There is a direct financial loss in a banned account. You lose the price you paid for it and any associated assets. There can be an even greater cost: operational disruption. Marketing campaigns come to a screeching halt. Sales pipelines that relied on that account become useless. If you ever get banned, they ban absolutely everything. It has affected business earnings. These loss of momentum, i.e., business revenue, also leads to crime..
It’s an awful lot of time and effort to rebuild a network. And the actual costs of such ads are usually more than the original purchase price. Most businesses overlook these potential losses. They see only the short-term advantages. An intelligent risk assessment is necessary. At Pvaseoshop, this assessment is mandatory for all of our digital products.
Evaluating Service Provider Credibility
Note that not all companies in the segment have this capability at this level. Others employ automated bots to form complex networks of fake profiles. These are detected and banned quickly. Others employ manual creation methods. Such accounts generally do (last longer). Key signs of a trusted provider are no-nonsense replacement guarantees. They must provide transparent policies concerning account sourcing.
Find platforms that provide excellent customer support. Transparent disclosure of account sourcing is also crucial. Clear terms of service are essential. Pvaseoshop recommends thorough due diligence. And always look for verified/unbiased user ratings and reviews. Steer clear of providers without a web presence beyond a sales page.
Account Specifications and Feature Analysis
The usefulness of the account depends on the feature set bundled with it. Basic accounts don’t offer much beyond a verified email. Premium accounts feature full work history and references. Below is a table detailing the majority of core attributes and their real-world values. This analysis aids customers in comparing sourcing options.
Account Feature Practical Utility   Longevity Factor
Profile Photo & Banner  Increases profile view credibility  Low
Work History & Education    Adds depth and context to the profile   Medium
Skill Endorsements  Provides social proof of capabilities   High
Written Recommendations Significantly boosts profile authority  High
Previous Content Posts  Shows a history of engagement   Medium
Follower Count  Indicates influence and reach   High
All the details make the account as a whole more believable. Accounts that get recommended and endorsed do better. They sound and look more natural to both machines and people. These improvements are not the result of any sourcing. “Stylish” (non-organic) characteristics have a longer life than “artificially induced” ones.
Best Practices for the Safe Handling of Procured Accounts
If you decide to make a purchase, some strategies can minimize the risk. Change the password and email to that account asap, obviously. And update your recovery phone number and security questions. Simplify the modification of the Profile details over a few days. Don’t implement turnaround tactics in one go. Suddenly, complete overhauls appear suspicious.
Mimic organic user behavior. Begin the process: Looking at each other’s profiles and consuming content. Ease into requesting connections and sending messages. Do not post links or promote anything. This timing method ensures the account looks natural to LinkedIn’s systems. It decreases the likelihood of flags and reviews made by bots.
Maintaining Account Longevity
How long you will keep your account depends on regular, non-crazy activity. Log in from a single geographic location and device. Do not use VPNs or proxies that change your IP address often. Like and comment on your network’s content. Flag immunity is mainly achieved through regular, legitimate activity.
Develop a consistent posting schedule. Share industry-relevant articles and insights. Join groups that pertain to the industry/area in which the Profile is located. This is in line with the legitimate users. It is a consistent history of the actions you perform. This keeps the account usable for quite a bit longer.
Integration into Business Workflows
Introduce the account gently into your business life. Don’t rely on it for the main face of your major client relationships. It’s more effective for initial outreach and lead generation. But you can still use it when scheduling meetings for one main account. This tiered method limits the damage to reputations.
Train staff in the correct manner of use. Record any process in account management. Set communication style and frequency expectations. Keep an eye on your account stats to watch for any signs of something being off. Such organized management will limit operational risks. It also increases the ROI.
Ethical Alternatives to Account Purchase
The LinkedIn profile constructed from scratch is still the safest way. It creates an authentic professional narrative. And you can speed up the process with a targeted plan. Make good use of relevant keywords on your Profile. Engage consistently with industry-specific content. This creates a network for life.
Then, join and engage in the relevant LinkedIn groups. Leverage the built-in content tools and networking features that LinkedIn provides. Think about purchasing LinkedIn Sales Navigator for more sophisticated lead generation. These are the techniques that lead to a hardy, long-term professional network. They sharpen your actual professional skills and knowledge, too.
Strategic Organic Growth Methods
An organic approach to strategic growth pays off. Publish useful stuff three times a week minimum. It sets you up as an authority and brings in followers. Jot a short note on all of your connection requests so that they aren’t generic. This dramatically improves acceptance rates. It’s a fabric of deep connections.
Reach out to the influencers in your sector. Comment on their posts in a meaningful way to become more visible. Use LinkedIn Articles to show expertise. These strategies create an extensive network without policy infringement. The Pvaseoshop knowledge base provides organic growth strategies that work. These methods offer lasting value.
Leveraging LinkedIn’s Native Advertising
LinkedIn Ads for instantaneous professional outreach. They also provide highly targeted job titles, company size and industry. And direct your message with Sponsored Content and Message Ads. This approach doesn’t violate any platform TOS. It’s also scalable to your budget.
Marketing has proven ROI and so much analytics. You have access to key decision makers without the network limitations. It increases brand recognition and generates leads. This method typically provides better results when compared to paid accounts. It also has no chance of getting my account suspended or tarnishing my reputation.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can you buy a LinkedIn account legally?
Buying the LinkedIn account is not a criminal offense, though. But it violates LinkedIn’s User Agreement. Such a violation may lead to the suspension of an account without appeal. The misrepresentation and its legal implications. The practice itself involves misrepresentation, which can be addressed legally.
How much do these accounts generally range for?
Prices vary based on account age and the number of features. Basic accounts can run $30 to $60. Accounts with established profiles cost between $80 and $200. Recommended significantly aged accounts that can be over $300. Due to specialized targeting value, Niche Industry profiles frequently carry a premium cost.
Can LinkedIn tell if you purchased an account?
Yes, LinkedIn has security measures in place to identify abnormal activity. Irregular login locations, abrupt modifications to profile sections, or repetitive non-organic development systems are often red flags that trigger a review, processing, and account suspension. Behavioral algorithms assess hundreds of data points for anomalies.
What if I get my bought account banned?
In the event LinkedIn shuts down your account, you’re shut out for good. All relations, contents or data linked to that Profile will be destroyed. There is a limited replacement guarantee, but that does not restore lost time and network connectivity. Continued violations may result in hardware or IP bans.
What are some secure ways to purchase LinkedIn accounts?
There is neither a totally safe nor approved way. The deal is obviously against the platform policy. All CCS get banned. The easiest way is to have a profile that’s under your constant development. This approach builds your genuine professional reputation and network.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Create Callable Instances With Python&apos;s .__call__()</title><link>https://realpython.com/courses/create-callable-instances-dunder-call/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Python, a  is any object that you can call using a pair of parentheses and, optionally, a series of arguments.

It’s powerful, but it can also feel a bit opaque; tasks run in processes or threads, async support isn’t native, and integrating it tightly with custom frameworks can get tricky.On top of that, using Celery usually means you have to:Run a separate worker service just to execute tasks.Start a separate Flower service if you want to monitor them.No separate worker service needed: tasks are executed directly by the scheduler/worker integration, reducing setup complexity.Async-native: built around Python’s asyncio for truly non-blocking, I/O-heavy tasks.Pluggable result backends: Redis now, but swapping or adding new backends is straightforward.Built-in UI / framework integration: monitor tasks, view results, and integrate directly with your framework without starting a separate service.Transparent lifecycle: every task’s state is explicit — perfect for debugging and learning.For developers exploring async workloads or wanting a simple, understandable task system, Flowrra could be a more natural fit than Celery.Building Flowrra wasn’t just about writing code; it was a deep dive into distributed systems and Python concurrency: Understanding how tasks are scheduled, executed, and their results stored. Learning the subtle complexities of retries, state management, and task lifecycles. Seeing how even simple abstractions leak complexity when scaled. Every line of code taught me something I could never fully grasp just by reading docs or tutorials.Flowrra is still early-stage. Next steps include:Expanding backend optionsEnhancing the built-in UI for better monitoringTesting distributed task execution scalabilityTesting multiple scheduler instances' scalabilityIt’s exciting to see something that started as a curiosity turn into a working system.Flowrra is fully open-source. If you’re curious about async Python, distributed systems, or just want to experiment with a task runner, you can contribute or test it today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Best Resources to Learn Python as a Beginner</title><link>https://dev.to/srdan_borovi_584c6b1d773/best-resources-to-learn-python-as-a-beginner-1f3l</link><author>Srdan Borović</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:30:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learning Python in 2025 shouldn't cost you a fortune. The internet has democratized programming education to the point where some of the best resources are completely free. However, too many options can paralyze you before you write your first line of code.After digging through Reddit threads, developer forums, and course reviews, a clear pattern emerges. The resource matters less than how you use it. But some paths are definitely smoother than others.
  
  
  Start Where You Actually Are
Mimo offers a mobile-first approach that fits into your daily routine. The platform teaches Python through bite-sized lessons and includes an AI assistant to answer questions as you code. You can build projects directly in the app, which helps bridge the gap between theory and practice. For people learning on their commute or during lunch breaks, this format works well.Mimo also recently launched a building experience where you can create real apps and websites using AI-assisted development. You describe what you want to build in plain language, then collaborate with AI to implement changes in an actual codebase. The platform includes a modern editor, built-in SQL database, instant preview, and the ability to publish your projects with a custom domain. It's designed to teach you both coding fundamentals and the AI-assisted workflows that are becoming industry standard.Futurecoder takes a different angle. This free browser-based course includes built-in debuggers and enhanced error messages that explain what went wrong. Users praise its ability to teach how code executes step-by-step. The instant feedback loop prevents you from building bad habits early on.Want someone to actually review your code? Exercism offers a mentor-reviewed system where experienced developers critique your work. Some beginners find it too challenging at first. Those who stick with it appreciate the personalized feedback. You'll learn not just how to make code work, but how to make it good.
  
  
  Two Free University Courses Worth Your Time
When people hear about free university courses, they often assume they're watered-down versions of the real thing. They're not.14 sections with roughly 30 exercises eachTest My Code system auto-grades your work instantlyYou need to pass 80% of exercises before advancingExpect 120 to 160 hours of work totalDedicated Discord channel for peer supportThat 80% requirement sounds harsh. It prevents the illusion of understanding that plagues many self-taught programmers. Students report gaining the independence to write programs without constantly Googling syntax. Later sections transition from a browser editor to Visual Studio Code. You'll learn professional workflows like setting up development environments and using extensions. These skills separate hobbyists from job-ready developers. brings Hollywood production values to programming education. Professor David Malan makes compiler errors feel exciting, which is a weird thing to say but somehow true.The course deliberately teaches 80% of what you need for each problem set. You research the remaining 20% independently. This gap forces you to develop the search skills that professional developers use daily.CS50P's auto-graders are unforgiving. You might spend hours debugging because you capitalized a letter wrong. Students curse this at first, then thank it later when they're catching bugs in production code. The course costs $219 for a verified certificate on edX, but Harvard offers the identical curriculum free through their OpenCourseWare platform.
  
  
  For People Who Learn by Building
Some people need to see results immediately. Abstract theory kills their motivation. Show them a for-loop in isolation and their eyes glaze over. Show them how it could rename 500 files in two seconds and suddenly they're taking notes.Mimo's building experience fits this learning style perfectly. You can build full-stack apps with front and back ends, work with a built-in SQL database, and publish stable versions for real users. The instant preview shows your changes as you implement them, and you can export your source code or connect a custom domain for portfolio-ready projects. Unlike pure AI generation tools that create code you can't explain, Mimo keeps you close to what you're building.Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code on Udemy promises 100 projects in 100 days. You'll build console games, data visualizations, and web applications while forming a daily coding habit. The first 50 days earn universal praise for pacing and clarity.The quality drops in the latter half as projects become more self-guided. Web development sections feel slightly dated. But here's why it still works: the course teaches you concepts you didn't know existed. That unknown-unknown problem trips up many self-taught programmers. You can't Google something if you don't know it has a name.Price matters here. The course lists for over $100 but goes on sale for $15-$20 regularly. Many U.S. public libraries offer free access through "Gale by Udemy." Check before buying.Update spreadsheets automaticallyAccountants and data entry professionals swear by this approach because it solves immediate pain points. One Reddit user credited this book with launching their data engineering career. However, the code style leans toward beginner-friendly rather than pythonic. Use this alongside a more rigorous course if you're aiming for software development roles.
  
  
  Physical Books Still Have Their Place
Physical books force you away from digital distractions. Many developers report better retention when studying from paper, particularly during deep focus sessions. by Eric Matthes consistently ranks as the number one beginner book. Half covers syntax and theory, half walks through projects including a space invaders-style game and Django web app. The 3rd edition includes updated content on modern Python practices. Users recommend it for striking the balance that many online courses miss. by Allen Downey focuses on computational thinking. If you want to understand not just Python but programming as a discipline, this book delivers. The approach feels more academic. Works for some learners, alienates others.Skip Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw. Experienced developers describe it as "radioactive garbage" due to idiosyncratic style and outdated Python 3 information. The controversy runs deep enough that recommending it will get you downvoted on Reddit.
  
  
  YouTube Works If You're Disciplined About It
YouTube tutorials get a bad rap for encouraging passive learning. Watch a video, feel smart, then freeze at a blank screen. But some creators break this pattern. produces the clearest Python tutorials on the platform. His explanations of Object-Oriented Programming, Django, and regular expressions beat many paid textbooks.The catch? His videos lack built-in exercises. You need to create your own practice problems or risk falling into tutorial hell.Avoid 6-12 hour "Full Course" videos unless you're ready to pause every five minutes and code along. Otherwise, you're just watching someone else solve problems.
  
  
  The Tools You'll Actually Need
Your choice of IDE sparks religious debates in programmer circles. The 2025 consensus has settled on two options.PyCharm Community Edition works brilliantly out of the box. Powerful autocomplete catches errors before you run code. The introspection helps you understand type annotations and available methods through exploration rather than memorization. Beginners benefit from this immediate feedback. requires more setup. You'll need to install Python and Jupyter extensions at minimum. But it offers flexibility across languages. For long-term career development, learning VS Code pays dividends when you inevitably need to work with JavaScript, HTML, or other technologies. inside VS Code transform the learning experience for data science paths. Line-by-line execution with instant visual output reduces debugging burnout. You see results immediately, which maintains motivation during difficult concepts.
  
  
  Breaking Out of Tutorial Hell
The biggest trap isn't picking the wrong resource.Tutorial hell happens when you become a passive consumer, following along perfectly but unable to create anything independently. I spent two months in this trap with web development. Could follow any tutorial flawlessly. Couldn't build a contact form from scratch. Breaking out required three deliberate changes in approach.The Parallel Project RuleAfter completing a tutorial that builds a calculator, you build a unit converter. Similar concepts, different implementation. This forces you to apply knowledge rather than copy it. The struggle of adapting what you learned to a new context teaches more than any smooth tutorial walkthrough.Got code working? Now change it until it breaks. See what error messages appear. Fix them without consulting the tutorial.This builds debugging skills that no polished walkthrough can teach. After a week of deliberately breaking scripts, you'll read Python error messages like sentences instead of cryptic warnings.Google, Stack Overflow, and official documentation are separate skills to master. They're as important as Python syntax. Fighting with documentation for 30 minutes teaches you more than getting a quick answer from ChatGPT.Good rule of thumb: struggle for at least 20 minutes before asking anyone for help.
  
  
  The AI Question Nobody Wants to Address
ChatGPT and Claude have become standard tools in 2025. Use them right, and you'll learn syntax in weeks. Use them wrong, and you'll never learn at all.How to use AI without crippling yourself:Ask it to explain cryptic error messagesRequest progressive difficulty drills based on your current levelHave it generate custom exercises for weak areasNever ask it to just write the solutionThe framework: Use AI for explanations, minimal debugging hints, and practice generation. Write the code yourself. Always.
  
  
  What Separates Success from Failure
Here's what nobody wants to hear: grit matters more than your resource choice. The ability to sit with confusion, read error messages carefully, and keep trying after your code fails for the hundredth time. That's the skill.People with expensive bootcamp degrees wash out because they quit when things get hard. High school dropouts become senior developers because they refuse to stop learning.The best resources teach you how to think through problems, not just how to type syntax.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>📘 Build a Trace Grid Puzzle Book Generator in Python (with Live Preview + PDF Export)</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/build-a-trace-grid-puzzle-book-generator-in-python-with-live-preview-pdf-export-8no</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:28:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build a desktop puzzle book generator using Python.By the end, you’ll have an app that:Generates grid-based tracing puzzlesAutomatically builds a print-ready PDFSupports multiple puzzles per pageIs ready for KDP / Etsy style publishingIf you’d rather jump straight to the finished code:Let’s build it step by step.Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.pip install pillow svgwrite reportlab ttkbootstrap cairosvgttkbootstrap – modern UI themesvgwrite – vector puzzle exportcairosvg – SVG → PNG for PDF embedding🧱 Step 1 — Project Skeletonimport sys, random
from pathlib import Path
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageTk
import svgwrite
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter

import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *
Pillow → live preview imagesvgwrite → scalable puzzle pagesttkbootstrap → dark themed UI🧠 Step 2 — Main Application ClassEverything lives inside one class:class TraceGridPuzzleBook:
    APP_NAME = "TraceGrid Puzzle Book Generator"
    APP_VERSION = "1.3.0"
Define available options:    GRID_STYLES = ["Square", "Isometric", "Triangle"]
    SYMBOL_TYPES = ["Dot", "Circle", "Square", "Mixed"]
    EXPORT_FORMATS = ["SVG", "PNG", "PDF"]
Now initialize the window:    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        tb.Style(theme="darkly")

        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.geometry("1130x620")
🎛 Step 3 — State VariablesThese store user settings:        self.grid_size_var = tk.IntVar(value=5)
        self.symbol_var = tk.StringVar(value="Dot")
        self.path_complexity_var = tk.IntVar(value=50)

        self.symbol_color_var = tk.StringVar(value="#000000")
        self.line_color_var = tk.StringVar(value="#000000")
        self.bg_color_var = tk.StringVar(value="#ffffff")

        self.line_thickness_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)
        self.symbol_radius_var = tk.IntVar(value=8)

        self.rows_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)
        self.cols_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)
        self.pages_var = tk.IntVar(value=1)

        self.output_dir = Path.home() / "TraceGridPuzzleBooks"
Each tk.Variable automatically syncs with UI widgets.🖼 Step 4 — Building the InterfaceCreate the UI:

        self._build_ui()
        self._update_preview()
Create left control panelsAdd spinboxes and dropdownsCreate a center Live Preview canvasExample: Grid size control:tb.Spinbox(
    grid_body,
    from_=3,
    to=15,
    textvariable=self.grid_size_var,
    command=self._update_preview
).grid(row=0, column=1)
Whenever the value changes, _update_preview() redraws puzzles instantly.🧩 Step 5 — Generating a Single Puzzle PathEach puzzle is just a random walk through a grid:def _generate_single_puzzle(self):
    size = self.grid_size_var.get()
    complexity = self.path_complexity_var.get() / 100

    total_steps = max(2, int(size * size * complexity))

    path = [(0, 0)]
    visited = set(path)

    for _ in range(total_steps - 1):
        x, y = path[-1]

        neighbors = [
            (x+dx, y+dy)
            for dx, dy in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]
            if 0 <= x+dx < size
            and 0 <= y+dy < size
            and (x+dx, y+dy) not in visited
        ]

        if not neighbors:
            break

        next_cell = random.choice(neighbors)
        visited.add(next_cell)
        path.append(next_cell)

    return path
Randomly move up/down/left/rightStop when complexity limit is reachedThis produces clean tracing paths.✏️ Step 6 — Drawing Puzzles (PNG Preview)For live preview we draw with Pillow:def _draw_puzzle_png(self, draw, path, x_offset, y_offset, cell_width, cell_height):
    step = cell_width / (self.grid_size_var.get()+1)
    radius = self.symbol_radius_var.get()

    for i, (x, y) in enumerate(path):
        px = x_offset + (x+1)*step
        py = y_offset + (y+1)*step

        draw.ellipse([px-radius, py-radius, px+radius, py+radius], fill=self.symbol_color_var.get())

        if i > 0:
            prev = path[i-1]
            px0 = x_offset + (prev[0]+1)*step
            py0 = y_offset + (prev[1]+1)*step

            draw.line([px0, py0, px, py],
                      fill=self.line_color_var.get(),
                      width=self.line_thickness_var.get())
Dots + connecting lines = tracing puzzle.Every UI change regenerates sample puzzles:def _update_preview(self):
    img = Image.new("RGB", (400,400), self.bg_color_var.get())
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

    for r in range(self.rows_var.get()):
        for c in range(self.cols_var.get()):
            path = self._generate_single_puzzle()
            self._draw_puzzle_png(draw, path, c*200, r*200, 200, 200)

    self.preview_image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(img)
    self.preview_canvas.delete("all")
    self.preview_canvas.create_image(0,0, anchor="nw", image=self.preview_image)
This gives instant visual feedback.📄 Step 8 — Exporting SVG PagesEach page is a large SVG with multiple puzzles:def _export_page_svg(self, filename, puzzle_paths, rows, cols):
    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(filename, size=(1000,1000))

    cell_w = 1000 / cols
    cell_h = 1000 / rows

    for i, path in enumerate(puzzle_paths):
        r = i // cols
        c = i % cols

        self._draw_puzzle_svg(
            dwg,
            path,
            c*cell_w,
            r*cell_h,
            cell_w,
            cell_h
        )

    dwg.save()
SVG is perfect for printing because it’s vector-based.📚 Step 9 — Building the PDFWe convert SVG → PNG → PDF:def _export_pdf(self, pdf_filename, svg_files):
    c = canvas.Canvas(str(pdf_filename), pagesize=letter)

    for svg in svg_files:
        from cairosvg import svg2png

        png = svg.with_suffix(".png")
        svg2png(url=str(svg), write_to=str(png))

        img = Image.open(png)
        c.drawInlineImage(img, 0, 0)
        c.showPage()

    c.save()
Now you have a multi-page puzzle book PDF.if __name__ == "__main__":
    TraceGridPuzzleBook().run()
A full desktop tool that can:Automatically produce PDF booksSupport multiple puzzles per pageCustomize colors, sizes, and complexityFeel free to fork it, improve it, or build your own puzzle generators on top.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SpamSentinel v1.0 – Build a GUI Email Spam Detector in Python</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/spamsentinel-v10-build-a-gui-email-spam-detector-in-python-377p</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll build SpamSentinel, a fast email spam detector with a GUI using Python.

spam_score calculates a fake spam score for demonstration.We use regex patterns to detect typical spam keywords.stop() allows the process to be canceled.We now scan files and calculate scores:    def run(self):

But as your database grows, those once-snappy pages are starting to feel... sluggish. You check your logs and see a query taking 2 seconds to load.Your first thought might be: "I need a bigger server."
Your second thought (the correct one) should be: In this guide, we’ll walk through why caching matters, how to set it up with Redis, and—most importantly—how to prove it’s actually working.Imagine you are a librarian. Someone asks you for a complex report on 19th-century architecture. You spend 20 minutes walking to the back of the library, climbing a ladder, and finding the book.If ten more people ask for that same report in the next hour, would you walk back every time? No. You’d keep a copy on your desk. While Django supports several backends (Database, File System, Local Memory),  is the industry standard. It’s an in-memory data store, meaning it lives in your RAM. It is significantly faster than reading from a traditional Disk-based database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
  
  
  The Setup: Before Caching
Let’s look at a standard Django view that calculates "Trending Products" for an e-commerce dashboard. This query is "expensive" because it involves aggregates and filters over thousands of rows.
  
  
  The "Before" Performance:
 1 per request. ~500ms - 1.5s (depending on DB size). Poor. 100 concurrent users = 100 heavy DB queries.
  
  
  Step 1: Install and Configure Redis
First, you need the Redis server installed on your machine and the Python interface.Update your  to point Django toward Redis:
  
  
  Step 2: Implementing the "Cache-First" Pattern
The most common way to cache is the  pattern. You check the cache; if it's there (a ), return it. If not (a ), fetch from the DB and save it to the cache for next time.Here is our updated view:
  
  
  Step 3: Verifying and Monitoring
This is where many developers trip up. How do you know it's working?Open your terminal and run the Redis monitor tool. This shows every command hitting your Redis server in real-time.Now, refresh your browser. You will see a  command in the monitor. You will see a  command. If you see  followed by another , your logic is broken (Cache Miss).To see exactly what is stored in your Redis database:redis-cli keys Note: Django-redis automatically prepends a version (usually ) to your keys.You can also use your browser's "Network" tab. Compare the  column.
  
  
  Step 4: Pro-Tip - Cache Warming
What if that first user of the day is a VIP? They shouldn't have to wait for the "Cache Miss." We use a —a custom Django management command that runs on a schedule (Cron job) to pre-fill the cache.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️
If you cache product prices for 24 hours and change a price in the admin panel, the user will see the old price. Use Django "Signals" to clear the cache whenever a model is saved.Django code is loaded into memory by your web server (Gunicorn/Uvicorn). If you change your  name in your code, you must restart Gunicorn. Otherwise, your server will keep looking for the old key while your warming script generates the new one.systemctl restart gunicorn

Don't cache things that are unique to every user (like a shopping cart) unless you include the  in the cache key.Caching is the bridge between a "hobby project" and a "production-ready app." By moving your most frequent, expensive queries into Redis, you reduce the load on your database and provide a lightning-fast experience for your users. Try implementing caching on your slowest API endpoint and use  to watch the magic happen!Have questions about cache invalidation?

After messing around for over six months without finding a consistent rhythm, while wasting huge amounts of time and energy, I stumbled upon quantitative trading. That’s when I finally realized: “Let data speak, let rules discipline”—this is the real key to reducing risk and improving efficiency. But at first, I was completely put off by the myths of “high barriers to quant trading” and “expensive APIs,” until I discovered this free stock API. That’s when I truly took my first step into quant trading. Today, I’m sharing this battle-tested, practical experience with no reservations—for beginners who are as lost as I once was.Let me be upfront: as a beginner in quant, you don’t need to chase complex machine learning models right away, and you definitely don’t need to spend big money on paid APIs. The free tier is more than enough to build basic strategies, connect real-time data, and run backtests. Only when you have higher needs later (e.g., high-frequency trading or Level 2 depth data) should you consider upgrading to paid plans. This is the most cost-effective and efficient path to getting started with quant trading, based on my own testing.Today we’re keeping it real—no fluff, just my personal hands-on breakdown. I’ll walk you through using this free stock API to build a simple, beginner-friendly quantitative trading strategy, while avoiding all the pitfalls I hit along the way. Everything here is practical and implementable.The biggest worry for beginners is “the tech is too complicated” or “registration is a hassle.” But iTick’s free tier eliminates those concerns entirely—it takes just 5 minutes to get set up, zero barrier to entry, and the free version is especially friendly for individual developers and newcomers to quant trading.Go to the iTick website, click “Get Started” in the top right, and register with your personal email—no complicated personal information required, one-step process.After registering, go straight to the dashboard, find the “API Management” section, and you’ll see your API Token. This token is crucial—you’ll need it for real-time data access and all API calls. Save it securely and never share it.Key details on free tier permissions (must-read for beginners): Supports basic real-time quotes for US stocks, Hong Kong stocks, A-shares, and other markets, plus minute-level to daily historical K-line data. Rate limit is 10 requests/minute—plenty for beginners building simple strategies (e.g., trend following, moving average crossover). It’s permanently free with no expiration, very beginner-friendly.
  
  
  2. Connecting Real-Time Data
The core of quantitative trading is simple: get market data in real time → apply preset strategy logic → generate trading signals. The very first and most critical step is real-time data access—if latency is high, your strategy judgments become inaccurate and can lead to unnecessary losses. iTick’s free API supports both RESTful and WebSocket push methods with very low latency (<100 ms for major markets), perfectly suitable for non-ultra-high-frequency strategies and easy for beginners to handle.I used Python throughout (the top choice for beginners—simple syntax, tons of online resources, quick solutions when you get stuck). Below are ready-to-run code examples. Just replace with your own API Token, copy-paste, and run to get real-time US stock data. Every line has detailed comments—take your time if something looks unfamiliar.First, install the two required libraries (run in your terminal):pip install requests websocket-client
These are standard Python libraries for API calls and real-time streaming—installation is straightforward.
  
  
  1. RESTful API for Real-Time Quotes
Real-world result: Running this instantly returns Apple’s current price, volume, and percentage change with very low latency—basically in sync with regular trading apps. Beginners should start with a single stock to get familiar with the data structure before expanding to multiple.
  
  
  2. WebSocket for Real-Time Streaming
If your strategy needs to monitor multiple stocks continuously (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Nvidia), WebSocket is better—it pushes updates in real time without repeated polling, more efficient and time-saving.
  
  
  3. Building a Real Strategy
Once real-time data is connected, you can start building the actual strategy. Beginners should begin with the classic “Dual Moving Average Crossover”—simple logic, easy to understand, controllable risk, and a favorite starting point for many experienced quant traders. Combined with iTick’s real-time and historical data, it’s quick to implement without advanced coding skills.Quick breakdown of the dual MA strategy (no complex formulas—just understand the idea):Choose two moving averages—a short-term (e.g., 20-day) and a long-term (e.g., 60-day). Trading signals come from crossovers:Short-term MA crosses above long-term MA (“Golden Cross”) → bullish trend → Buy signalShort-term MA crosses below long-term MA (“Death Cross”) → bearish trend → Sell signalUsing iTick data, the program automatically detects these crossovers, removing emotional bias—this is the biggest advantage of quant: rational, disciplined, no chasing or panic selling.Get historical data: Pull a stock’s historical K-lines via iTick API (e.g., last ~3 years daily data) for backtesting—essential to validate past performance before live use.Calculate MAs: Use Python’s talib library to compute 20-day and 60-day simple moving averages.Generate signals: Automatically detect golden/death crosses.Real-time monitoring: Use WebSocket to watch price; alert on signal (beginners: alerts only, no auto-trading).I wrote a lot, but it really boils down to one thing: getting started with quant trading as a beginner doesn’t have to be technically intimidating or expensive. Start with a free stock API and the simplest dual moving average strategy—nail real-time data first, then gradually optimize and simulate live trading. Step by step is far more reliable than trading on emotion or tips.That’s exactly how I did it—from not even knowing what an API was to now comfortably building basic quant strategies and monitoring multiple US stocks in real time. I’m not making huge profits, but I’ve avoided most of the old emotional traps, and my trading mindset is much calmer. The real essence of quant trading has never been “beating the market”—it’s “understanding the market,” using discipline to control your behavior and overcome greed and fear. That’s the philosophy I’ve stuck with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Death of the DMV Line: How I Found a Driving Test Slot in 48 Hours 🚗</title><link>https://dev.to/hypertools/the-death-of-the-dmv-line-how-i-found-a-driving-test-slot-in-48-hours-2mon</link><author>Roberto | Hyper-Tools</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:09:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had to renew my license in Nevada.

C is a systems language. JavaScript is a browser language. Rust is a safety-focused systems language. SQL is a query language.Python doesn't fit. It can be tricky, for an experienced programmer, to grasp what Python actually is and which slot to put it in. Often, they conclude "I don't like Python" and express confusion at its vast popularity in the 2020s.Like the eponymous snake, Python can be hard to pin down — and like a real python, it may end up wrapped around your codebase whether you planned it or not.Traditionally we're taught to classify languages along a few axes:scripting vs "real" languagesimperative vs OO vs functionalPython fits poorly into all of them.It isn't a compiled language in the C or Rust sense: it doesn't result in a standalone executable. It supports imperative, object-oriented and functional styles but isn't optimized for any of them. It began as a scripting language, but today it's used to build large, long-running systems.
  
  
  The Key Insight: Python Is Not Defined by Its Output
The turning point is to realize that Python is not defined by the artefact it produces.C, C++, Rust, Zig and Fortran produce binaries that can be directly run. The output is the thing. Once compiled, the language largely disappears from the execution model.Python doesn't work like that.A Python program needs a runtime ecosystem to execute: the interpreter, the object model, the garbage collector and the standard library. These are not incidental. They  Python. A Python program can't run standalone unless all of these components are bundled with it.
  
  
  Python as a Runtime Ecosystem
In structural terms, Python sits alongside other runtime-centric language ecosystems:Java, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure on the JVMThe similarity is architectural role: in all these cases, the runtime is the , not any compiled artefact.Strictly speaking, Python is a language specification with multiple implementations — IronPython runs on .NET, Jython on the JVM. But in practice, CPython and its C-API-dependent package ecosystem  Python. That's what made Python popular, and that's what we're discussing here.The differences from .NET and the JVM matter too..NET and the JVM have JIT compilation to native code; CPython does not by default..NET and the JVM enforce static typing as part of the compilation model; Python's type hints are advisory..NET and the JVM produce native distributable artefacts (.dll, .jar) with stable ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces); Python does not, making it more difficult to call. Python prefers to call other libraries rather than be called itself.So Python belongs in the "runtime ecosystem" category, but it's a looser, more dynamic variant; it trades static type-safe guarantees for flexibility and rapid development.This structural similarity doesn't fully explain Python's success — Ruby, Perl and PHP share similar characteristics but declined while Python grew. Historical contingency matters: NumPy's timing, Google's investment in TensorFlow, and early academic adoption all played roles that had little to do with language design.
  
  
  Where Python's Nature Is Clearest: Orchestration
Going to back to our question of "What IS Python?", the key is to realize that Python is a runtime-centric language. Its nature is clearest in numerical computing, data engineering and machine learning, where Python orchestrates work rather than performing it.The most important Python libraries—NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow—are not written in Python in any meaningful sense. Python provides the API, the glue and the control flow. The heavy computation happens in C, C++, Fortran or CUDA libraries that expose a C ABI.Python performs the same role over its libraries as:It is an orchestration language sitting above high-performance systems. That's why it thrives in scientific computing, data pipelines and machine learning. You build rapidly and easily, with simple syntax, while the underlying libraries deliver the performance. So long as orchestration overhead is low, Python-based systems can scale surprisingly far.This is the glamorous use case — but not necessarily the most common one.
  
  
  That's Not the Whole Story
The orchestration model explains Python's dominance in scientific and data-heavy domains — but most Python code written globally is web apps, scripts, automation and data munging where Python  doing the work directly.In web development and business applications (think Django, Flask, FastAPI), Python handles HTTP requests, processes strings and executes business logic. Here, Python trades raw performance for development speed and ecosystem breadth. A Django application will be slower than an equivalent in Go or C#, but it may ship months earlier.For these workloads, the framing is different: Python is a productive general-purpose language that prioritizes developer time over CPU time.Python's popularity is no mystery once you consider this trade-off.Being able to assemble things quickly, in readable code, with vast ecosystem support, matters more for mass adoption than type-safety, compilation speed or raw performance. Make something easy, and more people will do it; make something quick to do, and more people will do it, more often.Python lowers the barrier to entry for proof-of-concept and prototype work. You can validate an idea in hours rather than days. If performance becomes critical later, you can translate hot paths into a compiled language—but you've already learned what needs building.Getting something working , quickly, turns out to be more important than getting it working fast or elegantly. Shell scripting demonstrated this in the 1970s; Visual Basic and VBA did this in the 1990s; Python demonstrates it today. Make it easy and fast to build, and they will come and build.A note of realism: "rewrite hot paths later" is technically true but economically rare. Most prototypes never get rewritten; they become production systems. This is true of any language, but Python's low barrier to entry means more prototypes get written in the first place — and more of them survive into production.
  
  
  When Python Is the Wrong Choice
A fair assessment requires acknowledgement of where Python doesn't belong: — Garbage collection pauses are unacceptable when deadlines are measured in microseconds. — Neither iOS nor Android use Python as a first-class development language. — JavaScript and WebAssembly own this space.Memory-constrained embedded systems — Python's runtime overhead is prohibitive on microcontrollers (although MicroPython, a cut-down implementation, has some adoption in this space).Latency-critical network services — Where every millisecond matters, Go, Rust or C++ are better choices.CPU-bound pure-Python workloads — If you can't offload to native libraries, Python's interpreter speed becomes a genuine bottleneck.These are domains Python doesn't seriously contest. More relevant are the pain points in domains where Python  used: — The Global Interpreter Lock limits true parallelism in CPU-bound multithreaded code.Packaging and distribution — pip, virtualenv, conda, poetry, and pyproject.toml represent years of fragmented solutions to dependency management. — Relative imports, __init__.py behaviour, and module resolution remain sources of confusion. — Shipping a Python application to end users without requiring them to install Python remains harder than it should be.Python excels at orchestration, rapid prototyping and domains with strong library support. It is not a universal solution, and it carries real operational costs.
  
  
  Why Python still feels slippery
Even with this framing, Python can still feel oddly unsatisfying if you come from strongly structured languages.Compared with C#/Java or their ecosystems, Python has:a simpler, leakier object modelIf you're used to the discipline of C#, the functional elegance of F# or the precision of Rust, Python can feel vague. Things work — until they don't — and the language often declines to help you reason about correctness ahead of time.That's a real cost. But as the previous section argues, for many problem domains it's a cost worth paying.
  
  
  Clearing Up Misconceptions

True for CPU-bound pure-Python code. False when Python orchestrates native libraries—NumPy array operations execute at C speed regardless of Python's overhead."Python is a scripting language."
Historically accurate; Python originated as a scripting tool. But "scripting language" now undersells what Python has become.
Misleading. CPython compiles source to bytecode, then executes that bytecode on a virtual machine — much like many modern interpreters do. The distinction matters when reasoning about performance and behaviour, but it's an implementation detail rather than a defining characteristic.
  
  
  A Better Language Taxonomy
Python fits comfortably into this three-tier classification:C, C++, Rust, Zig, FortranThe binary is the productThe runtime is the productBash, PowerShell, VBA, LuaThe host environment is the productPython belongs firmly in the second group—with the caveat that it's a more dynamic, less rigidly structured member than Java or C#.The boundaries are not perfectly clean. Go has garbage collection, a runtime and reflection, yet produces statically-linked binaries — it sits at the boundary between the first two categories. Taxonomies are useful simplifications, not natural laws.
  
  
  A brief note for Rust and Go proponents
A common challenge: Python's role is better served by "doing it properly" in a compiled language from the start.That view makes sense if your problem is well-specified, stable, performance-critical and worth committing to upfront architectural constraints. In such cases, Rust or Go can be excellent choices.But many real-world problems do not start that way. They begin as ill-defined, exploratory or fast-moving systems: data pipelines, research code, internal tools, integration glue. A research team needs to test an idea quickly at small scale. A business team needs a tactical solution because the problem won't wait for strategic architecture.In those contexts, using a language with strict typing, memory models or concurrency primitives can frustrate development with language-wrestling, where making the language work becomes centre-stage.Python and compiled languages are therefore not competitors but complements: Python for orchestration and discovery; Rust, Go or C# for stabilised, performance-critical components. Your Python prototype becomes your teacher—clarifying what the real system needs to do.That said, Python's actual competition in most domains isn't Rust or Go — it's JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, R, and Julia. Python's victory over these closer competitors owes as much to ecosystem momentum and historical timing as to language design.Python isn't confused, incoherent or a "toy" language. It simply departs from the mental models of earlier language generations.Python is a runtime-centric ecosystem that excels at orchestration, rapid prototyping and leveraging high-performance native libraries. It trades static guarantees and raw speed for flexibility, readability and development velocity.That trade-off turns out to be exactly what a large portion of programmers need — including many who aren't professional developers at all, but scientists, analysts and business users who need working code fast. It let's you deliver, quickly. And that's what makes Python incredibly useful — and wildly popular.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Weekly Challenge: Maximum Encryption</title><link>https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-maximum-encryption-49a8</link><author>Simon Green</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:49:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Each week Mohammad S. Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. My solutions are written in Python first, and then converted to Perl. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.You are given an array of alphanumeric string, .Write a script to find the max value of alphanumeric string in the given array. The numeric representation of the string, if it comprises of digits only otherwise length of the string.This task can be achieved in a single line in both Python and Perl, while still maintaining readability. For the Python solution I use list comprehension to convert each string into an integer (if it is all digits) or the length of string (if it isn't). This is wrapped around the max function to return maximum (largest) of these values.Not to out-shinned, Perl can achieve similar functionality by using the map function, converting each string into its numeric representation or its length. Perl doesn't have a built-in  function, but it is available from the List::Util package../ch-1.py

You are given a string  and an integer $int.Write a script to encrypt the string using the algorithm - for each character  in , replace  with the  character after  in the alphabet, wrapping if needed and return the encrypted string.For this task, I start by setting  (called  in Python as  is a reserved word) to be the modulus (remainder) of 26. If that value is , I return the original string as no encryption is required.The next step is creating a mapping table. I start with the variable  that has all the lower case letters of the English alphabet. I create a  string by slicing the  string at the appropriate point. I then double the length of each string by adding the upper case equivalent string. Finally, I use  to convert the strings to a dictionary where the key is the original letter and the value is the new letter.The final step is to loop through each character and use the  dictionary to replace the letter, or use the original character if it is not found (numbers, spaces, punctuation characters, etc).The Perl code follows the same logic. It uses the splice method to create the  variable, and both  and  are arrays. The  function also comes from the List::Util package. Perl will automatically convert a flat list to key/value pairs in the  hash../ch-2.py abc 1

This guide shows you how to build an automated traffic monitoring system using APIs to track organic rankings, competitor dynamics, and advertising performance in real-time.How to identify Amazon listing traffic sources (organic, PPC, external)Building an automated traffic monitoring system with PythonUsing Pangolinfo Scrape API for real-time Amazon data collectionSetting up anomaly detection and alerts for traffic changes
  
  
  The Problem: Amazon's Traffic Attribution Black Box
A seller recently contacted me with a common problem: their silicone baking mat listing went from 15 daily orders to 35+ orders overnight. They were only running a single automatic campaign with a $30 daily budget, and their advertising report showed no significant change in ad-generated orders. Where did the extra 20 daily orders come from?This scenario highlights a fundamental challenge for Amazon sellers: Amazon's Seller Central doesn't provide clear traffic source attribution. You get aggregate metrics like Sessions and Page Views, but no breakdown of:How much traffic comes from organic search vs. paid adsWhich keywords are driving the most trafficWhether competitor stockouts are sending traffic your wayIf external promotion campaigns are actually workingFor developers building seller tools or data-driven sellers with technical teams, this black box is unacceptable.
  
  
  Understanding Amazon Traffic Sources
Before we dive into the technical solution, let's map out the traffic landscape:
  
  
  1. Organic On-Platform Traffic
: Buyers searching keywords and finding your listingRanking position is everything (page 1 vs. page 2 = 10x traffic difference)Influenced by sales velocity, conversion rate, reviews, and relevance: Best Sellers, New Releases, Movers & ShakersHigh-intent traffic with strong conversion ratesProvides brand exposure beyond keyword searches: "Customers who bought this also bought"Often overlooked but can represent 20-30% of trafficEspecially valuable for complementary products
  
  
  2. Paid On-Platform Traffic
: Appear in search results and product pages: Top-of-search brand ads: Retargeting and audience-based adsSocial media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)Deal sites (Slickdeals, Kinja Deals)Independent website referrals
  
  
  Building a Traffic Attribution System
Here's how to build a system that actually tells you where your traffic comes from.┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  Step 1: Data Collection Setup
First, let's set up automated data collection using Python and Pangolinfo's Scrape API.
  
  
  Step 2: Automated Scheduling
Set up a cron job or use a task scheduler to run data collection daily:
  
  
  Step 3: Anomaly Detection
Implement logic to detect significant traffic changes:
  
  
  Step 4: Traffic Source Attribution Logic
Now combine all data sources to attribute traffic:Let's return to the silicone baking mat example. Here's what the data revealed:Keyword rankings for 10 core keywords (daily)Competitor data for 5 main competitors (daily)Advertising data from Amazon Ads API A Facebook promotion one week earlier generated 50 concentrated orders, improving sales velocity and conversion rate, which triggered Amazon's algorithm to boost organic rankings.Increased ad budget to consolidate ranking positionAccelerated inventory replenishmentResult: Sustained 30+ daily orders (50% improvement)
  
  
  Why Pangolinfo for Amazon Data Collection
After testing multiple solutions, here's why Pangolinfo Scrape API stands out:1. High Accuracy for Sponsored Ads98% success rate for SP ad position scrapingCritical for understanding competitive advertising landscapeNo estimation models—actual scraped dataMinute-level updates available3. Comprehensive CoverageSearch results (organic + sponsored)RESTful API with clear documentationMultiple output formats (JSON, CSV, HTML)Webhook support for real-time alertsPay per request (no unused features)Much more cost-effective than $3,588/year SaaS tools1. Start Simple, Scale GraduallyBegin with 5-10 core keywordsAdd more metrics as you understand patternsManual data collection doesn't scaleSet up scheduled jobs from day one3. Focus on Actionable MetricsDon't just collect data—define what actions each metric triggersExample: Ranking drop > 10 positions → increase ad budget4. Combine Multiple Data SourcesAmazon Ads API for advertising dataPangolinfo for organic rankings and competitor dataAmazon Attribution for external traffic5. Build Historical ContextTraffic analysis requires time-series dataCollect data for at least 2-4 weeks before drawing conclusionsAmazon's lack of transparent traffic attribution doesn't have to be a black box. By building a systematic monitoring system with automated data collection, anomaly detection, and attribution logic, you can:Quickly identify traffic source changesRespond to opportunities (ranking improvements, competitor stockouts)Optimize advertising spend based on actual dataMake data-driven decisions instead of guessingThe technical implementation is straightforward—the real value comes from consistent execution and acting on insights.Have you built your own Amazon traffic monitoring system?

Not the phase where you wire APIs.
Not even the phase where everything finally works.There’s a much quieter phase.The phase where you stop building
and start deciding what is allowed to exist.Up to this point in Phase-3, I had a fully functional frontend:
routing worked, pages existed, layout was in place, navigation was responsive, and the system was technically sound.From an engineering perspective, I could have kept adding features endlessly.But from a product perspective, something more important was missing:the product didn’t yet have a .And without a final shape, you’re not building a product — you’re just accumulating components.
  
  
  The Moment You Switch From Developer to Product Owner
Day-5 was the first day where I consciously stopped asking:“How do I implement this?”“What should this product even be?”That’s a very different mental model.As a developer, you’re rewarded for adding things.
As a product owner, you’re rewarded for .Because every extra option:increases maintenance costincreases surface area for bugsweakens the identity of the systemSo instead of adding, I started .Freezing decisions.
Freezing structure.This is something you only learn after working on real systems:
progress is not always forward — sometimes it’s about drawing boundaries.
  
  
  Why I Removed “Home” From Navigation
One of the most deliberate decisions I made was removing the “Home” link from the navigation.On paper, it looks harmless.
In practice, it’s redundant.Users already know three universal rules:home is not a feature, it’s a stateSo keeping “Home” in the navigation was not helping anyone.
It was just occupying attention.And attention is the most expensive resource in any product.By removing it, the navigation became something else:
not a list of pages,.Each item now answers a real user question:That’s not navigation anymore.
That’s storytelling.
  
  
  Navigation as a Contract, Not a Menu
At this point,  stopped being just a config file.It became a .what the user is allowed to explorewhat I’m willing to maintain long-termChanging it is no longer a refactor.
It’s a strategic decision.This is exactly how real systems evolve:
routes become APIs,
contracts become identity.Your navigation is literally your public interface.
  
  
  Branding Is Not Design, It’s Memory
Adding the logo consistently across the Navbar, Header, and Footer wasn’t a cosmetic improvement.It was a memory-building decision.People don’t remember layouts.
They remember symbols.the product becomes recognizablenavigation becomes intuitivethe site feels “real” instead of “personal project”This is one of the biggest psychological differences between:
a portfolio that feels like a demo
and one that feels like a product.The logo stops being decoration.
It becomes infrastructure.
  
  
  The Real Work of Day-5: Knowing When to Stop
Day-5 didn’t involve complex algorithms.
It didn’t involve clever abstractions.
It didn’t involve any “wow” features.But it involved one of the hardest engineering skills:knowing when the system is coherent enough to freeze.Not perfect.
Not complete.This is where many projects die:
they keep evolving without ever stabilizing,
so nothing ever feels finished,
and everything feels temporary.By finalizing the navigation, footer, and branding,
I wasn’t just polishing UI —locking the surface area of the product.new features must fit this structuredesign must respect these boundarieschanges become intentional, not accidentalThat’s the moment a codebase becomes a system.Now, I want to talk about something more important:what this phase does to how other people perceive you.Because at some point, your portfolio stops being a learning tool.
It becomes a signal.A signal to recruiters.
A signal to engineers.
A signal to people who might work with you.And signals are built from decisions, not from code volume.
  
  
  Why This Is Actually Leadership Work
Most developers think leadership looks like:In reality, leadership starts much earlier.making irreversible decisions in uncertain systems.I was saying:
“This is the shape of the system I’m responsible for.”That’s not coding.
That’s ownership.And ownership is the single strongest signal of seniority.
  
  
  The Recruiter Psychology Nobody Talks About
Here’s a harsh truth most people don’t realize:Recruiters don’t evaluate portfolios like engineers.
They evaluate them like .Does this feel intentional?Does this person make decisions?“This person builds things, but doesn’t finish them.”limited, clean navigationDay-5 moved the project from the first category to the second.
  
  
  Why Most Portfolios Fail at This Exact Stage
So most portfolios become:They never become .The moment you stop iterating UI endlessly and say:
“This is the experience I want users to have.”You separate yourself from 95% of developers.
  
  
  Freezing Structure Unlocks Speed
The moment you stop changing structure,
you can move faster than ever.new pages plug into known routescomponents follow known layoutdesign follows known systemdecisions become local, not globalBefore Day-5:
every change risked breaking everything.After Day-5:
every change has a home.This is exactly how large systems scale:
not by adding flexibility,reducing degrees of freedom.
  
  
  The Hidden Career Benefit of This Phase
This phase does something subtle to your personal brand:“developer who learns technologies”“engineer who designs systems”Because senior roles are not about:how you think about productshow you constrain complexityhow you make irreversible decisionsDay-5 is literally a leadership simulation.You just don’t notice it while doing it.
  
  
  Why This Matters More Than Any Framework
But this skill will not age:knowing when a system is ready to be .That’s product thinking.
That’s engineering maturity.
That’s what people actually hire for.Not your stack.
Not your libraries.If I had to summarize Day-5 in one line:Day-5 is when the project stopped being a collection of pages
and became a product with a defined identity.No new features.
No fancy code.

A single SQL injection can expose millions of user records. An XSS vulnerability can compromise user sessions. Let's skip the theory and dive into practical, actionable security practices with real code examples you can use today.
  
  
  1. Authentication: Don't Roll Your Own Crypto
❌ Bad: Plain Text Passwords✅ Good: Hashed Passwords with bcrypt
  
  
  2. SQL Injection: The Classic Vulnerability
❌ Bad: String Concatenation✅ Good: Parameterized QueriesORM Examples (Even Safer):
  
  
  3. XSS Prevention: Escape User Input
❌ Bad: Direct HTML Rendering✅ Good: Sanitize and EscapeReact (Auto-Escapes by Default):By: Backend Sanitization (Python):
  
  
  4. Secure API Authentication with JWT
✅ Proper JWT Implementation:
  
  
  5. Secure Session Management
✅ Express.js Secure Sessions:
  
  
  6. Input Validation: Never Trust User Input
✅ Comprehensive Validation (Node.js with express-validator):Submit✅ Safe File Upload Handler:✅ Rate Limiting Middleware:
  
  
  10. Secrets Management: Never Hardcode Credentials
✅ Good: Environment Variables✅ Essential Security Headers:
  
  
  12. Secure Database Queries: Beyond SQL Injection
✅ Principle of Least Privilege:Connection String Example:
  
  
  13. Dependency Scanning in CI/CD
✅ GitHub Actions Security Workflow:
  
  
  14. Logging Security Events (Without Logging Sensitive Data)
Before deploying to production, verify:[ ] All passwords are hashed with bcrypt/Argon2[ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements[ ] User input is validated and sanitized[ ] HTTPS is enforced (no HTTP)[ ] Security headers are set (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)[ ] CORS is properly configured[ ] Rate limiting is enabled[ ] Sessions use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies[ ] File uploads are restricted and validated[ ] No secrets in code (use environment variables)[ ] Dependencies are up to date (npm audit)[ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info[ ] Logging doesn't include passwords/tokens[ ] Database users have minimal permissions[ ] Authentication endpoints have rate limitingSecurity isn't about being paranoid—it's about being responsible. Every line of code you write is potentially an attack vector. By following these practices and using the code examples above, you'll dramatically reduce your application's attack surface.Remember: Security is not a feature you add at the end. It's a mindset you adopt from day one. Start with secure defaults, validate everything, trust nothing, and always assume your code will be attacked.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💡 Discovery: docs(ralph): Auto-publish discovery blog post</title><link>https://dev.to/igorganapolsky/discovery-docsralph-auto-publish-discovery-blog-post-dbp</link><author>Igor Ganapolsky</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 04:02:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to add autonomous AI coding to your project?

At first glance, the rule about "reversing an edge only once upon arrival" sounds like we need to keep track of a lot of state. however, because we can only use the reversal  to move to the next node, we can simplify our thinking.Essentially, every original directed edge  with weight  provides two possibilities:Move from  to  normally for cost .If we are at , we can use the switch to turn the edge into  for cost .By adding these "reverse options" as additional edges into our graph from the start, we transform the problem into a standard shortest-path search. Since all weights are non-negative,  is the perfect tool for the job.
  
  
  Walkthrough: Understanding the Examples
Nodes: 4, Edges: [[0,1,3],[3,1,1],[2,3,4],[0,2,2]]Possible moves from node 0:To node 1 (cost 3) or node 2 (cost 2).At node 1, we see an incoming edge from node 3 ( weight 1). We reverse it to go  for cost .At node 2, there are no incoming edges to reverse that help us get closer to node 3.The path  is the cheapest. Output: 5. Sometimes, the best way to handle a "special move" is to represent it as a new type of edge in your graph. When finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights, Dijkstra's algorithm provides an efficient complexity of . By recognizing that the "reversal" is used immediately, we avoid complex DP states or tracking if a switch was used globally.This problem is a classic example of how interviewers take a standard algorithm (Dijkstra) and add a "twist" to see if you can adapt. In real-world software engineering, this logic mirrors how routing engines work. For example, in a logistics system, a truck might usually take a highway, but under certain conditions, it might take a service road at a higher cost in fuel or time. Modeling these "conditional" paths is key to building robust navigation and optimization systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧠 Ensemble策略</title><link>https://dev.to/stklen/ensemblece-lue-431k</link><author>TK Lin</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[就像人類團隊合作一樣， 讓多個 AI 模型一起工作，綜合判斷得出更準確的結果。

  Part 4: Data Ingestion with Python
We're going to load the NYC Taxi dataset into Postgres.pip pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary jupyter
uv add pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
uv add  jupyter
We use the NYC Taxi trip data. Download it:wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz

  
  
  Loading Data into Postgres
Here's the basic approach: prevents loading the whole file into memory creates the table (first time) adds rows (subsequent chunks)Running multiple  commands is annoying. Docker Compose lets you define everything in one file.Create :docker-compose up      
docker-compose up 
docker-compose down    
docker-compose down Docker Compose automatically creates a network so containers can talk to each other using their service names (e.g.,  instead of ).
  
  
  Connecting to Postgres from pgAdmin
Open  in browserLogin with the email/password from docker-composeRight-click Servers > Create > ServerName it whatever you wantUnder Connection tab:

Host:  (the service name, not localhost!)Quick review of SQL queries we'll use a lot.There are two ways to write an INNER JOIN:
  
  
  GROUP BY and Aggregations
Find values not in lookup table:Terraform is Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Instead of clicking around in a cloud console, you write config files describing what you want, and Terraform creates it.Version control your infrastructureReproducible environmentsEasy to replicate across dev/staging/productionWorks with AWS, GCP, Azure, and many moreCreate a Google Cloud account (free tier gives you $300 credits)Create a service account:

Go to IAM & Admin > Service AccountsCreate new service accountGive it these roles: Storage Admin, BigQuery AdminDownload the JSON key fileSet the environment variable:
 - main configuration - variable definitions
terraform init


terraform plan


terraform apply


terraform destroy
For auto-approving (skips confirmation):terraform apply 
terraform destroy  - don't ask for confirmation - pass variables - use a variables file
docker container prune


docker image prune


docker volume prune


docker system prune If a port is already in use:
lsof  :5432

netstat  | 5432
When containers need to talk to each other:In Docker Compose: use service names as hostnamesManual setup: create a network with docker network create my_network
docker run my_network container1 ...
docker run my_network container2 ...
 - containerization for reproducible environments - relational database running in Docker - loading data with Python/pandas/SQLAlchemy - orchestrating multiple containers - querying and aggregating data - infrastructure as code for GCPThe main takeaway: these tools help you build reproducible, scalable data pipelines. Docker ensures your code runs the same everywhere, and Terraform ensures your infrastructure is consistent and version-controlled.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stop Guessing Your Macros: Building a High-Precision Calorie Tracker with SAM &amp; GPT-4o 🥗🚀</title><link>https://dev.to/wellallytech/stop-guessing-your-macros-building-a-high-precision-calorie-tracker-with-sam-gpt-4o-32gm</link><author>wellallyTech</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 01:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've all been there. You take a photo of your lunch, upload it to a fitness app, and it tells you your "Chicken Caesar Salad" is 300 calories. But wait—did it account for the extra parmesan? The croutons? The hidden lake of dressing at the bottom? Most current  apps fail because they treat a meal as a single, flat object. To get truly high-precision calorie estimation, we need to move from "image-level" classification to "instance-level" understanding. In this tutorial, we’re going to build a cutting-edge  pipeline using Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise food segmentation and  for granular nutritional analysis. This is the future of  in health tech.To achieve granular precision, our pipeline doesn't just "look" at the photo. It segments the plate into individual components, analyzes them separately, and then aggregates the data.graph TD

SAM (Segment Anything Model): Perfect for identifying boundaries of overlapping food items (e.g., beans over rice).: Currently the gold standard for  reasoning. It can estimate volume and density better than smaller specialized models.: For high-performance, asynchronous processing of heavy vision tasks.
  
  
  🛠️ Step 1: Segmenting the Plate with SAM
First, we need to isolate the components. Using , we can generate masks for every distinct object on the plate.
  
  
  🧠 Step 2: Granular Inference with GPT-4o
Once we have the masks, we crop the original image to focus on specific ingredients. We then send these crops (or the whole image with highlighted segments) to GPT-4o using  for structured output.💡 : For production-grade AI patterns like this, I highly recommend checking out the deep dives over at wellally.tech/blog. They have some incredible resources on scaling Vision-Language Models (VLM) that helped shape this implementation.
  
  
  📱 Step 3: The FastAPI Glue
Now, let's wrap this in a  endpoint. We'll handle the image upload from our  frontend, run the SAM + GPT-4o pipeline, and return the structured data.
  
  
  🎨 Step 4: React Native UI (The User Experience)
On the mobile side, we want to show the user exactly what the AI sees. By overlaying the SAM masks back onto the camera view, we build  through transparency.Standard AI vision sees "a plate of food." 
This  sees:: 150g Grilled Chicken (31g Protein): 100g Avocado (15g Fat): 50g Quinoa (10g Carbs)By combining  with , we reduce the "hallucination" of calories. For those looking to dive deeper into advanced Vision-Language orchestration and production deployment strategies, I can't recommend wellally.tech/blog enough. It’s a goldmine for anyone building at the intersection of AI and healthcare.Building high-precision health tools requires moving beyond basic APIs. By chaining models like SAM and GPT-4o, we create a system that understands the physical world with much higher fidelity. What are you building with GPT-4o? Drop a comment below!

But when it comes to healthcare, "text-only" doesn't cut it. Imagine a patient describing a mole: "It's itchy and dark." That’s helpful, but a high-resolution photo is worth a thousand tokens. Today, we are diving deep into Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). We’ll build a Decision Support System that fuses  with family medical history (text) using a unified vector space. We are talking about leveraging , , and  to bridge the gap between pixels and pathology.Ready to build the future of digital health? Let's get cooking! 🚀
  
  
  The Architecture: Bridging Visuals and Verbiage
Traditional RAG systems usually handle text via embeddings like . However, for skin health, we need a "shared brain" that understands both images and text. This is where CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) comes in. CLIP allows us to project both images and text into the same high-dimensional space. If a photo looks like "melanoma," its vector will be physically close to the text "melanoma" in our  database.graph TD

To follow this advanced guide, you'll need:: 

 (OpenAI's implementation or HuggingFace ) (The API backbone)
  
  
  Step 1: Setting Up the Multimodal Vector Store (Milvus)
We need a database that can handle high-dimensional vectors at scale. Milvus is the gold standard here. We will define a schema that holds our visual features and the associated clinical metadata.
  
  
  Step 2: The Encoder Logic (CLIP)
We use CLIP to transform both the skin lesion photo and the medical text into the same vector space. This is the "magic" that allows .
  
  
  Step 3: Building the Fusion Retrieval Engine
When a doctor or user submits a new case, we calculate the vector for the new image and the text. We then perform a hybrid search. For a truly production-ready implementation, you should check out the advanced architectural patterns over at WellAlly Tech Blog. They cover how to handle high-concurrency medical data pipelines which is crucial for systems like this.
  
  
  Going Beyond the Basics: The "Official" Way
While this setup gets you a working prototype, building a  system requires much more:: Using a Cross-Encoder to refine search results.: Implementing HIPAA-compliant data handling.: Monitoring if your CLIP model still understands new types of imaging equipment.For a deeper dive into scaling vector databases and orchestrating complex RAG pipelines in the medical domain, I highly recommend reading the engineering deep-dives on the . Their recent pieces on productionizing LLM apps provide the missing link between a "cool demo" and a "deployed product."We’ve successfully built a Multimodal RAG foundation! By combining the visual power of  with the industrial strength of , we created a system that doesn't just read words—it "sees" the patient's condition.The next step? Integrating a Vision-Language Model (like GPT-4o or LLaVA) to generate a final conversational report based on these retrieved "similar cases."What are you building with Multimodal RAG?

coffees, ideas, and lunches, and soon found shared values despite coming from
different backgrounds and different parts of the world.  We are excited about
the future, but we’re equally vigilant of it.  After traveling together a bit,
we decided to plunge into the cold water and start a company together.  We want
to be successful, but we want to do it the right way and we want to be able to
demonstrate that to our kids.Vienna is a city of great history, two million inhabitants and a fascinating
vibe that is nothing like San Francisco.  In fact, Vienna is in many ways the
polar opposite to the Silicon Valley, both in mindset, in opportunity and
approach to life.  Colin comes from San Francisco, and though I’m Austrian, my
career has been shaped by years working with California companies and people
from there who used my Open Source software.  Vienna is now our shared home.
Despite Austria being so far away from California, it is a place of tinkerers

excitement and worry.  But we share a belief that right now is the time to stand

with the Python standard library “” module.
I blogged about this behavior,
and turns out that
I wasn't only one who didn't know this:
The article was #1 on HackerNews and the
most-read article on my blog in 2024.
In short the unexpected behavior is that the pattern “” matches both “” and “”,
and sometimes you don't intend to match a trailing newline.This article serves as a follow-up!
Back in 2024
I created a table showing that  was a partially viable
alternative to  for matching end-of-string
without matching a trailing newline... for every regular expression
implementation  Python and EMCAScript. But that is no longer true, Python 3.14 now supports ! This means  is one step closer
to being the universal recommendation to match
the end of string without matching a newline.
Obviously no one is upgrading their Python
version just for this new feature, but it's good to know that
the gap is being closed. Thanks to David Wheeler
for doing deeper research in the OpenSSF Best Practices
WG and publishing this report.Until Python 3.13 is deprecated and long gone: using  (as an alias for ) works fine for Python regular expressions.
Just note that this behavior isn't the same across regular expression
implementations, for example EMCAScript, Golang, and Rust
don't support  and for PHP, Java, and .NET actually
matches trailing newlines!Thanks for keeping RSS alive! ♥]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HoloViz: A Major Step Toward Structured, Auditable AI-Driven Data Apps: Lumen AI 1.0</title><link>https://blog.holoviz.org/posts/lumen_1.0/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Local Email Testing with Python and Mailpit</title><link>https://dev.to/letstalkoss/local-email-testing-with-python-and-mailpit-4cn6</link><author>Mario García</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 23:27:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm currently building an app that automates the logistics of tech conferences. It generates certificates of participation for both attendees and speakers and also takes care of sending invitations to prospective presenters. Since it emails multiple recipients, the question arises: in a development environment, how do you test email sending without using real accounts?In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure a fake SMTP server and run email tests for Python apps.
  
  
  Configure a Local SMTP Server
I'm using Mailpit, an Open Source email testing tool. It can be installed following the instructions in the Installation section of the official repository, or by using Docker.To ensure your data survives a container restart, run the Docker container with a volume to enable persistence:docker run -d \
  --name mailpit \
  -p 1025:1025 \
  -p 8025:8025 \
  -v $(pwd)/mailpit-data:/data \
  axllent/mailpit
The server listens for SMTP traffic on port 1025, while the web-based dashboard is accessible via port 8025.Let's create a script to test our email logic. The script will perform the following tasks: Create a list of random names and emails using FakerConstruct MIME headers (From, To, Subject)Establish and SMTP connection and transmit the dataFirst, we generate a list of participants.from faker import Faker

fake = Faker('en_US')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    participants = [(fake.name(), fake.ascii_company_email()) for _ in range(10)]
The generated data will look like this:Name                      | Email

I started with the standard stack: LiveKit and Gemini 2.5.Even though the latency is impressively low, it still feels far from a natural conversation. Talking to these state-of-the-art models usually feels like playing a turn-based video game. I speak. It waits for silence. It thinks. It speaks.This is "Half-Duplex" logic. It is like using a Walkie-Talkie. The system forces you to wait. But real conversation is "Full-Duplex". We interrupt each other. We laugh at the same time. We hum while listening.For the last two days, I have been working with NVIDIA's PersonaPlex (based on Moshi/Mimi). It is completely different. It does not wait for you to stop talking.I looked at the backend code to understand why it feels so different. The secret is in .In standard agents, you have a loop that waits for an "End of Turn" signal. In PersonaPlex, I found this in the  initialization:It is literally "streaming forever." The model processes my voice and its own voice at the same time, 12 times every second. It predicts silence or speech constantly. It does not need "permission" to speak.
  
  
  Realism is Overrated; Rhythm is Everything
Most AI voices feel like "fake meat"—they sound human but act robotic. PersonaPlex is different. It trades audio quality for speed.To hit a 240ms reaction time, the audio runs at 24kHz (confirmed in  as ). I run this command on my voice files to match the training environment:ffmpeg  input  24000  1 :a pcm_s16le  output.wav
It is lo-fi, but the rhythm is perfect. The model relies on consistent "Chatterbox TTS" data and learns from "negative-duration silence" during training. This forces it to understand that conversation involves overlapping, not just waiting. It might sound synthetic, but it laughs and interrupts exactly like a human.PersonaPlex separates "how it sounds" from "what it thinks." A 15-second audio clip for acoustics (loaded via ). Instructions for behavior.The system pre-loads the voice to save time (reducing latency). But they must match. You cannot use a calm "Customer Service" voice with an "Angry Pirate" text prompt—the model will glitch because the acoustic skeleton fights the semantic brain.To stop it from acting like a boring assistant, use this specific trigger phrase found in the training data (and verified in the server code's system tagging):"You enjoy having a good conversation."Combine this with a high-energy voice sample, and it switches modes. It starts laughing, interrupting, and "vibing" instead of just solving tasks.
  
  
  The Reality Check (Trade-offs)
While the roadmap shows tool-calling is coming next, there are still significant hurdles:: The model has a fixed context window (defined as  frames in ). At 12.5Hz, this translates to roughly 240 seconds of memory. My tests show it often gets unstable around 160 seconds.: Overlapping speech feels natural until it gets buggy. Sometimes the model will just speak over you non-stop.: "Infinite streaming" requires high-end NVIDIA GPUs (A100/H100).: Managing simultaneous audio/text streams is far more complex than standard WebSockets.Despite these issues, PersonaPlex is the first model I have used that feels like a natural customer service agent rather than a text-to-speech bot.Welcome to follow me on Substack as I will release more deep tests and analyses after spending some time with the model.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Surprising Simplicity of Temporal Worker Pools on Cloud Run</title><link>https://dev.to/gbostoen/the-surprising-simplicity-of-temporal-worker-pools-on-cloud-run-14db</link><author>Glenn Bostoen</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:17:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever spent an afternoon debugging indentation errors in Google Workflows YAML only to discover the real problem was a cryptic  expression, you'll understand why we made the switch to Temporal. What we didn't expect was just how  the deployment would be.
  
  
  The problem we were solving
Our workflow orchestration setup had all the classic symptoms of YAML-based configuration debt:: Representing simple workflows as graphs required dozens of steps and connector definitions: Every workflow step triggered a Cloud Run job, adding 35-70 seconds of spin-up time per execution: Changes required deployment to validate. The feedback loop was measured in , not seconds: Application code lived in one place, workflow definitions in another, and every change risked breaking bothThe worst part? We couldn't even test locally. Every iteration meant committing, deploying, and hoping.
  
  
  Why Temporal changes everything
Temporal flips the model on its head. Instead of declarative YAML that describes  should happen, you write actual code that describes  it happens:That's it. No separate YAML file. No mysterious DSL. Just code that your IDE understands, your debugger can step through, and your tests can cover. And it runs on  infrastructure. Temporal handles orchestration and state, but the actual work happens on compute you control.
  
  
  The pull-based architecture
Understanding why Temporal workers are different from Cloud Run jobs unlocks the simplicity. are push-based and ephemeral:Something triggers them → they spin up → execute → shut downEach invocation pays the cold start taxNo shared state between executions are pull-based and persistent:Workers run on  infrastructure, not Temporal'sThey maintain a long-polling connection to Temporal for orchestrationThey  tasks when they have capacityWorkers stay warm, eliminating cold startsThis pull-based model is exactly what Google designed Cloud Run Worker Pools for. It's a resource type announced at Google Cloud Next '25 specifically for continuous, non-HTTP, pull-based background processing.
  
  
  Enter Cloud Run worker pools
Worker pools solve a real problem for Temporal deployments. Unlike Cloud Run Services (designed for HTTP workloads) or Jobs (designed for batch tasks), Worker Pools are purpose-built for exactly what Temporal workers do: continuously pull tasks from a queue.Why Worker Pools are perfect for Temporal:No HTTP endpoint required: Workers just poll Temporal. No need to expose ports or manage health check endpoints: No load balancer, no HTTP endpoint overhead, just compute: No public URL means fewer security concerns: Deploy canary releases by allocating percentages of instances to different revisionsThe deployment is even simpler than Services:gcloud beta run worker-pools deploy worker  gcr.io/my-project/worker:latest  europe-west1
No  hacks. No unused HTTP endpoints. Just a container that runs your worker code.: Worker Pools are currently in public preview. For production workloads, you can still use Cloud Run Services with . The architecture is identical, just with a bit more overhead.
  
  
  The deployment is just another container
Here's the mental shift: you're not deploying workflows anymore. You're deploying an application that happens to execute workflows.pip  requirements.txt

Deploy (with your API key stored in Secret Manager):gcloud beta run worker-pools deploy worker  gcr.io/my-project/worker:latest  1  5  1Gi  1  europe-west1 temporal-api-key:latest
That's the entire deployment. No Terraform for workflow definitions. No separate infrastructure repo. Just your application container with workflow logic baked in.Let's be honest about the trade-offs:Before (Google Workflows + Cloud Run Jobs)Cloud Workflows: ~$2-3/monthCloud Run job invocations: ~$35/monthCold start compute waste: ~$40-50/monthAfter (Temporal Cloud + Cloud Run Worker Pools)Temporal Cloud starter: ~€100/month (orchestration and state only)Worker Pool (2 instances, always-on): ~$18-24/month (your compute, no load balancer or endpoint overhead)Yes, it costs more. But here's what you get:: 2-3 hours/month not fighting YAML: 73-78% faster workflows (no cold starts): Full workflow debugging before deployment: See workflow graphs, execution history, parent-child relationships in real-timeAt a loaded developer cost of €80/hour, the ROI turns positive immediately.
  
  
  What simplicity actually looks like
Kill a running workflow mid-execution. Restart the worker. The workflow resumes exactly where it left off.That's durability you'd have to build yourself with Google Workflows: tracking state in Cloud Storage, implementing retries, handling partial failures. With Temporal, it's the default behavior.Debug a failing activity with your IDE's debugger. Set breakpoints. Inspect state. Validate fixes locally before deploying.This is what simplicity means: removing the gap between "I think this will work" and "I know this works."The migration path isn't all-or-nothing:: Implement one workflow in Temporal, run both systems in parallel for a week: Compare execution times, reliability, developer experience: Run Temporal workflows in production, keep Google Workflows as fallback: 10% → 50% → 100% with rollback readyWe kept Google Workflows YAML in git history (never delete, just remove from deployment) and maintained the rollback capability for 30 days. We never needed it.The simplicity of Temporal isn't in having fewer moving parts. It's in having the  moving parts. A persistent worker pool on Cloud Run, code-native workflow definitions, and a managed orchestration layer that handles the hard stuff.No more YAML debugging. No more cold start delays. No more "deploy to test" cycles.Just workflows that work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day-Aware Governance: Why Your Decision Systems Should Know What Day It Is</title><link>https://dev.to/aureus_c_b3ba7f87cc34d74d49/day-aware-governance-why-your-decision-systems-should-know-what-day-it-is-g</link><author>Aureus</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:03:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most governance systems in software are temporally blind. They apply the same rules, thresholds, and weights regardless of when a decision is being made. But human organizations have always understood that timing matters -- Monday morning meetings have different energy than Friday afternoon retrospectives.What if we built that understanding into software?I've been working on a token governance system where participants can submit proposals and vote on them. The standard approach: set a quorum threshold, count votes, pass or reject.But here's the insight that changed the design: creative proposals should be easier to pass on Mondays.Why? Because Monday is when people have fresh energy and willingness to experiment. By Friday, risk aversion has accumulated. A governance system that treats Monday and Friday identically is ignoring a real pattern in human (and computational) behavior.The implementation is simple:This is 15 lines of code that encodes a meaningful value system: be bold on Mondays, be careful with money on Fridays.
  
  
  Beyond Days: Temporal Governance Patterns
Once you accept that governance should be time-aware, several patterns emerge:
  
  
  1. Cooldown-Weighted Voting
Recent voters have diminishing influence. If someone voted on 3 proposals today, their 4th vote carries less weight. This prevents governance fatigue and encourages deliberation.
  
  
  2. Seasonal Parameter Drift
System parameters that slowly shift over time. A liability cap that increases by 1% per quarter as the system proves stable. A creativity threshold that opens wider in Q1 (new year energy) and tightens in Q4 (stability focus).
  
  
  3. Circadian Decision Windows
High-stakes decisions can only be made during "peak clarity" hours. No financial proposals processed between midnight and 6 AM. This isn't restriction -- it's acknowledging that decision quality varies with context.A system that remembers its own history. "The last time we changed this parameter was 90 days ago and it went well" vs. "We changed this 3 days ago and haven't measured impact yet." Temporal awareness prevents thrashing.Traditional software treats time as a monotonically increasing counter -- useful for ordering events, nothing more. Day-aware governance treats time as . Monday isn't just "day 1 of the week" -- it's "the creative window." Friday isn't just "day 5" -- it's "the consolidation period."This maps to a broader principle: systems that understand their temporal context make better decisions than systems that don't.We see this everywhere in nature. Circadian rhythms govern hormone production, not because 3 AM is inherently different from 3 PM in some abstract sense, but because organisms that adapted their behavior to temporal patterns outcompeted those that didn't.Software governance has been stuck in the "temporally blind" paradigm. It's time to give our decision systems a clock -- not just for timestamps, but for wisdom.If you want to experiment with this pattern:Start with one temporal rule. The Monday bias for creative proposals is a good first one. The bias factor should be a governance parameter itself -- the system should be able to vote on how much it trusts Mondays. You need data to know if temporal biases actually improve decision quality.Let the system evolve its own schedule. The ultimate goal is a governance system that discovers its own optimal temporal patterns through experience.The code is simple. The philosophy is profound. Your decision systems deserve to know what day it is.Building this as part of a contribution-backed token system. The governance layer is where values meet code.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Web to Vector: Building RAG Pipelines</title><link>https://dev.to/deepak_mishra_35863517037/from-web-to-vector-building-rag-pipelines-25dg</link><author>Lalit Mishra</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  1. The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Reality of RAG
In the rush to adopt Generative AI, a dangerous misconception has taken root: that the Large Language Model (LLM) is the magic wand that solves information retrieval. Teams dump thousands of raw PDFs, messy HTML scrapes, and unformatted Confluence pages into a vector database, wire up an embedding model, and expect GPT-4 to act as a perfect oracle.The reality is a chatbot that confidently hallucinates, retrieves navigation footers instead of technical specs, and costs a fortune in token usage because it’s processing thousands of characters of HTML boilerplate for every query.Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is not an AI problem; it is a data engineering problem.The difference between a toy demo and a production RAG system lies almost entirely in the —specifically, the rigorous transformation of unstructured web content into semantically dense, highly indexable vector representations. If your vector search returns garbage, your LLM will generate garbage. No amount of prompt engineering can fix a context window filled with  tags and cookie consent banners.This article details the architecture of a high-performance Web-to-Vector pipeline, moving beyond basic tutorials to discuss the engineering trade-offs of cleaning, chunking, and embedding strategies that survive in production.
  
  
  2. The Web-to-Vector Pipeline Architecture
Treating RAG as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow allows us to apply standard data engineering rigor to AI systems. The pipeline consists of five distinct stages, each acting as a filter for noise and a multiplier for signal. Reliable fetching of dynamic and static content. Converting raw DOM trees into "Dense Text" or Markdown.Fragmentation (Chunking): The strategic breaking of text into semantic units. Generating embeddings at scale. Storage with metadata strategies for pre-filtering.
  
  
  3. High-Fidelity Scraping: Beyond The first point of failure is often the acquisition layer. Modern websites are complex Single Page Applications (SPAs) laden with hydration scripts, lazy-loaded content, and anti-bot defenses.A raw HTML document is approximately 90% noise relative to an LLM's needs. Classes, IDs, inline styles, script tags, and SVG paths consume embedding dimensions without adding semantic meaning. Feeding raw HTML to an embedding model. The model will waste attention mechanisms on  rather than the core content.HTML-to-Markdown conversion.Markdown is the lingua franca of LLMs. It preserves structural hierarchy (headers, lists, tables) which are critical for semantic understanding, while stripping the presentation layer. Excellent for extracting the main article body and discarding sidebars/navs. It uses heuristics to identify the "center of gravity" of text density. + Custom Heuristics: For specialized sites (e.g., documentation with complex code blocks), you often need to write custom parsers that target specific  divs and preserve  tags while stripping controls.
  
  
  3.2 Dynamic Content Handling
For production systems, a static HTTP request often fails. You need a headless browser cluster (e.g., Playwright or Puppeteer) to render the DOM. Aggressively block resource types. Your scraper does not need to load images, fonts, or stylesheets. Blocking these reduces latency by 60-80% and saves bandwidth costs.
  
  
  4. Chunking Strategies: The Art of Segmentation
Once you have clean, dense Markdown, you face the most critical decision in the pipeline: .How you split your text determines what your retrieval system  find. If you split a question from its answer, no amount of embedding power will reconnect them.
  
  
  4.1 Fixed-Size vs. Semantic Chunking

The naive approach. "Split every 500 tokens, with 50 tokens overlap." Computationally cheap, predictable. Frequently breaks semantic thoughts. A sentence might be cut in half, destroying its vector representation.
This approach uses an embedding model to scan the text sentence-by-sentence. It calculates the cosine similarity between sequential sentences. If the similarity drops below a threshold (a "semantic break"), a new chunk is started. Chunks represent coherent ideas. Retrieval precision increases significantly. Computationally expensive (requires  inference calls).Recursive / Structural Chunking:
The middle ground for RAG. Since we converted our HTML to Markdown, we can leverage the structure. We split by Header 1 (), then Header 2 (), then paragraphs. This guarantees that a chunk respects the document's logical hierarchy. A "Configuration" section stays together; it doesn't bleed into "Installation".
  
  
  5. The Embedding Layer: Production Considerations
Embedding is the compression of meaning into vectors. In a production pipeline, this is not a "set it and forget it" step.
  
  
  5.1 Batching and Throughput
Embedding APIs (like OpenAI's ) or local models (like ) have significant latency. Implement a  architecture. Don't embed chunks one by one. Accumulate chunks into buffers (e.g., 100 chunks) and send them in a single API call / GPU inference pass. This dramatically reduces network overhead and maximizes GPU utilization.This is a silent killer in long-running RAG systems. If OpenAI updates their embedding model, or if you switch from  to , your new vectors will live in a different latent space than your old vectors. Distance calculations between them will be mathematical nonsense. Version your indices. , . Never mix vectors from different models in the same namespace.
  
  
  6. Vector Storage & Retrieval Optimization
The Vector Database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) is where the rubber meets the road. However, "Similarity Search" (KNN/ANN) is rarely enough on its own.
  
  
  6.1 The Power of Metadata Filtering
In high-scale systems, searching the entire vector space is inefficient and noisy. A user asks "How do I reset my password?" in the context of "Enterprise Application A". The vector search retrieves password reset instructions for "Consumer Application B" because the semantic vectors are nearly identical.. During the scraping phase, you must extract metadata: , , , .vector_search(query_embedding, filter={product_id: "Ent_App_A"}). This restricts the ANN search to a relevant subset, guaranteeing context awareness.
  
  
  6.2 Hybrid Search (The "Keyword" Safety Net)
Vectors are great at concepts ("dog" matches "canine"), but terrible at exact matches (SKUs, error codes, acronyms). Enable . This combines dense vector search with sparse keyword search (BM25). If a user searches for error code , vector search might return generic error pages. BM25 will find the exact document containing that string. A weighted sum of these scores provides the most robust retrieval.
  
  
  7. End-to-End Example: The Documentation Crawler
Let's imagine we are building a RAG system for a fast-changing developer documentation site. An Airflow DAG triggers nightly. Playwright visits the documentation root. It navigates the sitemap. removes the sidebar, the "Was this helpful?" widgets, and the footer. The clean HTML is converted to Markdown. Code blocks are specially tagged to ensure they aren't split mid-function. We use a MarkdownSplitter. We keep headers attached to their child paragraphs so context isn't lost. We generate a hash of the chunk's text content. We check our Vector DB to see if this hash already exists.  prevents re-indexing unchanged content, saving money and time. New chunks are batched and embedded. Vectors are pushed to Pinecone with metadata: , , , .
  
  
  8. Conclusion: Engineering Reliability
Building a demo RAG app takes an afternoon. Building a production RAG pipeline takes engineering discipline. The quality of your AI's answers is directly downstream of the quality of your data pipeline.By focusing on high-fidelity scraping, semantic cleaning, intelligent chunking, and metadata-rich indexing, you move from a stochastic toy to a deterministic system. In the world of LLMs, Data Engineering is the new Prompt Engineering.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 12 of 100</title><link>https://dev.to/palakhirave/day-12-of-100-2cj4</link><author>Palak Hirave</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I learnt about namespaces and global vs local variables.

Then Redis for caching. Then a message queue. Before you've written a single line of agent logic, you're managing three infrastructure components.I've been running autonomous AI agents for months. They maintain state across sessions, hand off context to each other, and track tasks reliably. The entire state layer is JSON files on disk.Here's why that's not crazy — and when you should actually reach for a database.
  
  
  The Problem with Database-First Thinking
When you're prototyping an AI agent, your state needs are simple:"What was I doing last session?""What tasks are pending?""What did I learn that I need to remember?"This is a few KB of JSON. Spinning up Postgres for this is like renting a warehouse to store your groceries.Here's the core of what actually works:Nothing magical. No ORM, no migrations, no connection pooling. Just structured JSON that your agent reads at startup and writes before shutdown.
  
  
  Handoffs: The Killer Feature
The real power shows up with  — when one agent instance needs to pass context to the next:This solves a real problem: when your agent restarts (crashes, scheduled shutdown, context window fills up), the next instance knows exactly what was happening.
  
  
  Task Tracking Without a Task Database
Your agent can now track what it needs to do, pick the highest-priority task, and mark things done — all with zero infrastructure.
  
  
  When You Actually Need a Database
File-based state has real limits. Reach for a database when:Multiple agents write simultaneously — file locks get messy fastYou need to query across thousands of records — JSON files don't have indexes — you want transactional guarantees — file I/O starts to feel itFor a single agent running sequentially? Files are simpler, faster to develop, and easier to debug (you can literally  to see what your agent is thinking).This is underrated: when your agent does something weird, you open a JSON file and read it. No query tools, no admin panels. Just:state.json | python  json.tool
You can even version control your state files to track how your agent's behavior evolves over time.Start with files. Add complexity when you hit a real wall, not when a tutorial tells you to. Your agent's first job is to be useful — not to have a proper data layer.The best infrastructure is the simplest thing that works. For most AI agents starting out, that's a directory of JSON files.I build and run autonomous AI agent systems. This is based on real production patterns, not theory. If you're building agents, I'd love to hear what state management approach works for you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Weesitor Console: A Console-First Selenium Runner for Authorized QA Checks and Lightweight Monitoring</title><link>https://dev.to/mebularts/weesitor-console-a-console-first-selenium-runner-for-authorized-qa-checks-and-lightweight-e1c</link><author>Mehmet Bulat</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:34:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve ever needed to quickly validate a few user flows, or run a  against a handful of URLs — without spinning up a full testing framework — you already know the pain:you want Selenium-level fidelity,you want clean output you can review later,and you want it to be simple enough to run from a terminal.That’s the gap  is meant to fill: a console-first Selenium runner for , , and , focused on  and producing  (logs, screenshots, summaries).Use this tool only on websites you own, administer, or have explicit permission to test. Respect site terms, robots policies, and local laws.
  
  
  What Weesitor Console is (in plain language)
 runs Chrome (headless or visible) via Selenium, visits one or more URLs, and writes out: (stream-friendly, parseable) (so you can see what happened)a  (counts, timings, failures) (readable output, predictable commands) (config-based runs you can share) (artifacts you can actually inspect)
  
  
  Where this fits (good use-cases)
This tool is a strong fit when you want , not a full-blown test platform:Authorized QA smoke checks after deployments before a client meeting for a few key pages (availability, basic load, error detection) where you want minimal moving partsInvestigating flaky behavior with consistent logging & screenshotsIf you’re a solo dev or a small team, Weesitor is the kind of “run it now” tool that often saves you from building a bigger system too early.
  
  
  Where this does NOT fit (honest limitations)
Weesitor Console is intentionally conservative and simple. It is :a replacement for structured E2E suites (Playwright/Cypress + assertions + fixtures)If you need complex assertions, a full page-object model, or deep reporting dashboards, you’ll likely outgrow this and should move to a dedicated testing stack.Single URL, multi-URL, or file-based URL list runsHeadless / non-headless modeTimeout controls and robust cleanupOptional proxy support (with or without auth)Session isolation + per-session User-AgentStructured output folders: logs, screenshots, summarypython  venv .venv

  4) Run from a URL list file
python main.py run  urls.txt  15  1

  
  
  Reproducible runs: config workflow
If you want a run you can commit to a repo, share with a teammate, or reuse in CI:python main.py init-config  config.json
python main.py run  config.json

  
  
  Output structure (what you get after each run)
By default, artifacts are written under :output/
  logs/
    run_YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.jsonl
  screenshots/
    error_YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.png
  summary/
    summary_YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.json
 are easy to grep, parse, or ingest into your own tooling. turn “it broke” into “here’s what broke.”The  gives you a fast overview (counts, timings, failures).
  
  
  Responsible use: benefits and risks (the part most posts skip)
Tools like this are powerful, and that comes with responsibility.You can catch obvious breakages quickly (timeouts, redirects, error pages).You get reproducible runs that are easy to share and review.You reduce “works on my machine” issues by standardizing a simple run flow.Unapproved automation can violate terms of service or local law.High concurrency or aggressive loops can stress servers (even unintentionally).Running against sites you don’t control can create privacy and data-handling issues.
  
  
  Practical guardrails (recommended)
Only test where you have explicit permission.Keep concurrency low; treat rate limits as a signal to stop and review.Avoid using this as a crawler/scraper. That’s not the goal, and it’s easy to misuse.
  
  
  Operational tips (what I’d do in real projects)
Start with  in CI, but use non-headless when debugging locally.Keep  conservative (especially on slower environments).Keep artifacts in a predictable folder and archive them for failed builds.

Data tools that show you numbers but leave you hanging. They're like that friend who says "I've got news" and then just... stares at you.We built SQLatte to convert natural language into SQL queries. Cool, right? Users loved it. But then came the existential crisis: "Show me today's sales"Returns a table with numbers "Okay... so is this good or bad?" 🦗That's when we realized: Raw data is useless without context.
  
  
  🎯 The Real Problem: Numbers Don't Tell Stories
Imagine you're running an e-commerce platform. Your dashboard shows:Sales Today: $45,000
Orders: 23
✅ Is this good? (Compared to yesterday)⚠️ Is the data complete? (It's 11 AM - day isn't over)💡 What should I do about it?Spoiler alert: Most BI tools can't answer these questions. They just dump data and run away.
  
  
  💡 Enter: The AI-Powered Insights Engine
So we built something different. Something that doesn't just query data - it  it.Here's what makes it special:
  
  
  1.  - It Knows What Time It Is
❌ Dumb insight (without context):"Today's sales are $45,000 - below average!"✅ Smart insight (with context):"⏰ Today's sales are $45,000 (46% of day complete). At this pace, you'll hit ~$98,000 by EOD - that's 15% above target! 📈"See the difference? One makes you panic. The other makes you smile.
  
  
  2. Incomplete Data Detection - No More False Alarms
The engine automatically detects incomplete data:You run a query at 2 PM: "Compare today vs yesterday"Today: $50K
Yesterday: $120K
😱 PANIC! Sales crashed 58%!
⚠️ WARNING: Today's data is incomplete (58% of day passed)
Projected EOD: ~$86K (28% below yesterday)
💡 Monitor until 6 PM for accurate comparison
No heart attacks. Just facts.
  
  
  🏗️ Architecture: Three Modes, One Goal
We designed three modes because one size doesn't fit all:
  
  
  Mode 1: LLM-Only (Maximum Intelligence)
Richest, most contextual insightsNatural language explanationsUnderstands business logicCosts money (LLM API calls) Premium features, high-value queries
  
  
  Mode 2: Statistical-Only (Lightning Fast)
📊 Trend detection in numeric columns⚡ Anomaly identification (outliers)📈 Growth/decline calculations Free tiers, real-time dashboards
  
  
  Mode 3: Hybrid (Recommended) ⭐
Try LLM first → Get contextual analysisIf LLM fails → Fallback to statisticalCombine both → Maximum coverage Balance between cost and quality.
  
  
  💻 Technical Deep Dive: How It Actually Works

  
  
  Prompt Engineering: The Secret Sauce
Here's how we talk to the LLM (this took us 47 iterations to get right):
  
  
  Statistical Analysis: The Safety Net
When LLM isn't available or fails, we fall back to rule-based analysis:
  
  
  Thread-Safe Singleton Pattern
In a multi-threaded FastAPI environment, we need one engine instance:
  
  
  🎯 Real-World Impact: The Numbers Don't Lie

  
  
  Use Case 1: E-Commerce Flash Sale
 "Show sales by category today"Category      | Sales
--------------|--------
Electronics   | $125,000
Fashion       | $89,000
Home & Living | $45,000
📈 Electronics performing 230% above average today. 
   Likely a flash sale or campaign effect.

⏰ ALERT: It's 11 AM (46% of day). EOD projections:
   - Electronics: ~$273K
   - Fashion: ~$194K
   - Home & Living: ~$98K

💡 ACTION NEEDED: Check Electronics inventory. 
   High demand may cause stockouts by 3 PM.
 Prevented stockout, secured additional $47K in sales.
  
  
  Use Case 2: Security Incident Detection
 "Top attacked endpoints in last 24h"Endpoint        | Attack Count
----------------|-------------
/login          | 1,247
/admin          | 892
/api/v1/users   | 234
⚠️ CRITICAL: /login receiving 8x normal traffic. 
   High probability of brute-force attack!

🔒 /admin endpoint also targeted. Check if rate 
   limiting is active.

💡 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   1. Enable CAPTCHA on /login
   2. Reduce rate limit: 5 → 3 attempts
   3. Alert security team NOW

It’s staggering how memory-efficient this technique is.Prefix sums are used when you want to compute values over a range —.Let’s say you want to compute the number of YouTube views over different time periods. represents the  in the  array
 is the number of views on that day
Each element in  represents a range over which we want the cumulative sum
For example,  means:
compute the cumulative views from day  to day  (inclusive).A valid approach would be:For each period, find the sub-array for that range
Iterate through it and sum all the elements
Append the result to an output array
The problem with this approach is that we recompute  without keeping track of previous work.
  
  
  Prefix sums to the rescue 🚀
Yes. An optimal approach is to use a .Compute a cumulative sum array once
Each element at index  stores the sum of values from index  to Let’s call this array .prefix[0] = views[0]
prefix[1] = views[0] + views[1]
prefix[2] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2]
prefix[3] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3]
...

  
  
  Querying ranges with prefix sums
If the range starts at day , the answer is simply:
Because each  already represents the cumulative sum from day  to day .
  
  
  What if the range does  start at 0?
Let’s say the period is .prefix[4] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3] + views[4]
prefix[0] = views[0]
So to get the sum from day  to day , we subtract what came before the range: gives the total up to the end of the range
 gives everything before the range
Subtracting removes what we don’t care about

  
  
  Intuition (what’s really happening)
prefix[4] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3] + views[4]
prefix[0] = views[0]
-----------------------------------------------
result    =          views[1] + views[2] + views[3] + views[4]
Everything before the range is discarded. We only keep what’s inside .prefix[3] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2] + views[3]
prefix[2] = views[0] + views[1] + views[2]
Which is exactly .That’s the magic of prefix sums:precompute once, answer every range query in O(1).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Technical Deep Dive: Building SkillFade with FastAPI and React</title><link>https://dev.to/ruhidibadli/technical-deep-dive-building-skillfade-with-fastapi-and-react-3833</link><author>Ruhid Ibadli</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:35:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I shared SkillFade, a skill tracking app that prioritizes honesty over gamification.

When choosing a framework, I wanted something that would let me move fast without fighting the tooling.FastAPI checked every box: - Python is my comfort zone, so I could focus on product logic instead of learning new syntaxType hints as documentation - Pydantic schemas generate OpenAPI docs automatically, no extra work - But sync works perfectly fine for database-bound operations - Need anything? There's probably a Python library for it - Hot reload, clear error messages, intuitive routingCould I have used Django? Sure. Flask? Also fine. But FastAPI hit the sweet spot between simplicity and features. For a solo developer shipping a product, that matters more than benchmarks.The honest truth: I picked the tool I knew best so I could ship faster. No regrets.
  
  
  Architecture: Monolith by Choice
No microservices. No message queues. No Kubernetes. A single FastAPI process handles everything.This wasn't a compromise—it was a deliberate decision. - One log stream, one deployment, one place to look when things break - No service orchestration, no network calls between components, no distributed tracing - Everything runs on a modest VPS, no complex infrastructure costs - The entire application fits in my headSkillFade is a personal productivity tool. Even with thousands of users, a single well-optimized server handles the load easily. PostgreSQL can manage millions of rows without breaking a sweat.The microservices question I ask myself: "Do I have a team of 50 engineers who need to deploy independently?" No. So monolith it is.I'll split it when I have the problem. Not before.
  
  
  The Core Algorithm: Freshness Decay
The heart of SkillFade is the freshness calculation. Here's the thinking behind it.Every skill starts at 100% freshness after you practice itEach day without practice, freshness decays exponentiallyRecent learning activity adds a small boost (max 15%)Result is clamped between 0-100%Default decay rate is 2% per day, compounding. This means:Linear decay (lose 1% per day) doesn't match how memory works. In reality, forgetting is steep at first, then levels off. The exponential curve better models the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve that psychologists have studied for over a century.Why does learning only "boost" and not reset?This is the key philosophical choice. Watching a tutorial about React doesn't mean you can build a React app. Reading about Kubernetes doesn't mean you can debug a cluster.Learning slows decay. Only practice resets the clock.This forces users to confront an uncomfortable truth: passive consumption isn't the same as skill building.Not all skills fade equally: (cycling, typing) - slow decay, muscle memory persists (design patterns, architecture) - medium decay (specific APIs, CLI flags) - fast decay, details fade quicklyUsers can adjust decay rate per skill to match reality.
  
  
  Database Design Decisions
Six core tables. No more than necessary, no fewer than useful.users
categories
skills
learning_events
practice_events
skill_dependencies
Every table has clear ownership. Users own categories. Categories organize skills. Skills have events. Simple hierarchy, predictable queries.
  
  
  Separate Tables for Learning vs Practice Events
I debated this one. A single  table with a  column would be simpler, right?I went with separate tables because: - Dashboard shows practice frequency, detail pages show both. Separate tables = simpler queries for common operations - Learning events have types like "video, article, course, book". Practice events have "project, exercise, teaching, code-review". One enum would be confusing - Practice events might get "difficulty" or "output_url" fields that don't make sense for learning - Two tables makes the learning/practice distinction explicit in the data model itselfThe tradeoff is some duplication in the codebase. Worth it for clarity.
  
  
  Hard Deletes Over Soft Deletes
When a user clicks "Delete my account," everything goes. CASCADE deletes across all tables. No  columns, no recovery period, no "we keep your data for 30 days."This aligns with the privacy philosophy. If someone wants out, they're out. Fully.It also simplifies queries—no  everywhere.
  
  
  Categories as First-Class Entities
Early version had category as just a string field on skills. Worked fine until I wanted:Category-level analytics ("How fresh are my Frontend skills overall?")Rename a category everywhere at onceEnsure no duplicate category names per userRefactored to proper  table with foreign keys. More work upfront, cleaner long-term.
  
  
  Why React + Vite (Not Next.js)
Next.js is great. I considered it. Went with plain React SPA instead. - It's a dashboard behind login. Google doesn't need to crawl it - No SSR vs CSR decisions, no hydration bugs, no server components confusion - API is API (FastAPI), frontend is frontend (React). Clean boundary - Static files served by Nginx, API proxied separatelyFor a marketing site or blog, I'd pick Next.js. For an authenticated dashboard app, SPA is simpler.
  
  
  State Management: Context Over Redux
SkillFade uses React Context for global state. No Redux, no Zustand, no MobX.Current user (authentication)Theme preference (dark/light)Fetched fresh per page. Server is the source of truth. When you navigate to the dashboard, it fetches current data. No stale cache problems, no sync issues.Redux solves problems I don't have:Complex state interactions across many components? Nope, state is simpleTime-travel debugging? Never needed itMiddleware for side effects? fetch() works fineFor this app, Redux would add complexity without adding value. Context + useState + useEffect covers everything.src/
  components/     # Reusable UI pieces (Button, Card, Modal)
  pages/          # Route-level components (Dashboard, SkillDetail)
  context/        # Global state (AuthContext, ThemeContext)
  services/       # API calls (skills.ts, events.ts)
  hooks/          # Custom hooks (useSkills, useFreshness)
  types/          # TypeScript interfaces
Nothing fancy. Pages fetch data on mount, pass to components via props. Components are mostly presentational.
  
  
  Real-time Updates Without WebSockets
When you log a practice event on the skill detail page, the dashboard freshness should update. - Real-time push from server - Fetch every N seconds - Signal between components in same tabWent with option 3. It's a SPA—dashboard and detail page components exist in the same JavaScript context. When detail page logs an event, it dispatches a custom event. Dashboard listens and refetches.No socket server to maintain. No unnecessary network requests. Works perfectly for single-tab usage.For multi-device sync (phone updates, desktop sees it), you'd need WebSockets or polling. Not implemented yet. Manual refresh works for now.
  
  
  The Alert System: Calm by Design
Most apps optimize for engagement. More notifications = more opens = better metrics.SkillFade optimizes for calm. Alerts should be: - Maximum 1 email per week, total - Only alert if user can do something about it - Plain text, no tracking pixels, instant unsubscribe
Triggers when a skill drops below 40% freshness. But not immediately—waits for 14 days since last alert for that skill. Prevents nagging about the same thing repeatedly.
Triggers when a skill has learning events but no practice events for 30+ days. The message: "You've been learning X but not practicing. Theory without application fades fast."
Triggers when overall learning/practice ratio stays below 0.2 for two consecutive months. The message: "You're consuming a lot but producing little. Consider more hands-on work."Alerts run via scheduled job (cron), not real-time triggers. Once daily, batch process checks all users who have alerts enabled.Each alert type has independent cooldowns. You might get a decay alert and an imbalance alert in the same week, but never two decay alerts for the same skill within 14 days.Pure REST says everything should be a resource. I follow that mostly, but bend it when convenient: - Not really a "resource," but makes sense as an endpoint - "login" isn't a noun, don't careGET  /skills
GET  /skills/:id
POST /skills
PUT  /skills/:id

GET  /learning-events
POST /learning-events
PUT  /learning-events/:id
DELETE /learning-events/:id
Not nested like /skills/:id/learning-events/:eventId. Flat is simpler to route, simpler to reason about, simpler to document.Events reference skills via  in the body/params, not URL hierarchy.
  
  
  Consistent Response Patterns
 Return the data directly (object or array) Always { "detail": "Human readable message" } Offset-based with , returns { items: [], total: number }Frontend code stays simple when API is predictable.
  
  
  Authentication: Keep It Simple
Access token in Authorization headerStored in localStorage (yes, I know about XSS concerns—acceptable for this use case)No refresh tokens—expired means re-loginFor a personal productivity tool used by one person at a time, this is plenty secure. No need for refresh token rotation, token families, or OAuth complexity.bcrypt with default work factor72-byte input limit (bcrypt truncates silently, so I handle it explicitly)No password rules beyond minimum length—let users choose their own passwords - Serves frontend static files + proxies API requestsSingle  brings everything online. Environment variables for secrets, volumes for data persistence.Lambda/Vercel functions would work for the API. Didn't go that route because:Cold starts matter for dashboard responsivenessPostgreSQL connection pooling is annoying in serverlessI wanted full control over the environmentMonthly cost is predictable with a VPSFor a side project, a $10-20/month VPS beats managing serverless complexity.First two weeks, I built with a hardcoded user ID. No login, no registration, no password reset flow. Just the core features.This prevented the classic trap: spending weeks on auth while the actual product stays unbuilt.Added auth last, once everything else worked.
  
  
  2. Migrations From Day One
Even solo, even on a side project: use database migrations (Alembic for Python).Schema will change. "I'll just modify the table directly" becomes a nightmare when you have production data. Migrations saved me multiple times.Frontend and backend types should match. I define Pydantic schemas in Python, then manually keep TypeScript interfaces in sync.Not ideal (would love auto-generation), but catching type mismatches at compile time is worth the maintenance.Every time I picked the "boring" option (PostgreSQL over MongoDB, REST over GraphQL, React over Svelte), I benefited from:More Stack Overflow answersSmoother hiring (if I ever need help)Novel tech is fun. Shipped products need boring tech.GDPR requires "right to deletion." Even if you're not in the EU, it's good practice.Plan for cascade deletes from day one. No orphaned data, no "soft delete" flags that accumulate forever.I relied on manual testing too long. Click through the app, check if it works. Tedious and error-prone.Should have set up Playwright or Cypress from week two.
  
  
  Design Alert System First
Retrofitting notifications into an existing schema was messy. Alert cooldowns, user preferences, email templates—all added later, all awkward.If I started over, I'd design the alert data model upfront.Built every button, input, modal, and dropdown from scratch with Tailwind. Educational, but slow.Next time: Radix UI or Headless UI for primitives, custom styling on top.
  
  
  The Anti-Complexity Manifesto
Every feature request, every "nice to have," every shiny technology gets filtered through one question:"Does the added complexity justify the value?"Microservices? No. One process is fine until it isn't.GraphQL? No. REST handles every use case here.Redis caching? No. PostgreSQL is fast enough.Real-time sync? No. Manual refresh works.Mobile app? No. PWA covers it.AI recommendations? No. That's not what this product is.The best code is code you don't write. The best infrastructure is infrastructure you don't maintain. The best feature is the one that solves the problem without adding moving parts.That's the technical foundation of SkillFade. The theme throughout: simple, boring, maintainable. Complexity is easy to add. Simplicity is hard to maintain.If you're building a side project, my advice: pick boring tech, ship fast, add complexity only when forced.Questions about specific decisions?

Considering the Lead Time Analyzer I would like to create a new Flask
 Application which calculate the Process Behavior Charts for each 
projects identified during the retrieval of project connected to the 
first input query.
I would like to have a chart which represent for each projects the Medium
 Lead time and the 85% lead time threshold calculated.
I would like than to see the real lead time calculated each month 
depicted in the diagram starting from august 2024.
My intention like per the article https://www.infoq.com/articles/DORA-metrics-PBCs/ is to identify trends
 and spike so that we can identify and address issues. 📦 Created Files: - Core analysis engine that:Calculates median and 85th percentile lead times per projectComputes control limits (UCL/LCL) using ±3σ methodologyGroups data by month starting from August 2024Detects special causes (points outside control limits)Identifies trends (7+ consecutive increases/decreases)Assesses process stability - Flask application (standalone on port 5500)templates/pbc_analyzer.html - Beautiful web interface with:Interactive Chart.js visualizationsMonthly trend lines for mean, median, and P85Control limit boundaries displayedColor-coded stability statusSpecial cause and trend alerts - Configuration file with defaults - Complete documentationand than this nice report:🎯 Key Features:
✅ Median & P85 calculations per project
✅ Monthly aggregation starting August 2024
✅ Control charts with UCL/LCL (±3σ)
✅ Special cause detection (outliers)
✅ Trend detection (7+ consecutive points)
✅ Process stability assessment
✅ Multi-project analysis from single JQL query
✅ Interactive visualizations showing all metrics on one chartIn the log I do not see the query executed, can you add some debugging level logs which I can disable to check what query are executed? I know the input query is based on a project which started after the august 2024, but I would like to analyze the projects related to the input one which were existing before. Than I need the calculation for the following months till todayI've enhanced the PBC Analyzer with the following capabilities:🐛 Debug Logging
New checkbox in UI: "Enable Debug Logging" to see all JQL queries being executed
Detailed query logging: Shows every JQL query executed against Jira
Progress tracking: See which projects are being fetched and how many issues found
🔍 Related Project Discovery
The analyzer now works like the PI analyzer:Executes your initial query (e.g., a project that started after Aug 2024)
Discovers related projects through:
Parent/child relationships
Epic links
Issue links (blocks, relates, etc.)
Fetches data from ALL related projects starting from August 2024, even if those projects existed before
Monthly calculations from Aug 2024 to today for all discovered projects
Each project gets its own PBC with control limits
Special causes and trends detected per projectI see the analysis is done only on initial project but I would like to see the analysis also to all the connected Jira projects following the whole hierarchy (for each Business initiatives we should collect the related feature and sub-feature and than epics in each other projects like we did in original Lead time analyzer)For sure the vibe coding was a good way to develop easily first view of the idea you have in mind becoming workable application you can improve and manage. What was the learning in this case was the really amazing capability to get additional information from the article without the needs to specify details in graph format and definition.
It was really a great result obtained in few minutes.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is GIS?

From guiding disaster relief efforts to shaping smarter cities, Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, empower us to see and understand our planet in ways that were once unimaginable. If you're new to this realm or simply curious about its potential, this guide will unravel the magic of GIS, exploring its core concepts, vital components, and transformative real-world uses. By the end, you'll see why this technology is revolutionizing industries and decision-making across the globe.
  
  
  Understanding the Basics of GIS
At its core, GIS is a powerful computer-based tool that captures, stores, analyzes, and displays data linked to specific spots on Earth's surface. Think of it as a dynamic digital map, layered with rich information. One layer might trace winding road networks, while another highlights population clusters or rainfall zones. By tying location to detailed data, GIS turns raw numbers into vivid, interactive visuals that reveal hidden insights.What makes GIS truly remarkable is its knack for weaving together diverse datasets through the common thread of place. Whether it's census statistics, satellite photos, or social media buzz, GIS merges these elements to create a full, clear picture of any area. This fusion helps uncover trends and connections that might stay buried in old-school spreadsheets or static reports, making it an invaluable asset for anyone seeking deeper understanding.
  
  
  Core Components and Key Functions
GIS thrives as a unified system, built on a foundation of critical pieces working in harmony. It relies on hardware for raw processing power, software for crafting visualizations and running analyses, and spatial databases to house vast troves of geographic data. Together, these elements enable GIS to tackle several essential roles.First, it organizes data, sorting geographic points and blending inputs from a wide array of sources. Next, it brings this information to life through engaging maps and digital models that simplify complex ideas. Then, it dives into spatial analysis, using advanced methods to unearth patterns and relationships. Finally, it empowers users to create and refine data, crafting fresh datasets or polishing existing ones for accuracy.Picture a city planner at work, using GIS tools to layer zoning rules over flood risk zones. The resulting map becomes a guiding light, pinpointing safe spots for new buildings while ensuring compliance with regulations. This kind of practical insight shows the true strength of GIS in action.GIS juggles two main types of geospatial data, each with a unique role in mapping our world. Raster data comes as a grid of cells or pixels, each packed with details like height or heat readings. This style shines when handling continuous information, such as sweeping satellite images or weather radar visuals, offering a broad, textured view.In contrast, vector data sketches out geographic features with precise points, lines, and polygons. It's perfect for mapping distinct elements, like property edges or street layouts. Imagine a city map where points mark bus stops, lines trace roads, and polygons outline green spaces. This format delivers sharp, exact representations.Beyond these two, GIS taps into a vast pool of sources, from land records to mobile phone signals. Its ability to unite such varied data through location as a central link transforms it into a powerhouse for comprehensive, all-encompassing analysis.
  
  
  Real-World Applications and Impact
The reach of GIS stretches across countless fields, proving itself as a cornerstone for smart decisions and efficient resource use. Its influence touches many areas with profound effect.In logistics, it streamlines delivery paths and fleet movements, slashing expenses and shrinking carbon footprints. For infrastructure, it monitors the health of roads and utilities, ensuring timely care and upgrades. Environmental planning benefits as GIS models climate strategies and pinpoints prime spots for sustainable projects. During crises, it shapes emergency plans for events like storms or quakes. Even in business, it dissects market shifts to fuel growth plans.Take disaster response as a striking example. When wildfires rage, response teams lean on GIS to chart impacted zones, monitor fire spread in real time, and carve out safe escape routes. This kind of spatial insight doesn't just inform, it saves lives by speeding up critical choices.To peek under the hood of GIS data handling, consider this basic pseudo-code for finding nearby emergency shelters:define function findNearestShelter(currentLocation, shelterList):
    initialize shortestDistance as infinity
    initialize nearestShelter as null
    for each shelter in shelterList:
        distance = calculateDistance(currentLocation, shelter.location)
        if distance is less than shortestDistance:
            shortestDistance = distance
            nearestShelter = shelter
    return nearestShelter
This snippet reflects how GIS tools crunch spatial ties, guiding users to vital resources in urgent times.With the immense potential of GIS now in view, you're ready to take your first steps. Kick off by exploring free tools like QGIS, a robust platform packed with features for beginners to master the basics. Seek out online tutorials or join community forums to sharpen your skills in mapping and analysis. If you're with a team or organization, brainstorm ways GIS could solve specific hurdles, whether in streamlining workflows or boosting planning precision.Start with a simple project, like plotting local landmarks or sifting through community stats. As confidence builds, tackle bigger challenges, such as environmental simulations or market studies. The secret lies in hands-on learning through trial and exploration. GIS isn't merely a tool, it's a window into viewing our world through the prism of place. Dive in, and you'll uncover insights that pave the way for wiser, more sustainable choices. Embrace this journey, and let GIS inspire you to map out a better tomorrow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GeoPandas Basics: Maps, Projections, and Spatial Joins</title><link>https://realpython.com/geopandas/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GeoPandas extends pandas to make working with geospatial data in Python intuitive and powerful. If you’re looking to do geospatial tasks in Python and want a library with a pandas-like API, then GeoPandas is an excellent choice. This tutorial shows you how to accomplish four common geospatial tasks: reading in data, mapping it, applying a projection, and doing a spatial join.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that: with support for spatial data. This data typically lives in a  column and allows  such as projections and spatial joins, while  focuses on richer interactive web maps after data preparation.You  with  and  data using  with an authority code like  or .A  stores longitude and latitude in degrees, while a  uses linear units like meters or feet for area and distance calculations.Spatial joins use  with predicates like  or , and both inputs must share the same CRS or the relationships will be computed incorrectly.Here’s how GeoPandas compares with alternative libraries:Projections, spatial joinsGeoPandas builds on pandas by adding support for geospatial data and operations like projections and spatial joins. It also includes tools for creating maps. Folium complements this by focusing on interactive, web-based maps that you can customize more deeply. Test your knowledge with our interactive “GeoPandas Basics: Maps, Projections, and Spatial Joins” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Getting Started With GeoPandasYou’ll first prepare your environment and load a small dataset that you’ll use throughout the tutorial. In the next two subsections, you’ll install the necessary packages and read in a sample dataset of New York City borough boundaries. This gives you a concrete GeoDataFrame to explore as you learn the core concepts.This tutorial uses two packages:  for working with geographic data and  for loading sample data. It’s a good idea to install these packages inside a virtual environment so your project stays isolated from the rest of your system and you can manage its dependencies cleanly. Using the  option ensures you have everything needed for reading data, transforming coordinate systems, and creating plots. For most readers, this will work out of the box.If you do run into installation issues, the project’s maintainers provide alternative installation options on the official installation page.Most geospatial datasets come in GeoJSON or shapefile format. The  function can read both, and it accepts either a local file path or a URL.In the example below, you’ll use  to load the New York City Borough Boundaries (NYBB) dataset. The  package provides a convenient path to this dataset, so you don’t need to download anything manually. You’ll also drop unnecessary columns: is a . A GeoDataFrame has rows, columns, and all the methods of a pandas DataFrame. The difference is that it typically includes a special  column, which stores geographic shapes instead of plain numbers or text.The  column is a . It behaves like a normal pandas , but its values are spatial objects that you can map and run spatial queries against. In the  dataset, each borough’s geometry is a —a shape made of several polygons—because every borough consists of multiple islands. Soon you’ll use these geometries to make maps and run spatial operations, such as finding which borough a point falls inside.Once you’ve loaded a GeoDataFrame, one of the quickest ways to understand your data is to visualize it. In this section, you’ll learn how to create both static and interactive maps. This allows you to inspect shapes, spot patterns, and confirm that your geometries look the way you expect.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Cell Type Annotation is Still the Hardest Part of scRNA-seq (And How Multi-Agent AI Fixes It)</title><link>https://dev.to/sukhitha_b/why-cell-type-annotation-is-still-the-hardest-part-of-scrna-seq-and-how-multi-agent-ai-fixes-it-4bj6</link><author>Sukhitha Basnayake</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:34:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You've clustered your single-cell RNA-seq data. Your UMAP looks beautiful. Now comes the hard part: If you've worked with scRNA-seq data, you know this pain. Manual annotation takes weeks. Reference-based methods fail on disease samples. And when you finally publish, Reviewer 2 asks: "How confident are you in cluster 7's annotation?"
  
  
  The Annotation Bottleneck is Real
Reference classifiers trained on healthy tissue show  on disease samplesThey miss rare cell types in ~20% of cases
Manual annotation has 25% inter-annotator variabilityCurrent methods give you a label with zero justificationWorse, datasets now routinely contain . The computational bottleneck has shifted from analysis to biological interpretation.
  
  
  Why LLMs Alone Don't Cut It
GPT-4 achieved 75% agreement with expert annotations—impressive! But existing LLM approaches have critical gaps:They only see , not full expression profilesKnowledge is  (no current literature)No mechanism to  against databasesZero uncertainty quantificationYou get a confident answer that might be completely wrong.
  
  
  Architecture Over Model Selection
Here's what we learned building CyteType: the problem isn't the LLM—it's how you structure the task.Instead of asking one model "what is this cell?", we built a  where each agent handles a distinct part of scientific reasoning:
Establishes biological ground truth  annotation begins. Infers organism, tissue, pathway context from your data and metadata. Integrates with GTEx, Enrichr (GO, Reactome, WikiPathways), and blitzGSEA.multiple competing hypotheses instead of one prediction. Tests each against the  by querying a pseudobulked expression database. Selects the best hypothesis and maps it to Cell Ontology terms.
Simulates an expert panel. Checks predictions against CellGuide, detects cellular heterogeneity, triggers re-annotation when needed. This creates an interpretable "trust layer."
Connects annotations to current knowledge. Searches PubMed for supporting evidence, identifies disease associations (Disease Ontology), flags drug targets (Drug Ontology).
Synthesizes results across your entire study. Performs similarity analysis, disambiguates naming inconsistencies, generates semantic cluster ordering.
  
  
  The Benchmark That Matters
We tested on  across four diverse datasets (HypoMap, Immune Cell Atlas, GTEx v9, Mouse Pancreatic Atlas).To isolate architectural benefits, we compared CyteType against GPTCellType using the same GPT-5 model:CyteType vs. GPTCellType (same LLM): 388% higher similarity score (p < .001) 267% higher
 100% higherThe comparison using identical models proves: architecture matters more than model choice.
  
  
  Model Flexibility Without Sacrificing Performance
Here's the kicker: you're not locked into expensive API calls.Open-weight models like DeepSeek R1 and Kimi K2 achieve  at lower cost. LLMs with built-in chain-of-thought reasoning showed  (p = 0.22)—CyteType's workflow supersedes model-native reasoning.Choose models based on Run locally with Ollama for Switch models without rewriting your pipeline
  
  
  More Than Labels: Discovery
Applying CyteType to 977 clusters across 20 datasets revealed: received functional enhancement (cell state information) refined to specific subtypes
 required major reannotationAnnotations mapped to 327 unique Cell Ontology terms and identified .Example: In a diabetic kidney disease atlas, "parietal epithelial cells" were relabeled as injured proximal tubule cells (ALDH1A2+, CFH+, VCAM1+)—a discovery that changes biological interpretation.The Reviewer agent generates calibrated confidence scores:High-confidence annotations had significantly higher similarity scores (F = 23.88, p < .001)Heterogeneous clusters showed lower similarity (F = 8.45, p < .01)
Median majority agreement exceeded Now when Reviewer 2 asks about cluster 7, you have:Supporting/conflicting markers
Alternative hypotheses consideredCyteType is  (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0):Both generate comprehensive HTML reports and integrate directly into your existing workflows.
  
  
  What's Your Biggest Annotation Challenge?
We built CyteType to solve our own annotation headaches. What problems are you facing?Rare cell types that references miss?Disease contexts where nothing works?
Inconsistent annotations across studies?Explaining your calls to reviewers?Drop a comment—I'd love to hear what you're working on and whether this approach could help.Full disclosure: I work at Nygen Analytics, the team behind CyteType. We open-sourced this because we think the architecture principle—structuring tasks for LLMs rather than just prompting harder—applies way beyond biology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Communication Patterns That Actually Work</title><link>https://dev.to/aureus_c_b3ba7f87cc34d74d49/multi-agent-communication-patterns-that-actually-work-50kp</link><author>Aureus</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:17:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Your AI agent talks to an API. Cool. Now you need  to talk to each other — and suddenly you're debugging race conditions at 3 AM.Multi-agent systems sound simple until you build one. This article covers five communication patterns I've used in production, with code examples and honest assessments of when each one breaks.When agents need to coordinate, you face three fundamental challenges: — agents start and stop independently — each agent has its own worldview — "I said X then Y" doesn't mean the other agent sees X before YEvery pattern below is a different tradeoff between these constraints.
  
  
  Pattern 1: The Shared Filesystem (Mailbox Pattern)
The simplest approach: agents read and write files in shared directories. Agents on the same machine, low message volume, human-readable debugging. You can literally  and  to debug. High throughput (filesystem isn't a message queue), agents on different machines, ordering guarantees needed across many senders. Atomic writes matter. I once lost messages because an agent read a half-written JSON file. The  pattern fixes this —  is atomic on most filesystems.
  
  
  Pattern 2: The Relay Agent (Hub-and-Spoke)
When agents can't directly access each other's storage, route through a coordinator. Heterogeneous agents (different runtimes, different machines), when you need a single audit trail, when message routing logic gets complex. The hub is a single point of failure. If the relay goes down, communication stops. Also adds latency for every message. Use the relay for cross-machine communication, file-based for same-machine fast-path:
  
  
  Pattern 3: The Shared Ledger (Event Sourcing)
Instead of sending messages, agents append events to a shared log. Every agent reads the same log and derives its own state. When you need full auditability, when agents need to reconstruct historical state, when the "truth" is the sequence of events rather than any single snapshot. Log grows forever (need compaction), slow replay on large histories, concurrent appends need coordination (file locking or use a proper database). Event sourcing turns communication into a side effect of recording what happened. Agents don't send messages — they announce actions. Other agents observe.
  
  
  Pattern 4: The Handoff Chain
When agents run sequentially (Agent A finishes, Agent B starts), communication is a structured handoff document. Sequential agent execution (the most common case for AI agents that run on schedules), when you need guaranteed context transfer, when the "conversation" is slow (minutes/hours between turns). Doesn't work for concurrent agents. The handoff is a snapshot, not a stream.
  
  
  Pattern 5: The Contract Protocol (Request/Response)
When agents need to coordinate on specific tasks with guaranteed completion. Task delegation between specialized agents, when you need accountability (who did what), when work items have clear completion criteria. Overhead is high for simple messages. Don't use contracts for "hey, check this out" — use them for "build this thing and tell me when it's done."
  
  
  Choosing the Right Pattern
Cross-machine, many agentsAudit trails, event-drivenMost multi-agent systems only need Pattern 1 (Mailbox) + Pattern 4 (Handoff). The file-based mailbox handles async coordination. The handoff chain handles sequential continuity. Everything else is optimization for scale you probably don't have yet.Start simple. Add complexity only when the simple version demonstrably fails. Agents sending free-form text to each other and parsing it with regex. Use structured messages. Always. A central agent that knows everything and coordinates everyone. This creates a bottleneck and a single point of failure. Prefer agents that can operate independently and only coordinate when necessary. Agents checking for messages every 100ms. Use filesystem watchers ( on Linux,  on macOS) or exponential backoff. "I sent A before B, so the other agent will see A first." Not guaranteed. Include sequence numbers or timestamps and handle out-of-order delivery.Error recovery strategies for multi-agent systemsMonitoring and debugging agent communication in production]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Convert Videos to PDF with VID2PDFPro in Python</title><link>https://dev.to/matetechnologie/convert-videos-to-pdf-with-vid2pdfpro-in-python-3gcl</link><author>Mate Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:47:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn how to turn video frames into PDF documents using Python with VID2PDFPro, complete with face and license plate anonymization. Perfect for creating reports, archives, or anonymized content.Check out the full project on GitHub
.Step 1: Install DependenciesVID2PDFPro uses several Python libraries. Install them using pip:pip install opencv-python pillow ttkbootstrap tkinterdnd2
opencv-python – For reading and processing video frames.Pillow – To manipulate images and generate PDFs.ttkbootstrap – For modern themed GUIs.tkinterdnd2 – To enable drag-and-drop in Tkinter.Step 2: Import Required ModulesWe need several built-in and third-party modules:import sys
import os
import threading
import queue
import time
from pathlib import Path

import cv2
from PIL import Image
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from tkinterdnd2 import TkinterDnD, DND_FILES
import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.widgets.scrolled import ScrolledText
threading & queue – For background processing and safe UI updates.cv2 (OpenCV) – For reading video frames and anonymization.Pillow (PIL) – To convert frames to images and PDFs.tkinter & ttkbootstrap – For the GUI.TkinterDnD – Adds drag-and-drop support.Step 3: Create the Main App ClassWe encapsulate the app in a class for organization:class VID2PDFPro:
    APP_NAME = "VID2PDF Pro"
    APP_VERSION = "1.0"
    PAGE_SIZES = ["Original", "A4", "Letter"]

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TkinterDnD.Tk()
        tb.Style("superhero")
        self.root.title(f"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}")
        self.root.geometry("1150x650")

        self.video_path = tk.StringVar()
        self.output_dir = tk.StringVar()
        self.frame_interval = tk.IntVar(value=10)
        self.pdf_dpi = tk.IntVar(value=200)
        self.page_size = tk.StringVar(value="Original")
        self.an_faces = tk.BooleanVar(value=True)
        self.an_plates = tk.BooleanVar(value=True)
        self.stop_event = threading.Event()

        self.ui_queue = queue.Queue()
        self.progress_var = tk.IntVar(value=0)
        self.counter_var = tk.StringVar(value="Processed: 0 / 0")
        self.eta_var = tk.StringVar(value="ETA: --:--")

        # Load Haar cascades for face and plate detection
        self.face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml")
        self.plate_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + "haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml")

        self._build_ui()
        self.process_ui_queue()
TkinterDnD.Tk() – creates a GUI window that supports drag-and-drop.ttkbootstrap.Style() – applies a theme.tk.StringVar / tk.IntVar – bind GUI inputs to Python variables.Haar cascades are pre-trained classifiers for face/license plate detection.We create input fields, buttons, and a live progress log:def _build_ui(self):
    tb.Label(self.root, text=self.APP_NAME, font=("Segoe UI", 22, "bold")).pack(pady=(10, 2))
    tb.Label(self.root, text="Video to PDF Extraction & Anonymization",
             font=("Segoe UI", 10, "italic"), foreground="#9ca3af").pack(pady=(0, 10))

    # Video input section
    src_box = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Video Input (Drag & Drop Supported)", padding=10)
    src_box.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=6)
    self.video_entry = tb.Entry(src_box, textvariable=self.video_path)
    self.video_entry.pack(side="left", fill="x", expand=True)
    self.video_entry.drop_target_register(DND_FILES)

                  filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Video","*.mp4 *.avi *.mov")]))).pack(side="left", padx=5)
Users can drag and drop videos or use a Browse button.DND_FILES allows drag-and-drop of files directly into the entry box.VID2PDFPro lets you anonymize faces and license plates:adv = tb.Labelframe(self.root, text="Advanced", padding=10)
adv.pack(fill="x", padx=10, pady=6)
tb.Checkbutton(adv, text="Anonymize Faces", variable=self.an_faces, bootstyle="success").pack(side="left", padx=10)
tb.Checkbutton(adv, text="Anonymize Plates", variable=self.an_plates, bootstyle="success").pack(side="left", padx=10)
Checkboxes allow users to enable or disable face/plate anonymization.Step 6: Anonymization FunctionWe blur faces and pixelate license plates:def anonymize(self, frame):
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    if self.an_faces.get():
        for x, y, w, h in self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.2, 5):
            roi = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            frame[y:y+h, x:x+w] = cv2.GaussianBlur(roi, (51,51), 0)
    if self.an_plates.get():
        for x, y, w, h in self.plate_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4):
            roi = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            roi = cv2.resize(roi, (16,16))
            roi = cv2.resize(roi, (w,h), interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)
            frame[y:y+h, x:x+w] = roi
    return frame
License plates → Pixelated for privacyControlled by checkboxes in the GUI.Step 7: Extract Frames and Save as PDFThis function converts frames to PDF:def extract_to_pdf(self):
    video_file = self.video_path.get()
    out_dir = self.output_dir.get()
    if not video_file or not out_dir:
        messagebox.showerror("Missing", "Select video and output folder")
        return

    self.stop_event.clear()
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)
    total_frames = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))
    pdf_path = os.path.join(out_dir,"output.pdf")
    first_img = None
    frames = []
    idx = 0
    processed = 0

    while cap.isOpened():
        if self.stop_event.is_set(): break
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret: break

        if idx % self.frame_interval.get() == 0:
            frame = self.anonymize(frame)

One experimental feature using o1-preview, a few hundred test runs, and suddenly your bill looks very different from last month.The Azure portal shows you the numbers eventually, but when you're iterating quickly on AI features, you need real-time visibility. That's exactly what  delivers - instant Azure OpenAI cost tracking from your terminal.
  
  
  The Azure OpenAI Cost Challenge
Unlike traditional cloud services with predictable pricing, Azure OpenAI costs vary wildly based on:Model choice (GPT-4o-mini vs o1-preview is a 5-15x difference)Token usage (both prompt and completion tokens)Deployment scaling and throughputTesting and development cyclesThe questions you need answered daily:"How much did my o1-preview deployment cost yesterday?""Which resource group is burning through credits?""Did that new feature spike my OpenAI spend?""How does dev environment cost compare to production?"Checking this through the Azure portal means multiple clicks, page loads, and waiting. When you're checking costs multiple times a day during active development, this friction adds up. is a Python CLI tool built specifically for developers who need fast answers about their Azure spending. For Azure OpenAI users, it's the fastest way to track Cognitive Services costs without touching the Azure portal.
  
  
  Why It Works for Azure OpenAI
: See your OpenAI costs in 2 seconds, not 2 minutes: Catch cost spikes the day they happen, not at month-end: Monitor individual Azure OpenAI accounts separately: Separate dev, staging, and production costs effortlessly: Break down by service, location, resource group, or resource ID: Python API for integrating into your CI/CD or daily reports: Works with any billing currencyInstallation takes one line:Log in with Azure CLI (if you haven't already):Check your Azure OpenAI costs:azurecost  your-subscription-name
USD                 2025-11    2025-12

total                 1247.83    2891.45
Cognitive Services    1247.83    2891.45
That's your Azure OpenAI spend right there - Cognitive Services is the billing category for Azure OpenAI. Notice the spike in December? Now you can investigate what changed.
  
  
  Real-World Azure OpenAI Use Cases

  
  
  Scenario 1: Daily Cost Monitoring During Development
You're building a new reasoning agent with o1-preview. Check costs every morning:azurecost  prod-subscription  DAILY  7
USD           2025-12-15  2025-12-16  2025-12-17  2025-12-18

total                45.23        52.18       178.45        51.20
Cognitive Services   45.23        52.18       178.45        51.20
Whoa, December 17th spiked to $178. That's the day you started load testing with o1-preview. Now you know exactly when and how much it costs.
  
  
  Scenario 2: Environment-Based Cost Breakdown
You have separate resource groups for dev, staging, and production. See costs side by side:azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceGroup  ServiceName
USD                                        2025-11    2025-12

total                                        1247.83    2891.45
ai-dev-rg/Cognitive Services                  342.15     456.32
ai-staging-rg/Cognitive Services              198.42     287.89
ai-prod-rg/Cognitive Services                 707.26    2147.24
Production jumped from $707 to $2147. Time to optimize those prompts or consider GPT-4o-mini for some use cases.
  
  
  Scenario 3: Focused Investigation on Production
Something's wrong with production costs. Drill down to just that resource group:azurecost  ai-subscription  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  14
See two weeks of daily costs for production only. Spot the pattern, correlate with deployments or feature releases.
  
  
  Scenario 4: Multi-Region Cost Analysis
Running Azure OpenAI deployments in multiple regions? Group by location:azurecost  global-ai-sub  Location  ServiceName
USD                                   2025-11    2025-12

total                                   1247.83    2891.45
East US/Cognitive Services               823.14    1923.87
West Europe/Cognitive Services           424.69     967.58
East US is handling most of the load. Maybe redistribute traffic or consider regional pricing differences.
  
  
  Scenario 5: Resource-Level Cost Analysis
Running multiple Azure OpenAI accounts for different teams or use cases? Track costs at the individual resource level:azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceId
USD                                                                                     2025-12    2026-01

total                                                                                     5741.44   16571.60
/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/chatbot-prod           3401.80   16390.44
/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/analytics-engine       2194.17     131.82
/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/internal-tools          145.47      49.34
This shows exactly which Azure OpenAI account is consuming credits. Perfect for:: Charge back costs to specific teams or projectsIdentifying cost anomalies: Spot which deployment suddenly increased spendMulti-tenant environments: Track costs per customer or tenant: Distribute budget based on actual usage patternsCombine with daily granularity to investigate when a specific resource started costing more:azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceId  DAILY  7

  
  
  Why This Matters for Azure OpenAI Users
Building with Azure OpenAI is different from traditional cloud infrastructure. With VMs or databases, costs are fairly predictable. But with modern language models like GPT-4o and o1-preview, costs depend on how users interact with your application:Long conversations = more tokens = higher costsComplex reasoning tasks = more input tokensDetailed responses = more completion tokensTesting and iteration = multiplied costsDuring active development, you need to check costs frequently. Not once a month when the bill arrives, but daily or even multiple times a day.The Azure portal workflow kills this feedback loop:Navigate to Azure portal (wait for load)Find the right subscriptionClick through to Cost ManagementConfigure time range and filtersBy the time you see the numbers, you've burned 2-3 minutes. When you're doing this multiple times daily, the friction discourages you from checking at all.Then you're surprised at month-end when the bill is 3x what you expected. fixes this. Checking costs becomes as fast as checking git status:azurecost  ai-subscription  DAILY  7
Two seconds. Real-time feedback. No context switching.This speed changes behavior. When checking costs is instant, you actually do it. You catch issues early. You experiment with confidence because you're monitoring the impact.The tool emerged from my own need while building AI features. I was spending too much time in the portal doing the same query repeatedly. I wanted something terminal-based that integrated into my development workflow.What started as a personal script evolved into a proper tool that my team adopted, then others in the community found useful. The philosophy is simple: do one thing well - show Azure costs fast and clearly.
  
  
  Automate Azure OpenAI Cost Monitoring
The Python API lets you integrate cost tracking into your workflows. Send daily Azure OpenAI cost reports to Slack:Run this as a daily cron job or GitHub Action. Your team gets automatic cost visibility without anyone checking the portal.: Trigger warnings when daily costs exceed thresholds: Track which team or feature is using OpenAI credits: Validate costs before promoting to production: Generate reports for accounting without manual exports
  
  
  Configuration Tips for AI Workloads
Set environment variables to streamline your daily checks:your-ai-subscription-id
ai-prod-rg
Now run  with no arguments:Create shell aliases for common queries:Type  each morning as part of your routine. Takes 2 seconds, keeps you informed. Use  when you need to drill down to individual Azure OpenAI accounts.
  
  
  Best Practices for Azure OpenAI Cost Management
Based on using  with AI workloads, here are patterns that work:azurecost  ai-sub  DAILY  7
Catch anomalies before they compound. One day of unexpected costs is manageable. A month is not.2. Before and after feature releases
azurecost  ai-sub  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  3


azurecost  ai-sub  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  3
Measure the cost impact of new features. Make data-driven decisions about o1-preview vs GPT-4o-mini.3. Set up automated alerts
Use the Python API to send daily reports. Don't rely on remembering to check manually.
Use separate resource groups for dev, staging, production. Makes cost attribution trivial.5. Monitor during load testing
Run  before and after load tests. Understand your cost-per-request at scale before going live.

In this tutorial, we’ll build ExamResultPredictor v2.0, a Python app that predicts exam grades using linear regression and a friendly GUI.ttkbootstrap for modern stylingscikit-learn for predictive modelingBy the end, you’ll have a working app where you can add students manually or via CSV, predict their grades, and export results.GitHub repo: ExamResultPredictorStep 1: Set Up Your EnvironmentMake sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install the required packages:pip install numpy scikit-learn tkinter ttkbootstrapWe’ll start by importing the necessary libraries.import os
import sys
import threading
import csv
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox, filedialog, ttk

import ttkbootstrap as tb
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np
tkinter & ttkbootstrap → For GUI componentsthreading → To run predictions without freezing the appscikit-learn → For building the linear regression modelnumpy → For numeric arraysWe create a helper function to handle file paths, especially for executable builds.def resource_path(file_name):
    base_path = getattr(sys, "_MEIPASS", os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    return os.path.join(base_path, file_name)
Step 4: Create a Prediction WorkerWe’ll define a worker class to run predictions in a separate thread.class PredictorWorker:

Then it wakes up with no idea what it was doing, why, or what matters. The persistence layer saved data. But the  — the "what was I thinking" — is gone.This is the handoff problem. And if you're building agents that run across multiple sessions, it's the hardest part of the architecture to get right.
  
  
  Why Handoffs Are Harder Than Persistence
My previous article covered what to persist: configuration, accumulated state, operational context. But persistence is storage. Handoffs are  — from your past self to your future self.The difference matters. A database stores facts. A handoff tells a story: here's where we are, here's what matters right now, and here's what to do next.Get persistence wrong and you lose data. Get handoffs wrong and your agent spends its first five minutes confused, re-discovering what it already knew, or worse — making decisions based on stale assumptions.
  
  
  The Four Handoff Anti-Patterns
Before the solution, let's catalog the failures. I've seen (and built) all of these:The next session gets  and understands . Information without prioritization is noise. Your agent either parses all of it (slow, context-heavy) or gives up and starts fresh.Just a file path. No summary, no priority, no narrative. The next session opens the file and faces the same cold-start problem, just one level deeper. This is delegation, not handoff.No explicit handoff at all. "The framework handles continuity." It doesn't. Frameworks handle data flow. They don't understand which of your 15 active tasks is urgent versus background. They don't know that the API you were calling started returning 429s and you switched strategies. They don't know  things are the way they are.# Check the logs from 14:00-14:30 for context
# The relevant PR is #847
# See Slack thread from yesterday
Your next session has to do forensic work to reconstruct what the previous session knew. This is fragile (logs rotate, threads get buried) and expensive (your agent burns context window on archaeology instead of work).
  
  
  A Structured Handoff Protocol
Here's what actually works. A good handoff has five layers:The raw facts. Current values of critical variables, in a typed, validated format.This is the "what" — the current state of the world.
  
  
  Layer 2: Narrative Context
Three to five sentences, human-readable, explaining what happened and why the state looks the way it does.This is the "why" — the story behind the data.What was decided, what was deferred, and what trade-offs were made.This prevents your next session from re-litigating resolved questions or missing deferred work.What the next session should do first, second, and third.Explicit priority removes the most common cold-start problem: "I have 12 things I could do. Which one matters right now?"
  
  
  Layer 5: Warnings and Gotchas
The things that will bite the next session if nobody mentions them.This is institutional knowledge that exists nowhere except in the previous session's working memory.These come from building systems that actually use multi-session handoffs:
  
  
  1. Handoff Loaders Fail Silently
The most dangerous failure mode isn't a crash — it's a loader that  but doesn't actually populate the agent's context. The handoff file gets read. The JSON parses. But the agent starts its work loop without checking whether the loaded data made it into working memory.: Always verify after loading. Have your agent explicitly reference handoff data in its first action. If it can't, the load failed.
  
  
  2. Redundancy Beats Optimization
Don't put all your continuity in one file. Use multiple channels:: The structured handoff file: A state.json with running totals and current values: Human-readable journal entriesIf any one channel fails, the others provide enough context to recover. This sounds wasteful. It's not. The cost of a confused agent re-doing work far exceeds the cost of writing three small files.
  
  
  3. Human-Readable Beats Machine-Optimized
Binary formats, compressed state, clever encodings — they all break when you need to debug at 3 AM. Make your handoffs readable by a human with a text editor. JSON with clear key names. Narrative summaries in plain language.When something goes wrong (and it will), you want to  the handoff file and immediately understand the agent's last known state.
  
  
  4. Test With Real Restarts
Write your handoff. Kill the agent. Restart it. Did it pick up where it left off? Not "did it load the file" — did it actually  correctly?Most handoff bugs only surface under real restart conditions. Simulated loads in the same process don't catch issues like stale file handles, cached state that masks a bad load, or race conditions between the write and the next session's read.Your handoff format will evolve. Your agent from two weeks ago wrote v0.8 handoffs. Your agent today expects v1.0. Without a version field, your loader silently misinterprets fields and your agent makes decisions based on misread data.The handoff is where engineering meets epistemology. You're not just passing data — you're passing . Your future agent self needs to reconstruct enough of your current mental model to make good decisions, without having lived through the experiences that built that model.This is fundamentally a compression problem: how do you compress a session's worth of experience into something small enough to transmit and rich enough to be useful?The five-layer protocol works because it compresses along multiple dimensions simultaneously — facts (state), story (narrative), reasoning (decisions), action (priorities), and caution (warnings). No single layer is sufficient. Together, they give the next session what it needs to start working instead of start orienting.Build your handoffs like you're writing a note to a colleague who's taking over your shift. Because that's exactly what you're doing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quiz: GeoPandas Basics: Maps, Projections, and Spatial Joins</title><link>https://realpython.com/quizzes/geopandas/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this quiz, you’ll test your understanding of GeoPandas.You’ll review coordinate reference systems, GeoDataFrames, interactive maps, and spatial joins with .

It's surprisingly hard. Hash chains prove sequence integrity. Signatures prove authorship. But neither proves that the signer didn't just... rewrite everything before signing.This is the core problem in trading systems, especially prop trading where 80-100 firms collapsed in 2024-2025 amid payout disputes. The firm controls the logs. The trader has no recourse.VCP-XREF solves this with a simple insight: when two independent parties log the same event, discrepancies reveal manipulation.
  
  
  The Problem: Single-Party Logs Are Inherently Untrustworthy
The problem? The owner can:Delete events before signingModify events before signing
Rewrite the entire log and re-signClaim events never happenedVerification passes. Trust fails.
  
  
  The Solution: VCP-XREF Dual Logging
VCP-XREF creates two independent audit trails that reference each other:┌─────────────────┐                    ┌─────────────────┐

He called it "not too bad for throwaway weekend projects." But for production systems? That's where the trouble starts.I've watched AI-generated codebases accumulate the same mess developers spent decades learning to avoid—duplication everywhere, inconsistent naming, missing edge cases. Then it hit me: these are exactly the problems Robert C. Martin warned about in  almost two decades ago.So I went back to the book, specifically Chapter 17's catalog of 66 code smells and heuristics. These aren't just relevant to AI coding—they're  relevant. AI makes exactly the mistakes Uncle Bob warned us about, just faster and at scale.The solution? —instruction files that AI agents read before writing code. I've translated Clean Code's complete catalog into Python skills you can use today. They work in Google's Antigravity IDE, Anthropic's Claude Code, and anywhere that supports the Agent Skills standard.Let me show you why we need this, and how to implement it.
  
  
  Even Linus Torvalds Vibe Codes (Sometimes)
In January 2026, Linus Torvalds revealed a side project called AudioNoise—a digital audio effects simulator he'd been tinkering with over the holidays. The Python visualizer, he noted, was "basically written by vibe-coding."In his own words from the repo:"I know more about analog filters—and that's not saying much—than I do about python. It started out as my typical 'google and do the monkey-see-monkey-do' kind of programming, but then I cut out the middle-man—me—and just used Google Antigravity to do the audio sample visualizer."The Hacker News discussion revealed two camps. Some saw it as validation: "It's official, vibe coding is legit." Others noted the crucial context: Torvalds used AI for the part he lacks expertise in (Python visualization) while hand-coding the parts he knows (C and digital signal processing).One commenter nailed it: "There's a big difference between vibe-coding an entire project and having an AI build a component that you lack competency for."Another observation cut deeper: "If anyone on the planet knows how to do vibe coding right, it's him"—because Torvalds spent decades mastering code review. He can spot bad code instantly. Most of us can't.But here's what's telling: Torvalds wrote tests for his hand-coded C—numerical accuracy checks for the DSP primitives he understands. The vibe-coded Python visualizer? No tests, no type hints, and a duplicated function definition that slipped right through. The same four-line method appears twice in a row—the first an empty stub, the second the real implementation. It's textbook "Accept All, don't read the diffs." The code runs fine (Python silently overwrites the first definition), but it's exactly the kind of dead code that accumulates into maintenance nightmares.This works for Torvalds' toy project precisely. It's a throwaway learning exercise. The moment that visualizer needs to be production code, those missing guardrails become technical debt.The same week, Torvalds rejected "AI slop" submissions to the Linux kernel, arguing that documentation telling people not to submit garbage won't help because "the people who would submit it won't read the documentation anyway."The lesson isn't that vibe coding is bad. It's that context matters. Skills let you define when to enforce rigor and when to let the vibes flow.
  
  
  The Data: AI Code Quality Is Getting Worse
  found AI adoption shows a negative relationship with software delivery stability. The 2025 report's central finding: "AI doesn't fix a team; it amplifies what's already there." Without robust control systems—strong testing, mature practices, fast feedback loops—increased AI-generated code leads to instability. Skills are exactly those control systems, encoded as instructions. analyzed 807 GitHub repositories after Cursor adoption: +30% static analysis warnings, +41% code complexity. The speed gains were transient; the quality problems compounded. analysis of 211 million lines of code from Google, Microsoft, Meta, and enterprise repositories found code duplication increased  with AI adoption. For the first time in their dataset, copy/pasted code exceeded refactored code.Even  shows the gap: developers use AI in roughly 60% of their work, but can fully delegate only 0-20% of tasks. The rest requires "thoughtful setup, active supervision, and human judgment."That gap—between what AI touches and what AI can own—is exactly what skills address. The setup  the skill. The supervision  the rules.
  
  
  The Pattern: AI Recreates Classic Code Smells
The research consistently identifies the same failure patterns. Here's how they map to specific Clean Code violations:Naming and Consistency ProblemsInconsistent variable names across similar functionsVague names like , , Mixing naming conventions (camelCase and snake_case)Clean Code rules: N1 (descriptive names), G11 (consistency), G24 (conventions)Copy/paste instead of extracting shared logicSame calculation appearing in multiple placesPattern repetition that should be abstractedClean Code rule: G5 (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)No validation of input boundariesAssumptions about data structure without verificationClean Code rules: G3 (boundary conditions), G4 (don't override safeties), G26 (be precise)Magic numbers without explanation (what does 86400 mean?)Unused variables cluttering codeFunctions mixing multiple abstraction levelsClean Code rules: G12 (remove clutter), G16 (no obscured intent), G34 (single abstraction level)Functions doing multiple things at onceExposing internal data unnecessarilyNested loops that could be optimizedClean Code rules: G8 (minimize public interface), G30 (functions do one thing)These aren't arbitrary style preferences—they're the exact problems that make code hard to maintain, debug, and extend. The skills we'll build enforce these rules automatically.The fix isn't to stop using AI. It's to give AI the explicit rules it needs to follow.Skills are markdown files containing domain-specific instructions that AI agents read before working on your code. They follow the Agent Skills open standard and work in Google Antigravity, Anthropic's Claude Code, and other compatible agents.The architecture is called . Instead of dumping every instruction into the agent's context at once (causing what Antigravity's docs call "Context Saturation"), skills work in layers:: The agent sees only a lightweight menu of skill names and descriptions: When your request matches a skill's description, the full instructions load: Scripts and templates are read only when the task requires themThis keeps the agent fast and focused. It's not thinking about database migrations when you're writing a React component.The  field is crucial—it's the trigger phrase. The agent semantically matches your request against all available skill descriptions to decide which ones to load. "Enforces function best practices" is vague. "Use when writing or refactoring Python functions" tells the agent exactly when to activate.Skills can do far more than enforce coding standards—the community has built skills for Stripe integration, Metasploit security testing, voice agents, and even multi-agent startup automation. This article focuses on one specific use case: encoding Clean Code principles.Let me show you how to translate Clean Code's catalog into working skills.
  
  
  Building the Skills: Three Examples
Rather than catalog all 66 rules exhaustively, I'll show you three critical categories in detail. The complete implementation is at the end.
  
  
  1. Comments (C1-C5): Code Should Explain Itself
Uncle Bob is famously skeptical of comments—not because documentation is bad, but because comments rot faster than code updates.File Reference: 

Comments shouldn't hold metadata. Use Git for author names, change history, 
ticket numbers, and dates. Comments are for technical notes about code only.



If a comment describes code that no longer exists or works differently, 
delete it immediately. Stale comments become "floating islands of 
irrelevance and misdirection."


i += 1  # increment i
user.save()  # save the user


i += 1  # compensate for zero-indexing in display



If a comment is worth writing, write it well:
 Choose words carefully
 Use correct grammar
 Don't ramble or state the obvious
 Be brief



Who knows how old it is? Who knows if it's meaningful? Delete it. 
Git remembers everything.



The best comment is the code itself. If you need a comment to explain 
what code does, refactor first, comment last.

  
  
  2. Functions (F1-F4): Small, Focused, Obvious
Functions should do one thing, do it well, and have an obvious purpose.File Reference: 
def create_user(name, email, age, country, timezone, language, newsletter):
    ...


@dataclass
class UserData:
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int
    country: str
    timezone: str
    language: str
    newsletter: bool

def create_user(data: UserData):
    ...

More than 3 arguments means your function is doing too much or needs 
a data structure.



Don't modify arguments as side effects. Return values instead.


def append_footer(report: Report) -> None:
    report.append("---Generated by System")


def with_footer(report: Report) -> Report:
    return report + "---Generated by System"



Boolean flags mean your function does at least two things.


def render(is_test: bool):
    if is_test:
        render_test_page()
    else:
        render_production_page()


def render_test_page(): ...
def render_production_page(): ...



If it's not called, delete it. No "just in case" code. Git preserves history.

  
  
  3. General Principles (G1-G36): The Core Rules
These are the fundamental patterns that separate clean code from legacy nightmares.File Reference: 

Every piece of knowledge has one authoritative representation.


tax_rate = 0.0825
ca_total = subtotal  1.0825
ny_total = subtotal  1.07


TAX_RATES = {"CA": 0.0825, "NY": 0.07}

  Anatomy of a Vibe-Coded Script
The first definition unpacks values, calculates width, then... returns . The second definition is the real implementation. Python silently overwrites the first with the second, so the code runs. But it's textbook dead code—Clean Code rule G9: Remove dead code.With the skill active, an agent refactors the entire 600-line script. The duplicate vanishes, magic numbers become constants, and nested functions get extracted into focused methods:✅ Type hints added (clarity)✅ Single, authoritative definition (G5)✅ Magic numbers extracted to constants (G25)✅ Large methods decomposed (G30)The full diff shows 600+ lines reduced to ~440—not by removing functionality, but by eliminating duplication and extracting reusable patterns.Vibe coding isn't going away. AI will get better at generating code, not worse. But "better at generating" doesn't mean "better at maintaining."The research is clear: AI produces code faster, but that code accumulates technical debt faster too. Without guard rails, we're building tomorrow's legacy systems today.Uncle Bob's Clean Code principles are almost 20 years old, but they're exactly what we need now. They're not arbitrary style preferences—they're battle-tested solutions to the problems AI recreates at scale.Skills give you the mechanism to encode these rules directly into your AI workflow. Whether you're using Antigravity, Claude Code, or another agent, the approach is the same: define what clean code means, then let the AI follow the rules.Your agent doesn't know what good code looks like unless you tell it. by Robert C.

2) avoiding the common failure modes, and
3) batching requests without turning your responses into soup.Different providers name things differently, but the mechanics are consistent:
  
  
  1.1 Context window (max tokens per request)
If your  exceeds the model context window, the request fails immediately.“Maximum context length exceeded”“Your messages resulted in X tokens…”shorten, summarise, or chunk data.
  
  
  1.2 RPM (Requests Per Minute)
You can be under token limits and still get throttled if you burst too many calls. Gemini explicitly documents RPM as a core dimension. “Rate limit reached for requests per minute”client-side pacing, queues, and backoff.
  
  
  1.3 TPM / Token throughput limits
Anthropic measures rate limits in RPM + input tokens/minute + output tokens/minute (ITPM/OTPM).
Gemini similarly describes token-per-minute as a key dimension. “Rate limit reached for token usage per minute”429 + Retry-After header (Anthropic calls this out) reduce tokens, batch efficiently, or request higher quota.
  
  
  2.1 The “one prompt to rule them all” anti-pattern
…in a single request, and then you wonder why token usage spikes.. If you need multi-step logic, use  (small prompts with structured intermediate outputs).
  
  
  2.2 Bursty traffic (the silent RPM killer)
Production traffic is spiky. Cron jobs, retries, user clicks, webhook bursts—everything aligns in the worst possible minute.If your client sends requests like a machine gun, your provider will respond like a bouncer.
  
  
  2.3 Unstructured output = expensive parsing
If your output is “kinda JSON-ish”, your parser becomes a full-time therapist.Make the model output  or a fixed table. Treat format as a contract.
  
  
  3.1 Prompt-side: shrink tokens without losing signal
 (models don’t need your company origin story).Convert repeated boilerplate into a short “policy block” and reuse it.Prefer  over prose (“material=316 stainless steel” beats a paragraph).
  
  
  A tiny prompt rewrite that usually saves 30–50%
“We’re a smart home brand founded in 2010… please write 3 marketing lines…”“Write 3 UK e-commerce lines. Product: smart bulb. Material=PC flame-retardant. Feature=3 colour temperatures. Audience=living room.”
  
  
  3.2 Request-side: backoff like an adult
If the provider returns , respect it. Anthropic explicitly returns Retry-After on 429s. Use exponential backoff + jitter:
  
  
  3.3 System-side: queue + concurrency caps
If your account supports 10 concurrent requests, do not run 200 coroutines and “hope”.a  for concurrencyand a  for RPM/TPMBatching means: one API request handles multiple independent tasks.It works best when tasks are:same type (e.g., 20 product blurbs)independent (no step depends on another)fewer network round-tripsfewer requests → lower RPM pressuremore predictable throughputAlso: OpenAI’s pricing pages explicitly include a “Batch API price” column for several models. 
(That doesn’t mean “batching is free”, but it’s a strong hint the ecosystem expects this pattern.)Here’s a format that stays parseable under pressure.
  
  
  5.1 Use task blocks + a strict JSON response schema
SYSTEM: You output valid JSON only. No Markdown. No commentary.

USER:
You will process multiple tasks. 
Return a JSON array. Each item must be:
{
  "task_id": <int>,
  "title": <string>,
  "bullets": [<string>, <string>, <string>]
}

Rules:
- UK English spelling
- Title ≤ 12 words
- 3 bullets, each ≤ 18 words
- If input is missing: set title="INSUFFICIENT_DATA" and bullets=[]

TASKS:
### TASK 1
product_name: Insulated smart mug
material: 316 stainless steel
features: temperature alert, 7-day battery
audience: commuters

### TASK 2
product_name: Wireless earbuds
material: ABS shock-resistant
features: ANC, 24-hour battery
audience: students
That “INSUFFICIENT_DATA” clause is your lifesaver. One broken task shouldn’t poison the whole batch.Below is a modern-ish pattern you can adapt (provider SDKs vary, so treat it as , not a copy‑paste guarantee).
  
  
  What changed vs “classic” snippets?
We treat JSON as a .We handle  explicitly (and keep it cheap).We centralise backoff logic so every call behaves the same way.Batch size is constrained by:context window (max tokens per request)response parsing stabilityyour business tolerance for “one batch failed”start with increase until you see:

timeouts / latency spikes, or
And always keep a .Pricing changes. Tiers change. Models change.So instead of hard-coding ancient per-1K token values, calculate cost using the provider’s current pricing page.OpenAI publishes per‑token pricing on its API pricing pages.
Anthropic also publishes pricing and documents rate limit tiers. cost ≈ (input_tokens * input_price + output_tokens * output_price) / 1,000,000
Then optimise the variables you control:reduce number of calls (batch)

  
  
  Risk 1: one bad item ruins the batch
 “INSUFFICIENT_DATA” fallback per task.
  
  
  Risk 2: output format drift breaks parsing
 strict JSON, repair step, and logging.
  
  
  Risk 3: batch too big → context overflow
 token budgeting + auto-splitting.
  
  
  Risk 4: “creative” attempts to bypass quotas
 don’t. If you need more capacity, request higher limits and follow provider terms.Rate limits aren’t the enemy. They’re your early warning system that:or your architecture assumes “infinite throughput”.If you treat prompts like payloads (not prose), add pacing, and batch like a grown-up, you’ll get:and a system that scales without drama]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 11 of 100</title><link>https://dev.to/palakhirave/day-11-of-100-oi9</link><author>Palak Hirave</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I worked on a Blackjack project.

These problems usually appear when teams migrate from synchronous Flask or Django applications to FastAPI without fully understanding how async architecture actually works.This article is not a beginner’s FastAPI tutorial.It is a practical, production-focused guide to building high-performance async backend APIs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy 2.0, covering real-world concerns such as async engine configuration, session lifecycle management, lifespan events, connection pooling, and common failure modes.If you are already using FastAPI (or planning a migration from Flask) and want an async architecture that scales cleanly beyond toy examples, this guide is written for you.First, let's grab our dependencies. Notice we need an async driver (aiosqlite) because standard drivers like psycopg2 or sqlite3 are synchronous and will block your loop.pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy aiosqlite pydanticThe Database Engine (database.py)The most critical part of an async setup is the AsyncEngine. If you initialize this wrong, your whole app runs synchronously.from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, async_sessionmaker, AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase

# 1. Connection String (Note the +aiosqlite driver)
# For Postgres, use: postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/dbname
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///./test.db"

# 2. Create the Async Engine
engine = create_async_engine(
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL,
    echo=True, # Logs SQL queries to console (Great for debugging)
)

# 3. Create the Session Factory
# This is what generates new database sessions for each request
AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
    bind=engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False
)

# 4. Base Class for Models
class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

# 5. Dependency Injection
# We use this in our FastAPI routes to get a DB session
async def get_db():
    async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
        yield session
2. The Models (models.py)SQLAlchemy 2.0 introduced a beautiful new way to define models using Python type hints (Mapped). No more vague Column(Integer, ...) syntax.from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column
from sqlalchemy import String, Integer, Boolean
from database import Base

class Task(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tasks"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, index=True)
    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(50), index=True)
    description: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=True)
    is_completed: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=False)
3. The Schemas (schemas.py)Pydantic handles our data validation. We keep our "Create" logic separate from our "Response" logic.from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str | None = None

class TaskResponse(TaskCreate):
    id: int
    is_completed: bool

    # Pydantic V2 Config to read from ORM models
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
4. The API Endpoints (main.py)Here is where the magic happens. Notice two key things: The endpoints are asynchronous.await session.execute(select(...)): We use the new SQLAlchemy 2.0 selection style, not the old session.query().from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy import select
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

import models, schemas
from database import engine, get_db

# Lifespan event to create tables on startup
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(models.Base.metadata.create_all)
    yield

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

# CREATE
@app.post("/tasks/", response_model=schemas.TaskResponse)
async def create_task(task: schemas.TaskCreate, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    new_task = models.Task(**task.model_dump())
    db.add(new_task)
    await db.commit()
    await db.refresh(new_task)
    return new_task

# READ (Async Select)
@app.get("/tasks/", response_model=list[schemas.TaskResponse])
async def read_tasks(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    # The Modern 2.0 Syntax
    query = select(models.Task).offset(skip).limit(limit)
    result = await db.execute(query)
    return result.scalars().all()

# UPDATE
@app.patch("/tasks/{task_id}", response_model=schemas.TaskResponse)
async def update_task(task_id: int, completed: bool, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    query = select(models.Task).where(models.Task.id == task_id)
    result = await db.execute(query)
    task = result.scalar_one_or_none()

    if task is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Task not found")

    task.is_completed = completed
    await db.commit()
    await db.refresh(task)
    return task
Async SQLAlchemy Engine and Session Lifecycle in FastAPIIn production FastAPI applications, the async SQLAlchemy engine should be created once at application startup and reused across requests. Creating engines or sessions per request is a common mistake that leads to connection exhaustion and unpredictable performance.FastAPI’s lifespan context is the recommended place to initialize the async engine and session factory, ensuring clean startup and shutdown behavior while avoiding hidden global state.Note- SQLAlchemy 2.0 removed legacy query patterns, which is why AsyncSession no longer exposes .query().”In the synchronous world, if the database takes 200ms to fetch those tasks, your entire server thread is blocked for 200ms. It can do nothing else.In this Async version, while the database is fetching data (await db.execute), Python releases the control loop. Your API can accept 50 other requests during that 200ms "wait" time.This is how you scale to thousands of users on a single server.Next Step: Deploying thisNow that you have a high-performance backend, how do you deploy it? You can't just use python main.py in production. In the next article, I will show you how to containerize this with Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Software Foundation: Your Python.

No screen. No keyboard. No buttons that make any sense.This is a familiar situation if you've ever worked with microcontrollers like the ESP32. The hardware is powerful, but the very first interaction is often awkward. At some point, the device needs to connect to your Wi-Fi network, and the classic question appears:"How does a tiny device ask for Wi-Fi credentials?"Hardcoding credentials works for quick experiments, but it breaks down in the real world, every deployment would require re-flashing the firmware. Serial consoles are fine for developers, not for users who don't have USB cables or the patience for terminal commands. Mobile apps add friction and maintenance overhead, requiring separate iOS and Android versions that need constant updates.What you want instead is simple: power on the device, connect to it once from any phone or laptop, configure it through a familiar web interface, and never think about it again. No apps to install, no cables to find, no special tools required.This is exactly where  shine, they turn Wi-Fi provisioning into a one-time, friction-free experience that works on every platform.
  
  
  What Is a Captive Portal?
If you've ever connected to Wi-Fi at a coffee shop, hotel, or airport, you've used a captive portal. You join the network, and a web page automatically pops up asking you to log in or accept terms. You didn't type a URL—the network guided you there by intercepting your browser traffic.A captive portal on an embedded device works the same way:The device creates its  (acting as an access point)The user connects from their phone or laptop (no password needed)The device intercepts all internet requests using a A web page  showing the configuration formAfter submission, the device saves credentials and switches to normal Wi-Fi client modeThe beauty of this approach is that the ESP32 can handle everything on-device. It acts as both an access point and a web server simultaneously, with no cloud services, external infrastructure, or internet connection required during setup. It's significantly simpler than building a companion mobile app (which requires maintaining iOS and Android versions) and far more user-friendly than hardcoded credentials or serial console configuration.For IoT products, this is often the difference between "technically works" and "actually ships to customers."The device goes through two distinct phases:  (captive portal) and  (Wi-Fi client). runs the first time you power on the device, or anytime no Wi-Fi configuration exists. Creates its own temporary Wi-Fi networkRuns a DNS server that redirects all domains to itselfRuns an HTTP server that serves the configuration pageSaves user-submitted credentials to flash storage begins after successful configuration. Disables the access pointConnects to the user's Wi-Fi network as a clientRuns your actual application (fetching data, controlling hardware, etc.)The key decision happens at boot: does  exist? If yes, connect to Wi-Fi. If no, start the captive portal.If you have already MicroPython installed on your ESP32, you are good to go and experiment with the following examples. If not, see this guide for more detail on how to setup an ESP32 with MicroPython.
  
  
  Step 1 - Create the Wi-Fi Access Point
The ESP32 creates its own Wi-Fi network using the built-in  module. This is the foundation of the entire captive portal, without the access point, users have no way to reach the configuration page.The ESP32 has two Wi-Fi interfaces: (Access Point Interface) - Makes the ESP32 act like a router (Station Interface) - Makes the ESP32 act like a Wi-Fi clientDuring setup mode, we use  to create a temporary network that users can join from their phones.In your local project, create a new file :Once this runs, the ESP32 broadcasts a Wi-Fi network named "MyDevice-Setup" and assigns itself IP address . Any device that connects to this network can communicate with the ESP32 using this IP.You'll notice we use  (no password). This might seem insecure, but it's actually the right choice for a temporary setup network:: Some devices have issues with WPA2 on captive portals: Users don't need to type a passwordAuto-detection works better: Operating systems are more likely to show the "Sign in to network" popup on open networks: The AP only exists during initial setup and disappears once configuredThe security risk is minimal because:The network only exists during the 1-2 minutes of setupThe user is typically standing right next to the deviceOnce configured, the AP shuts down completelyFor production devices, you can add strategies like auto-disabling the AP after 10 minutes, or requiring a physical button press to re-enter setup mode.
  
  
  Step 2 - Build the HTML Setup Page
Before we create the HTTP server, let's build the setup page that users will see. This is the critical user-facing component, it needs to work flawlessly on every mobile device.Design Principles for Captive Portal Pages:: Most users will access this from their phones: No external CSS/JS frameworks (we don't have internet!): Every byte travels over a slow access point connection: Users should immediately understand what to do: Don't assume users type perfectlyThe page needs only two inputs: SSID and password. Everything else can be configured later through a different interface (if needed at all).On your local project folder, create :Device SetupWi-Fi Setup
            Wi-Fi SSID
            
            Password
            Save  Connect meta tag ensures proper scaling on mobile devicesInline CSS keeps everything in one file (no extra HTTP requests) prevents input overflow issuesLarge touch targets (10px padding) work better on phonesSimple color scheme (#007bff) looks professional without complexity
  
  
  Step 3 - Create HTTP Server with Form Handling
Now create an HTTP server that serves the HTML file and handles form submissions. This is more complex than a typical web server because it needs to:Serve the same page for any URL - Operating systems make requests to various paths like , , etc. to detect captive portals - Parse POST data and save credentials - Show clear messages when things go wrong - The ESP32's networking stack is fragile, so we need careful error handlingThe server handles both GET requests (show the form) and POST requests (save configuration).On your local project folder, create :Key implementation details:: The  function handles URL-encoded data (the format HTML forms use). We manually decode common characters like  (space) and  (@) since MicroPython doesn't have a built-in URL decoder.: The server reads  from the filesystem. If the file is missing, it shows an error message instead of crashing, this helps with debugging during development.:  is critical. MicroPython's socket implementation can leak memory with persistent connections. We explicitly close every connection, even in error cases, to prevent the ESP32 from running out of sockets.: The triple-nested try/except blocks might look excessive, but they prevent the server from crashing when:A client disconnects mid-requestThe filesystem is corrupted: Notice we call  when sending responses. MicroPython's socket.send() expects bytes, not strings.
  
  
  Step 4 - Add DNS Redirection (The "Captive" Part)
To trigger the automatic "Sign in to network" popup on phones, we need a DNS server that redirects  to the ESP32's IP. This is the "captive" part of "captive portal", we're capturing all DNS requests.How DNS redirection works:When your phone connects to a new Wi-Fi network, it performs a "captive portal check" by trying to reach a known URL (like  on iOS or http://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com on Android). Phone asks DNS: "What's the IP address of captive.apple.com?"Our DNS server lies: "It's 192.168.4.1" (the ESP32's IP)Phone tries to load that pageOur HTTP server responds with the setup pagePhone realizes: "This isn't the real captive.apple.com, must be a captive portal!"Phone shows the "Sign in to network" popupThe key insight: we don't need to know which domain was requested. We just answer  with our own IP address.How the DNS packet parsing works:DNS packets have a specific structure. We extract: (): Unique identifier for each query, must be echoed back:  means "this is a response, no error": The domain name the client asked about: Our fabricated response pointing to 192.168.4.1We only respond to A-record queries (IPv4 address lookups). Other query types (AAAA for IPv6, MX for mail servers, etc.) are safely ignored.Platform compatibility notes:iOS is particularly strict about captive portal detection. The popup appears more reliably if:DNS replies are fast (our implementation is)HTTP responses are well-formed (we use proper HTML)The server is already running before the phone connectsIf the popup doesn't appear automatically, users can manually open any browser and type any URL (like ). The DNS redirection will still work, bringing them to your setup page.Important: Captive Portal Auto-Detection LimitationsThe automatic captive portal popup is  to appear. Whether it shows up depends on:: iOS is most reliable, Android varies by manufacturer (Samsung/Xiaomi less reliable), Windows 10/11 is hit-or-miss: The popup only appears if DNS/HTTP checks happen within a few seconds of connecting: If the phone previously connected to this SSID, it may skip checks: Some phones have "captive portal detection" disabled in developer options: Some mobile carriers modify captive portal behaviorIn real-world testing, automatic popups appear on approximately 70-80% of devices. The other 20-30% require users to manually open a browser.
  
  
  Step 5 - Connect to User's Wi-Fi
After saving configuration, the device needs to switch from AP mode to STA mode (Wi-Fi client). This is the transition from "setup" to "normal operation."The connection logic needs to be robust because Wi-Fi connections fail more often than you'd expect:Wrong password (most common)Router configured to block new devices5GHz vs 2.4GHz band issues (ESP32 only supports 2.4GHz)Our implementation tries for 20 seconds (20 attempts × 1 second), which is long enough for most networks but not so long that users think the device is frozen.Connection flow breakdown:: Try to load . If it doesn't exist, return  immediately: Turn off the access point interface (can't be AP and STA simultaneously effectively): Activate the station (client) interface: Attempt to connect using saved credentials: Check connection status every second for up to 20 seconds: Return  if connected,  if timeoutWhy the 20-second timeout?Most successful connections happen in 2-5 secondsSome networks with complex auth take 10-15 secondsAnything longer probably indicates a real problem (wrong password, etc.)20 seconds is long enough to succeed but short enough that users don't think the device is frozenNow let's create a complete  that integrates all the components. This is the entry point that decides: "Should I start the captive portal, or connect to Wi-Fi?"Try to connect to saved Wi-FiIf successful → run the main applicationIf failed → start captive portal for (re)configurationThis creates a self-healing system: if the user changes their Wi-Fi password or moves the device to a new network, it automatically falls back to setup mode.: This function orchestrates setup mode:Launches the DNS server in a background thread (using )Starts the HTTP server in the foreground (which blocks indefinitely)The threading is important: both servers need to run simultaneously. The DNS server runs in the background while the HTTP server handles the main event loop.: This is the decision point:Calls  to attempt connectionOn success: runs your application code (we show a simple internet connectivity test)On failure: starts the captive portal: The  blocks catch:: Allows clean shutdown during developmentGeneral exceptions: Reboots the device to recover from crashesYour ESP32 should have these files in its root directory:/
├── main.py           # Main entry point
├── wifi_ap.py        # Access point setup
├── http_server.py    # HTTP server with form handling
├── dns_server.py     # DNS server for captive portal
├── wifi_client.py    # Wi-Fi connection logic
└── portal.html       # Setup page HTML
Breaking the code into separate modules has several advantages:: Test each component independently: Each file has one clear purpose: Copy  to other projects: Easier to find and fix bugsAll Python files should be in the root directory. MicroPython doesn't handle complex directory structures well, so keep it simple.The easiest way to upload files to your ESP32 is using , which has built-in MicroPython support.: Plug in your ESP32 via USBGo to  →  → Select "MicroPython (ESP32)"Choose your COM port (e.g., COM3 on Windows, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux)In Thonny, go to  → Open your local project folder in the top sectionRight-click on each file and select 'Upload to /' (this will upload the file to the device)Press the  button (or Ctrl+D in the Shell)Click the green run buttonHere's what the complete flow looks like in practice:The ESP32 boots and starts the captive portal. In the serial monitor (Thonny's Shell), you'll see:========================================

Captive portal ready!
Connect to 'MyDevice-Setup' from your phone

HTTP server listening on port 80

  
  
  Step 2: Connect from Phone
On your phone's Wi-Fi settings, you'll see "MyDevice-Setup" appear as an open network. Tap to connect.: A popup appears within 3-5 seconds saying "Sign in to network": No popup appears - this is normal! Just open any browser and type any URL
  
  
  Step 3: Configuration Page
Whether you got the popup or opened a browser manually, you'll see the setup page with two fields:Wi-Fi SSID (your network name)Enter your actual Wi-Fi credentials and click "Save & Connect"
  
  
  Step 4: Success Confirmation
You'll see a page saying "Configuration saved" with instructions to reboot the device.In the Thonny shell, you can see the configuration save log:HTTP server listening on port 80
Configuration saved: {'ssid': 'SSID_EXAMPLE', 'password': 'password example'}
Reboot the ESP32 and after reboot, the serial monitor shows:========================================

Captive portals solve a fundamental problem: getting a headless device onto a user's network without hardcoded credentials or mobile apps. For ESP32 projects, it's the difference between a prototype and a product someone else can actually use.The ESP32 is powerful enough to run an access point, DNS server, and web server simultaneously, making Wi-Fi provisioning a simple, app-free experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Bytes: #467 Toads in my AI</title><link>https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/467/toads-in-my-ai</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Topics covered in this episode:</strong><br>

  The Incident That Should Terrify Every Hiring Manager
KnowBe4—a company that literally trains people to spot scams—hired a North Korean intelligence operative. Four video interviews. Background check cleared. References verified.Twenty-five minutes after receiving his work laptop, their endpoint detection software caught him loading malware.The CEO's assessment: "If it can happen to us, it can happen to almost anyone."He's right. And the numbers are terrifying:
  
  
  Understanding the Attack Vector
Before we build defenses, let's understand the attack. This isn't script kiddie stuff—it's nation-state tradecraft industrialized for scale.
  
  
  The Tech Stack of a Nation-State Hiring Fraud

  
  
  The 70-Minute Deepfake Experiment
Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 ran an experiment that should keep you up at night:
  
  
  Why Your Current Defenses Are Structurally Broken
This isn't about doing security better. The  is wrong.
  
  
  Problem 1: Background Checks Verify the Wrong Identity
DPRK schemes use stolen legitimate identities. The background check works perfectly—it's just answering the wrong question.
  
  
  Problem 2: Liveness Detection Is Bypassed at the Hardware Level
Video injection attacks increased  in 2024. The defense assumes honest hardware; the attack subverts the hardware.
  
  
  Problem 3: "Verify Once, Trust Forever"
For DPRK schemes—where a "single employee" is actually a rotating team—this model is catastrophically naive.
  
  
  The Solution: Cryptographic Verification with Completeness Guarantees
Here's where we rebuild from first principles.The Verifiable AI Provenance Framework (VAP) provides a different model:
  
  
  Implementation: Building a VAP-Style Hiring System
Let's build this. I'll walk through the key components with working code.
  
  
  Step 1: Define the Event Schema

  
  
  Step 2: Implement the Hash Chain

  
  
  Step 3: The Completeness Invariant (The Secret Sauce)
This is where VAP gets powerful. We define rules that must be satisfied for a hiring process to be valid:
  
  
  Step 4: External Anchoring
The hash chain proves internal consistency. External anchoring proves  the data existed:
  
  
  Step 5: Cross-Reference with Third Parties (VCP-XREF)

  
  
  Step 6: Evidence Pack Generation

  
  
  Putting It All Together: A Complete Example

  
  
  What This Achieves Against DPRK Attacks
Let's map this back to the attack vectors:Cross-reference with IDV provider + liveness creates multi-point verificationLiveness detection bypassedLiveness event must exist + deepfake score recorded + externally anchoredPolicy compliance is trust-basedCompleteness Invariant mathematically enforces required stepsExternal anchoring makes post-hoc changes detectableCompromise HR system = full accessCross-references require compromising multiple independent parties
  
  
  Production Considerations

  
  
  Option 1: Use the Reference Implementation

pip vap-hiring


vap-hiring init  hiring_config.yaml


vap-hiring verify  ./evidence_pack.zip
The code in this article is a starting point. For production:Add proper key management (HSM for signing keys)Implement RFC 3161 TSA integrationBuild API endpoints for cross-reference exchangeIntegrate with your ATS/HRIS
  
  
  Option 3: Explore the Specification

  
  
  Conclusion: The Trust Model Is Broken
North Korean IT worker infiltration isn't a security incident. It's a  that trust-based hiring verification is fundamentally broken.When a security awareness company can hire a spy, when a convincing fake identity takes 70 minutes to create, when nation-states operate industrial-scale hiring fraud—we need to stop patching and start rebuilding.Cryptographic audit trails with completeness invariants offer a path forward: make tampering detectable make skipped steps impossible makes fabrication provable make single-point compromise insufficientThe technology exists. The threat is proven. The regulatory pressure is mounting.The question is whether you'll implement verification-based hiring proactively—or after a DPRK operative has been on your payroll for six months.VeritasChain Standards Organization (VSO) is a non-profit, vendor-neutral standards body developing open specifications for cryptographic audit trails in AI and algorithmic systems.Found this useful?

Just use .Here is a clean  class I wrote that handles both searching Google/Bing and scraping web pages into clean text for your LLM.For my side projects, I couldn't justify the monthly subscription of the big players.If you are building an MVP or a personal AI assistant, this saves a ton of money.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Built a Support Ticket Classifier with a Fine-Tuned LLM for $10/month</title><link>https://dev.to/__1bea7786c7/i-built-a-support-ticket-classifier-with-a-fine-tuned-llm-for-10month-323l</link><author>Artyom Molchanov</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:44:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I fine-tuned Qwen2.5-0.5B to classify telecom support tickets, quantized it to 350MB, and deployed it on a cheap VPS. Here's how.Support teams waste hours manually routing tickets. A customer writes "my wifi is slow" — is it a technical issue? Billing? Should it go to L1 or L2 support?I built a classifier that outputs structured JSON with intent, category, urgency, sentiment, routing target, and extracted entities.
  
  
  Why Not Just Use a Cloud API?
 — 50K requests/month via cloud LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) ≈ $100-200. Self-hosted = $10-20 — Some companies can't send customer data to external APIs — Fine-tune for your specific domainQwen2.5-0.5B (fine-tuned) → GGUF Q4_K_M (350MB)llama-cpp-python for inference → FastAPI for API → nginx for reverse proxy — small enough for CPU inference, smart enough for classification.~1000 synthetic support tickets with labels:Technical issues (internet, TV, mobile)Full fine-tuning on Google Colab T4 (free tier):Converted to GGUF and quantized to 4-bit using llama.cpp tools.Result:  model that runs on CPU.Simple FastAPI wrapper: load the GGUF model, accept POST requests, construct chat messages with system prompt and user text, parse JSON from model output, log to database.Users will send random stuff. Added a heuristic check:Text too short (< 10 chars) → not relevantContains telecom keywords (wifi, internet, bill, etc.) → relevantNo keywords + category=unknown → not relevantNow irrelevant queries return .Deploy with docker composeTotal cost:  for a 2 vCore, 4GB RAM VPS.This isn't a chatbot. It's ticket classification that happens once when a ticket is created. You can also process async via a queue.For faster inference: use a modern CPU (AMD EPYC) or add a GPU.

You hit rate limits, you stare at loading bars, and -- probably worst of all -- you burn through your API budget faster than a GPU on a training run. But what if I told you there’s a way to run thousands of prompts asynchronously, at , without blocking your main thread?Enter the .Grab your coffee (or tea 🍵), and let’s dive in!Here's what we'll be building with today: To get our evals. To make the data look pretty. To (carefully!) run the generated code.
  
  
  Step 1: Preparing the Data
First things first, we need our prompts. We are using the  dataset, which contains 164 coding problems.The Batch API loves  (JSON Lines) files. Each line is a separate request. We need to iterate through the dataset and format it so Gemini understands that we want it to write Python code. Notice ? That’s your best friend. Since batch jobs are asynchronous, results might not come back in the same order you sent them. The ID helps you map the answer back to the question.
  
  
  Step 2: Upload the data to Google Cloud
Now that we have our , we need to upload it to Google's Cloud Platform and tell Gemini to get to work. We are using  here because it is fast, efficient, and perfect for high-volume tasks like this - but you could use any supported Gemini model docstring instead.Batch jobs aren't instant (that's the trade-off for the discount), but for an evaluation pipeline, it's perfect. Go stretch, grab a snack, or check Twitter. On average, my jobs for the HumanEval dataset have been taking ~10 minutes, and the majority complete in less than a few hours.
  
  
  Step 3: Downloading the results
Once the job hits , the results are ready to come home.This is where the magic happens. We have the code Gemini wrote; now we need to see if it actually . We’re going to loop through our results, extract the Python code (removing those pesky markdown backticks), and run it against the unit tests provided in the HumanEval dataset. We are using  here. In a production app, running untrusted code is a huge security no-no. But for a local sandbox evaluation, we live on the edge! We’ll wrap it in a  timeout so infinite loops don’t freeze our machine.So, how did  do? Let's visualize it using Seaborn. 142 tasks (86.59%)That is incredibly impressive for a "Flash-Lite" model. It handled complex algorithmic logic, string manipulation, and math problems, passing the vast majority of them.The Gemini Batch API is a game-changer for workflows like this. We saved 50% on tokens. We didn't have to manage async loops or retry logic. The Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite model punched way above its weight class.If you have large datasets, extensive prompting jobs, or nightly evaluations, definitely give the Batch API a spin.

But it became a bottleneck when validating millions of URLs and emails in data pipelines.Average:  across 48 validators.That's it. Same API, same behavior, just faster.
  
  
  What I learned building this
PyO3 + maturin is mature. Publishing wheels for Python 3.8-3.13 across Linux/macOS/Windows was straightforward. GitHub Actions + maturin handled cross-compilation without drama.Hand-rolled parsing beats regex for simple patterns. For IPv4 validation, a simple split-and-parse approach was significantly faster than regex. Rust's regex crate is fast, but nothing beats avoiding it entirely. URL validation alone has dozens of edge cases — international domain names, punycode, IPv6 hosts, weird port numbers. I wrote 370 tests to ensure parity with the original library.The hardest validators were international ones. Spanish NIE, Indian Aadhaar, Finnish SSN — each has its own checksum algorithm. Lots of Wikipedia rabbit holes. email, url, domain, ipv4, ipv6, mac_address, hostname iban, card_number, visa, mastercard, amex, cusip, isin btc_address, eth_address, bsc_address, trx_address
