and you'll notice that the "JIT decorator" pattern is pretty popular. For
example, this JAX snippet:In both cases, the function decorated with  doesn't get executed by the
Python interpreter in the normal sense. Instead, the code inside is more like
a DSL (Domain Specific Language) processed by a special purpose compiler built
into the library (JAX or Triton). Another way to think about it is that Python
is used as a  to describe computations.In this post I will describe some implementation strategies used by libraries to
make this possible.Preface - where we're goingThe goal is to explain how different kinds of  decorators work by using
a simplified, educational example that implements several approaches from
scratch. All the approaches featured in this post will be using this flow: Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" /> Expr IR --> LLVM IR --> Execution" class="align-center" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/decjit-python.png" />
These are the steps that happen when a Python function wrapped with
our educational  decorator is called:The function is translated to an "expression IR" - .This expression IR is converted to LLVM IR.Finally, the LLVM IR is JIT-executed.First, let's look at the  IR. Here we'll make a big simplification -
only supporting functions that define a single expression, e.g.:Naturally, this can be easily generalized - after all, LLVM IR can be used to
express fully general computations.Here are the  data structures:To convert an  into LLVM IR and JIT-execute it, we'll use this function:It uses the  class to actually generate LLVM IR from .
This process is straightforward and covered extensively in the resources I
linked to earlier; take a look at the full code here.My goal with this architecture is to make things simple, but .
On one hand - there are several simplifications: only single expressions are
supported, very limited set of operators, etc. It's very easy to extend this!
On the other hand, we could have just trivially evaluated the 
without resorting to LLVM IR; I do want to show a more complete compilation
pipeline, though, to demonstrate that an arbitrary amount of complexity can
be hidden behind these simple interfaces.With these building blocks in hand, we can review the strategies used by
 decorators to convert Python functions into s.Python comes with powerful code reflection and introspection capabilities out
of the box. Here's the  decorator:This is a standard Python decorator. It takes a function and returns another
function that will be used in its place ( ensures that
function attributes like the name and docstring of the wrapper match the
wrapped function).After  is applied to , what  holds is the
wrapper. When  is called, the wrapper is invoked with
.The wrapper obtains the AST of the wrapped function, and then uses
 to convert this AST into an :When  finishes visiting the AST it's given, its
 field will contain the  representing the function's
return value. The wrapper then invokes  with this .Note how our decorator interjects into the regular Python execution process.
When  is called, instead of the standard Python compilation and
execution process (code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed
by the VM), we translate its code to our own representation and emit LLVM from
it, and then JIT execute the LLVM IR. While it seems kinda pointless in this
artificial example, in reality this means we can execute the function's code
in any way we like.AST JIT case study: TritonThis approach is almost exactly how the Triton language works. The body of a
function decorated with  gets parsed to a Python AST, which then
- through a series of internal IRs - ends up in LLVM IR; this in turn is lowered
to PTX by the
NVPTX LLVM backend.
Then, the code runs on a GPU using a standard CUDA pipeline.Naturally, the subset of Python that can be compiled down to a GPU is limited;
but it's sufficient to run performant kernels, in a language that's much
friendlier than CUDA and - more importantly - lives in the same file with the
"host" part written in regular Python. For example, if you want testing and
debugging, you can run Triton in "interpreter mode" which will just run the
same kernels locally on a CPU.Note that Triton lets us import names from the  package
and use them inside kernels; these serve as the  for the language
- special calls the compiler handles directly.Python is a fairly complicated language with  of features. Therefore,
if our JIT has to support some large portion of Python semantics, it may make
sense to leverage more of Python's own compiler. Concretely, we can have it
compile the wrapped function all the way to bytecode,
and start our translation from there.Here's the  decorator that does just this :The Python VM is a stack machine; so we emulate a stack to convert the
function's bytecode to  IR (a bit like an RPN evaluator).
As before, we then use our  utility function to lower
 to LLVM IR and JIT execute it.Using this JIT is as simple as the previous one - just swap 
for :Bytecode JIT case study: NumbaNumba is a compiler for Python itself. The idea
is that you can speed up specific functions in your code by slapping a
 decorator on them. What happens next is similar in spirit to
our simple , but of course much more complicated because it
supports a very large portion of Python semantics.Numba uses the Python compiler to emit bytecode, just as we did; it then
converts it into its own IR, and then to LLVM using .By starting with the bytecode, Numba makes its life easier (no need to rewrite
the entire Python compiler). On the other hand, it also makes some analyses
, because by the time we're in bytecode, a lot of semantic information
existing in higher-level representations is lost. For example, Numba has to
sweat a bit to recover control flow information from the bytecode (by
running it through a special interpreter first).The two approaches we've seen so far are similar in many ways - both rely on
Python's introspection capabilities to compile the source code of the JIT-ed
function to some extent (one to AST, the other all the way to bytecode), and
then work on this lowered representation.The tracing strategy is very different. It doesn't analyze the source code of
the wrapped function at all - instead, it  its execution by means of
specially-boxed arguments, leveraging overloaded operators and functions, and
then works on the generated trace.The code implementing this for our smile demo is surprisingly compact:Each runtime argument of the wrapped function is assigned a , and
that is placed in a , a placeholder class which lets us
do operator overloading:The remaining key function is :To understand how this works, consider this trivial example:After the decorated function is defined,  holds the wrapper function
defined inside . When  is called, the wrapper runs:For each argument of  itself (that is  and ), it creates
a new  holding a . This denotes a named variable in
the  IR.It then calls the wrapped function, passing it the boxes as runtime
parameters.When (the wrapped)  runs, it invokes . This is caught by the overloaded
 operator of , and it creates a new  with
the s representing  and  as children. This
 is then returned .The wrapper unboxes the returned  and passes it to
 to emit LLVM IR from it and JIT execute it with the
actual runtime arguments of the call: .This might be a little mind-bending at first, because there are two different
executions that happen:The first is calling the wrapped  function itself, letting the Python
interpreter run it as usual, but with special arguments that build up the IR
instead of doing any computations. This is the .The second is lowering this IR our tracing step built into LLVM IR and then
JIT executing it with the actual runtime argument values ; this is
the .This tracing approach has some interesting characteristics. Since we don't
have to analyze the source of the wrapped functions but only trace through
the execution, we can "magically" support a much richer set of programs, e.g.:This  with our basic . Since Python variables are
placeholders (references) for values, our tracing step is oblivious to them - it
follows the flow of values. Another example:This also just works! The created  will be a long chain of 
additions of 's runtime values through the loop, added to the 
for .This last example also leads us to a limitation of the tracing approach; the
loop cannot be  - it cannot depend on the function's arguments,
because the tracing step has no concept of runtime values and wouldn't know
how many iterations to run through; or at least, it doesn't know this unless
we want to perform the tracing run for every runtime execution .Tracing JIT case study: JAXThe JAX ML framework uses a tracing
approach very similar to the one described here. The first code sample in this
post shows the JAX notation. JAX cleverly wraps Numpy with its own version which
is traced (similar to our , but JAX calls these boxes "tracers"),
letting you write regular-feeling Numpy code that can be JIT optimized and
executed on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs via XLA. JAX's tracer builds up an underlying IR (called
jaxpr) which can then be
emitted to XLA ops and passed to XLA for further lowering and execution.For a fairly deep overview of how JAX works, I recommend reading the
autodidax doc.As mentioned earlier, JAX has some limitations
with things like data-dependent control flow in native Python. This won't work,
because there's control flow
that depends on a runtime value ():When  is executed, JAX will throw an exception, saying something
like:
This concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the
value of the argument count.As a remedy, JAX has its
own built-in intrinsics from the jax.lax package.
Here's the example rewritten in a way that actually works: (and many other built-ins in the  package) is something JAX
can trace through, generating a corresponding XLA operation (XLA has support for
While loops, to which this
 can be lowered).The tracing approach has clear benefits for JAX as well; because it only cares
about the flow of values, it can handle arbitrarily complicated Python code,
as long as the flow of values can be traced. Just like the local variables and
data-independent loops shown earlier, but also things like closures. This makes
meta-programming and templating easy .The full code for this post is available on GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hugo van Kemenade: Improving licence metadata</title><link>https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/improving-licence-metadata/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:11:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[PEP 639 defines a spec on how to document licences

I stated:Not a chance, for many years to come. [Python 2.7] currently represents 7-10%
of total downloads, meaning around 70k / 100k downloads per day.Only 3 years later, and to my surprise, downloads for Python 2.7 dropped to
0.36%! As such, as of psutil 7.0.0, I finally decided to drop support for
Python 2.7!These are downloads per month:According to pypistats.org Python 2.7 downloads
represents the 0.28% of the total, around 15.000 downloads per day.Maintaining 2.7 support in psutil had become increasingly difficult, but still
possible. E.g. I could still run tests by using old PYPI
backports.
GitHub Actions could still be
tweaked
to run tests and produce 2.7 wheels on Linux and macOS. Not on Windows though,
for which I had to use a separate service (Appveyor). Still, the amount of
hacks in psutil source code necessary to support Python 2.7 piled up over the
years, and became quite big. Some disadvantages that come to mind:Having to maintain a Python compatibility layers like
  psutil/_compat.py.
  This translated in extra extra code and extra imports.The C compatibility layer to differentiate between Python 2 and 3 (#if
  PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 3, etc.).Dealing with the string vs. unicode differences, both in Python and in C.Inability to use modern language features, especially f-strings.Inability to freely use s, which created a difference on how CONSTANTS
  were exposed in terms of API.Having to install a specific version of  and other (outdated)
  deps.Relying on the third-party Appveyor CI service to run tests and produce 2.7
  wheels.Running 4 extra CI jobs on every commit (Linux, macOS, Windows 32-bit,
  Windows 64-bit) making the CI slower and more subject to failures (we have
  quite a bit of flaky tests).The distribution of 7 wheels specific for Python 2.7. E.g. in the previous
  release I had to upload:psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-none-win32.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27m-manylinux2010_i686.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux2010_i686.whl
psutil-6.1.1-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl
The removal was done in
PR-2841, which removed around
1500 lines of code (nice!). . In doing so, in the doc I
still made the promise that the 6.1.* serie will keep supporting Python 2.7
and will receive  (no new features). It will be
maintained in a specific python2
branch. I explicitly kept
the
setup.py
script compatible with Python 2.7 in terms of syntax, so that, when the tarball
is fetched from PYPI, it will emit an informative error message on . The user trying to install psutil on Python 2.7 will see:$pip2installpsutil

As the informative message states, users that are still on Python 2.7 can still
use psutil with:pip2 install psutil==6.1.*

Currently, Python has thirty-five keywords and four soft keywords. These keywords are always available in Python, which means you don’t need to import them. Understanding how to use them correctly is fundamental for building Python programs.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:There are  and  in Python.You can get a list of all keywords using  from the  module. in Python act as keywords only in specific contexts. are keywords that have been deprecated and turned into functions in Python 3.In this article, you’ll find a basic introduction to all Python keywords and soft keywords along with other resources that will be helpful for learning more about each keyword. Test your knowledge with our interactive “Python Keywords: An Introduction” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:In this quiz, you'll test your understanding of Python keywords and soft keywords. These reserved words have specific functions and restrictions in Python, and understanding how to use them correctly is fundamental for building Python programs.Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can’t be used for anything but those specific purposes. These keywords are always available—you’ll never have to import them into your code.Python keywords are different from Python’s built-in functions and types. The built-in functions and types are also always available, but they aren’t as restrictive as the keywords in their usage. An example of something you  do with Python keywords is assign something to them. If you try, then you’ll get a . You won’t get a  if you try to assign something to a built-in function or type, but it still isn’t a good idea. For a more in-depth explanation of ways keywords can be misused, check out Invalid Syntax in Python: Common Reasons for SyntaxError.There are thirty-five keywords in Python. Here’s a list of them, each linked to its relevant section in this tutorial:Two keywords have additional uses beyond their initial use cases. The  keyword is also used with loops and with  and  in addition to in conditional statements. The  keyword is most commonly used in  statements, but also used with the  keyword.The list of Python keywords and soft keywords has changed over time. For example, the  and  keywords weren’t added until Python 3.7. Also, both  and  were keywords in Python 2.7 but were turned into built-in functions in Python 3 and no longer appear in the keywords list.As mentioned above, you’ll get an error if you try to assign something to a Python keyword. Soft keywords, on the other hand, aren’t that strict. They syntactically act as keywords only in certain conditions.This new capability was made possible thanks to the introduction of the PEG parser in Python 3.9, which changed how the interpreter reads the source code.Leveraging the PEG parser allowed for the introduction of structural pattern matching in Python. In order to use intuitive syntax, the authors picked , , and  for the pattern matching statements. Notably,  and  are widely used for this purpose in many other programming languages.To prevent conflicts with existing Python code that already used , , and  as variable or function names, Python developers decided to introduce the concept of soft keywords.Currently, there are four  in Python:You can use the links above to jump to the soft keywords you’d like to read about, or you can continue reading for a guided tour.Value Keywords: , , There are three Python keywords that are used as values. These values are singleton values that can be used over and over again and always reference the exact same object. You’ll most likely see and use these values a lot.There are a few terms used in the sections below that may be new to you. They’re defined here, and you should be aware of their meaning before proceeding:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EuroPython Society: Changes in the Grants Programme for 2025</title><link>https://www.europython-society.org/changes-in-the-grants-programme-for-2025/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:16:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We are increasing transparency and reducing ambiguity in the guidelines.We would like to support more events with our limited budgetWe’ve introduced caps for events in order to make sure all grants are fairly given and we can support more communities.We’ve set aside 10% of our budget for the local community. The EPS introduced a Grant Programme in 2017. Since then, we have granted almost EUR 350k through the programme, partly via EuroPython Finaid and by directly supporting other Python events and projects across Europe. In the last two years, the Grant Programme has grown to EUR 100k per year, with even more requests coming in.With this growth come new challenges in how to distribute funds fairly so that more events can benefit. Looking at data from the past two years, we’ve often been close to or over our budget. The guidelines haven’t been updated in a while. As grant requests become more complex, we’d like to simplify and clarify the process, and better explain it on our website.We would also like to acknowledge that EuroPython, when traveling around Europe, has an additional impact on the host country, and we’d like to set aside part of the budget for the local community.The Grant Programme is also a primary funding source for EuroPython Finaid. To that end, we aim to allocate 30% of the total Grant Programme budget to Finaid, an increase from the previous 25%.We’ve updated the text on our website, and split it into multiple sub-pages to make it easier to navigate. The website now includes a checklist of what we would like to see in a grant application, and a checklist for the Grants Workgroup – so that when you apply for the Grant you already know the steps that it will go through later and when you can expect an answer from us.We looked at the data from previous years, and size and timing of the grant requests. With the growing number and size of the grants, to make it more accessible to smaller conferences and conferences happening later in the year, we decided to introduce max caps per grant and split the budget equally between the first and second half of the year. We would also explicitly split the total budget into three categories – 30% goes to the EuroPython finaid, 10% is reserved for projects in the host country. The remaining 60% of the budget goes to fund other Python Conferences. This is similar to the split in previous years, but more explicit and transparent.Using 2024 data, and the budget available for Community Grants (60% of total), we’ve simulated different budget caps and found a sweet spot at 6000EUR, where we are able to support all the requests with most of the grants being below that limit. For 2025 we expect to receive a similar or bigger number of requests.We are introducing a special 10% pool of money to be used on projects in the host country (in 2025 that’s again Czech Republic). This pool is set aside at the beginning of the year, with one caveat that we would like to deploy it in the first half of the year. Whatever is left unused goes back to the Community Pool to be used in second half of the year.Fairer Funding: By spreading our grants out during the year, conferences that happen later won’t miss out.Easy to Follow: Clear rules and deadlines cut down on confusion about how much you can get and what it’s for.Better Accountability: We ask for simple post-event reports so we can see where the money went and what impact it made.Stronger Community: Funding more events grows our Python network across Europe, helping everyone learn, connect, and collaborate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Python: Quiz: Python Keywords: An Introduction</title><link>https://realpython.com/quizzes/python-keywords/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python keywords are reserved words with specific functions and restrictions in the language.

Snake 🐍 (and the Year of Python?).For centuries, π was often approximated as 3 in China. Some time
between the years 1 and 5 CE, astronomer, librarian, mathematician and
politician Liu Xin (劉歆) calculated π as 3.154.Around 130 CE, mathematician, astronomer, and geographer Zhang Heng
(張衡, 78–139) compared the celestial circle with the diameter of the
earth as 736:232 to get 3.1724. He also came up with a formula for the
ratio between a cube and inscribed sphere as 8:5, implying the ratio of
a square’s area to an inscribed circle is √8:√5. From this, he
calculated π as √10 (~3.162).Third century mathematician Liu Hui (刘徽) came up with an algorithm
for calculating π iteratively: calculate the area of a polygon inscribed
in a circle, then as the number of sides of the polygon is increased,
the area becomes closer to that of the circle, from which you can
approximate π.This algorithm is similar to the method used by Archimedes in the 3rd
century BCE and Ludolph van Ceulen in the 16th century CE (see 3.14.0a2
  release notes), but Archimedes only went up to a 96-sided polygon
(96-gon). Liu Hui went up to a 192-gon to approximate π as 157/50 (3.14)
and later a 3072-gon for 3.14159.Liu Hu wrote a commentary on the book The Nine Chapters on the
Mathematical Art which included his π approximations.In the fifth century, astronomer, inventor, mathematician,
politician, and writer Zu Chongzhi (祖沖之, 429–500) used Liu Hui’s
algorithm to inscribe a 12,288-gon to compute π between 3.1415926 and
3.1415927, correct to seven decimal places. This was more accurate than
Hellenistic calculations and wouldn’t be improved upon for 900
years.Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development

She is currently a member of the Django 6.x Steering Council and she has been a DSF member since March 2021. 
You can learn more about Lily by visiting her GitHub profile.Let’s spend some time getting to know Lily better!Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc)My name is Lily Foote and I’ve been contributing to Django for most of my career. I’ve also recently got into Rust and I’m excited about using Rust in Python projects. When I’m not programming, I love hiking, climbing and dancing (Ceilidh)! I also really enjoying playing board games and role playing games (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons).How did you start using Django?I’d taught myself Python in my final year at university by doing Project Euler problems and then decided I wanted to learn how to make a website. Django was the first Python web framework I looked at and it worked really well for me.What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?I’ve done a small amount with Flask and FastAPI. More than any new features, I think the thing that I’d most like to see is more long-term contributors to spread the work of keeping Django awesome.What projects are you working on now?The side project I’m most excited about is Django Rusty Templates, which is a re-implementation of Django’s templating language in Rust.Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?What are the top three things in Django that you like?Django Conferences, the mentorship program Djangonaut Space and the whole community!You have been a mentor multiple times with GSoC and Djangonaut Space program, what is required according to you to be a good mentor?I think being willing to invest time is really important. Checking in with your mentees frequently and being an early reviewer of their work. I think this helps keep their motivation up and allows for small corrections early on.Any advice for future contributors?Start small and as you get more familiar with Django and the process of contributing you can take on bigger issues. Also be patient with reviewers – Django has high standards, but is mostly maintained by volunteers with limited time.Yes! It’s a huge honour! Since January, we’ve been meeting weekly and it feels like we’ve hardly scratched the surface of what we want to achieve. The biggest thing we’re trying to tackle is how to improve the contribution experience – especially evaluating new feature ideas – without draining everyone’s time and energy.You have a lot of knowledge in the Django ORM, how did you start to contribute to this part?I added the Greatest and Least expressions in Django 1.9, with the support of one of the core team at the time. After that, I kept showing up (especially at conference sprints) and finding a new thing to tackle.Is there anything else you’d like to say?Thank you for doing the interview, Lily!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quansight Labs Blog: PEP 517 build system popularity</title><link>https://labs.quansight.org/blog/pep-517-build-system-popularity</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Analysis of PEP 517 build backends used in 8000 top PyPI packages]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seth Michael Larson: Building software for connection (#2: Consensus)</title><link>https://sethmlarson.dev/building-software-for-connection-consensus?utm_campaign=rss</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the previous article we concluded that a persistent always-on internet

through an official Nintendo-affiliated distribution such as a magazine or online contest.Beyond official distributions, it's clear Animal Crossings' designer, Katsuya Eguchi,
wanted players to  to complete their catalogs.
The game incentivized trading items between towns by assigning
one “native fruit” (Apple, Orange, Cherry, Peach, or Pear) and
randomly making a subset of items harder to find than others depending
on a hidden “item group” variable (either A, B, or C).Items could be exchanged between players when one player visits another town,
but this required physically bringing your memory card to another
players' GameCube. The GameCube might have come with a handle, but the 'cube wasn't exactly a . Sharing a physical space isn't something you can do with everyone or on a regular basis.So what did Katsuya Eguchi design for Animal Crossing? To allow for item distributions from magazines and contests and to make player-to-player item sharing easier Animal Crossing included a feature called “secret codes”.This feature worked by allowing players to exchange 28-character codes with Tom Nook for items. Players could also generate codes for their friends to “send” an item from their own game to a different town. Codes could be shared by writing them on a paper note, instant message, or text message.The forgotten durability of offline software
This Reddit comment thread from the GameCube subreddit was the initial inspiration for this entire series.
The post is about someone's niece who just started playing Animal Crossing for the first time.
The Redditor asked folks to send items to their nieces' town using the secret code system.
This ended up surprising many folks that this system 
 in a game that was over 23 years old!
For reference, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo Network were only available for 8 and 13 years respectively.
Below are a handful of the comments from the thread:“For real does this still work lol?”It's hard not to take these comments as indicators that something is
 with internet-connected software today. What had to go wrong for a 
system continuing to work to ? Many consumers' 
experience with 
software products
today is that they become useless e-waste after some far-away service is 
discontinued a few years after purchase.My intuition from this is that software that requires centralized servers and infrastructure to function
will have shorter lifetimes than software which is offline or only
opportunistically uses online functionality.I don't think this is particularly insightful,
more dependencies always means less resilience. But if we're building software for human connection then the software
should optimally only be limited by the availability of humans to connect.What is centralization good for?Animal Crossings' secret code system is far from perfect. The system is easily abusable, as the same secret codes can be
reused over-and-over by the same user to duplicate items without ever expiring. The only limit was that 3 codes could be used per day.Not long after Animal Crossing's release
the secret code algorithm was reverse-engineered so secret codes 
for any item could be created for any town and recipient name as if they came from an official Nintendo distribution.
This was possible because the secret code system relied on "security through obscurity".Could  be the answer to preventing these abuses?The most interesting property that a centralized authority approach
provides is : forcing everyone to play by the same rules. By storing
the “single source-of-truth” a central authority is able to prevent abuses
like the ones mentioned above.For example, a centralized “secret code issuing server” could generate
new unique codes per-use and check each code's validity
against a database to prevent users from generating their
own illegitimate codes or codes being re-used multiple times.The problem with
centralized consensus is it tends to be  to cover the entire software state.
A centralized server can generate codes perfectly, but how can that same server
 that the items you're exchanging for codes were obtained legitimately? To know this
the server would also need to track item legitimacy, leading to software which requires
an internet connection to operate.This is optimal from a correctness perspective, but as was noted earlier,
I suspect that if such a server was a mandatory part of the secret code system
in Animal Crossing that the system would likely not be usable today.This seems like a trade-off, which future would you rather have?Redesigning Animal Crossing secret codesIf I were designing Animal Crossings' secret code system with modern hardware, what would it look like?
How can we keep the offline fall-back while providing consensus and being less
abusable, especially for official distributions.I would likely use a public-key cryptographic system for official distributions,
embedding a certificate that could be used to “verify” that specific secret codes
originated from the expected centralized entity. Codes that are accepted would be
recorded to prevent reusing the same code multiple times in the same town.
Using public-key cryptography prevents the
system from being reverse-engineered to distribute arbitrary items until the certificate
private key was cracked.For sharing items between players I would implement a system where each town
generated a public and private key and the public key was shared to other towns
whenever the software was able to, such as when a player visited the other town.
Players would only be able to send items to players that they have visited
(which for Animal Crossing required physical presence, more on this later!)Each sender could store a nonce value for
each potential recipient. Embedding that nonce into the secret code would allow
the recipients' software to verify that the specific code hadn't been used yet.
The nonce wouldn't have to be long to avoid simple reusing of codes.Both above systems would require much more data to be embedded into each “secret
code” compared to the 28-character codes from the GameCube. For this I would
use QR codes to embed over 2KB of data into a single QR code. Funnily enough,
Animal Crossing New Leaf and onwards use QR code technology for players to share design patterns.This design is still abusable if users can modify their software or hardware
but doesn't suffer from the trivial-to-exploit flaws of Animal Crossing's secret code system.Decentralized global consensus?What if we could have the best of both worlds: we want consensus
that is both  and . At least today, we are out of luck.Decentralized global consensus is technologically feasible, but the existing solutions
(mostly blockchains)
are expensive (both in energy and capital) and can't handle throughput on any sort of 
meaningful scale.There are many other decentralized consensus systems that 
are able to form “pockets” of useful peer-to-peer consensus using a fraction of
the resources, such as email, BitTorrent, ActivityPub, and Nostr.
These systems are only possible by adding  or by only guaranteeing .When is global consensus needed?Obviously global consensus is important for certain classes of software like 
financial, civics, and infrastructure, but I wonder how the necessity
of consensus in software changes for software with different risk
profiles.For software which has fewer risks associated with misuse is there as much
need for global consensus?
How can  be designed to reduce risk and require
less consensus to be effective? If global consensus and centralized 
servers become unnecessary, can we expect  to be usable 
on much longer timescales, essentially for as long as there are users?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Morsels: Newlines and escape sequences in Python</title><link>https://www.pythonmorsels.com/newlines-and-escape-sequences/</link><author></author><category>Planet Python blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:17:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This string contains a newline character:That's what  represents: a newline character.If we print this string, we'll see that  becomes an  newline:Why does Python represent a newline as ?Escape sequences in PythonEvery character in a Python …]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Join Strings in Python</title><link>https://realpython.com/python-join-string/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>Real Python Blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python’s built-in string method  lets you combine string elements from an iterable into a single string, using a separator that you specify.

Whether you need to format output or assemble data for storage,  provides a clean and efficient approach for joining strings from an iterable.In the upcoming sections, you’ll learn the basic usage of  to concatenate strings effectively. You’ll then apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios, from building CSV files to constructing custom log outputs. You’ll also discover some surprising pitfalls and learn how to avoid them. Test your knowledge with our interactive “How to Join Strings in Python” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Test your understanding of Python's .join() string method for combining strings, handling edge cases, and optimizing performance.How to Join Strings in Python Using To use the string method , you call  on a separator string and pass an iterable of other strings as the argument. The method returns a single string, where it has inserted the separator string between each element of the iterable:In this example, you joined a list of words into one sentence, separated by spaces.At first glance, this usage might look a little backward. In many other string operations, you call the method on the main string that you want to manipulate. However, with , you call the method on the separator string, then pass the iterable of strings that you want to combine:This example achieves the same result as the earlier one but splits the process into two steps. Defining  separately makes the code more readable and avoids the potentially odd-looking syntax of calling  directly on a short string literal. Remember that  is a  method, which means that you’ll need to call it on a  string object. Keeping that in mind may help you remember why you need to call it on the separator string.You rarely see code that’s written in multiple steps where you assign the separator string to a variable, like you did in the example above.In typical usage, you call  directly on the separator string, all in one line. This approach is more concise and highlights that any valid string can be your separator, whether it’s whitespace, a dash, or a multicharacter substring.Join With an Empty StringWhat if you don’t want any separator at all, but just want to concatenate the items? One valid approach is to use an empty string () as the separator:This code snippet concatenates the letters in the list, forming a single string . Using an empty string as the separator is a great way to assemble strings without a delimiter between them.Since  can take any iterable of strings—not just lists—you can even pass a string as an argument. Because strings are iterable, Python iterates over each character in that string, considering each character as a separate element:By calling  on  and passing the string , you effectively place a comma between every single character in . This might not always be what you intend, but it’s a neat trick to keep in mind if you ever need to treat each character as a separate element.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>#493: Quarto: Open-source technical publishing</title><link>https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/493/quarto-open-source-technical-publishing</link><author></author><category>Talk Python</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/download/493/quarto-open-source-technical-publishing.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://talkpython.fm/">Talk Python To Me</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Real Python Podcast – Episode #238: Charlie Marsh: Accelerating Python Tooling With Ruff and uv</title><link>https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/238/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>Real Python Blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you looking for fast tools to lint your code and manage your projects?

Test your knowledge with our interactive “How to Split a String in Python” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:In this quiz, you'll test your understanding of Python's .split() method. This method is useful for text-processing and data parsing tasks, allowing you to divide a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.How to Split a String in Python Using The  method in Python is a versatile tool that allows you to divide a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. By default,  separates a string at each occurrence of whitespace, which includes spaces, tabs, and newlines. This makes it particularly handy when dealing with plain text where words are separated by spaces:As you can see,  divides the sentence into individual words, removing the spaces in the process. It’s important to note that  also strips newlines by default, which might not be immediately obvious:The  method treats the newline characters as whitespace, and splits the text into individual words rather than lines. This is a crucial point to remember when working with multiline strings.The simplicity of  makes it a powerful tool for string manipulation. Whether you’re processing text files or parsing user input, using  can streamline your workflow.When you’re faced with the task of cleaning up messy text, you may want to pair  with . You can learn more about using  by expanding the collapsible section below:You may encounter code that uses  in combination with another string method, :In this example, you’re dealing with text that contains whitespace characters at the beginning and end of . You may see results like this when working with data that you received through web scraping, copy-paste artifacts from PDFs, or even regular user input.Combining  and  is a common and straightforward way to break potentially messy text into manageable tokens.The idea is that you first remove superfluous whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string using . This operation returns a new string object without that whitespace. You then chain to this cleaned output, allowing it to break the text into elements—in this case, individual words.If you’re only dealing with messy whitespace, however, then you don’t need to use  to get to a clean result:Because  splits on any whitespace and ignores extra leading and trailing whitespace, the result is the same as when you first explicitly remove leading and trailing whitespace with .Nevertheless, there may be advantages to adding  into the mix: You clearly communicate to other developers that you intend to apply data cleaning—and readability counts! You may later need to update your code to split on a different delimiter, in which case  won’t remove extra whitespace automatically. A well-designed additional step of explicitly removing whitespace with  can prevent surprises.If you’re only splitting on whitespace, then you likely won’t need to use . However, due to developer habits and a preference for explicitness, you may still come across this combination of string methods in the wild.When you use , it returns a list of substrings. This means that you can iterate over the result, access individual elements using indexing, or unpack the iterable into separate variables.For example, when you’re dealing with user input, you might want to extract specific pieces of information:In this code snippet, you take a string containing a name, surname, and age, and split it into a list of three separate strings. Then, you unpack the list into three descriptive variables. Finally, you use an f-string to format the output. Extracting data pieces like this is useful when you’re dealing with structured data where you know the position of each element beforehand, and you can rely on consistent use of whitespace.In this section, you’ve learned how to use Python’s  method to divide strings into smaller parts based on whitespace. This method is invaluable when working with plain text data, allowing you to extract and manipulate information. By understanding the default behavior of , including its treatment of newlines, you’ll be well-equipped to handle a variety of string manipulation tasks in your Python projects.In the next section, you’ll explore how to customize the behavior of  by specifying different delimiters, enabling you to tackle more complex string splitting scenarios.Split With Different Delimiters Using By default,  uses any whitespace as a delimiter to separate a string into a list of substrings. However, many real-world scenarios require splitting strings using other delimiters. This is where the  parameter comes into play.Imagine that you’re parsing data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file. CSV files are a popular format for storing tabular data, where each line represents a row and each value within a line is separated by a comma.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python 3.13.2 and 3.12.9 now available!</title><link>https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2025/02/python-3132-and-3129-now-available.html</link><author>Thomas Wouters</author><category>Python official news</category><category>dev</category><category>official</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 19:58:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/">Python Insider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A small release day today!

The  loop syntax declares a loop variable that takes each item from the collection in each iteration. This loop is ideal for repeatedly executing a block of code on each item in the collection. You can also tweak  loops further with features like , , and .By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that: iterates over items in a data collection, allowing you to execute code for each item.To , you use the  construct.To repeat code a number of times without processing the data of an iterable, use the  construct.To do , you can use for index, value in enumerate(iterable): to access both index and item.In this tutorial, you’ll gain practical knowledge of using  loops to traverse various collections and learn Pythonic looping techniques. Additionally, you’ll learn how to handle exceptions and how to use asynchronous iterations to make your Python code more robust and efficient. Test your knowledge with our interactive “Python "for" Loops: The Pythonic Way” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:In this quiz, you'll test your understanding of Python's for loop. You'll revisit how to iterate over items in a data collection, how to use range() for a predefined number of iterations, and how to use enumerate() for index-based iteration.Getting Started With the Python  LoopIn programming, loops are control flow statements that allow you to repeat a given set of operations a number of times. In practice, you’ll find two main types of loops: loops are mostly used to iterate a  number of times, which is common when you’re processing data collections with a specific number of data items. loops are commonly used to iterate an  number of times, which is useful when the number of iterations depends on a given condition.Python has both of these loops and in this tutorial, you’ll learn about . In Python, you’ll generally use  loops when you need to iterate over the items in a data collection. This type of loop lets you traverse different data collections and run a specific group of statements  or  each item in the input collection.In Python,  loops are compound statements with a  and a  that runs a predefined number of times. The basic syntax of a  loop is shown below:In this syntax,  is the loop variable. In each iteration, this variable takes the value of the current item in , which represents the data collection you need to iterate over. The loop body can consist of one or more statements that must be indented properly.Here’s a more detailed breakdown of this syntax: is the keyword that initiates the loop header. is a variable that holds the current item in the input iterable. is a keyword that connects the loop variable with the iterable. is a data collection that can be iterated over. consists of one or more statements to execute in each iteration.Here’s a quick example of how you can use a  loop to iterate over a list:In this example,  is the loop variable, while the  list is the target collection. Each time through the loop,  takes on a successive item from . In this loop, the body consists of a call to  that displays the value on the screen. This loop runs once for each item in the target iterable. The way the code above is written is the Pythonic way to write it.However, what’s an iterable anyway? In Python, an  is an object—often a data collection—that can be iterated over. Common examples of iterables in Python include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets, which are all built-in data types. You can also have custom classes that support iteration. Python has both iterables and iterators. Iterables support the  consisting of the special method. Similarly, iterators support the  that’s based on the  and  special methods.Both iterables and iterators can be iterated over. All iterators are iterables, but not all iterables are iterators. Python iterators play a fundamental role in  loops because they drive the iteration process.You can also have a loop with multiple loop variables:In this loop, you have two loop variables,  and . Note that to use this syntax, you just need to provide a tuple of loop variables. Also, you can have as many loop variables as you need as long as you have the correct number of items to unpack into them. You’ll also find this pattern useful when iterating over dictionary items or when you need to do parallel iteration.Sometimes, the input iterable may be empty. In that case, the loop will run its header once but won’t execute its body:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build a Dice-Rolling Application With Python</title><link>https://realpython.com/python-dice-roll/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>Real Python Blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create a Python dice roll simulator.

You’ll learn how to gather and validate the user’s input, import code from modules and packages, write functions, use  loops and conditionals, and neatly display output by using strings and the  function.Click the link below to download the entire code for this dice-rolling application and follow along while you build the project yourself:In this step-by-step project, you’ll build an application that runs dice-rolling simulations. The app will be able to roll up to six dice, with each die having six faces. After every roll, the application will generate an ASCII diagram of dice faces and display it on the screen. The following video demonstrates how the app works:When you run your dice-rolling simulator app, you get a prompt asking for the number of dice you want to roll. Once you provide a valid integer from 1 to 6, inclusive, then the application simulates the rolling event and displays a diagram of dice faces on the screen.Your dice-rolling simulator app will have a minimal yet user-friendly text-based user interface (TUI), which will allow you to specify the number of six-sided dice that you’d like to roll. You’ll use this TUI to roll the dice at home without having to fly to Las Vegas.Here’s a description of how the app will work internally:Prompt the user to choose how many six-sided dice to roll, then read the user’s inputA call to  with appropriate argumentsParse and validate the user’s inputA user-defined function called Run the dice-rolling simulationA user-defined function called Generate an ASCII diagram with the resulting dice facesA user-defined function called generate_dice_faces_diagram()Display the diagram of dice faces on the screenA call to  with appropriate argumentsKeeping these internal workings in mind, you’ll code three custom functions to provide the app’s main features and functionalities. These functions will define your code’s public API, which you’ll call to bring the app to life.To organize the code of your dice-rolling simulator project, you’ll create a single file called  in a directory of your choice in your file system. Go ahead and create the file to get started!You should be comfortable with the following concepts and skills before you start building this dice-rolling simulation project:If you don’t have all of the prerequisite knowledge before starting this coding adventure, then that’s okay! You might learn more by going ahead and getting started! You can always stop and review the resources linked here if you get stuck.Step 1: Code the TUI of Your Python Dice-Rolling AppIn this step, you’ll write the required code to ask for the user’s input of how many dice they want to roll in the simulation. You’ll also code a Python function that takes the user’s input, validates it, and returns it as an integer number if the validation was successful.

In this tutorial, you’ll explore several of these game engines, learning what you need to start crafting your own Python video games!To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be well-versed in Python programming, including object-oriented programming. An understanding of basic game concepts is helpful, but not necessary.Ready to dive in? Click the link below to download the source code for all the games that you’ll be creating:Python Game Engines OverviewGame engines for Python most often take the form of Python libraries, which can be installed in a variety of ways. Most are available on PyPI and can be installed with . However, a few are available only on GitHub, GitLab, or other code sharing locations, and they may require other installation steps. This article will cover installation methods for all the engines discussed.Python is a general purpose programming language, and it’s used for a variety of tasks other than writing computer games. In contrast, there are many different stand-alone game engines that are tailored specifically to writing games. Some of these include:These stand-alone game engines differ from Python game engines in several key aspects: Languages like C++, C#, and JavaScript are popular for games written in stand-alone game engines, as the engines themselves are often written in these languages. Very few stand-alone engines support Python.Proprietary scripting support: In addition, many stand-alone game engines maintain and support their own scripting languages, which may not resemble Python. For example, Unity uses C# natively, while Unreal works best with C++.  Many modern stand-alone game engines can produce games for a variety of platforms, including mobile and dedicated game systems, with very little effort. In contrast, porting a Python game across various platforms, especially mobile platforms, can be a major undertaking. Games written using a stand-alone game engine may have different licensing options and restrictions, based on the engine used.So why use Python to write games at all? In a word, Python. Using a stand-alone game engine often requires you to learn a new programming or scripting language. Python game engines leverage your existing knowledge of Python, reducing the learning curve and getting you moving forward quickly.There are many game engines available for the Python environment. The engines that you’ll learn about here all share the following criteria:They’re relatively popular engines, or they cover aspects of gaming that aren’t usually covered.They’re currently maintained.They have good documentation available.For each engine, you’ll learn about:Basic concepts, as well as assumptions that the engine makesMajor features and capabilitiesTwo game implementations, to allow for comparisonWhere appropriate, you should install these game engines in a virtual environment. Full source code for the games in this tutorial is available for download at the link below and will be referenced throughout the article:With the source code downloaded, you’re ready to begin.When people think of Python game engines, the first thought many have is Pygame. In fact, there’s already a great primer on Pygame available at Real Python.Written as a replacement for the stalled PySDL library, Pygame wraps and extends the SDL library, which stands for . SDL provides cross-platform access to your system’s underlying multimedia hardware components, such as sound, video, mouse, keyboard, and joystick. The cross-platform nature of both SDL and Pygame means that you can write games and rich multimedia Python programs for every platform that supports them!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Develop Data Visualization Interfaces in Python With Dash</title><link>https://realpython.com/python-dash/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>Real Python Blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dash is a popular Python framework for creating interactive data visualization interfaces.

These tools help you embed variables and expressions directly into strings, control text alignment, and use custom format specifiers to modify how values appear. You can apply these techniques to create well-structured and readable Python code.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that: in Python involves embedding variables and expressions into strings.You create an  in Python by prepending a string literal with an  or  and using  to include variables or expressions.You can use variables in Python’s  by placing them inside curly braces and passing them as . in Python control how values appear when formatted, using components like fill, align, sign, width, and type.You align text in Python string formatting using the  component, which can justify text to the  within a specified width.When working with strings in Python, you can leverage these formatting techniques to create dynamic and readable output. To get the most out of this tutorial, you should know the basics of Python programming and the string data type. Test your knowledge with our interactive “A Guide to Modern Python String Formatting Tools” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Python has developed different string interpolation and formatting tools over the years. If you’re getting started with Python and looking for a quick way to format your strings, then you should use Python’s f-strings.If you need to work with older versions of Python or legacy code, then it’s a good idea to learn about the other formatting tools, such as the  method.In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to format your strings using f-strings and the  method. You’ll start with f-strings to kick things off, which are quite popular in modern Python code.Using F-Strings for String InterpolationPython has a string formatting tool called , which stands for formatted string literals. F-strings are string literals that you can create by prepending an  or  to the literal. They allow you to do string interpolation and formatting by inserting variables or expressions directly into the literal.Creating F-String LiteralsHere you’ll take a look at how you can create an f-string by prepending the string literal with an  or :Using either  or  has the same effect. However, it’s a more common practice to use a lowercase  to create f-strings.Just like with regular string literals, you can use single, double, or triple quotes to define an f-string:Up to this point, your f-strings look pretty much the same as regular strings. However, if you create f-strings like those in the examples above, you’ll get complaints from your code linter if you have one.The remarkable feature of f-strings is that you can embed Python variables or expressions directly inside them. To insert the variable or expression, you must use a , which you create using a pair of curly braces.Interpolating Variables Into F-StringsThe variable that you insert in a replacement field is evaluated and converted to its string representation. The result is interpolated into the original string at the replacement field’s location:In this example, you’ve interpolated the  variable into your string. Note that Python treats anything outside the curly braces as a regular string.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game With Python and Tkinter</title><link>https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-python/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>Real Python Blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Developing a tic-tac-toe game in Python using Tkinter combines programming logic with graphical user interface design (GUI).

In this project, you’ll use the Tkinter GUI framework from Python’s standard library to create a game interface, while applying the model-view-controller pattern and an object-oriented approach to organize your code. For more on these concepts, check out the links in the prerequisites.To download the entire source code for this project, click the link in the box below:Demo: A Tic-Tac-Toe Game in PythonIn this step-by-step project, you’ll build a tic-tac-toe game in Python. You’ll use the Tkinter tool kit from the Python standard library to create the game’s GUI. In the following demo video, you’ll get a sense of how your game will work once you’ve completed this tutorial:Your tic-tac-toe game will have an interface that reproduces the classic three-by-three game board. The players will take turns making their moves on a shared device. The game display at the top of the window will show the name of the player who gets to go next.If a player wins, then the game display will show a winning message with the player’s name or mark ( or ). At the same time, the winning combination of cells will be highlighted on the board.Finally, the game’s  menu will have options to reset the game if you want to play again or to exit the game when you’re done playing.If this sounds like a fun project to you, then read on to get started!Your goal with this project is to create a tic-tac-toe game in Python. For the game interface, you’ll use the Tkinter GUI tool kit, which comes in the standard Python installation as an included battery. The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays  and the other plays . The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. The game will be tied if no one gets three in a row by the time all the cells are marked.With these rules in mind, you’ll need to put together the following game components:The game’s , which you’ll build with a class called The game’s , which you’ll manage using a class called The game board will work as a mix between  and  in a model-view-controller design. To build the board, you’ll use a Tkinter window, which you can create by instantiating the  class. This window will have two main components: Shows information about the game’s status Represents previous moves and available spaces or cellsYou’ll create the game display using a  widget, which allows you to display text and images.For the grid of cells, you’ll use a series of  widgets arranged in a grid. When a player clicks one of these buttons, the game logic will run to process the player’s move and determine whether there’s a winner. In this case, the game logic will work as the , which will manage the data, logic, and rules of your game.Now that you have a general idea of how to build your tic-tac-toe game, you should check out a few knowledge prerequisites that’ll allow you to get the most out of this tutorial.To complete this tic-tac-toe game project, you should be comfortable or at least familiar with the concepts and topics covered in the following resources:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Real Python Podcast – Episode #237: Testing Your Python Code Base: Unit vs. Integration</title><link>https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/237/</link><author>Real Python</author><category>Real Python Blog</category><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://realpython.com/atom.xml">Real Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What goes into creating automated tests for your Python code?
